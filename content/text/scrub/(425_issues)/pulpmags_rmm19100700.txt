mascots of the rail

by walter gardner

baseball-players soldiers and sailors are not the only men who
attempt to ward off their jonahs and bring good luck to themselves by
keeping mascots railroad men from the beginning have shown a
leaning toward animal proteges and though a goat trailing his whiskers
about a roundhouse or a dog riding in an engine-cab would seem apt to
prove anything but a hoodoo-killer the little god of luck sometimes works
things out peculiarly

     in the days when discipline was not so rigid as at present and so long
as the men got their trains over the road on time the officials did not concern
themselves particularly about what the men did a cock - fight in the
roundhouse-pit did not bring about the severe jacking up that it would now
in the early seventies and even later mascots were privileged characters and
train-crews often carried them on their runs from one division to another

how a goat butted into a romance and how the strange intuitions
of a cat and dog made history on the st louis

iron mountain and southern

   what can you expect when the crew
havent a mascot  

   oh come off the perch walt whats
a mascot got to do with it  

   oh nothing so far as i know but
you know that is the only train on this
road whose crew hasnt a mascot of some
kind

    dont believe in this mascot busi-
ness i dont say there is anything in it
but back in the seventies the boys at the
fredericktown roundhouse had a great
assortment of animals - a little zoo of
their own

   well what of it 

   you know that fredericktown was
the division on the belmont branch of
the st louis iron mountain and south-
ern at that time the furnaces at iron
mountain on the texas branch were
running full time turning out pig and
the result was that traffic was constantly
increasing the boys -had pigs dogs
cats goats and a rooster

   fine lot of farmers that gang must
have been

   they were all to the good just the
same well one of the chief moguls
around that roundhouse was a full-grown
goat that the boys had named murphy
after the roadmaster murphy wore a
goatee and so did the goat murphy
did not like it but he knew better than
to cheep so murphy the goat ranged
in and out of the roundhouse at his own
sweet will and murphy the roadmaster
never showed up there if he could help it

   the boys had teased the goat until
they had him trained so that the unfor-
tunate who had occasion in the course
of his work to stoop to pick up anything
while billy was in range was sure to get
a salute

  jerry phalen who was firing the 
came in on no i from st louis while
the hostler was setting the  in her stall
jerry was shucking overalls and jumper
and getting ready to wash up

a goat with a purpose

   jerry wore a red flannel undershirt
and when the engine was set in her stall
he took the tender bucket and drew it
full of water then climbed down to the
floor it being a cold day he picked up
a link and put it in the stove until it was
red hot then dropped it into the pail of
water heating it up so he could have a
good wash

   murphy sat on his hunkers a few
feet from the stove chewing his cud and
wagging his beard he paid no attention
to jerry and jerry did not give him a
thought

  jerry set his bucket of water on the
floor some little distance from the stove
and in the position he occupied he was
just forward of the s leading drivers
he got a bar of soap and had just
worked up a nice lather which he was

applying to his head and neck when
murphy landed

   he struck jerry square and jerry
werit over the bucket under the con-
necting-rod and into the pit the floor-
ing was even with the crown of the rail
on the outside of the pit and the plank-
ing was slippery with the grease that had
dripped from the boxes

  jerrys hands were also soapy so
there was nothing he could catch to check
himself he struck the opposite side of
the pit below the rail the pit being
walled with brick and fell to the bottom
in a crumpled heap

billy meets murphy

   the boys thought that he was killed
and if he had struck the side of the pit
with his head he would most assuredly
have broken his neck as it was he
struck with his shoulders and when the
boys got him out from under the engine
he was found to be only stunned

   just across the street was a grocery-
store and over this was the railroad ho-
tel kept by the widow of a railroader
and her daughters her house was al-
ways filled to capacity by the railroaders
murphy the roadmaster stopped there
when in town and murphy the goat
was a privileged character in fact he
was on the best of terms with the land-
lady and her daughters

   the work was too heavy for the old
lady and the girls and they hired some
help the newcomer was a jolly irish
girl named maggie malone but the rail-
roaders at once dubbed her  biddy and
biddy she was to the end of the chap-
ter now biddy had not been properly
introduced to murphy the goat and did
not know that he was a character of im-
portance in the back yard so one day
when she found him turning over an as-
sortment of tomato and fruit cans she
started after him with a broom

   now murphy like all sensible mas-
culines had a wholesome respect for a
broom especially when it was wielded by
a buxom irish girl he gravely and se-
dately retired to the alley where he stood
wagging his beard and surveying biddy
closely until she vanished into the
kitchen when he returned to the round-
house murphy was sensible and could

jerry went over the bucket and into the pit

take a hint at the end of a broomstick as
well as any one so he cut out his visits
to the railroad hotel

biddy  makes a good target

    biddy had forgotten all about mur-
phy until one day there came an order
for an extra train-crew and engine  to
take a special over the south end word
was sent to the boarding-house to have
the dinner kettles delivered at the round-
house so a good lunch was put up and
biddy was sent to the house with it

    she handed it up to dennis obrien
the fireman the two chaffing the while
and dennis daring her to climb into the
engine but biddy knew the work was
too pressing and telling him she would
take that dare some day when she had
more time she started back to the hotel

    on the way she had to pass the coal-
shute and stopping she placed her foot
on the rail and stooped over to tie a shoe-
lace just as murphy came out from un-
der the coal-shute he wasnt the kind
of a goat to decline a challenge so he
lowered his head gathered his feet to-
gether and launched his body-full at the
unsuspecting biddy he struck her fair
and she pitched forward into the cinder-
pit

   murphy at once meandered around
the sandhouse and biddy scrambled to
her feet just in time to see dennis who
was doing his level best to keep a straight
face offering to help her out now
biddy had not seen or heard anything of
murphy the goat so she sailed into
dennis accusing him of bumping her
into the cinder-pit and informing him
in choice gaelic that he was no gentle-
man

   the more dennis tried to explain the
more voluble she became and finally as
he thought of her flying leap into the
cinder-pit he could restrain himself no
longer and sat down on a wheelbarrow
and fairly yelled this was adding in-
sult to injury and biddy stalked off
highly offended followed by advice from
dennis not to wear barber-pole stockings
thereafter

murphys downfall

   murphy showed poor judgment
he was no respecter of persons and this
led to his downfall one day master
mechanic haynes came down from ca-
rondelet on a tour of inspection and
after h had gone through the  rip 
shop he was looking over the round-
house piloted by the roundhouse fore-


the railroad mans magazine

man engine  was in one of the stalls
-a big eight-wheel freight-engine her
right cylinder-cocks were nut working
smoothly for some reason and just as
the two came up to the engine the round-
house foreman was handed the engineers
report the two men stopped by the
cylinder and with his left hand on the
pilot-beam haynes leaned over to look
at the cylinder-cocks just as murphy
came around the nose of the pilot

   murphy backed off a few feet and
hit the master mechanic fairly and
squarely sending him down on his hands
and knees barking his hands and serious-
ly fracturing his dignity then the storm
broke the air fairly sizzled  and
haynes showed a command of strong
language that none of the boys had ever
imagined he possessed murphy passed
on calmly chewing his cud and-wagging
his beard as innocent as a babe  but his
fate was sealed the word was passed
to remove murphy from this vale of
tears and from thenceforward and for-
ever no goats were to be allowed in or
around any roundhouse on the system

   the boys were sorely tried they
could not bear the idea of death for
murphy and the question of selling him
was not to be considered for murphy

 he christened it tipperary

was too old and tough to make into mut-
ton and not a man from roundhouse
foreman to call-boy could be found who
would act as executioner

   a consultation was held and it was
decided that dennis obrien and mike
fitzgerald should take murphy aboard
the  when she pulled out on no 
over the south end and at a favorable
opportunity where they thought murphy
was likely to find a good home drop him
overboard and let him shift for himself

   they got murphy up into the gang-
way of the  with no trouble but mur-
phy was not inclined to stay so they tied
him to the brakestaff with a cord and
pulled out on no  on time

   now mike and dennis should have
known enough about goats to know
that nothing but a chain will hold the
brute if he takes a notion to leave so
when no  stopped at the depot at mar-
quand away went murphy with the fraz-
zled end of the cord which he had
chewed in two still flying from his neck

   the boys thought it was all right
and wired from the next stop that mur-
phy had got away and deserted at mar-
quand and went on to the end of the
run coming back the next day on no 
when the  was run into her stall there
was murphy superintending the opera-
tion as was his usual custom

 then jerry phalen took him on the
 intending to carry him to carondelet
or st louis but murphy proved too
slick he worked out of the dog-chain
they had tied him up with and when the
train stopped at mine la motte the first
station four miles north murphy went
overboard and took to the timber mur-
phys escape was duly reported to the
roundhouse gang and when the  came
back on no  the next day murphy was
on deck as usual

matters were getting serious haynes
was an easy-going man but when he gave
an order it had to be obeyed or somebody
had to suffer the boys did not know
what to do killing murphy
was not to be thought of so
will allen who was running
baggage and express from st
louis to belmont and who had
heard of the escapades of mur-
phy as indeed had every man
in the service suggested a plan
mascots of the rail



   no  and no  met at frederick-
town and had twenty minutes for din-
ner so during the stop one day he
told the boys to put a tag on murphy ad-
dressed to frank johnson who was run-
ning baggage on the cairo arkansas and
texas the  eat  road out of cairo and
he would see him on this trip and ar-
range with him to take murphy and pass
him on to the next baggageman and thus
get him far enough away so that he could
not get back

   when allen came north on no 
the next day he told the boys to have
murphy ready for him the next trip-
which would be two days later as he had
his lay-over in st louis-and that john-
son would transfer him to the little
rock run at the little rock and mem-
phis junction so when he came down
on no  murphy was duly installed in
a corner of the baggage-car and fastened
so that it was impossible to get away

   he was turned over to johnson who
fook him down over the cat road to the
little rock and memphis and the bag-
gageman there took him on to little
rock what finally became of murphy
none of the boys ever heard

a mix-up between mascots

   murphys successor was a spanish
red game-cock which a lad living at
mine la motte and attending school in
fredericktown gave to jerry phalen
jerry was very proud of the bird and
boasted that he could lick anything that
wore feathers he christened it tipper-
ary and arranged with biddy that she
was to feed him and see that he was
taken care of while he was absent on his
runs biddy in time became very fond
of tipperary and he was soon a pet in
and around the roundhouse as well as at
the boarding-house

   dennis obrien who fired the 
ran opposite jerry and the  and when
the  was cut from her train and the
 backed down to hook on the two
used to chaff each other considerably and
dennis boasted that he had a black game-
cock at belmont that could and would
wallop tipperary

   as  ran on the south end and the
 on the north end there did not seem
to be much chance for the two to get to-

gether  for when jerry came in dennis
went out and the boys began to demand
that dennis make good by showing up
his game-cock

   one daf dennis came in on no 
and as his engine was set in her stall
he climbed down with a crate in his
hand in which there was a sure enough
game-cock dennis told the boys that
he was named donegal and that done-
gal could lick tipperary any day in the
week and not half try

   now some of the boys were from
tipperary some from donegal but the
bulk of them were from other parts of
ireland it was not long before the men
were lined up according to their prefer-
ence and the majority were in favor of
tipperary whether it was a test of the
popularity of the two men or whether
the preference was caused by the recollec-
tions of the  ould dart was a question
that was an open one

   one day the  dropped her crown
sheet as she was coming in on no i and
went into the  rip  shop while another
engine took her run for one trip this
was the opportunity that the boys had
been waiting for and the wires soon
flashed the news to the boys on both divi-
sions that tipperary and donegal were
to settle the question as to which was the
better bird at two oclock that afternoon
this time was chosen for no i and no

	were both out of the way and there
was nothing due until  pm

tipperary turns the trick

   one of the pits in a vacant stall was
selected as the battle-ground and jerry
got down at one end with tipperary
while dennis with donegal occupied
the other the engihemen wipers sta-
tion-men and all the men in railway
service who could get away crowded
around the pit and the fight was prompt-
ly begun

   tipperary was slow and donegal
forced the fighting getting in a crack on
tipperary that sent him staggering jer-
ry took him up and handled him care-
fully but it was plain to all that tip-
perary was mad clear through when
the birds were released they went at each
other but neither scored then tipper-
ary with- wings dragging flew at done-


the railroad mans magazine

gal and struck him with his left gaff
sending the spur clear through done-
gals head

   a considerable amount of money had
been wagered not only in frederick -
town but along the whole branch the
odds were largely in favor of tipperary
though why was never understood from
that time forward tipperary was cock of
the walk one morning biddy went out
into the yard and found tipperary dead
his throat having been cut by some ani-
mal presumably a weasel jerry took the
body to a taxidermist in st louis and
had it mounted and placed it on the
boiler-head above the steam-gage in the
s cab

cupid gets busy

   dennis swore that biddy had hoo-
dooed donegal because he laughed at
her when murphy butted her into the
cinder-pit but biddy affirmed that den-
nis was a prevaricator and that he was
not to be believed on oath

  jerry always hit it off pretty well
with biddy though she insisted that he
was well named and that he had a
failin for every girl he met as time
went on it seemed to be an open ques-
tion as to which stood the highest in the
graces of the fair irish girl jerry or
dennis none of the boys could settle
the question for when dennis was in
he and biddy were always sparring

   one day dennis came in  no 
and as the  backed down and hooked
on he said just as jerry swung up on
to the footboard

    you had better fix it up with that
carondelet girl jerry or you will be
left in the race

  jerry told him not to worry about
the carondelet girl and no  pulled
out dennis went over to the round-
house  and washed up then went to the
hotel for his dinner

   that afternoon some of the boys saw
him and biddy going up-town together
but they thought nothing of it at the
time but at the supper-table another girl
was waiting on the table and the land-
lady told them that dennis and maggie
malone had been married that afternoon
dennis had got a two weeks layoff and
they were going to st louis on no 

  jerry was a great fellow for ani-
mals except cats he never had much
use for cats and his next venture in the
pet line after tipperarys death was a
dog one of these little yellow tin-can-
to-tail sort of animals

  he came into the roundhouse at
fredericktown one day chased by an
empty can that some boy had tied to his
stub of a tail he did not have much of
a narrative to speak of

   he was just about all in and as he stag-
gered into the roundhouse with that tin-
can continuation thumping behind him
he happened to turn into the stall where
no  was standing the wipers having
just fired her up to go north  no 

   this was in the early seventies and
in those days it was the practise to get
as much brass as possible on an engine
sand-box dome cylinders and steam-
chests were brass-jacketed and the fire-
men were expected to put in their leisure
time around the roundhouse in keeping
a bright shine  them

   engine no  had a fair share of
brass about her anil her drivers truck
and tender-wheels were painted a bril-
liant red in fact she was as pretty as a
country girl at a county fair but it kept
jerry pretty busy keeping her bright and
smart

  jerry was an irishman and while he
was fond of the fair sex in general so far
as the boys knew the only things on earth
that he really cared for were harry mc-
quaide his engineer and engine 

just a yellow dog

   jerry smoking a short black clay
pipe and clad in overalls and juniper
was busily engaged in polishing up a
cylinder-jacket when the yellow dog put
in an appearance the brute staggered
up to jerry-sank back on his hunkers
and looking up into the firemans face
whined piteously

   something about the forlorn aspect
of the brute or it may have been the
plaintive appeal to his sympathy attract-
ed jerrys attention he took his pipe
from his mouth looked at the dog for a
minute and said

    poor devil you are in hard lines
aint you

 the dog looked at him piteously
mascots of the rail



 he came into the
roundhouse chased
by an empty can

house and asked her to take
the dog back and give him a
good feed

   the girl did so and as
jerry came out of the house
after dinner the yellow dog was
waiting for him beside the door jerry
went on to the roundhouse and followed
by the dog climbed into the cab looked
at his fire and got ready for his run to
st louis

couldnt feeze the dog

   the dog at on the floor for awhile
but receiving  further attention from
jerry he leaped up into the gangway
and up  to the firemans seat jerry
thought that when the engine began to
move that he would get frightened and
leap off but he was not that kind of a
dog

when jerry backed the engine down to
the depot just as the  had pulled on
to the siding dennis called

  jerry dont name the dog done-
gal

     you can bet your sweet life i wont
hes too yellow

  then harry mcquaide the engi-
neer swung intothe gangway and the
first thing that he spied was the yellow
dog

    hello jerry he said  where did
you get the pup  

    huh i didnt get the purp he
got me

   then he told harry about the tin

   he patted the dogs head and then
taking his knife cut the cord that at-
tached the can to the stub of a tail which
the dog kept thumping on the floor

   it was about noon and jerry started
for his boarding-house as he was en-
tering the dining-room lie met the girl
who had taken biddys place in the

j nolimatj liud

   the hostler climbed on the engine
and took her out to the turntable turned
her and ran her out to the coal-chute
track where she was coaled up but the
dog seemed to be fully satisfied with his
surroundings

  the leaving time tf no  was 
pm this was before the day of inject-
ors and it was customary
when an engine came out of
the roundhouse to run her up
and down the line for half a
mile or so to pump her up
this was done with the 
she running north of the town
a mile or so but the dog
seemed to enjoy the situation
the railroad mans magazine

can episode and how the brute seemed
determined to keep close to him harry
stepped across and patted the dog  the
head

  all right jerry well keep him
and call him dick lie is the s mas-
cot and we cant afford to lose him

a canine passenger

   with some waste they fixed up a bed
for him on the running-board between
the firemans locker and the door of the
cab and dick fell into it as snugly as
though he had never been anywhere else

   all the way to st louis that dog
sat upon his bunch of waste and kept
his eyes  the track ahead once when
a steer got on the track and harry
-whistled he became excited and barked
furiously until the steer left -the road-
bed when they passed it dick did not
turn his head he seemed to think that
by his barking he had driven the steer
out of the way and that what happened
to the bovine after that was  concern
of his

   when the train stopped at the st
louis depot and the backup pilot came
on to take the train back to carondelet
that dog still kept his place and -when
the engine was set in the house and her
fire was drawn he condescended to get
down jerry bought him some bones and
scraps of meat and he remained in the
house he would not go far from the
engine and when she was fired up and
backed no  up to the plum street de-
pot in st louis dick was in his place on
the running-board

   it was not long until s mascot
was known all over the division and
when jerry and harry were both away
from the engine the hostler was the only
person that he would permit to come
aboard when the engine was in the
house he apparently considered that his
responsibility was ended

   the boys all petted him and endeav-
ored to make friends with him but while
he received all their overtures in a con-
descending sort of way none of them
made any impression his love and loy-
alty were due to jerry and harry in the
order named and to no others

   dick had been banging over the div-
ision for about six months and his vellow

muzzle in the cab-window  the fire-
mans side had come to be as much a
fixture as the cab itself he never by
any chance climbed up on the right side
and though harry coaxed him over once
or twice he seemed to know by instinct
as it were that in his place on the left
side he was in  ones way

    the  was coming south one day 
no  and just as they pulled out of
bismarck the enginemen noticed that dick
was getting uneasy and when they swung
into the long stretch alongside the st
francis river he began to bark furiously

    he leaped from his seat to the deck
and seized harrys trouser-leg endeavor-
ing to pull him away

   harry shook him loose but it did
 good he pulled again again he
was shaken loose when he leaped to his
place  the running-board and barked
violently he jumped to the deck again
and again seized harrys trouser-leg
pulling with all his might to get him
away from the right side

  whats the matter with the purp
harry asked of jerry

    dont know unless he wants you
to stop

     well im going to see if there is 
anything the matter with bis bed and
he crossed over to the firemans side
while dick leaped back to his place 
the running-board and twisted himself
into all sorts of shapes in an effort to
show his pleasure at getting harry over
to his side of the engine

   just as mcquaide leaned forward
to examine the bunch of waste that was
dicks bed the right side rod snapped
and the end whirling around like an
immense flail stripped the right side of
the engine completely ripping away the
side of the cab and the running-board
from the quadrant outward

   with the fragment of steel thrash-
ing alongside at each turn of the driver
harry finally managed to reach over and
shut her off he then got down and dis-
connected her going into fredericktown
working his left side only

   if dick had not succeeded in enti-
cing harry away from the right side the
probability is that he would have been
killed now the question is did that
yellow pup know that side rod was go-
ing to snap
mascots of the rail



    after this episode dick owned the
whole road from st louisto belmont
he grew fat and lazy but he never
missed a trip that the  made and when
she went into the backshop dick took
his layoff

   none of the other runners could

	coax him on to their engines he was
absolutely and unquali-
fiedly loyal to the  and
her crew and especially to
jerry it soon got so that
when you would see dick
you could be sure that
jerry was near and if you
saw jerry it was a safe bet
that dick was not far
away dick ran on the 
for a long time until he
finally went the way that
all good doggies go

    well marsh its up
to you now its your
turn to spin a yarn

    all right boys said
marsh  well as you
are telling dog and goat
stories  will have to go
back to the seventies
when i was firing the old
 on the illinois cen-
tral bob mcquaide was
my engineer a brother to
harry that you spoke of
on the iron mountain
and when i passed and
was set up bob went to
the iron mountain the
brothers desiring to have
a run on the same road

bob was as cool and nervy a runner as
you ever saw he had served in the
union army during the war and had
frequently been employed as a runner
when it was necessary for the army to
handle trains he was not a bit super-
stitious

   our run was from centralia to
cairo and at that time the two best
towns between the points named were
duquoin and carbondale and i suppose
are so yet at duquoin was the junc-
tion with the st louis alton and terre
flaute which in connection with the
illinois central formed the cairo short
line from st louis to cairo

   the agent at duquoin had a black

tom cat i-ie was undoubtedly the larg-
est tame cat that i have ever seen there
was not a white hair oh him

   well that cat took a fancy to the old
 for some reason and when we would
pull in he would spring into the gang-
way and up on the firemans seat where
he would curl up until we got to car-

j iiolmam bmo

sat up on my locker and meowed three or four times

liondale then he would spring to the
ground and disappear until we came in
on the up trip when he would come
aboard and ride back to duquoin

   at that time we were pulling way
freight and had a twenty-four hour lay
over at centralia that cat never would
ride on another engine one day the 
had been sent into the shop for light re-
pairs and engine  off the north end
took her run the only mistake that cat
ever made was on this trip when 
stopped at the depot the cat sprang
aboard as usual but he went on out on
the other side

   the boys tried to coax him on to
the other engines but they could never


the railroad mans magazine

succeed  was the only engine in
his opinion henever mistook another
for her except in that one instance
change of the runs made no difference
night or day fast through or way
freight it was all the same to tommy
as long as  was pulling it

   one day we pulled into duquoin
southbound about noon tommy was on
time as usual and sprang aboard he
sat up on my locker for a moment and
meowed three or four times then he
leaped to the ground and disappeared

     what ails the cat  said bob

    hanged if i know possibly he
remembered that he had an engagement
with maria and tried to excuse himself

i	answered

   just as we pulled out tommy was
sitting on his hunkers on the platform
and he fairly squalled as we passed him

    theres something wrong said bob
 and that cat knows it he tried to tell
us plain as any one could

    oh nonsense i answered

     all tlje same keep your eyes peeled
 for some reason which i cannot ex-
plain to this day i could not shake oft
the impression that something was wrong
with the big muddy bridge four miles
north of carbondale but i did not men-
tion it to bob as we pulled out of
elkdale bob said

    walt i am going to stop at the big
muddy theres something wrong with
the bridge

    do you know that i have had the
same feeling ever since we left duquoin
and i cannot give any reason for feeling
so i replied

    well stop all the same he paid

   we ran to within a hundred feet of
the bridge and stopped we both climbed
down and went ahead the spring
floods had piled a lot of drift against the
bridge an cl the water piling up against
this dam had softened the earth and
worked its way through the bank just
above the north abutment cutting the
back filling out from behind the mason-
ry and leaving an ugly hole acrossmhich
the track remained suspended

   there being no joints above the
break and the rails stretching across the
ties held up to the rails by the spikes
leaving the track apparently all right as
seen from above if we had not stopped
and gone ahead we would never have
discovered the washout we would have
piled all that train into the hole right
on top of that engine

   we backed up to elkdale reported
the washout and there we lay until the
track was cribbed up so we could cross

   tommy resumed his trips after that
and he kept them up for some time when
he finally failed to show up and we sup-
pose that he was killed all the same

	 was his engine and none of the boys
could get him onto another even by
picking him up bodily and carrying him
aboard for he would spit and scratch
and the moment that he was released
would leap to the ground as though the
engine burned his feet

   at any rate the question before the
court is

    what did that cat know and if he
knew about the big muddv bridge how
did he know it   

government meals  cents

the intercolonial railway of canada pre-
senting its claims to public patronage
says that  as a government road it is owned
by the people and in the operating of the
line this principle is ever kept in view so
that the best available service will be

given it operates its own sleeping and

all at seventy-five cents-which are fully

nailing ninety-four

     by robert fulkerson hoffman

        something sinister creeps into the life of
        high haven and the back-shop takes action

 igh haven had but one
  lynching  and as lynch-
  ings go that was not a
  complete success

     theres a chink open
  somewheres along the
  ground-line of our cabin boys said
  stocky jim endy elevating himself to a
  seat on a vise-bench between the engine-
   laden pits of high haven shops

     thats it said old tom waring
  with an anxious note reaching almo-f
  to a uaver in his voice  theres a
  slat offen our coop and somethings crope
  in 

     the little group that stood about in
  the few remaining minutes of that noo-i
  hour in turn expressed this idea vari-
  ously that was the first angry swirl
  of talk that came eddying to the surface
  from the deeply disturbed undercurrent
  of feeling which was surging in the
  shops

    they were good shops and very well-
  manned for many years they had stood
  in all the dignity of a trusted sentinel as
  the railroads last mechanical outpost in

the industrial war against the desert and
the mountains

  a proud little community whose pride
gave no offense had grown up around the
shops it had the just pride of attain-
ment in the face of very great odds hav-
ing normally a peace and contentment
keyed high with the tang of the clear
upper air

  true it had its little lines of social
demarcation and occasionally some small
dissension for example mrs mahalie
wife of jim mahalie who ran the limited
turn and turn about with nick botts
might not speak to mrs botts for several
days while the acrimonious discussion
was on as to who  burned up the dri-
ving-boxes  on engine 

  but such things were sporadic they
ran their short course and left no per-
manent hurt the little ripples of dis-
turbed feelings subsided in due time and
high haven resumed its wonted pride
of calm

  the men tactfully calmed the teapot
tempests which from time to time
loomed large upon the womens horizon




the railroad mans magazine

-and quarreled sociably over their own
small differences

  this it will be seen was all quite as
it should be and on the whole high
haven had made its impress deeply upon
the roads affairs its good name had
gone afar even in the person of tom
warings stripling son it had substan-
tially reached the general managers of-
fice the young man as file clerk was
making good in chicago and high ha-
ven listened with shining eyes when old
tom sometimes unbent to speak of the
boys little trials and tribulations and
successes

  yes high haven had been both proud
and happy but now this stealthy trou-
ble-something which it did not under-
stand-was creeping upon the little town

  one by one in quick succession the
older men were being weeded out of the
shops and made derelicts they lined up
along the picket-fence at the railroad sta-
tion breaking their hearts while they
tried bravely to smile when the limited
whisked in and out again behind engines
which their hands had lovingly built and
petted to perfection

  one by one the honest but sometimes
outspoken younger men were being
turned adrift and disappearing into the
world of work beyond the mountain
while strange faces of still younger men
were taking their places in the shops

  when pressed for a reason for these
things the master mechanic looked trou-
bled and walked away with his chin upon
his breast unanswering for the first time
in high havens knowledge of him

  the root of the trouble grew far away
-as far as chicago even-and high
haven was tasting the first bitter fruit
of that growth

  it began with a yellow-looking circu-
lar letter that came in the general man-
agers daily grist of mail the letter-
head seemed harmless enough from
 the industrial improvement corpora-
tion it professed to come

   plans that place progressive peo-
ple its further headlines set forth in
conspicuous type above a detailed offer to
give an exact daily report upon the  in-
dividuality personal and general charac-
teristics working efficiency and loyalty
of any working force on earth weeding
out the undesirable taking up the lost

motion and turning into the treasury
more actual dollars per man employed
than ever has been got out of your men
before

   no pay unless we succeed and no
dead timber left when we get through
with your shops we aim to please this
short symposium of the survival of the
fittest and the uncaught naively conclu-
ded   our operatives are never caught
absolute secrecy guaranteed

  that letter bore also a few penciled
words from one who was not much given
to debate in the higher management of
the road the general manager there-
fore called in the general superintendent
of motive power

   i detest it  said the general man-
ager quite frankly  i despise the
whole spy system as thoroughly as i did
when i was a mechanic at the bench and
 hope that this will not be for long

   but weve got to try it before we can
say absolutely that it is both ultimately
worthless and immediately disturbing as
i believe it to be

   put it on and send me the original
reports as fast as you get them

   therefore there was a spotter or spot-
ters in high haven shops therefore
high haven was much disturbed in that
memorable month of its trial and jim
endy sturdy pit-man wfas the first to
give concrete expression to the thought
that was shaping itself slowly in the shop

  after that the idea went murmuring
down the pit-line amid the ringing rata-
plan of hand-hammers clinking out the
merry ring of smitten steel day by
day it was discussed and punctuated by
the boom of sledges and the sharp spang
of riveting hammers upon giant shells of
steel standing big solemn and forsaken-
looking in the boiler-shop

   the anvils rang it subtly in tjie black-
smith-shop and men there read the
menace of it in the lurid flames that
flared and leaped above the forges

  ihe buzz-saws of the cab-shop hummed
with it the great forest of running
belts on the machine side just over the
straight track from the pit side of the
back-shop whirled it into the surcharged
air and wafted it to every guardian of
lathe and planer and other busy moving
device that worked for the good name of
high haven and the good of the service
nailing ninety-four



  yes that much was established beyond
reasonable doubt there was a fat in
the meal-box a beetle on the limb a
lizard at the bee-hive anything you like
as parallel but somebody was secretly
accusing somebody was listening to the
accuser while the defendant was un-
heard somebody was delivering judg-
ment against which there was no effec-
tive appeal

 who

  men searched each others faces fur-
tively to no avail the scorer-beetle
cutting his fatal circle around the young
hickory limb is so like the color of the
thing which it destroys that a passing
look will not betray its presence yet
the limb quickly dies

  the lurking lizard is so like the sun-
washed rock upon which it glides that
often it is only the quick darting of its
tongue that may arrest the eye but if
by chance one should step upon the in-
sidious thing-that would be very dif-
ferent 

  so far no one had chanced to step

upon the lizard the process of elimi-
nation had gone on at the shops until
tom warings was one of the few gray
heads that remained the  mavericks
as jim endy called them-the newer
men who had not been long enough in
the shop to properly acquire and assimi-
late the  brand  of high haven-had
become a considerable factor in the shops
total and jim with some lingering in-
stincts of his earlier days as a cattleman
upon the up-lands searched their faces
unflaggingly for some sign or ear-mark
which might point the way fo their pedi-
gree or possible ownership

  but he found nothing worth while
men in uniform however modest look
quite a deal alike in general mens
faces like printers type sometimes read
quite the reverse of what they are meant
to finally convey

  perhaps the situation would never have
drawn down to an actual focus upon the
secret offender if the postmasters wife
had not been hard put to it for a bit of
morning gossip

one by one the older men were being weeded out of the shops


the railroad mans magazine

it flew swiftly past his clutching fingers

   how is mrs waring she asked a
morning caller at the delivery window

   um-huh too bad she dont get
better-yes i help at the window here
sometimes but not much-that is a
bright boy of tom warings there
is hardly a three days that goes by
but that he sends a letter from chicago-
um-huh yes hes in the general man-
agers office you know and doing well
they say-yes well good morning  

  that was all but one of the pa-
thetic old graybeards who had but re-
cently been relegated to the picket-fence
brigade was there with his aching heart
waiting for the letter that had not come
in answer to his appeal to headquarters
for a hearing but which he had not yet
the courage to believe would never come

  he heard that morning chat and dis-
appointed as usual went away ponder-
ing it every three days eh and doing
well so tom was doing well he had
his job undisturbed

  why should he have his age didnt
save him what saved him

  so he mulled it over until his quick
suspicion became a conviction the idea

ran the length of the pickt-
fence brigade in the next few
days it crossed the tracks
and made its rapid way into
the shops

  men began to look askance
at old tom waring some-
times lie suddenly found him-
self standing alone where a
moment before a group of
his fellows had stood earn-
estly talking while he ap-
proached a fierce and re-
sentful spirit was being fo-
mented against him but as
yet there was nothing definite
upon which to center it in the
way of accusation

  if he noticed these things
waring gave no sign per-
haps he unconsciously with-
drew a little closer into him-
self but under normal con-
ditions this would have been
easily accounted for he was
at all times a reticent sort
and furthermore all who
were a part of the old life of
high haven knew that save
for his occasional unbending to report
the progress of his absent son his
thought was chiefly with the patient
white-faced little wife at home

  they knew that each morning time
out of mind he had propped the frail
little body upon the pillows in its bed
and with his own roughened but gentle
hands bathed the half-transparent hands
and face of his wife brushed out her soft
hair and made her as comfortable as
might be before leaving her to the care
of a domestic and taking his way to his
work on the pits

   for this and for other things as kindly
they had honored him as few men were
honored in high havens quiet way
hut if it is found that a man is a traitor
in any walk of life all other facts at
once shrink to minor significance a
storm was evidently gathering around
tom waring a seemingly little thing
precipitated it

  on one side of the pit upon which en-
gine  was receiving repairs stood
the vise-bench at which waring worked
beside him worked jim endy fitting up
shoes and wedges for that side of the
nailing ninety-four

 

engine on the opposite side of the pit
jake halprecht manned the bench fit-
ting similar parts for the corresponding
side of 

  jake peering malevolently through
the frames under the engine in a furtive
study of tom waring as he worked al-
lowed one of the heavy dead shoes which
he was trying against a pedestal-jaw to
slip from his grasp the sharp-cornered
heavy casting gritted across the pedestal-
binder and darted into the pit with no
word of warning to announce its coming

  it struck a glancing blow behind the
ear of one of jim endys maverick
machinists who was stooping there and
slid to rest in the brick-paved bottom of
the pit the man dropped without a
sound and lay there with the blood well-
ing from a three-inch gash which showed
the white gleam of the bone before the
red flood poured forth and drenched his
hidden face

  they lifted him out and laid him on
tom warings bench and it was wa-
rings skilful hands that stanched the
gaping wound and waring who best en-
acted the part of the good samaritan
until the man could be taken away for
further attention

  in a week he was back - with band-
aged head-at the pit senseless at the
time of the accident he did not know
whose hands had given him first aid
possibly he was so constituted that he
did not especially care in any event
within two days of his return the dis-
turbing rumors that pointed toward tom
waring were renewed with a venom that
passed all that had previously been
shown

  somebody had heard that warings
boy had written from chicago that jim
endy was likely to lose out soon no-
body had told tom waring of this but
everybody else had heard it within those
pregnant two days

  jim endy did lose out he was dis-
charged within twenty-four hours from
the time the rumor became current no
reason given and jim was too proud to
ask for any he joined the picket-fence
brigade and waited

  that evening after the shop-whistle
had blown there was an unusual hubbub
and crowding in and about the shop wash-
room men who ordinarilv did not

think of stopping there to free hands and
faces of the heavier grime before going
home for the day crowded into the room
and overflowed noisily into the shop

  above the growing clamor in which
tom warings name was being bandied
about very recklessly there arose at
length one voice that spoke clearly the
dominant note

  this things gone far enough
when he comes down-town to-night he
gets the question square and hes got to
give the answer 

  while this voice of menace was rising
in the shops the summer sun was bestow-
ing its evening benediction upon the lit-
tle red telegraph-office at bright angel
a half-hours ride eastward over the
mountain

  there and then big jim mahalie with
square-set jaw and smiling eyes was
heading the west-bound limited into the
siding for water and to let the general
managers one-car special go by on its
way eastward

  he saw it coming far away over the
buttes and while the water was being
rushed into the tender of his own engine
he made a quick sure inspection below
and stood waiting to see the special roll
rapidly past

  in the observation end of the special
the simple evening meal was being eaten
by the general manager and his secretary
the slight repast had reached that stage
of its serving which would require no
further attendance from the cook-facto-
tum-porter so that able and zealous ser-
vitor seized the opportunity to set in or-
der the forward compartment of the car
which served as the secretarys office

  dusting adjusting and guardedly re-
arranging the mass of papers upon the
secretarys desk he made the well-mean-
ing mistake of raising a window - sash
close beside the desk just when one of
the swift little catspaws which frequent-
ly dab down from the upper air on the
great divide added its swirl to the com-
motion set up by the flying train

  instantly one flattened sheaf of pa-
pers from which he had lifted the paper-
weight rose with a rustling flutter it
flew swiftly past his clutching fingers and
fetched up tossing and tumbling be-
tween the driving-wheels of jim maha-
lies engine as the special swept past


the railroad mans magazine

  jim picked up the papers and stood
looking expectantly at the receding train
he waited for the stop signal from the
specials engine-whistle to indicate that
the loss was reported and that they
would stop and pick up the papers

  no signal sounded the train rapidly
faded into a lessening speck in the dis-
tance and jim knew that the porter
after one frightened glance from the open
window had decided to defer the evil
hour of reckoning-take a continuance
as it were and hope for the best

  thus suddenly become the custodian
of this waif of correspondence jim
glanced with natural interest at the top-
most sheet his face paled the merest
shade then it reddened with a surge
of anger

  he looked hastily up to the fireman
perched on the waterspout and noted
with relief that he was watching anxi-
ously the flow of water into the tender

  climbing hastily back to his seat in the
cab mahalies eyes burned through the
contents of the papers swiftly surely as
he was wont to read a sheaf of tissue
orders when the waterspout clanked up
against the roadside tank he knew those
writings as he would have known a hand-
ful of orders at one sure reading he
was ready to  run on them

  tom waring came down-town that
evening in high haven he came just
when the dusk was growing deep and
the yellow lights were beginning to show
thickly along the main street near the
tracks he came with heavy step and
bowed head as one whose trouble is too
deep for speech yet cries aloud for the
friendly company of men

  the streets nearest the tracks were
more than usually alive men stood in
little knots and larger groups here and
there upon the nearer corners but wa-
ring did not notice it he came steadily
on across the little plaza which opens
upon the tracks beside the station and
joined the group strung out along the
picket-fence and swelled to a cluster of
silent men beneath the lone cottonwood
which stands sentinel at the edge of the
plaza

  halting there he lifted his eyes for a
single glance about him he saw jake
halprecht jim endy and others whom
he knew or did not know in that one

haggard glance then his eyes fell and
he spoke

   boys my wife-

   cheer up  broke in a voice he did
not know  never mind your wife for
a little while theres something else we
want to talk about

  waring straightened at this as if he
had been struck for the first time he
took understanding note of his surround-
ings he saw a general movement of
men from the adjacent streets and cor-
ners toward the tree beneath which he
stood

  what he did not see however was a
coil of rope that swung at the hip of one
of the approaching throng perhaps it
was as well for those who stood imme-
diately about him that he did not see
that for whatever else tom waring
might prove to be he had the courage
and the sinews of a man

  one comprehensive glance he took
and said

   well talk it then 

  the response came promptly the
thickening crowd shaped itself auto-
matically into a circle around him

   whos the spotter in the shop de-
manded the voice that had admonished
him insolently to cheer up

  the booming station-call of jim ma-
halies engine came rolling down through
the dusk as if ii unintelligible answer

   i dont know  replied waring quiet-
ly as the echoes of the limiteds whistle
died out upon the mountainside

  no you dont said the voice de-
risively  whats your boy writing about
from chicago

   that is none of your business re-
plied waring still quietly

   youre the spotter  declared the
voice and the man with white-bandaged
head pressed forward from his place be-
side jake halprecht and thrust out his
jaw aggressively

   you lie shouted waring as he
leaped toward the man

  at the word the crowd split and up-
heaved into a dozen fighting centers in
which battled those who believed in tom
waring and those who believed that he
was false

  the bandaged head was shuffled be-
yond warings reach and many hands
were clutching tearing pounding at
nailing ninety-four



warings body in return for the storm
of blows which lie was dealing fiercely
upon them at every side

  upon this shouting battling throng
jim mahalie looked out in astonishment
as his engine glided to a stop at the edge

his last mad onslaught and he was tear-
ing the rope down hand over hand from
the limb ripping it loose from warings
neck and casting it away over the heads
of the men who remained upright
around him

of the plaza his quick wits guessed but
once and guessed right he leaped
from the engine-cabr and with brawny
arms toughened by years of battling with
murderous reverse-levers began beating
his way through the riotous mob toward
waring

  he was strong he was fiercely an-
gry but they were many and he was
but one with his eyes fixed on tom
waring he saw the stealthy coilof rope
hurtle through the air and fasten its run-
ning noose at toms throat

  he saw the loose end go writhing up-
ward and over a limb of the cottonwood
and saw the line run taut again he
saw toms battling suddenly cease while
his hands clutched futilely at the stran-
gling loop around his neck

  then he had no ck-ar recollection of
what he saw until he was done trampling
over the bodies of men who fell before

   	r r

  half senseless he supported waring
while he snarled forth the bitterest words
of denunciation that ever rang across the
plaza of high haven

  stand away you cursed camp-fol-
lowers  you dogs you coyotes you
i mean  you  mavericks 

   high haven couldnt breed a play
of its own as low as this

   sit down tom 

  he let waring down gently to a place
at the foot of the tree and made an ef-
fort to fan him with his oil-glazed cap

   jim said waring faintly then
his voice took on greater power and he
added the one magic word that pene-
trated to the outer rim of the now silent
crowd and went farther toward healing
the breach in high haven affairs than
any other that he might have uttered

   boys my wife-my wife died a few
minutes ago

i mean  you mavericks


the railroad mans magazine

  oh my goodness moaned a deep
voice from the midst of the awe-struck
throng

   you know continued warings
voice  shes been long sick but the end
came that suddenlike that it fair struck
me dumb i guess i sort of wandered
down here looking for somebody to stand
by me for a mite until i can get used to
the idea

    want to go home now he con-
cluded struggling to regain his feet

  wait tom said jim mahalie
 brace up for a while we ought to
know about this - and then im going
with you

  he thrust his hand deep within his
blouse and brought forth the vagrant
sheaf of papers from bright angel si-
ding

   hold your lamp here a minute
perky will you he called to the con-
ductor of the limited

  the gay little green-and-white lantern
bobbed its way through the fringe of the
crowd and by its light mahalie read
aloud a line from one of the papers which
he was rapidly shifting with skilful fin-
gers

  at the first word the man of the band-
aged head began edging toward the rim
of the crowd he was stooping and
pressing for a final exit when jake hal-
prechts big hand fell heavily upon his
shoulder

  wait commanded jake  no-
body goes now  

  it was all there word after word
line after line page after page each
of jim mahalies brief and pointed ex-
tracts held something which somebody
recognized and instantly connected with
something else-all having a common
trend  all leading to one inevitable de-
duction

  every pitiful little human weakness or
defection that might not  make for suc-
cess  in the shops daily doings was par-
ticularly set forth there by day and date
and hour

  poor well-meaning average human
kind was laid bare in that merciless
epitome of the policy of the survival of
the fittest they were able documents
of their kind

  it was short and cold and very calm
that reading of mahalies and when he

quickly reached and read the topmost
writing the effect of that brief communi-
cation was electric

   worked with tom waring jim
 endy and jake halprecht to-day on en-
 gine  halprecht dropped a dead-
 shoe  me knocked me clean out
 bad cut back of ear have to lay off
 rest of this week

    dont know whether done  pur-
  pose but they are getting hot and dan-
  gerous guess i can bluff them some
  more jim endy ought to be fired quick
  and next tom waring started spot-
  ter talk fire halprecht hes a dub
  and too old	

   that is ally said jim mahalie
 can any of you enthusiastic gentlemen
nail this patriot who signs    

  the man with the bandaged head sud-
denly broke loose from the slackened
grasp of halprecht and darted through
the edge of the crowd he sprang across
the platform of one of the cars in the
limited with jake halprecht and jim
endy close behind

  across the yard through the round-
house and into the black depths of the
boiler-shop the chase led and it ended
beside a rivet-heating forge upon which
the fire still smoldered

  they did not strike him nobody
deigned to kick him they stated at him
in a species of loathing wonder until
jim endy gritted through his clenched
teeth 

   you  marcrick  

  that word settled the fate of the fu-
gitive he did not bear the brand of
high haven he must bear a brand of
his own it was quickly done

  jim endys hand had lost none of its
old-time skill with the  running-iron
the fire  the forge flared up for a lit-
tle time and then died down again

  when    went over the mountain
that night he was neither bruised nor
beaten-but his number- was aching and
burning upon his back

  there is now  line of discredited
veterans smiling with breaking hearts
along the fence-line at high haven
time and experience have evolved a
more acceptable form of retirement just
how much of this is due to the manner
of the return of the general managers
papers it might be difficult to say
nailing ninety-four



he must bear a brand of his own

  however he received them promptly
through the proper channel with full in-
formation he personally took them to
the general superintendent of motive-
power and after he had closed the door
against all intrusion banged them upon
the desk with the terse command

 destroy them yourself you
know how it finished at high haven
think of it and with the limited
standing by 

  he paused-and continued 

   destroy them put every one of
those men back as soon as you can with-
out making a parade of it 

  he turned about and had reached the
door when he said -with an odd smile

 the new terminal building for the new york central lines in new york city
 this magnificent structure is being erected on the site of the old ter-
 minal without the slightest interruption to the train schedules
the new home of the new
york central

by stephen an gus cox

the new york central railroad is rapidly pushing to completion its new
terminal on forty-second street new york city its officials are
meeting the cry for larger and better transportation facilities in the
metropolis with a terminal that will be the acme of constructive skill mil-
lions of dollars are being spent for the safety comfort and convenience of its
patrons and with an ingenuity that borders on wonderment a new depot is
being constructed with the razing of the old one still going on while the ter-
minal trackage is being doubled without a single interference to the regular
passenger-train schedules it is a marvel of engineering skill

in the heart of new york city a gigantic terminal is being con-
structed while the old one is being demolished and the
schedules of a great system remain unchanged

in the heart of new york the
great modern matter-of-fact
city a miracle is being wrought
one of the greatest engineer-
 ing feats of railroad history
is being accomplished the
grand central station one of the busiest
of the worlds termini is being razed its
tracks torn up its yards quarried its
switches and signals changed and re-
changed every day

  a mighty new terminal being con-
structed simultaneously with the de-
struction of the old one and not a train
of the  that run in and out of it
daily is being delayed

  it is a work such as giants might be
expected to achieve an immense won-
der-inspiring section of the great future
brought into use half a century ahead of
time

  the new york central railroad com-
pany for thirty-nine years has been the
only railroad company with a passenger
station  manhattan island all other
lines from south west and north came

to an end-made a disappointing finish
so to speak-in jersey city or hoboken
and the tired passengers must needs tum-
ble out of the cars go swarming down
the narrow sloping chutes and aboard
the ferry-boats there to dwell a seem-
ingly interminable period while the boat
was backing and filling ducking and
dodging the innumerable river-craft and
paying a course for a slip somewhere
along the river-front on the new york
side

  originally built in s  the station
was enlarged in  and  but the
constantly increasing traffic made im-
perative a much larger station and the
new york central railroad company
realizing that in another decade new
york will be a city of six or eight mil-
lions with three or four times the present
traffic decided to build for the future

a daring undertaking

  lhe enlarging of a terminal in the
heart of new york city is a task only


the railroad mans magazine

to be undertaken by the most daring
where acres of property perhaps the
most valuable in the world have to be
swept away the cost of yard tracks
comes mighty high

  the pennsylvania railroad company
gave an illustration of what can be done
in this direction with unlimited resources
the new york central is giving an illus-
tration of what can be done with unlim-
ited resources and engineering genius
they bought nearly twenty-two acres of
real estate and ruthlessly swept down
millions of dollars worth of residences
and stores but in yard trackage twen-
ty-two acres is not an enormous area
and more is needed if the company would
not again be face to face with the same
problem in a very short time

  there must be an end of the buying
up of the city and especially when the
purchase prices run to fabulous sums per
front foot they already had twenty-
three acres in the old terminal and this
added to the twenty - two made what
would strike one as a good-sized yard

  it did not strike the responsible offi-
cials of the new york central that way
so they set about to see how they could
double it without investing in more real
estate

  simplest thing in the world of course
to excavate and make two levels very
simple indeed on paper however it
is for the directors to command and the
engineers to obey

  if the directors say that all trains
must be drawn into new york city bv
electric-power it must be done if the
directors say that trains must run into a
terminal of two or even more levels
that also must be clone in engineering
there are apparently no impossibilities

the first work

  the first work was a work of destruc-
tion commuters coming in every morn-
ing saw the outline of the yards changing
day by day with the rapidity of magic
buildings that had been landmarks to
them for years as they emerged from
the park avenue tunnel were destroyed
overnight

  over on the east side the temporary
terminal sprang into existence the lower
floor of the grand central palace was

commandeered for the purpose and a
splendidly fitted station appeared before
the new yorker had hardly become
aware of the fact that changes were be-
ing made

  from behind this terminal two levels
of track pushed their way out toward
the tunnel they were the beginning of
a new order of things

  gradually they widened stretching out
westward toward the old station until
there were twenty-three tracks on the up-
per level and nine tracks on the lower
level then began the work of destruc-
tion of the old tracks and yards

  a thousand men like an angry army
of invading insects began tearing with
their seemingly puny strength at what
had been the monumental labor of an
earlier generation there was something
tragically ruthless in this terrible sacri-
fice to the god of expansion

drilling into the earth

  they pounded their whirling steel
stings into the earth and tore out her
rock-bound heart but all along the
rhythmic pulsing of the drills beat the
air like the music of the song of indus-
try in the weird glow of electric flare-
lights they drilled and drilled and the
night instead of softening the sounds of
destruction made them appear all the
more relentlessly eager

  to the watching new vorkers it seems
as if the new york central had decided
to make wreck and chaos -of all it could
lay its hands on

  it was not until practically a few
months ago that to the experienced eye
some semblance of order some idea of
design could be gained from the appar-
ent chaos

  as the tracks from the new portion
of the yards reached to the old one the
old terminal began to be destroyed and
the old tracks to be torn up

  the tearing down of the station with
its enormous and heavy train-shed and
the accommodating of the tremendous
crowds is one of the engineering feats
of the day to move the train-shed over
the heads of the passengers a most in-
genious scheme was evolved

  an enormous movable traveler was
built in accordance with the contour of
the new home of the new york central 

the train-shed and mounted on wheels
which ran on rails laid in the middle of
the platforms the train-sheds were re-
moved in sections of twenty and forty
feet the roof covering which consisted
of corrugated iron and glass being re-
moved to the floor of the traveler

  the trusses having a span of  feet
and a height of ninety feet were cut out
in eight sections and lowered onto the
traveler-floor by derricks this work be-
ing done in the daytime

  at night two tracks were assigned to
the construction department and the
refuse material was placed on cars and
sent out on the road temporary wooden
sheds were built behind the traveler so
as to leave very little uncovered space

  when the traveler reached the fence
at the north side of the present concourse
the work became more difficult for the
reason that no supports could be placed
on the concourse it being filled with peo-
ple most of the time but the difficulty
was surmounted and the roofing and
trusses successfully removed

  the base of the trusses extended sev-
eral feet below the level of the platforms
however and to prevent the necessity of
tearing up a goodly portion of the con-
course an acetylene - oxygen blow - pipe
was used and by means of the flame thus
produced the trusses were burned off at
the level of the platform

the track arrangement

  of the forty-two tracks on the upper
or express-train level twenty-nine will
be adjacent to platforms and of the
twenty-five local or lower-level tracks
seventeen will be adjacent to platforms
five of the upper-level tracks at the
extreme west side will be connected by
means of loops with yard tracks on the
east side while the majority of the
tracks on the suburban level will have
loops at the southern end connecting
them with the storage-tracks at the east
side of the yard

  inbound through trains from the neck
of this immense bottle will in the ma-
jority of cases be diverted onto one of
the five tracks already mentioned as be-
ing connected by loops with the tracks
at the east side after the passengers
have alighted the trains will be taken

around the loop and after the baggage-
cars have been placed on a track adja-
cent to a baggage platform equipped
with elevators and conveyors the rest of
the train will be placed on tracks in the
storage-yard

trains down an incline

  inbound suburban trains will be sent
to the suburban level down an incline-
track either at the extreme west side of
park avenue or on one about the center
of the avenue thence onto a track ad-
jacent to a platform and in most cases
on the west side of the yard

  flere the passengers alight and if
the train is to depart immediately it is
reloaded sent around the loop and rises
on an incline-track to the main level on
the east side of park avenue and thence
onto the road

   trains that are not to go out for a while
are placed in the suburban storage-yard
thus the business of the two yards will
be kept separate and all confusion inci-
dent to transferring equipment from one
level to the other will be avoided

   as may be supposed in a yard the size
of the grand central terminal with its
sixty - seven tracks aggregating thirty-
two miles a perfect system of signaling
and train control is necessary without
such a system it would be impossible to
get  trains through the narrow neck
of our hypothetical bottle every twenty-
fpur hours without collisions and wrecks

  one man controls  the entire train
movement of the grand central termi-
nal he is stationed at mott haven
and is called the chief interlocking di-
rector between his office and the
grand central station are five towers in
which are lever switchboards it being
possible to open or close any switch by
pushing a lever and thus diverting a
train onto any track desired

   in each of these towers there is a bay
window and in the window sits the
tower-director who when he sees a train
coming gives an order to one of the
operators who pushes the proper lever
and the train moves onto the proper
track

   the trains on the different divisions
are designated by a different letter on
all the train-sheets trains of the har-


the railroad mans magazine

lem division are denominated x those
on the new york new haven and hart-
ford division by y and those on the
hudson river division by z

  if a train arrives at mott haven and
the chief interlocking director wires to
the towers that z- has arrived the
directors in the towers know that train
no  of the hudson river division is
referred to when the train comes in
sight the director gives the order to one
of the men who pushes the proper lever

  this system has been described fully
in a previous number of the railroad
mans magazine so it is not necessary
to more than refer to it here

  the tearing up of the old tracks the
excavating and erection of the tremen-
dous girders which are to form the
groundwork and support for the upper
level was more than a problem of tre-
mendous construction - it was also a
problem of ingenuity every move had
to be laid out on paper and new com-
binations of signals and switches worked
out before a rail could be torn up or
there might have been unending delays

  never before was work so scientific-
ally ordered and so minutely planned in
the order of its execution excavating
alone was a task so stupendous as to
daunt all but the dauntless over

	cubic yards of earth and rock
have been excavated already and the
work is little more than half completed
the rock-drilling varies from five to fifty
feet and already enough rock has been
removed to build a pyramid as large as
the famous ones of egypt

like a bottles neck

  to get an adequate idea of the diffi-
culties of constructing a tremendously
wide terminal station with two levels and
with every track in almost constant use
it must be borne in mind that the entire
traffic must be poured through the park
avenue tunnel as through the neck of
a bottle

  the ingenuity demanded in laying out
these tracks and in apportioning the
trains that run over them is positively
uncanny like everything connected
with this tremendous undertaking one
has to think of it in superlatives the
trains of practically three railroads

 empty into and from this enormous bot-
 tle there are the hudson river and
 harlem divisions of the new york cen-
 tral and the new york new haven and
 hartford road

    the irand central station the crown-
  ing glory of this great terminal will
  stand on the site of the old building the
  demolition of which will begin the first
  of may the new station will be 
  feet long  feet wide and  feet
  high at the street level it will be 
  feet long  feet wide and  feet
  deep the building will be bounded by
  depew place on the east forty-second
  street on the south vanderbilt avenue
  on the west and forty-fifth street on
  the north  but the building will be set
  back from forty-second street and van-
  derbilt avenue about  feet providing
  a wide plaza on the south and west

the station

    the original plans of the station itself
  have been changed considerably from the
  first design and the building when fin-
  ished will present a-unique spectacle of
  a self-supporting terminal

    as may be seen from the architects
 drawings which we reproduce a sky-
 scraper building will reach up from the
 main structure and the rental from the
 offices contained in it are expected to
 practically defray the working cost of the
 terminal

    the main entrance to the station will
  be at forty-third street on the vander-
  bilt avenue side on descending a short
  flight of stairs to a level about ten feet
  below the street one will find himself on
  the main concourse which will be 
  feet wide  feet long and  feet
  high the suburban concourse will be
  the same width but only  feet long

    south of this concourse and between it
  and tile iorty-second street front will be
  - a large waiting-room ticket-offices etc it
  will not be necessary for passengers to go
  through this room in going to and from
  trains around three sides of the con-
  course at about the street level will be
  a balcony to which carriage passengers
  and those entering from the street will
  have access

    the main concourse will connect only
 with outbound trains an arriving con-
the new home of the new york central 

  course for through trains will be built at
  the east side of the building thus avoid-
  ing the confusion usually existing where
  incoming and outgoing passengers com-
  mingle on one concourse

  below the concourse and waiting-room
on a floor immediately between them and
the suburban track level will be a large
mezzanine concourse connecting with the
subway and enabling arriving and de-
parting suburban passengers to go to and
from the subway and suburban track level
without having to ascend to the street

  for several years past all the trains
entering and departing from the grand
central terminal have been hauled by
electric locomotives consequently the
smoke and gas-fumes so disagreeable to
passengers while the train was traversing
the tunnel have disappeared

  in addition what are known as multi-
ple unit trains are in operation these
cars have a motor and can be operated
as units or any number together

  the use of electricity as a motive pow-
er made a great change at the terminal
with steam-locomotives a high train-shed
was necessary to provide ventilation but

with electricity all that is necessary is to
provide room with the trains it was this
that made possible the creating of a sec-
ond level which could be utilized for the
suburban train service

  as the terminal is to be used by the
new york new haven and hartford
railroad company as well as by the new
york central the presidents of these two
companies are in full control and they
give final decisions on all plans evolved
by engineers architects etc and under
them and having direct charge of the
work is a vice-president of each road
who in turn is assisted by a joint com-
mittee of three representatives of each
road these committees making recommen-
dations on all plans submitted by the
engineers and architects

  the total amount of steel used in the
construction will be  tons this
would require in the neighborhood of

	cars to haul and would make a
train about twenty - five or thirty miles
long

  the capacity of the old terminal was
 car  the capacity of the new terminal
will be  cars

had arrived in davenport

   we were coming down the track at the
rate of about forty miles an hour and were
within a mile and a half of donahue he
said  when i saw something ahead of us
in the middle of the track

   i thought it was a dog but suddenly saw
it was a child as it raised up the child

was playing in the sand and was stooping
over so that it looked like a dog i imme-

   when we came to a full stop i hated to
go out and look at the spot where we had
undoubtedly killed the boy as i thought
sure that he would have been run over and
sies as well i never was so surprised as
when i saw my fireman step up to the cab
holding the child by the neck

  both fireman and engineer state that the
mother of the child living close by ran out
of the house when she saw the train ap-
proaching but turned in horror and fled
back as she evidently did not want to see
the child killed

shining rails shining rails glistening in the light

you who greet the frozen north-meet the land of white
you who greet the frozen north-ah my thoughts run wild
who is crying love of mine can it be the child

wilful thoughts stray back again from the frozen zone
maddening rails saddening rails go your way alone

shining rails shining rails turning toward the south
stronger is the loved ones kiss upon my willing mouth
stronger is the loved ones kiss-yet i seem to see
sunny climes and graceful palms-they are calling me

i must answer love of mine ill return-but when
cruel bitter loving rails-i am yours again

chapter i
master of his fate

kroke

    i john anderson thirty
years old born of respectable
parents living until my twen-
ty - first year in a thriving
western town having had
every advantage that education and kind-
lyparental indulgence could bring know
the full meaning of that word-better
perhaps than any other man  earth

   do not bar the unfortunate who stands
in the bread-line from night to night i
do not bar the needy mendicant who does
not taste food for days at a time and who
begs from door to door  do not bar
the man who has spent his all and looks
vainly for work  have been broke-
broke in every sense of the word

   have been without money for years
i have known what it is to pick crusts of
bread from the refuse of a kitchen i
have slept in public parks on summer
nights and stood in doorways on winter
nights

   have even begged to be taken into
city prisons just to get some food and
shelter from the cold it is not so bad
when one can find neither work nor food
to spend a few days or weeks or months
even in prison at least there is some
humanity inside the gray walls a man
cant starve and lie has a blanket to roll
in every night

but it is hard when a man is ambitious

 am ambitious i want work i want
to live like other men only a little will
satisfy me

i have tried hard-mighty hard i am
not a believer in that thing called fate

but there must be something-something
that keeps men down besides their own
acts

  why should i preach or why should
 even think have such men as  the
right to do either

  perhaps you can answer that question
when you jiave heard my story

  at twenty-one  ran away from my
good home  resented a scolding that
my father had given me-that was all

  we lived in hampton wyoming-a
conventional place of some ten thousand
inhabitants i was accustomed to pur-
chase the household necessaries at the
town stores for my mother

   on this particular day she sent me out
with twenty dollars it was a big sum to
me when  left her at ten oclock in the
morning i had no more intention of not
returning home than she had of killing
me i kissed her good-by

   she told me not to harbor any ill-feel-
ing against my father but somehow or
other i felt he had harmed me deeply
it wasnt what he said that hurt-it jvas 
the manner in which he said it

  something possessed me as  walked
down the street a new light seemed to
come into my life  began to slowly re-
alize that as i had just come of age i
was of some importance in the world
and that it was up to me to put that im-
portance to the test

   it was impossible to do so in hampton
that  village as i sneeringly dubbed
it was no place for me what wouldnt
 give to be back there now

   i was just turning into the main street
of our town when my will was strong
upon me 

  i would not pay the bills i would
not turn back i would go 




the railroad mans magazine

   walked straight to the railroad sta-
tion and secured a ticket for omaha al-
though the agent knew me lie didnt show
any surprise when i purchased a ticket
out of town  suppose that i did it in
such a mechanical way that it did not
occur to hmi that i was purchasing the
ticket for myself

  the train rumbled into the depot and
came to a halt it was then shortly after
noon in the scurry and hurry of alight-
ing passengers and the good-bys of the
departing ones in the exchange of in-
coming and outgoing freight busily han-
dled by the depot men i got aboard

  i found a seat in the rear of the
smoker - a small badly ventilated car 
the fumes of bad tobacco were so dense
that i began to be stifled some twenty
men were lounging about the seats-some
were asleep some still smoking but they
all had the dismal air of tiresome travel

  somehow or other i did not think of
home  that motley crowd of hard-looking
men had arrested my thoughts i began
to wonder who they were and whither
they were going if it really were possible
for human beings to get so low in the
scale of life when my senses were punc-
tured by a shrill voice  all aboard  

  it was drawn out in the monotone fa-
miliar to conductors the train gave a
sudden jolt the locomotive puffed-
once twice thrice-and then it secured its
momentum

  in another minute we were moving
ahead easily and faster-faster-faster
the familiar spots in the outskirts of the
town went by-first in the easy stage of
observation then so fast that i was re-
minded only of the saying of some noted
humorist that the telegraph-poles looked
like a fine-tooth comb

  it may seem incongruous that anything
humorous should have entered my mind
then but as this narrative will show
the humorous in life always struck me
forcibly

  it mattered little about the seriousness
uf my condition even with hunger gnaw-
ing at my vitals i never failed to see the
humorous side of a situation and  pre-
-ume that this optimistic streak so to
-peak is accountable for the fact that i
am alive to-day to write this story

  we were soon in a part of the country
that was strange to me my thoughts

then turned to my mother i knew that
she was now worrying because i had not
returned home and  pictured to myself
litjr feelings when darkness came and i
would not be home to join in our evening
meal

  i did not worry about my father 
knew that with his cold-blooded demean-
or he would simply look upon my de-
parture as just what might happen to any
young man he had no sentiment life
with him was all practical and matter of
fact we are simply creatures to shape
our own destinies he thought and  was
only shaping mine

  as we sped along and twilight came
i tried to time the exact moment -when
my father would be returning home i
could see my mother with tears in her
eyes telling him that something terrible
must have happened to me and i can see
him denying that such was the case-that
i was old enough to take care of myself
and that i would be sure to turn up all
right in the end

  he had that all-pervading belief in
human nature that any man thrown on
his own resources provided he has grit
and determination will ultimately land
on his feet and i knew that he lost no
sleep that first night that i was absent
from home although my mother probably
cried her eyes out wondering if i were
dead or alive

  when i reached omaha and stood
alone and desolate on the sidewalk in
front of the great railway station i de-
termined for a moment to return home

  but it dawned on me with much force
that i was a thief as well as a runaway

  and yet wouldnt my mother have giv-
en all that i had taken and all that she
possessed if i would have returned that
night

  it was too late now the damage had
been done i was my own master-the
designer of my own fate nobody could
say a word to me as to what i should or
should not do i had only my own com-
mands to obey there is something in that

  night came on and it was pretty cold
 was hungry and i wandered to a cheap
restaurant near the station where for
twenty cents  secured a greasy beef-
steak smothered in a wad of greasy on-
ions and a cup of coffee that must have
been brewed from the bark of a tree
the man who wasnt game



  compared with the plain but well-
cooked and tasty meals that my mother
so gladly prepared for our little home
this repast was like unto the swill that
is thrown to hogs but hunger is its own
best cook i have frequently learned since

  after i had finished my meal i walked
down to the station and watched the
trains as they were shunted back and forth
in the yards railroads had ever a fascina-
tion for me and i was getting deeply in-
terested in several new passenger-locomo-
tives attached to the fast trains for the
east and west when the darkness came
upon me

  the myriad lights of the railway yards
seemed to dazzle my eyes and before i
knew it i was blinking and tired the
next thing to do was to find a place to
sleep

  my first impression was to crawl in
some box car and pass the night i saw
three standing on a siding near a freight-
station and started across the tracks to
them a man yelled to me to go back

  evidently he was on the lookout for
tramps

   sat in the station near the stove until
another man-this one in uniform-came
up to me and asked me what train i was
waiting for

  i didnt know of course so he hustled
me into the street again with the forcible
reminder that the station was no place
for bums neither was it a hotel

  it was too cold to wander the streets
which  would gladly have done in order
to save my money but when i remem-
bered that on the morrow i would have
to start out in search of work it seemed
to me that the best thing for me to do
was to get a good sleep

   walkedalong a dimly lighted thor-
oughfare and into another-i have- trav-
eled so much since that i do not remem-
ber the names - and finally my eyes
caught a sign faintly showing under a
flickering gas-light that seemed destined
to be extinguished with every puff of the
wind the sign

rooms

  and  cents

men only

  i entered the place and walked a din-
gy flight of wooden stairs to a landing

where the word  office  on a glass door
told me that i should apply there there
was only one light on the landing and the
odor-nay let me now give it its proper
name smell-was enough to choke an or-
dinary mortal

  i entered the office it was a dingy af-
fair-a room of perhaps eight square feet
six of which were partitioned off by a
brass net work directly in front of the
door there was a window in the brass
work and through this a man thrust his
head and asked me what i wanted

   i should like to have a room for the
night i answered

   how much  he asked

  i remembered the sign outside and my
meager purse and told him that the ten-
cent variety would suit my taste just then

  what is your name he asked as
he pushed a book in front of me and
handed me a pen

  i took the pen and started to write at
the place he indicated but it suddenly
struck me that i could not give my own
name in such a place i wrote down
the john-that was common enough
-but what should  indite as a surname

  long training or instinct or heaven
knows what forced me to make the  a
and before i knew it i had written the
name  andrews

  i have since read somewhere that crim-
inals assuming names generally use their
own initials that there is some unseen
power that guides the hand to do this no
matter how much the mind may force it
to do otherwise

  how old are you he asked when
he had written my name

   twenty-one i truthfully answered

   where were you born  was the next
query

  i hesitated what difference could it
make to him what  said

    chicago  finally told him with a
tremor	

   what is your occupation was
hurled at me

   clerk i said half under my
breath

  he wrote down eacli answer as if each
were gospel truth he asked me one or
two more questions-the names and ages
of my parents which brought forth black-
ened lies i finally mustered up courage
to ask him why it was necessary to pursue


the railroad mans magazine

tliis mode of cross-examination for the
simple purpose of renting a ten - cent
room

  he did not hesitate to answer he
gave it to me quick and straight from the
shoulder he said

   so we will know who you are in case
you commit suicide the law requires it

  he was a cheerless - looking lantern-
jawed consumptive of some forty-five
years into whose life disappointment
must have crept and died he didnt
know just how deeply those words cut-
and he didnt care

  h e struck a -great brass gong and looked
upon me with the calm indifference of
one who knows a tramp when he sees one
as he took the dime  handed him and
thrust it in a cluttered-up cash-drawer

  his ring was answered bya shuffle of
feet outside a man rattled down-stairs
and entered it was evident that in this
hotel the attendants cared but little for
the comfort of the sleepers

   show him up to twenty-seven said
the man behind the brass work to the
man who entered

  this second individual nodded to me
and opened the door i followed as he
started up another flight of stairs more
dimly lighted than the first

  he opened the door of a room-a large
poorly ventilated room in which a hun-
dred men were sleeping then it came to
me that my ten cents did not entitle me to
a single room my guide led me on
among the lines of cots placed ilose to
each other in perfect order

  it was dark-only a red lamp gleamed
over the solitary door to show the way
out in case of fire we walked almost
to the end of the room when he stopped
in front of a vacant cot pointed and made
his exit

  there were no tips in that hostelry

  the vacant cot to which he pointed was
 twenty-seven i looked at it a moment
and then sat down on it my hands
touched the musty blanket and the hard
pillow and a shudder ran through my
body then i tried to look around me

  on every cot so far as i could see
was a man some were asleep some must
have been awake many were snoring like
sawmills and many more were restless
but all were human derelicts with no
story to tell about themselves

  all perhaps had given fictitious names
-just as i had-and if all committed sui-
cide or if the place burned down and all
were incinerated who would mourn
them

  but the odor of the place-the foul
impure stench it made my head ache
for a moment i thought of the cleanliness
of my own home and the pride that my
good mother took in keeping it whole-
some a tear burned on my cheek 
threw myself on the cot without removing
even my coat or shoes

  i wanted to go to sleep and forget
everything

  i buried my face in that awful pillow
it was a hard canvas affair without any
pillow-slip and scores of heads had rest-
ed there before mine

  but it did seem good to lie down even
if the odors of the place were getting
more and more unbearable and the
snoring and the restless occupants were on
ni nerves

  as i listened to them a terrible wave of

real homesickness completely engulfed

me i grew restless i cried i even

moaned

          

  i would have given anything-anything
to have been home  knew the torture
that my mother was suffering for me her
voice was calling the-darkness fright-
ened me those men around me seemed to
mock the good that i had in me i wanted
to go home-i wanted to go home

  the next thing that i knew some one
was prodding me violently in the middle
of the back

chapter ii
the man in the next cot

t had been sound asleep whoever
was trying to awaken me evidently
had been working pretty hard in that di-
rection for before i regained my waking
senses he had poked me violently with
his fist and always in the same place in
the middle of my back

  thinking that something had hap-
pened i sat up the man who had been
so intent on waking me was the occupant
of the cot beside mine he was a short
sandy man he wore a cheap black suit
which was much the worse for dirt and a
blue shirt
the man who wasnt game



  his hair was long and disheveled and
his stubbly beard offset by a mustache
that was reddish and somewhat heavy
gave him an appearance that was not
inviting to a young man who had just
thrust himself alone on the mercy of the
wicked world

  he was the first to speak

  time to get up pal theyll throw
you out of this dump in a few minutes

  i thanked him and looking around me
i noticed that the cots were being slowly
emptied one by one

   come with me and i will show you
where to wash he volunteered

  i followed him i suppose that i
would have followed a dog i felt that
it was easy then to follow anything save
my own inclination

  he led the way across the hall to a
smaller room opposite the one in which
we had slept around a battered sink
a score or more of men of all ages were
rubbing yellow soap on their hands and
into their eyes and ears tien they
would plunge their hands under the fau-
cets from which flowed goodly streams
and rinse the suds away they seemed
to be enjoying it

  the water looked refreshing but there
was a dismal taste in my mouth and a
stickiness about my face and hair that
seemed to defy any cleansing property oil
earth

  i removed my coat collar and tie i
waited patiently until there was an open-
ing-and then i washed indeed 
seemed to be cleansing my very soul my
but that water was good 

  now for a rub on the towel but alas
there were only three towels and they
had been used so many times by so many
men that they were not only slopping with
water but black with dirt i hadnt the
courage to tackle one of them so i
deftly extracted my handkerchief from
my pocket and began to use it to dry
my face and hands

  some one was laughing at me

  i turned it was the unkempt being
who had so rudely awakened me

   not used to this sort of thing son-
ny  he said

  my mother had taught me to look only-
on the pleasant side of things and espe-
cially in dealing with my fellow man i
remembered this and while i resented his

unseemly impertinence i smiled at him as
if it made no difference to me whether
i used a handkerchief or towel

  i finished drying and started for the
door he followed me i made for the
street and he was close at my heels
i veached the sidewalk and looked around
me it was a cold bleak morning and
to make matters worse a dismal rain was
falling

  i looked in the direction of the rail-
road station only a few blocks away and
my eye caught a huge clock-it pointed
to the hour of seven that was the
hour when all the sleepers in the place
where i had passed the night were turned
into the streets

  i thought that i would go over to the
station for a while it would be inter-
esting now to watch the trains and the
men going to work-and maybe i would
be fortunate enough to find employment

  just as i was starting away my
 friend  who had lurked in the door-
way of the hostelry came out and ap-
proached me

   cant we go and get a little break-
fast  he asked

  it wasnt a bad suggestion i replied
that i thought that i would go some-
where for a cup of coffee

   ill go along he responded  i
know a place up here a block or two
and he jerked his head in a direction
opposite from the railway station

  we walked along together he asked
me my name i told him that it was
 john i did not attempt to give him
my last name

   mines billy brown he volunteered
 say lets be pals where are you head-
ing for

   im going to look for something to
do when ive had some coffee i said

  he smiled as if i didnt mean it we
exchanged a few more commonplaces
when we reached a dingy restaurant it
was dignified by a huge sign over the
door announcing that coffee and cakes
could be purchased for ten cents and by
a dozen or more sad-visaged pies in the
show-window

  billy entered first i followed he
led the way to a table in the rear of the
place and brushed the multitudinous
flies from the oil-cloth with a sweep of
his arm he took a chair opposite me


the railroad mans magazine

  and there we sat awaiting the coming of
  the attendant

     a fat girl with her hair still in papers
  hastened in from the kitchen with her
  mouth full of her own breakfast and
  tried to ask us what we would have

     coffee y sinkers said billy

    a nod from me indicated to her that
 i would take the same

    she vanished and before she had time
  to return with two thick and steaming
  cups of a concoction that might have
  passed for coffee with a horse and a
  plate containing six leaden links that
  were never intended for anything but
  sinkers billy had leaned over and was
  becoming confidential

    if its work youre looking for pal
  i want you to stick to me an i can put
  you wise to a little job in this town that
  will make us both rich

    something youre interested in i
 said with all the enthusiasm i possessed
  yes its a hotel down here

     a hotel i echoed  what sort of
 a place-are you going to open it 

   to be sure i am he answered
  i wont say anything more about it

	now but you meet me to-night at eight
  oclock in front of that joint where we
  slept last night an i will tell you all
  about it i cant do it now 

    he said some other things which i do
 not remember while he soused the sink-
 ers in his coffee and dripped the liquid
 onto his vest while trying to guide the
 combination to his mouth indeed i
 thought that he was a little excited but
 put it down to his prospects

    youre the kind of young man i
 like he continued  i saw you come
 in last night i watched you as you sat
 on your cot i heard you cryin i couldnt
 go to sleep

     i dont blame you i said  it is
  a dirty hole i never slept in such a
  place before

     i thought so said billv  but it
  aint so bad when you get used to it
  would i ever get used to it 

    billy choked the last bit of leaden
 sinker down with the iast gulp of near-
 coffee and the fat girl appeared again

     which one of you gents agoin to
 pay fer this she asked

    t fumbled for my share of it but billy
  said  i will and taking two dimes

from his pocket handed them to the girl
i thanked hftn and noticed that the girl
was eying him pretty steadily

   think i seen you afore she ob-
served with a peculiar squint in her right
optic

   why i always come here for break-
fast dont i asked billy smiling

   dont gimme none of that con re-
plied the girl  you aint no regiar in
this dump i knows em all i seen
your picter in th paper an it didnt have
them whiskers on it neither

  bill laughed and i laughed as we arose
and started for the door just as we were
emerging into the street billy called
back  guess youve got another guess
cornin sis

   mebbe i aint mistaken shouted sis

  i felt a little better the food the
mans companionship the promise of the
work the girls blarney were all needed
to balance the bleakness of the weather
perhaps it wasnt going to be so hard
to face the world after all perhaps i
would find in bill a good friend

  we walked to the station and sat down
under the shed he bought a newspaper
and scanned it hurriedly then he passed
it to me but i didnt care to read

   tell me more about the hotel job
i said

   s-s-sh  he replied and looked
queerly about him  dont speak of that
now ill tell you about that to-night

  he looked around him again

	 come he said  there is a park
right up here lets go up there and sit
for a while its much pleasanter than
here

   but its raining i said

   thats nothing he answered  
know a place that beats this for shelter

  he started and i followed i turned
my collar up around-mv neck and thrust
my hands into my pockets for it was get-
ting colder and colder-and i couldnt
imagine why he wanted to leave the sta-
tion where at least we were sheltered
from the wind

  we entered a street that seemed to be
a businessthoroughfare neither of us
said a word after we had walked some
three or four blocks i noticed two tall
business-like men crossing the street in
our direction

  they were looking straight at us
the man who wasnt game



there could be no mistake about that
 thought that they might be friends of
bill so i nudged his arm

  bill looked and caught their eyes
then as if possessed with a demon he
suddenly turned and ran

   one of the men started after him and
i noticed that he pulled a pistol as he
did so

  i stood stock still watching my van-
ishing companion and his pursuer when
the second man walked up to me and laid
his hand  my arm

    anyhow weve got you he said

   me  i said choking and burning
 i dont understand-

  youre under arrest he answered
 come with me  

  he began to lead me away by the arm
i heard a pistol-shot-then another
they seemed to be very close by

  suddenly a crowd emerged from a side
street bill had doubled on his tracks
and was being pursued by the populace
back to the spot where he had first seen
the strangers

   i saw him coming in my direction the
man with me took a tighter hold on my
coat

   i made a desperate effort to free my-
self

  this only made him grab me the
tighter he threw back his coat and
exhibited a silver shield on his breast
on which i hastily caught the word
 detective

  i knew then it was foolish to make
resistance

   bill was running in our direction it
was plain that he didnt see us

   the hunted look on his face his star-
ing determined eyes haunt me to this
day

  on he came the crowd close at his
heels yelling  stop thief stop thief 
the second detective was following in
the crowd but it was evident that he was-
afraid to shoot now for ftar of hitting
some one in the mob

  then as bill came toward us the de-
tective who was holding me calmly
reached to his hip-pocket for his pistol
i saw it gleam in his hand

  i saw him deliberately put his finger
on the trigger-and wait

  he waited until the unfortunate man
was barely twenty feet away then fired
straight at him i saw bill throw his
hands up and stop just before the report
-but it was too late

  bill fell in the street a great crowd
around him my custodian took a grip
 my wrist twisted it so that it brought
my hand up to the middle of my back-
and marched me off to jail a crowd
followed and i could hear occasional
mutterings about  bank  and  rob-
bery -and then it came upon me that
i was in bad

   tried to explain my position to the
officer he would not listen

  i was marched to the door of the city
prison an officer opened it and closed
it with a clang when my captor and i
were safe inside the latter did not re-
lax his hold on me until we stopped in
front of a high desk behind which sat
a heavily uniformed policeman-the head
of his district

  what have you got clancy he
asked my captor

   doyle an me landed red pete the
bank-robber this morning

   did you have to shoot asked the
man behind the desk

   yes i pulled on him let nim
have it straight

   is he dead

   dont know its pretty hard to kill
them guys he fell anyhow an i hus-
tled this feller off here

  whos this asked the man behind
the desk

   this said clancy as he jerked me
around so that i faced him  this is red
petes pal hes the fellow who pulled
off that robbery at the eagle hotel on
monday night

to be continued

a work-train may be carrying as good brains as a private car but
      youve got to prove it its what you are that counts not
      what you claim to be

observations of a country
station-agent

by j e smith

no -in which schwartz tells of his troubles while purchasing
right-of-way from farmers and especially with  pap
an unwashed antique and his bonehead son

t does not particularly matter
what department of railroad
work a man looks into there
is likely to be found some-
thing of interest-something
out of the ordinary showing unexpected
slants of human understanding

  the greatest mind of the literary world
made the truthful observation that  there
are sermons in stones on the railroad
that means the stone-mason gang if the
stone-mason gang furnishes thrills of
romance and adventure why not the
fence gang the section gang the bridge
carpenters or the lineman and it is
true that in all these places there are
stories of unusual experience and human
interest

  a seeker of railroad stories should
search these out-of-the-way places and
poke and rake about in these unpromising
fields and he is often rewarded with a
find

  i had this idea in mind when one long
day last summer i fell in with schwartz

  schwartz is our railroad real estate
man we are double tracking our road
and schwartz had been buying addi-
tional right of way along the line

  the public call it  double tracking
we of the railroad allude to it as the
 second track both mean the same
thing

  all along our right-of-way we needed
little strips of land ten twenty sixty or
a hundred feet wide to complete the work
of the second track

  it looks easy to go out among our
neighbor farmers and buy for a fair
price small parallel strips of land

  but schwartz was sad and sunburnt
he talked disparagingly of the farmer

   dont make the mistake he said
depreciatingly  that the farmer is either
an easy mark or that he is a friend to the
railroad he cant be coaxed wheedled
cajoled or frightened into giving us an
inch  a fair basis he wont meet us
half way-not a quarter of the way he
wont even come a foot in our direction

   weve got to run him down and
bivouac on his own premises and hold
him while we explain that we want a
strip of his land and that we will pay
him well for it when he finds we must
have it he sees at once that the land
lying along the railroad is the most fer-
tile on the farm and that weare about
to rob him of his most valuable posses-
sions

   then lie - digs into the past for a
generation or two and revives all the
old grievances of fencing drainage fire
and stock claims he has ever had against
the railroad lumps them into a fine round
aggregate doubles the value of the land
stacks it all up in one grand total and
puts it up to us that we can have the
strip-probably an acre all told-for
nine hundred and forty dollars and eighty
cents

   this pays all the old debts that we
do not owe and includes the farmers

matum that not a  chimed cent less will
buy it

  when you tell a farmer that the rail-
road has made his farm what it is and
that without railroads his farm would not
be a third of its present value he looks
at you with innocent surprise and asks
 what would your blamed old road
be if it wasnt for the farms huh 

  thats the kind of an argument that
goes around in a circle its nix on a
farmer because lie knows hes the center
of the universe

   take this country through here
continued schwartz   had to purchase
twenty-three strips along our
right-of-way for the railroad

what did i run up against

three things--sentiment sharp
practise and pig-headed obsti-
nacy

   maybe you would be inter-
ested to hear some of my expe-
riences  you would eh  

  schwartz lit a stogie designed
in wheeling slid down in the
seat until he rested comfortably
on the small of his back and
hung a few clouds of smoke
about the circumambient then
lie began

   i said sentiment didnt i 

you did not know people are
sentimental about land did you 

well they are the farmer
and his family are associated
very closely with inanimate
things and they become at-
tached to them his hedge
fence his meadow his strip of
woodland all appeal to him
with a sort of dumb affection that a man
without a soul cannot understand

  i gave a quick nod to show that i
understood

   all the farmers i approached with
the explanation that we wanted a strip
of land to allow the railroad to spread
out a little came back with the same
expression   aint got no land for sale
then i explained that the railroad
must have it that its business had out-
grown its present facilities it now must
have two tracks that the business of
the country is greater every year and
that we are forced to increase our capacity
to take care of it  presented ourselves

in the attitude of having to do this that
we were compelled by conditions to spend
vast sums to enlarge our plant we were
driven to it and in reality we were un-
willing purchasers of the strip of land
needed

  after i had presented the matter in
this way to the first farmer i visited i
was pointedly informed that lie had no
land for sale

   now the land was in his wifes
name-a little forty-acre farm-and the
poorest kind of a place all we needed
of it was a strip of twenty feet along a
gully to give us room for a fill and

the ground was so poor along there that
grass would hardly grow on it

   i offered them three times the real
value and  knew they needed the
money

   after a little while the man was
willing to sell but the woman would
not listen to it

    i argued the case with her and told
her as i told them all that the railroad
would take it anyway

   we can take any property for the
operation of our trains through con-
demnation proceedings but we only resort
to the courts when everything else has
failed

j uoewau bine

her pa planted em there the day him an her

ma was married


the railroad mans magazine

   so i explained to the woman how
we would proceed if she did not sell it
to us and how it would be to her profit
to accept the figure i made her rather
than drive us to that extremity

   she was a little weezen shrunken
creature and i saw she had a horror of
going to the court still she would not
budge an inch

   she did not try to drive a bargain
the price gave her no concern she sim-
ply would not sell and her reason was
the purely feminine one of  just because

   she shed tears and became hysterical

    i would sell anywhere else on the
farm except right there she cried

   we could not use a strip anywhere
else on the farm we had to have the
twenty feet at the gully to widen our fill
i tried to make her understand it that
way but she was absolutely immovable

   it puzzled me why she was willing
to part with a strip any other place but
was so unreasonably unyielding at the
very spot we actually had to have

   the man did all he could for me
but we made no headway with the woman

   at length he led me out behind the
log barn and made a shamefaced con-
fession

    im ashamed of her mister i am
for sure he said with a sort of weak-
eyed lowliness  its just a durn cranky

idee of hern they aint eny sense in it
you know theys two old apple-trees 
that strip thats the reason its
them they aint much account her
pa planted em there the day him and her
ma was married they was two children
you know-my wife and the one that
died they wus raised under them trees
 her pa ust to say he had four in his
family ann and sade and the rambow
and the pippin tree and mister if that
woman has any sewing or work of that
kind to do when the days are warm
youll always find her right out there
under that pippin-tree taint the ap-
ples mister its cause of her pa i hope
you wont tell eny one mister id hate
for it to git out it ud kind o disgrace
us you see youd cut em down thats
what worries her mister

   i assured him i would say nothing

i also assured him that we would drop
the matter for the present and give her
time to struggle with her feelings i left
with the utmost contempt for that shriv-
eled husbandr who was ashamed and
apologetic for perhaps the only touch of
sentiment that had ever come under his
observation

   there now comes some darker his-
tory within six weeks both trees were
dying when this became apparent we
had no trouble completing the deal and

 did not want to be unreasonable and hold you up

j wormati lvm

taking the possession of the
strip

   why did they die the
husband told me with a half-
exultant smirk and a cunning
side whisper

  he bored them to the
heart filled the holes with a
solution of common salt and
something else and then
plugged them up

   his wife thought it was
providence

   the husband saved him-
self the disgrace of his wifes
emotions and at the same time
fastened his clutches on some
railroad money

   while this deal was pend-
ing i was busy with others in
the same neighborhood i
made headway slowly

   i could have dealt with
many of the farmers without
much delay but i found that
each had a pride in being able
to drive a sharp bargain and
was fearful his neighbor would
do better than he they were
all touchy on that point

   nothing hurts the pride
of the farmer-or humiliates him more
than to ascertain that another farmer has
driven a better bargain

   they can talk ta me of captains of
finance industrial promoters and hot-
air purveyors of the cities but when you
undertake to put one over on a haystack
artist you have got to be a pretty peart
citizen or you will lose a bunck of cuticle
in the operation

   all this made it hard for me to se-
cure an opening each farmer decided
to wait until he saw what i was paying
the others

    i found it necessary to at least close
one transaction and thereby establish a
price so i selected what appeared to me
to be the meekest brother for the initial
onslaught

   i picked him out from all the rest
-ie was a little unassuming pious non-
resisting man he agreed so readily with
all i said and admitted every proposition
so fully and freely that i began to think
he was going to make us a present of the
strip through his farm

paps got his mind made up so hev i

   i felt impelled to remind him that
the railroad really had the money and
was willing to pay a fair price i wanted
to caution him not to throw his land
away

    admired and commended his broad
public spirit but i made it plain to him
that the railroad did not expect this ad-
ditional right-of-way strip without ma-
king some payment

   i was to call on him again in two
days he wanted a little time to do some
figuring he wanted you understand
only what was exactly right but he could
not tell offhand and if i would come
back in two days he would give me his
proposition in writing

    went away in high spirits and re-
turned ditto

   i felt that he was a conscientious old
man and i was sure he wanted to trim
down his figures to the lowest possible
limit

   when i returned he bade me sit he
asked after my- personal welfare with a
kind of christian solicitude and humility


the railroad mans magazine

he asked about our railroad and ex-
pressed the mild hope that it was pros-
pering

    some people are prejudiced against
railroads said he  but i aint this
country wouldnt amount to much if it
wasnt for railroads some people are
always taking advantage of them and
holding them up for everything they can
get out of them i never believed in
that rights right i believe in be-
ing as fair and square in dealing with a
railroad company as i would with one of
my neighbors

  he handed me an envelope

    its all wrote out and put down in
black and white what i will take to deed
to the railroad that ten-foot strip were
ready to make the deed any time well
sign up the papers any time you want us
to that ten foot amounts to three-sev-
enths of one acre i called it a half-
acre thats dost to it i figured every-
thing purty dost i did not want to be
unreasonable and hold you up like some
people do

   you asked me what the envelope con-
tained i havent yet recovered from the
shock of my first glimpse of the  within
document remember this party was
hand - picked for an opener h is talk
was so smooth and fair i thought  was
going to make a fine start mind you i
told him in an hour of weakness not to
give his land away - that we actually
wanted to pay something

   there were four foolscap pages of
disgusting details itemized and listed in
a fair hand

   the grand total-the final considera-
tion-for the one-half acre of raw farm-
land was carried to the very bottom of the
last page and set down in large bold
figures

   what do you think farm-land sells
for around here one hundred dollars
an acre thats a fair average a half-
acre would be fifty dollars  would
gladly have paid him twice that but ill
be jumped up if that innocent unsophis-
ticated personification of justice didnt
make his figures on it one thousand three
hundred and forty-two dollars and ninety
cents

   and i picked on him as the easiest
one of the bunch thats what hurts

   how did he arrive at that magnificent

total  by going back to the time of
adam and coming down through the dark
ages to the present day

   you see he thought he had us-
that we had to buy his half-acre at any
price-so he added everything to it he
could think of

   there were crumpled-tailed pigs
woolly sheep short-horned cows and
other domestic animals slaughtered at
regular intervals in time past by the rail-
road and settled on a compromised val-
ue all of these were indicated in an
appalling list and the difference justly
due as viewed by the owner was carried
out as a debit

   for instance here are some of the
items that i remember particularly
june   the companys train
killed a spotted calf they paid me ten
dollars i consider the actual value of
that calf twenty dollars balance due
me-

    on an average they kill one turkey
goose or chicken every two weeks they
do not consider a claim for a fowl they
say it is of no consequence in forty
years they have killed  fowls 
fowls at thirty cents each - a very low
average-leaves due me for poultry


    the railroad furnishes a highway
for tramps tramps steal annually from
me ten dollars worth of produce total
forty years at ten per year 

    the railroad section - foreman has
carried water from my well in the barn-
yard for  years for his gang five per
cent of cost of well and pump upkeep in
forty years 

    twenty-eight engines a day pass my
field on the south emitting dense black
smoke which obscures the sunlight on ten
acres thirty minutes a day retards
growth and maturity of crop one twenty-
fifth total two dollars per year 
years 

  can you beat that last item and
to think i picked on the author of it as
the easiest one of the bunch

  schwartz threw away a half-smoked
cigar in disgust

   oh yes we finally got the half-acre
he came across but not until we had our
lawsuit with blairs cost us about three
hundred thats so much we dont like to
talk about it
observations of a country station-agent 

when i

   i must tell you about the blairs-
there were two of them father and son
they owned adjoining farms along the
right of way we needed a twenty-foot
strip of each farm

   i called on the younger blair first
he gave me a very cool reception

    this is my land said he  i own
it and i pay the taxes on it
want to sell any of it to the
railroad ill let you know

   evidently it would have
held  up our second track
work a long time if we had
waited for blair to let us
know he did not seem to
be the  let you know  kind

so  conveyed the information
to him with a sort of con-
fidential assurance that when
a railroad had to have more
land for additional running
track it could go into court
and get it by condemnation
proceedings

   i added that we wanted
to deal fairly with the people
and that we expected to pay
m ore than the land was
worth but that we would not
be held up for exorbitant fig-
ures and that no man nor
set of men could block the
outlined improvement

   this plain talk had no
effect on mr blair he bat-
ted his weak eyes with a wise
owl snap and informed me
once more that the land was
his and that when he wanted
to sell any of it to the rail-
road hed let me know etc after that
he assumed a stillen silence and i made
no further headway

     i will see your father i said taking
up a new lead  and see what he thinks
about it if i can come to terms with
him i should be able to do so with you
  you can see pap if you want to
but it aint no use said blair  paps
got his mind made up so hey i aint
enything can change us

    it can do no harm to explain mat-
ters to your father i argued  i want
to put our proposition before him and
give him the railroads reason for want-
ing a strip of his land

    pap knows his business so do i
blair interrupted  when we want to
sell any land to the railroad well let
you know

   he disposed of the whole matter a
number of times by that ultimatum

   nevertheless i went at once to
 paps  house  pap  was about the
finest old ruin i have ever seen he was

jncmn ixnd-

it isnt too late yet i yelled

you should take a little trip-

say down to indianapolis

unkempt unwashed and uncared for
he had defied the invasion and ravages
of all the germs of germdom and had
scorned every known law of sanitation
as a consequence he was only eighty-
seven years old and deaf at that

   all about him was a state of decay
the house was an early-day log one
corner had sunk down close to the
ground like a tired horse shifting its
weight on one leg

    yelled my proposition to him with
all the details  then i paused partly for
breath and partly for him to give some
expression he asked with a childs
innocence


the railroad mans magazine

    how old do you say i be 

   about sixty-eight  said aiming
for a complimentary shot

   he gave a dry cackle

    i was eighty-seven second of last
march  aint never rode on a train

    never rode on a train  i repeated

der i got back to the original proposi-
tion and endeavored to show the old man
that selling us a strip of land twenty
feet wide would in no way impair his
value as an antique all i could get out
of him was that he had never rode on a
train i showed him the land was rather

    no never been inside of the cars
eighty-seven the second day of last
march and never rode on a train

    it isnt too late vet  yelled
 you should take a little trip-say down
to indianapolis-some day

    me ride on a train  not me 

   all at once i understood him

   people have various ambitions al-
most every one wants place power or
riches but this old man wanted to be a
curio he wanted to be the prize fossil
he wanted to be pointed out as the man
of eighty-seven who had never ridden on
a train the distinction he craved was
that he had stayed hitched true to the
prehistoric

    people come from all around to
see me he added with a show of pride
 at the old settlers meetin i sets on the
platform and the speaker tells em all
about it no sir never rode on a train
 with superficial ejaculations of won-

poor where we wanted a strip and that
altogether it amounted to only seven-
eighths of an acre-

    he never rode on a train 

  -and that we would pay him dou-
ble its farm value and build him a new
hog-proof fence clear through-

    he never rode on a train

  -and that we would take care of his
surface water and our stone arch would
be deepened to improve the general
drainage of his place-

    he never rode on a train

   after a fruitless chase around a circle
a number of times  sought the son

    i aint got nothin more to say
said the son squinting at me through
narrow eyes  ill do what pap does
and nothin else if pap will sell you a
strip i will but understand we aint
got no land for sale gidup 

   i beat it to the old homestead to
have another talk with pap

all son could do was to

kick the dog every time
a train whistled
observations of a country station-agent



     im back again i called out cheer-
ily  i just had a talk with your son
he says that if youll sell us a strip of
your land hell do the same

     he told you so too didnt he yes
sir i aint never rode on a train 

    he said hed sell if you-

    some people say it aint so i kin
prove it no sir i never rode on a train
and im eighty-seven-eighty-seven the
second day of march

    you see we must have the land-

    aint many can say what i can when
they git as old as i am that they aint
never rode on a train 

    i hurried to the son

     see here i said to him  i do not
think i can come to any agreement with
your father he doesnt seerrr to grasp
the proposition i am making

     well replied the son  ill do what
pap does but we aint got any land for
sale gidup 

   i could not make any headway with
that precious pair the son was hostile
but evasive fie kept me running to
 pap  on an impossible errand  pap 
was complimented with my visits he
thought i was down there through a keen
curiosity to see the rare old man the
backwoods oddity the pioneer wonder
that had never ridden on a train

    negotiations came to a standstill

   i threatened  son  with court pro-
ceedings

   the answer he returned offhand was
that if any railroad man attempted to
come on his side of the fence with pick
and shovel or a surveyors outfit hed fill
him full of buckshot

    he put up a sign  no trespassing

   now the progress of a great enter-
prise does not halt at a sign nor can it
be stayed by the buckshot argument of a
hostile land owner in this case we went
into court

   they opposed us at every angle and
they were venomous in their opposition

   but we got the land and we paid
them less than we had offered before we
started proceedings

   the whole thing was nothing but
pig-headed obstinacy arising from an
ignorant prejudice against railroads

    it was a great revelation to  son  to
learn that land belonging to him could
be taken for railroad purposes regardless

of his attitude in the matter he could
not understand it he did not know
there was anything beyond private owner-
ship he does not know yet what they
mean by  rights of the community  and
 eminent domain

   as for  pap that fine old antique he
got to tell the judge the lawyer the ap-
praisers and all others in the case that
he  hadnt never rode on a train

   encouraged by a cunning lawyer who
found him good picking  son  came
back at us with suits for damages suits
for trespass and injunction proceedings

   nevertheless we fenced off the strip
a trusty steam shovel reduced it to the
proper grade and a new track holds it
forever

   for a long time all  son  could do
was to kick the dog every time a train
whistled and  pap  not only assured
all concerned that hed never rode on a
train but  ding blast his hide if ever he
would

   by and by a new and brilliant idea
percolated  sons  thick head

   he plotted a half acre of ground
on the top of the hill and named it
 high point cemetery

   it abuts the railroad right-of-way
and the railroad can never encroach on
that sacred reserve we can never again
widen our right-of-way on his farm

   the law recognizes a burial-place as
a hallowed and consecrated spot  son
in his malicious resentment has headed
off any further advance we may ever
want to make in his direction

   kind and considerate providence
helped the scheme along by removing
 pap  from this  vale of railroads

    son  planted him one foot from
the right-of-way fence

   they will not expect the railroad to
furnish an epitaph but heres one any-
way-borrowing an expression from a
pure-food-law label it has the flavor
of shakespeare

p a p

lived s years and never rode on a train

  was agin all things thats modern

  automobiles baths and phones

  and curses be on the railroad

  that dares disturb these bones

   i could tell you more said schwartz
 but im out of stogies i need the dope
to keep me thinking

by augustus wittfeld

             the star detective uses his skill and
             mental telepathy to penetrate a mystery

arlock bjones was the
 star detective of the pole-
 to-pole railway when i
 stepped into his sumptuous
 apartments and found him
 intently scrutinizing a coup-
 ling-pin he gave me a quick glance and
 said

   ah watchem i see you have lots of
leisure and as your wife has gone away
i feel that i can depend on you to join
me in this case

  i gasped

  remarkable i ejaculated it
beats the time-table how you deduce these
things that none but myself am aware
of

   dead easy he replied  you have
on a bright red necktie that fact pro-
claims to the world that your wife has
gone to the country you generally shave
yourself but as you have a clean shave
and your face is free from gashes i know
that you have been to the barbers that
and the fact that you have been playing
pool is evidence that you have time to
offer up on the altar of ennui

   but how do you know t have been
playing pool i asked in an awestruck
voice

   well he replied  you have chalk
on the lapel and tail of your coat and
also between the thumb and forefinger of

your left hand that can indicate noth-
ing but that you have been playing pool
 i might have been playing billiards
i suggested

   yes he replied   but you dont
know how

   carlock i commented  youre a
wonder what is the case you are work-
ing on 

   this he replied  is the most per-
plexing case that has come to my notice
since i recovered my sanity the time
pushem lost forty minutes on his run
and i was assigned to the task of dis-
covering and returning them was a kin-
dergarten proposition to the problem
that confronts me now

  he paused and filling his pipe with
a piece of oily waste he lit it then
baring his arm he vaccinated himself
with an ivory point

   i am doing this he said  to make
it difficult for me to catch anything i
hate to work on an easy job

   but what is this case that is baffling
you   i asked

   watchem he replied irritatedly
 how often have i told you that you
should be more perspicuous in your re-
marks i am not baffled i am never
baffled t may be perplexed but not
baffled perplexity is what gives zest to
mv art


the gold coupler	

   the only time i was baffled was
when i was run over and cut to pieces by
the night express then my skill in put-
ting jig-saw puzzles together stood me in
good stead and  was quickly on my
feet what baffled me was the fact that
people thought me cl dead one when i
was merely run down

   i received this coupling-pin in a let-
ter this morning even with my won-
derful power of perception which i have
cultivated with the latest approved pat-
terns of cultivators i might have over-
looked it had it not dropped from the
envelope and struck me on the pedal ex-
tremity had it struck me on the head
i would not have thought much but i
instantly reasoned that there was some-
thing on foot

  he opened a sub-cellarette and pour-
ing out a glass of benzin he tossed it
off neatly then striking a lucifer he
ignited his breath and his face was il-
lumined

   what is it   i gasped

   just a light luncheon he replied

  when he had finished his naphtha
lunch he picked up the coupling-pin and
gazed at it intently

   watchem he asked  do you notice
anything unusual about this coupling-
pin  

  i gazed at it quizzically

   nothing i replied  except that it
is a coupling-pin

   watchem he said  i cannot see
that the constant grind of domesticity
has sharpened your wits appreciably
cannot you see that it is made of gold

	 wonderful i ejaculated

   but why should any one send you a
gold coupling-pin i asked

   let us reason this thing out by de-
duction he replied

   had the sender wished me harm he
would have sent me a dynamite bomb or
a safety-razor the fact that he sent me
a coupling-pin can indicate but one thing
and that is that he wishes to couple up
with me you dont have to be links-eyed
to detect that but the motive we
must search that out what do you make
of it watchem  

   im afraid ill have to give it up
i ventured

  yes but i dont propose to he re-
plied  its not every day that some one

sends me a gold coupling-pin and i pro-
pose to keep it

   did the letter give no clue to the
sender i asked

   ah watchem he commented  you
are improving i had forgotten to read
it

  he rescued the letter from the waste-
basket where he had thrown it and
shutting his eyes he read it to me

  it ran as follows

  mr carlock bjones new york city

    n y

   dear mr bjones-i am enclosing
  you a sample of our new coupling-pin
  which i tam desirous of having adopted
  by the pole-to-pole railway knowing
  of your connection with the railway in
  question and having read of your ex-
  traordinary ability of fastening things
  upon those who are unwilling to have
  things fastened upon them i am send-
  ing you the enclosed as a retainer
  for your services in having your road
  adopt this pattern of pin the draft
  pins are made of the finest quality of
  graft steel while those which are in-
  tended for exerting a pull on the pur-
  chasing end are as you will notice manu-
  factured from eighteen karat graft gold

    i will he pleased to see you at my
  hunting-lodge in the arrowdondacks
  this evening when we can discuss de-
  tails very respectfully

                          e z graft

   there is more in this said carlock
than appears on the surface no man
has ever had to offer me a bribe twice
watchem we must make haste ere the
promoter of this useful device changes
his mind no man can make me such
an alluring proposition and escape

  watchem he hissed before the
clocks strike the hour of midnight i shall
have the signature of e z graft to one
of my non-breakable contracts come
we lose time but wait i have an
idea why should we consume time in
going to the arrowdondacks when it is
in my power to summon our quarry to

he rapped sharply upon the table two
or three times and then muffled himself
up in the raps which made him look like
a mahatma doing the esoteric i could
see his massive mind working behind his
impassive brow as he concentrated upon

was marvelous often have i seen him
wink ominously to the drug clerk

  his massive brows were knitting like

heard the moan of an emergency-brake at

  expectantly we waited the silence

doors clanged and the indicator inside

   thats me replied carlock  you
are in trouble really my dear sir you
should get married  then you could tell

your troubles to your wife without hav-
ing to come to me

  the portly party paled  how do
you know all these things he asked

  it is my business to know every-
thing replied carlock  i know you
are not married because nobody loves a
fat man i know you are in trouble be-
cause you own an automobile and i know
that your chauffeur has left you because
you used the emergency-brake in making
a social stop a chauffeur never uses a
brake of any kind he goes ahead and
breaks the machine by running into some-
thing

   marvelous  gasped the visitor  as
you know these things perhaps you can
tell me my name

   e z graft replied carlock

   you lose said the portly party  e
z graft was arrested this morning for
bribery

   then who are you  demanded car-

   that said he  is another story

tie farms for the pennsylvania

to plant over three million black locust and red oak trees for

                 future road-bed construction

since it has become apparent that the
timber supply is decreasing and with
ii the supply of suitable timber for rail-
road ties the large transportation companies
are taking steps which will ensure available
timber in the future

 the pennsylvania railroad company is
acting under the pressure of economic ne-
cessity the growing scarcity of railroad ties
and the increasing cost of those available
having pointed the necessity of making pro-
vision for the future

  this great undertaking calling for pro-
fessional skill of a high order a very con-
siderable outlay of land and capital and a
patient waiting for results is in line with
other similar forestry experiments by rail
roads in the united states but differs from

all of them in its magnitude it is contem-
plated to plant three and ahalf million trees
within a period of eight years

  unlike some of the railroad  tie-wood
plantations those of the pennsylvania are
not confined to the cultivation of the quick-
growing catalpa but give preference to
black locust and red oak and the effort
is not confined to the cultivation of suita-
ble timber but involves the study and eradi-
cation of insect enemies of different trees
and the perfection of wood preservative
processes

 altogether the work is a complex and
different one but if it results in securing
to the railroads a regular and adequate sup-
ply of the materia it will probably justify
the cost and trouble

special traveling correspondent of the railroad mans magazine

we are again down in dixie-lancl with mr willets through the
medium of the yarns that he spins here we encounter hairbreadth
escapes from death with the kuklux klan and we meet other
dangerous persons including that band of marauders known as the night
riders those outlaws seemed to hold a peculiar grudge against railroad
men and the stories that the boys have given our traveling correspondent
indicate that many a southern train-crew started out with its life in its hand
air willets has called these little stories dramas-and dramas they arc in the
truest sense of the word each one contains the elements of a stage play

no - more dramas of dixie land

the hobo and the ice-water-defying the night riders-the tobacco
war-one mans slaughter-k k hanging parties-zach
martins story-the stolen 

   you go away and ill come out an-
swered the man inside

  no ill stay right here white re-
torted

   you will will you called the man
inside the car and with thaj he let fly
at white-fired straight at the detective
who was standing within six feet of him

  white fell the hobo ran for his life
white was found seriously wounded by
earl smith of bristol

  white had once befriended smith in an
hour of need  and so when the young
man reached the station with his sorry
burden he said to the station-master

   i saw the tramp who did this job
and ill know him when i see him again

i	mean to find him-you just watch me
next morning smith-dressed now as
a hobo-took a train for bluff city ten-
nessee he believed that the man who
shot white would make his way down the
track to bluff city

        had not been in bristol ten-
nessee half an hour when a
detective-story was literally
thrust upon me nearly
every railroad man i met on
that queen and crescent trip
seemed bent upon pouring into my ears a
special officer story heres the one
i heard at bristol

  detective gene white of the south-
ern railway was standing on the plat-
form at the bristol station waiting for
the train for washington seeing a man
slouch past the station and down the
tracks white said to himself

   its porter wynn the hobo whats
lie up to now  

  white followed the man of the slouchy
gait-followed him through the bristol
yards till finally he saw the hobo climb
into an empty freight white walked up to
the door of the car and called

   come out of there 




the railroad mans magazine

  arriving at bluff city smith went to
the water-tank sat clown and waited

  surely enough the tramp came slouch-
ing down the track seeing one who ap-
peared to be of his own class he ac-
costed smith and the two engaged in
conversation for more than half an hour
till finally the tramp said

   wonder where i can get a drink of
water  

   at the station promptly replied
smith  come along ill show you the
water-cooler

  they entered the station and smith
led his prey to the cooler and bade him
drink as the tramp lifted the cup to
his mouth smith suddenly cried

   drop that and throw up your hands
porter wynn 

  wynn looked up to find that he was
staring into the wrong end of a big gun

   sit down ordered smith

in custody

  wynn sat and his captor relieved him
of his gun and kept him covered till ail
east-bound freight came along on which
smith convoyed his captive back to bris-
tol

  after turning his prisoner over to the
authorities smith went to the hospital
where detective white lay suffering

  smith told him what he had done

   youre a born special officer groaned
white  the southern railway will
need you-when you grow up

  the explanation of  when you grow
up  is that the young man who disguised
himself as a hobo and went down intu-
itively to the place where he believed the
man who nearly killedhis friend would
appear was barely sixteen years of age

  bristol railroad men assured me that
the southern railway really intends to
employ earl smith as a detective  when
he grows up and as earl smith is now
nearing the age of twenty-one he hasnt
much longer to wait for the promised job

defying the night riders

  at both knoxville and chattanooga
railroad men related stories of uncom- 
fortable and even fatal experiences of
train-crews with the famous raiders of
the south-the night riders

  at knoxville engineer hawley of
the southern railway told me of an ex-
perience of a friend of his-engineer
buck thorn-commonly called  buck-
thorn --with night riders at russell-
ville kentucky

  it was on a night in january buck-
thorn was pulling a louisville and nash-
ville passenger-train slowly into russell-
ville when suddenly he saw a big blaze
rising from the middle of the town

  its the night riders he cried to

his fireman  theyre burning the to-
bacco warehouses here 

  how do you know the fireman
asked

   instinct answered the engineer
 the town is asleep blow the whistle
on the track ahead buckthorn and his
fireman beheld a band of men wearing
black masks some carried rifles others
lanterns which they waved as a com-
mand for buckthorn to halt his train
buckthorn brought his train to a stop
and while the masked men swarmed
around the engine the leader cried

  you there-in the cab youre
buckthorn are you not

   yes came the answer

   do you want to be alive to-morrow
night this time 

    certainly do
ten thousand miles by rail



    then dont you blow that whistle or
warn the town in any other way of what
you see happening to the warehouses
you may proceed

  buckthorn proceeded but the mo-
ment the train entered the town limits
he began with daredevil courage blow-
ing the whistle

  one prolonged shriek-a screech of
alarm that lasted during the time con-
sumed by his train in passing through the
town

   past the station he flew knowing that
if he pulled down his life would not be
worth a penny if there were any pas-
sengers on the train who wanted to get
off at russellville they were carried by

the torch applied

   the shriek of that locomotive-whistle
awoke the town the citizens rushed to
the rescue of the burning warehouses

  the l and n road foreman of en-
gines advised buckthorn the next day to
lay off for at least two weeks and stay in
hiding the engineer did so for two days
and then reported for duty

    im going to make my run he said
 and to the winds with the riders 

   he and his fireman carried rifles as
well as revolvers for a month after that

but they never had a chance to use them
buck thorn is alive and well to-day

the tobacco war hero

  at chattanooga a trainman of the
southern railway james riley known
on the line as  little jim told me of
the experience of two employees of the
louisville and nashville during a raid of
the night riders at hopkinsville ken-
tucky

  peter morgan was the watchman at
the hopkinsville depot the hour was
midnight and seemingly the only per-
son awake in the whole place was this
same peter morgan it was his duty to
watch not only the passenger-station but
also the freight-house where much tobac-
co was-stored

  while morgan paced up and down
outside the passenger-depot six men
wearing black masks suddenly loomed up
in front of him seized him and before
he could cry out an alarm tied a piece of
tobacco-bagging over his mouth they
threw him  the ground and bound him
hand and foot

  one of the men then sat down beside
him with a shotgun across his knee he
did not speak a word

  morgan knew that the night riders
had come

   as if rising out of the earth scores and
scores of masked men appeared at the sta-
tion the helpless watchman estimating
that they numbered at least two hun-
dred the station door was forced open
and they filed in

  morgan was carried in and laid on the
floor while the night riders maintained
absolute silence

  the leader appeared and parceled his
men in squads numbering from six to
twenty then all filed out again only
the bound watchman and his silent guard
with the shotgun across his knees were
left

in the mouth of death

  five minutes later the sky was illu-
minded by a mighty blaze the tobacco-
warehouses were afire morgan heard
shots and the cries and curses of men and
groans of women

  	happened that a stain of cars loaded


the railroad mans magazine

  with tobacco stood near the station to
this train some of the raiders applied a
torch and then went to help their com-
rades at the warehouses

  silas lyman an l and n trainman
who happened to be laying over in hop-
kinsville that night while making his
way down to the station saw the raiders
set fire to the train-load of tobacco ly-
man hid behind a tree till the torchmen
ran off toward the town

 by jove exclaimed lyman i
think i can save that end car

  he dashed to the train sprang in be-
tween the two last cars and uncoupled
them

   shes loose he told himself  but
how am i to move her i need something
i can use as a lever

the burning train

  he thought a moment and remem-
bered a tool-box near by running to the
box he found that the section-men for-
tunately had left several tools lying on
the ground among them a crowbar used
for moving rails

  leyman seized this and ran back to the
burning tobacco train

  to his joy he found that the flames
had not yet reached the end car using
the crowbar as a lever he got the car into
motion when-piitg ping

  lyman fell in his tracks wounded

  thus silas lyman l and n train-
man became one of the heroes of the
tobacco war at the time he was not
on duty in the voluntary act of trying
to save property entrusted to the railroad
from which he derived his daily bread
he nearly lost his life

  he suffered foi months from the al-
most fatal bullets without one warn-
ing word he had been shot down by
members of the latter-day kuklux klan

   oh yes tennessee and kentucky
are peaceful states these days added
the chattanooga trainman  and gogia
is sometimes just as peaceful-in another
way if you want to hear the gogia
end of the business from a railroad mans
view-point you go over to chickamauga
and see old jake wylie hes a retired
gainesville midland railroader and hell
tell you all about the peaceful times in
his state

  	actecl on the trainmans tip

  one day in august  a train of
the gainesville midland railway began
pulling away from its terminal at
monroe georgia bound for belmont a
run ill thirtv-two miles the conductor
in passing through the jim crow car
overheard one of the passengers say

 ah aint got no ticket but ahm
goin to ride to belmont just the same
the conductor promptly pulled the
signal-cord and after a long argument
the y-ain went on minus the negro

  later in the day that same negro ap-
peared at a general store in monroe and
asked for some buck-shot- the absent-
minded clerk gave him instead some
bird-shot that mistake probably saved
the lives of -a number of railroad men as
well as the lives of over a score of
citizens of monroe

  the following morning the manager
of the western union office in the depot
sam stannard came rushing into the
office of train despatcher joe thomp-
son crying

   dye hear those shots up street
  yes whats up a war

   a railroad man has been shot and
-youve got iico guns havent you
joe give me one of em you take
the other now come along to the
front

  the train despatcher and the telegraph
man rushed up the main street when
suddenly joe thompson staggered and
fell peppered with bird-shot

  the report of a gun had come from
somewhere in the arcade of the bank of
monroe toward that place sam stan-
nard started

   wait a moment stannard  cried a
man running up and joining the teleg-
rapher  ill go with you its that
negro  bully  wade

like a battle-field

  the newcomer was dr forsythe the
mayor of monroe he had hardly
spoken the name  bully  wade when
down he went too wounded in the leg

  stannard now looked around be-
wildered all over the street lay men
wounded as on a battle-field

  stannard saw steve burke one of the
railroad telegraphers running toward
r

ten thousand miles by rail



him-when down went burke with a
wound in the head

  then along came roy fisher one of
the call-boys of the g m r r he
too fell before the negros gun

  joe kendall the trainmaster next fell
with a volley in his breast

  ed strong cashier of the southern
express company and tack marryman
the southern express agent at the depot
were the next victims

  besides these railroad men some
twenty citizens of the town were laid
low by the double-barreled shotgun in
the hands of  bully  wade

  some ones got to kill that man
said stannard with a glance at the
prostrate forms of his friends and co-
workers   guess its up to me

  with that he walked deliberately up to
the enemy but not while the enemy was
reloading his gun-no but just as the
enemy pointed his gun at the telegraph
man and pulled the trigger

  bird-shot whistled all round stannard
but still he advanced on the enemy till
he looked straight into his eyes

   bully  wade iired his last shot-at
stannard

  a second later the enemy was no more

  president baldwin at savannah and
general ianager eppes and general
freight and passenger agent veazey at
athens each received this message

 depot and yard force here nearly all

out of commission as the result of a

  battle in which twenty-nine white men

  were wounded and one negro killed

  send twelve men and trained nurses

   who killed the enemy  asked train
despatcher joe thompson some days
later when stannard visited him at his
bedside

   dont know replied stannard
 the station-master and the baggage-
man and the station-porter and the yard-
master and two trainmen and a con-
ductor and one or two engineers and
about three section-hands and yours
trulv all fired at the same time-i
think

kuklux hanging parties

  engineer  hen  rust and conductor
sullivan were in charge of a night
passenger-train out of decatur alabama
on the run through the tennessee bot-
toms up to nashville

  their  command  consisted of three
trainmen who worked the hand-brakes
whenever  hen  rust called for a stop
for some unaccountable reason their
train was extremely popular with certain
citizens who had the misfortune to be
regarded as undesirable by the kuklux
klan

  it was on the old nashville and
decatur railroad connecting at the
alabama town with the southern rail-
way and at the tennessee town with the
tennessee central

  the train left decatur at  pm and
arrived at nashville at  am return-
ing the next night rust and sullivans
train was stopped in the tennessee bot-

one of the men sat down with a shotgun across his knee


the railroad mans magazine

toms somewhere about midnight about
every third night by men shrouded in
white-cotton sheets with slits for eye-
holes these white apparitions rust
and sullivan called the  ghosts of the
rail

  the ghostly ones would stop the train
by waving firebrands across the track
then they would take one of the un-
desirables from the train lead him off
the right-of-way to the nearest cedar-
tree and order the train crew to come
along and witness the proceedings

  after attending about a dozen of these
nocturnal hanging parties rust and
sullivan and their crew were unanimous
in agreeing that the thing had become
monotonous and that the next time the
white-robed executioners appeared and
ordered out the train-crew to witness a
hanging to a man they would decline
the invitation

  meantime conductor sullivan in the
opinion of the k ks had joined the
undesirable class sullivans crime being
that he had told with harrowing details
stories of the hangings he had witnessed
and in particular how he had seen three
bodies swinging on one cedar

  then came the night when sullivan
and rust and their three minions of the
brake-wheels were to  strike  when
ordered to come forward and watch a
swinging

  it was some time after midnight-the
usual time the train was running
through the tennessee bottoms-the
usual place once again rust beheld the
 ghosts of the rails  waving firebrands
across his track to avoid a fusillade of
shots he whistled for brakes

the meeting called

 immediately the train was surrounded
by k ks the engineer knew that
some undesirable was being carried off
the train a voice beside his cab said

   reckon you want to witness this yere
meetin out of justice partner

  no i dont answered rust not so
much as turning his face to the speaker

   yes you do partner insisted the
man beside the cab  you-want to at-
tend this meetin mighty bad now
youre a handsome cuss-and id like
to take a look at your face turn round

  rust swung round to find himself
looking into the muzzle of a rifle

   youre powerful interested in this
meetin partner said the white-sheeted
man behind the winchester  get
down and come right along

   no protested rust  ill stay
here you dont need me ill take
your word for the meeting me and my
conductor and my crew dont want to
attend no more meetings of yours we
are tired of them were staying on the
train to-night

   youre mistaken partner your
train-crew is on hand all of em espe-
cially your conductor come on now or
well take you anyway

  the upshot of this matter was that
 hen  rust left his cab and proceeded
in the company of the k ks to the
usual spot chosen for the nights hanging

and there was sullivan

  what was his amazement when he ar-
rived at the cedar-tree to find that the
central figure of the entertainment was
none other than conductor sullivan

  there stood sullivan surrounded by
the sheeted k ks with a lariat around
his neck and his eyes staring upward
along the lariat to where it was thrown
over a stout limb

   youre not goin to swing sullivan 
cried rust  whats he done 

   hes been spraddlin information
around decatur and nashville said one
of the k ks  which is some agin
the code of honor upon which we-all
have from time to time duly invited him
to attend these yere meetins but look
here rust what we-all is goin to pro-
pose now is to give this conductor just
one more chance to live he must prom-
ise and you must promise and your crew
must promise that this sullivan man will
hereafter for all time go away from this
region and never come back

  oh is that all you want cried
rust gleefully- all right take that
rope off sullivan we promise liell
never run again through these bottoms

  sullivan was released and the train-
men abandoned t hat run

  at the station at montgomery ala-
bama i found a tremendous crowd of
outgoing passengers
ten thousand miles by rail



    is this a usual crowd i asked the
conductor

   its a usual saturday crowd sir
he replied

   but why saturday  i asked

   excursion rate-round trip
for a one-way fare sir we call
them saturday - sunday excur-
sions because the tickets sold at
that rate are good saturday to
monday-over to atlanta or up
to birmingham and chattanoo-
ga or down to mobile and new
orleans my names frobeck

k 

ager named cecil gabbett the three
of them plus the catamount started the
week-end excursions which are now so
popular throughout the south

  	it was on the atlanta and west

he walked deliberately up to the enemy-

but not while the enemy was
reloading his gun

  thus began an acquaintance which led
to yarn-spinning on frobecks part in
the course of which he said

cats and cats

  tell you what started these satur-
day-sunday excursions sir it was a
cat

 cat

   yes sir a dead cat a cat about
five feet long sir a catamount be-
sides the cat there was an engineer
named jack me waters and a conductor
named zacli martin ami a general man-

point railroad frobeck continued
 the engineer and conductor whom ive
just named were running a train up to
atlanta from montgomery at gab-
bettville when the train stopped a man
stepped up to mcwaters and offered him
a dead catamount which he himself had
just killed-saying the engineer could
have the carcass for two bits

   just for fun mcwaters bought the
cat and tied it by the tail to the bumper
of his engine with the body spraddling
down the pilot

   at every station all the way to at-
lanta crowds gathered round the engine


the railroad mans magazine

and asked mcwaters no end of questions
about the catamount

   now hitched to the end of that train
was the private car of the general man-
ager cecil gahbett after five or six
stations had been passed with crowds
swarming arrund the engine at each
place the g m called for the conduc-
tor zach martin to come to his car

   the g m asked him what all the
fuss was about zach told him about the
catamount and then added

    there are lots of folks in these
crowds who would like to spend sunday
in atlanta but they complain that the
fare is too high they cant afford it
  why not make a special saturday-
sunday excursion rate  suddenly ex-
claimed general manager gabbett

  yes replied martin take em
up to atlanta and back for the price of
a one-way ticket-and youll get em in
droves

   and the thing was done conduc-
tor frobeck said in conclusion

the southern pacific

  from espee men in los angeles i
gathered the facts of a remarkable case
of railroad sleuthing that might be en-
titled a railroads human blood-
hounds or the deep dark secret of
fifty thousand dollars

  a train over the new brownsville rail-
road of the texas gulf coast pulled
into the brownsville station a minute
later fireman charles beeler fell in a
faint on the floor of the cab members
of the train crew lifted the fireman out
of the cab and laid him on the ground
presently he regained consciousness and
his first words were

   im going to die boys because ive
nothing more to live for

  to no one did he explain why he had
 nothing more to live for but all could
see that fireman beeler was a very sick
man though not so far gone but that he
felt he could stand the journey back to
houston-which he did soon after ar-
riving at houston however the railroad
men lost all track of him

what had become of charley beeler
in a shack on the outskirts of hous-
ton a light appeared those living in
the neighborhood had not seen a light in

that shack for two years in all that
time it had been unoccupied

  toward that light now on the night
in question a man unknown to the neigh-
borhood made his way stealthily till he
reached the door of the shack then
suddenly he shoved the door open en-
tered and found a man lying on the
floor

   i want to talk to you beeler said
the visitor

   im perfectly willing to talk an-
swered the man on the floor in a weak
voice

rust swung around to find himself look-
ing into the muzzle of a rifle

  you know me asked the new-
comer

   yes youre anderson one of the
espees bloodhounds i know that you
and others have been watching me for
five whole years but the games ended
cap im all in i crawled in here to
die

   then  reckon youre ready now to
tell where you hid that money

   i am replied beeler  ill tell you
the whole story and when ive finished
ten thousand miles by rail



you espee bloodhounds will quit my
trail and leave me to die in peace cause
youre goin to believe my story

  beeler related a tale as thrilling as a
melodrama it was as nearly as the
espee men in new orleans could re-
member as follows

  one evening in the spring of  the
money-clerk of wells fargo  com-
pany at san antonio texas left the
office and went home to supper at the
finish of the meal the clerks pretty wife
anna said

   charley take me to the show to-
night will you

  charley said  you bet  after sup-
per the wife dressed herself in her very
best

   but it isnt much of a gown is it
she said then added that she wished
she had at least one pretty frock such as
one of those worn by the managers
wife-meaning the local manager of
wells fargo

  now charley beeler-for that was the
clerks name-loved his wife deeply and
wanted to please her

  that night she broached the very sub-
ject which for a long time had been one
of beelers manias namely that such a
fine-looking young woman should have
fine clothes

the promise

   hang it all  he exclaimed  you
shall have as fine a dress as any woman
in san antonio ill get it for you some-
how

   how  asked the wife

   ill earn it of course

   good   she exclaimed happily

  on the way to the theater charley
beeler was so absent-minded that he
failed to hear remarks his wife addressed
to him

   what are you thinking about she
asked  that you make me repeat every-
thing i say before you answer

   im thinking of your new dress
charley replied

  at the theater he bought two of the
best seats took his wife in seated her
then suddenly said

   ill have to leave you alone a while
i must do an errand down at the espee
station ill be back in time for the
second act

  next morning railroad and express
circles in san antonio were agitated by
the news that a package of money con-
taining  shipped over the south-
ern pacific in care of wells fargo 
company from new orleans had van-
ished from the car in which it arrived
at the espee station at san antonio

  during the morning young mrs beel-
er rushed into the wells fargo office
crying

   what has become of my husband
he left me at the theater last night say-
ing he would return in time for the sec-
ond act but i have not seen him since 

on the hunt

  an espee detective jack williams
happened to be in the express office at
the time and overheard the lamentations
of the money-clerks pretty wife wil-
liams had already been assigned to run
down that  learning that beeler
had disappeared the detective at once
left the express office and proceeded to
wire up and down the espee line all the
way out to el paso and all the way down
to new orleans warning all to look out
for a young man with close-cropped
hair age twenty-four tall slim black
mustache black eyes good-looking and
fairly well-educated

  before nightfall word came to wil-
liams in san antonio that beeler had
been seen in uvalde a town about half-
way between san antonio and spofford
straightway some half a dozen officers
in the employ of the espee and wells
fargo headed by williams rode spe-
cial  west to uvalde

  there they found that beeler had
struck the trail into the trackless desert
of south texas evidently bound for the
mexican border beeler had hired a wag-
	the railroad mans magazine

charley take me to the show to-night

on in uvalde from his wifes brother-
the only undertaker in town this fur-
nished the necessary clue

  hiring ponies and taking a supply of
provisions the sleuths rode forth on
beelers trail following the wagon-tracks

  down toward the rio grande the trail
led until they found the wagon aban-
doned but no beeler and no fifty thou-

mexican rural police in
the chase and once when
they struck a river they
bought a boat outright and
then returned it to the seller
this in order to get quickly
across

  after weeks of such work
 suffering hardship exposure
 and starvation beeler was
 caught he was found in a
 thicket in a region of mexico
 where few white men had
 ever been the fugitive was
 found fast asleep while he
 still slept the sleuths hand-
 cuffed him

  without waiting for the
 formalities o f extradition
 detecthe williams and his
 comrades marched beeler
 back to the rio grande
 across into texas and up to
 san antonio where the
 young man confessed to hav-
 ing taken the money

  he refused however to
 tell where he had hidden it
 he was sentenced to seven
 years on a texas penal farm

   my wife anna   beeler
 cried as he was led away to
 serve his sentence  how is
 it  have not seen her 

  the sleuths had purposely kept the
heart-broken wife away from beeler so
now when the prisoner asked for her for
the hundredth time williams replied

    your wife is dead

beeler staggered seemed on the verge
of swooning when the detective added
 and since she is dead the money
wont be much good to you you took

sand one of the horses had been aban- the money in order to buy pretty dresses

doned too beeler evidently having
mounted the other

  again southward the trail led till the
sleuths lost it entirely then they spread
out in a big semicircle picked up the
trail advanced to the rio grande and
across it and into mexico

  through the north mexican wilder-
ness and over the santa rosa moun-
tains the sleuths kept up the pursuit
having plenty of money they bought
fresh ponies as soon as those they rode
were worn out they employed rurales

for her didnt you well shes beyond
needing dresses now

out on the penal farm

but the trick didnt work instead of
weakening under this sweating process
the prisoner cried

 you lie shes alive shes too young
to die ill tell you nothing about the
money 

he went to the penal farm about
once a year regularly for seven years
ten thousand miles by rail



either williams- or some other espee or
wells fargo detective would show up at
the farm and endeavor to get beeler to
betray the hiding-place of the cash but
each tinlct the detective was defeated

  in the last year of beelers term at the
penal farm an epidemic struck the camp
and many of the convicts died each
night the prisoners buried their own
dead or prepared the bodies of departed
comrades for shipment to relatives in
various places

  one night beeler was put to work
preparing a certain body for shipment to
uvalde texas that being the dead con-
victs home in one of the dead mans
pockets beeler came across a little slip of
paper and a small bit of lead pencil of
a sudden then solely on impulse beeler
wrote a few words addressed to the only
undertaker at uvalde-his wifes brother

  he slipped the paper into one of the
dead convicts socks to beelers joy
the corpse was carried out of the camp
without inspection

  a few months later beeler was re-
leased he hastened to san antonio in
search of his wife only to find that she
had left the city years before saying
that she was going to her brother at
uvalde

  beeler journeyed on to uvalde but no
one there knew of the whereabouts of

his wife- to his further dismay he
found that the undertaker his wifes
brother had disappeared one week after
receiving the corpse of the convict from
the penal farm

  in frantic haste beeler then started
for the uvalde station of the espee the
station was some distance from the town
and before he reached his destination
beeler found that he was being followed
he even recognized his follower-de-
tective anderson of the espee

  instead of going to the railroad sta-
tion beeler went back to the town an-
derson was watching him closely

  after hiding for three days in a sa-
loon he succeeded in the middle of the
night in getting away unobserved as he
supposed by the relentless bloodhound

  beeler hastened then to the railroad sta-
tion crawled underneath the building
dug into the earth with his bare hands
and finally uttered an agonized cry

   come out of there beeler sudden-
ly cried a voice  what are you do-
ing 

  beeler panting and dripping with
perspiration came from under the station
to confront the omnipresent anderson

   so thats where you hid the money is
it said the sleuth

   no it isnt answered beeler  look
for yourself

the uext day beeler learned that his
brother-in-law had been seen down in the
brownsville region and forthwith he be-
gan a five-year search for that under-
taker

he managed to work his way down to
brownsville being employed part of the
time as a cowboy finally when the
railroad began building through he se-
cured a job as fireman  the engine of
a construction-train when the road be-

 so thats where you hid the money 


the railroad mans magazine

gan running freight-trains he was given
a regular run as fireman

  night and day he was on the lookout
for his brother-in-law and night and day
lie was watched by the railroad detectives
until finally the day when he fainted in
the cab as described at the beginning of
this story and then traveled up to hous-
ton and crawled to the empty shack only
to be confronted once more by anderson

  what did i write on that paper
beeler now said to the detective in telling
his story  i wrote down the hiding-
place of the fifty thousand dollars i
knew my brother-in-law being the only
undertaker in uvalde would find it when
he prepared the body for burial

   i wrote that if he would go to the
hiding-place and get the money he could
keep twenty-five thousand dollars as his
share in payment for holdingthe remain-
ing half of the money safe for me until i
came for it but he made away with the
whole fifty thousand dollars and for
five years ive been searching for him
meaning to kill him on sight

  and the hiding-place the detec-
tive asked  where was it

   under the depot at uvalde of course

you found me there at themomenti dis-
covered that the money as well as the
undertaker had disappeared you believe
me do you not

   i do beeler said the detective
 and now i want you to believe me too
your wife is dead

   yes i knew it answered beeler
v thats what made me faint in the cab
of the locomotive just before i fainted
i overheard some passengers talking at
the station i heard one of them say

    and anna - anna beeler - shes
gone too-died of a broken heart

   but good-bv cap added beeler
 youll leave me to die in peace 

   yes

   and call off all the other detectives 
   yes

  as anderson started to leave the shack
beelers eyes brightened and he said-

   say cap ive got just one happy
thought i keep thinking of that just
nothing but that all the time it is-that
i did it all for the woman i loved pret-
ty sooncap ill see her and then-
anderson the espees human blood-
hound had closed the shack door very
softly on the dead

the fastest thing on wheels

this title now rightfully belongs to the
automobile we are told by a writer
in the engineering record motor-driven
vehicles of all kinds including steam and
electric locomotives are now led in the
race for speed-records by the rubber-tired
car that has no rails at all to run on says
the paper just named

   it is casually worth noting that the auto-
mobile speed record which has remained
for four years at a rate of  miles per
hour over the measured mile has again
been raised this time by a gasoline auto-
mobile of  rated horse-povver the
figure touched is  miles per hour the
measured mile being covered in  sec-
onds

   this puts the locomotive record of 
miles per hour quite in the shade and passes
even the top speed obtained in the zossen
electric-locomotive tests of  thus the
general speed-record passes into the hands
of ihe automobile in spite of the fact that

it does not have the-advantage of a smooth
track on which to run

   the long-threatened increase in rail-
way speeds to sensational figures is yet far
from coming to pass and the one hundred-
mile-an-hour train seriously projected near-
ly twenty years ago is still in the dim dis-
tance the stern chase of the automobile
is likely to be as usual a long chase these
transcendental speeds are perhaps likely to
be long in coming as a matter of common
transportation but every raising of the
record ought to be a stimulus toward faster
trains in those cases where speed really be-
comes of practical importance the me-
chanical possibilities are still very far
ahead of practise and the fundamental ques-
tion has become merely one of commercial
desirability

ferred to by the engineering record was

             moral suasion  was all right for children -
             but it would not go with a bull terrier

feptimus boglip was a
salesman by profession and a
humanitarian by instinct the
 first of these necessitated his
presence from  am till 
pm in a big new york whole-
sale store the second resulted
in the shaping of a portion of the do-
mestic policy of his new rochelle home
on what he believed to be ideal lines

  being a man of family he had plenty
of opportunities to put his pet theory
into practise which was that under no
circumstances should a child be made to
feel the shingle the slipper or the rod

   moral suasion sir is the only thing
that a youngster needs in the way of di-
rection or discipline mr boglip would
declare to the individual who wasnt of
his way of thinking  the man who lifts
his hand against a child brutalizes him-
self and the helpless victim of his bar-
barity at one and the same time spare
the rod sir and you spare the child the
suffering and humiliation which you have
no right to inflict upon it

  so mounted on his hobby lie would
follow a dozen different trails of argu-
ment all of which led to the justifica-
tion of his beliefs whether he succeed-
ed in convincing his auditor was a
matter of which he took little account
for like a good many people of fixed
opinions mr boglip had more desire to
give tongue to the latter than to convert
others to his way of thinking

  now it wasnt that mrs boglip be-
lieved that the indiscriminate infliction
of physical pain on her children did them
good but she did hold that a parent had
the right to keep the rod as a sort of
court of last resort

  she also held that the knowledge of
that fact  the part of the youngsters
invested the father or mother with a re-
spect that would otherwise be lacking

  luckily though the quartette of bog-
lip children were as a rule mightily
well-behaved as children go and the
occasion was rare indeed when the ideas
of mr and mrs boglip came into col-
lision in regard to punishment

  this was fortunate perhaps for mr
boglip for he was a little man who had
followed the marital instincts of most
little men - he married a woman who
weighed a third more than he did and
who towered three inches above him

  had mrs- b chosen to back her be-
liefs with her personality there would
have been no doubt as to the outcome

  but two things militated against her
enforcing her methods with her muscles
the first was that like most big people
she was good-nature personified the sec-
ond the boglip dog-kennel which calls
for explanation

  the boglips were no exception to their
neighbors in the matter of dogs nearly
every resident for miles around had a
kennel

  at one end of the lawn of the boglip
home was a strip of ground enclosed by
wire netting inside were three kennels
in one of which lived mrs boglips fat
and wheezy irish water spaniel while
another was given over to an airedale
terrier with a rather malformed right ear

  this dog had been given to boglip by
a generous friend who bred the animals
and had no use for those which were not
physically perfect

  the third kennel was devoted to a
couple of nondescripts the special prop-


the railroad mans magazine

ertv and delight of the boglip children
who always called them  mutts like
most dogs of mixed ancestors and no
pedigree they were jolly alert and in-
telligent much more so indeed than
their somewhat blooded confreres

  the space in front of and around the
kennels was liberal sanded and formed a
capital exercise and romping ground for
the canines access was obtained by a
gate in the wire fence the key to the lock
whereof being in the boglip kitchen out
of reach of the boglip youngsters

  now there was one remarkable and
peculiar connection between the boglip
children and the boglip dogs mr bog-
lip was not always logical in the observ-
ance of his set views on punishment he
began to find that the children-ephraim
elihu sarah and ruth whom he had
lovingly named for biblical persons-
were growing more unmanageable with
their years

  like all youngsters they were in mis-
chief from morning till night and when
father came home in the evening mother
would tell him how they had nearly
driven her mad and father in order to
get even and uphold his theories so far
as possible took a whip hiked to the
kennels and  took it out on the dogs

  they yelped blue murder while the
boglip four looked on in delight and in-
wardly praised their fathers method of
administering punishment to them mrs
boglip called him a fool and criticized
his behavior and she warned him sound-
ly never to touch wallv the wheezy dog

  one evening mr boglip reached his
home in bad humor on this particular
day everything had gone wrong he had
missed trains going and coming and as
most people should know this when it
happens to a commuter is looked upon
as both misfortune and disgrace

  one of his biggest western customers
hadnt shown up as per promise and an-
other had bought much less than usual
mr boglip had also smashed a couple of
valuable samples which were charged
to his commission account

  he had been  called down  by one
of hi chiefs in regard to his alleged fail-
ure to push a line of american goods
and to crown it all when in a subway
car on his way to the grand central
depot a large and aggressive lady of

gaelic extraction had spoken of him as
a half-boiled shrimp just because he
had accidentally trodden on her toes

  mrs boglip also had had a trying
day of it herself what with the un-
heralded flitting of her colored help a
bedroom ceiling that for no apparent
cause whatever had descended on clean
tidies and spreads a kitchen range which
had sulked for hours and then became so
furiously industrious that it reduced most
of the dinner to cinders neighbors who
called at ungodly times stayed unreason-
ably long and said unkind things about
people whom mrs boglip liked a dis-
pute with the laundry over missing arti-
cles and lastly the children

  the children dressed their faces shiny
with washing were waiting in their play-
room for the call to their returning pa
they were accustomed to have their sup-
per after the grown-ups and in the in-
terval hatched schemes of mischief for
the morrow

  mr boglip entered his home with
nasty little flying pains playing over his
forehead betokening a neuralgic head-
ache his nerves were raw and his tem-
per likewise and mrs boglip as she
placed the chops on the table began to
tell of the vagaries of the stove and the
desertion of jennie the colored cook

  in his heart mr boglip felt rather
glad for an outlet for his depression
naturally he didnt say so he did re-
mark raspingly something to the effect
that if mrs boglip was incapable of
managing either a range or a servant it
would be cheaper for them to go board-
ing than to continue the farce of house-
keeping

  -ie knew that his wife hated a board-
ing-house with a whole-souled hatred
and that as a matter of fact she was an
excellent manager and housewife

  mrs boglip paused in helping the
chops looked down-literally doivn-
upon her small spouse opened her mouth
to speak closed it again and once more
plunged her fork into the meat she
selected two of the best chops with elab-
orate care matched each with the meal-
iest of potatoes and handed the plate to
her husband without a word

  mr boglip took the plate with a dem-
onstration of contempt and martyrdom
that didnt escape the notice or allay the
boglips canine- party



exasperation of mrs boglip but she
continued to keep her lips closed mr
boglip munched discontentedly for a few
moments and then after assuring him-
self that it wasnt on the table demanded
tomato sauce

   there isnt any said mrs boglip
somewhat sharply  ive already told
you that it was only at the last moment
that i found that the dinner which i had
really cooked was spoiled so i had to
get the chops all of a hurry consequent-
ly there wasnt time for tomato sauce
or-or anything else

  mr boglip noted with relish the lame
termination of mrs boglips explanation
and determined to rub it in  well he
began this finishes me if you cant
keep house better than-

  the sentence was never ended mrs
boglip arose in her wrath and towering
over the little man wagged a compelling
right hand at him

   that will do septimus boglip she
said  i say that that will do dont
you go talking about my housekeeping
when those children of yours are making
a laughing stock of you and me because
of your fool ideas about their training
i give you fair warning septimus that
the next time the children need a whip-
ping theyll get it and get it good from
me 

  mr boglip tried to interrupt but
failed mrs boglip silencing him with a
gesture that seemed to imply that he
simply wasnt to be heard from till she
had had her say so she went on

   you are grumbling because for once
in your life youve had to eat chops in-
stead of roast chicken  poor fellow poor
starved fellow how my heart goes out
to you but as between unexpected
chops and four children filled with the
very old mischief-what 

  mrs boglip jerked out the last word
of her sentence with a force and sud-
denness that startled mr boglip into
swallowing quite a large lump of prac-
tically unchewed mutton and he knew
that he was in for an attack of indiges-
tion again he tried to speak but mrs
boglip prevented

    the first thing this morning -and just
after you had left continued the now
thoroughly aroused wife  ephraim
while chasing elihu through the front

parlor tripped and fell against that pret-
ty vase you gave me on my birthday i-

i-wouldnt have had that broken for
anything 

  here mrs boglip sniffed deliberately
and with feminine unreasonableness
arose walked around the table kissed her
husband on the forehead and ignoring
his attempt to explain excuse or dissem-
ble returned to her place and continued
 next thing three of them managed
to get little ruth into one of the apple-
trees and wouldnt take her down she
was crying as if her heart would break
the pretty dear when i went to her help

   and in the meantime sarah and
ephraim had managed to stick leaves all
over the cat with that library paste you
brought home the other night and the
poor frightened creature no knowing
what it was doing ran up the parlor cur-
tains and then jumped clean from the
pole to the mantelpiece smashing the
vase that aunt ellen gave us last christ-
mas as well as two of the-

  mr boglip rose suddenly gurgled vio-
lently and reseated himself suddenly as
mrs boglip eyed him sternly

   as i was saying the cat broke two
crystal ornaments on the candelabra that
you value so much because somebody be-
longing to you brought it from england
-at least you say they did-though for
the life of me i cant see why that
should make it any more valuable im
sure that any day in the week i can buy
prettier and cheaper things at any of
the big stores in new york

  mr boglip held up his hand in feeble
protest while he managed to change the
direction he didnt interfere with the
strength of the current of his wifes elo-
quence like a good many other nor-
mally quiet souls mrs boglip once
aroused was difficult to quell

   then relentlessly continued the
wife  i had but barely cleaned up the
mess and cleaned off the cat when bang
crush went something-in your den 
mr boglip dropped his knife and
fork and forgetful of chops or com-
mands snorted sepulchrallv what was
it

   well said mrs boglip after a
brief pause  i almost hate to tell you
not that i am afraid that you will pun-
ish the children but for your own sake


the railroad mans magazine

   go on replied boglip resignedly
 i spose the cat didnt murder the can-
ary or try to elope with-the chops

   i said that the noise came from your
den-not from the parlor or the ice-box
answered mrs boglip coldly  any-
how i ran up-stairs and there i found-
 but youll have another potato wont
you septimus she asked anxiously

  go on shouted mr boglip lick-
ing a pair of dry lips

   well resumed mrs boglip sighing
heavily but not without certain enjoy-
ment  as i got near the head of the
stairs the children came out of your
den giggling septimus giggling mind
you i asked them what they had been
doing  fishing explained ephraim
smashing things added sarah  gee 
said elihir  aint it a good thing we aint
got a dad like mr joplin if we had
wecl get it good and plenty to-night
and then all three of them laughed up-
roariously

  mr boglip moved uneasily in his
chair where was ruth all this time
he asked in default of something better
to say

   ill come to that presently said
mrs boglip  well i went into your
den and of all the messes your  moral
suasion  dear hadnt stopped your chil-
dren from fishing in the aquarium 
mr boglip jumped with surprise and
horror the aquarium with its swim-
ming and crawling tenants was another
of his hobbies and the children had
been taught to hold it as a sacred thing

   yes resumed mrs boglip with
unction  they had bent pins into fishing-
hooks had gotten thread out of my work
basket and were using fish-food for bait
no wonder that the poor things-the fish
i mean-had bitten freely and were-
 what  shouted mr boglip

   as i entered the room replied mrs
boglip  ruth-ruth mind you-was
holding that double-tailed goldfish that
you were so proud of trying to pull a
bent pin out of his jaw

   but that was nothing to the rest of
what i saw on the carpet were lying
nearly every fish that had lived in the
aquarium its astonishing the number
of scales thatll come off one little fish
and how those scales will spread and
stick it took me over an hour to-

    well thats all right broke in mr
boglip testily  get back to ruth and
all the rest of it

   as i learned later after all the fish
had been caught some qne of your hope-
fuls-

   ours remarked mr boglip

   yours repeated mrs boglip  your
hopefuls thought that it would be a good
thing to clear out the aquarium they
tried to lift it off the stand onto the
floor one side is smashed to atoms and
the carpet of your den will have to be
cleaned and im much afraid that the
dear little snails and lizards and polly-
wogs-that is as many of them as i can
find-will never be themselves again

  mr boglip groaned

   but that isnt it resumed mrs
boglip  when the aquarium tilted a
good deal of the water in it hit your
bookcase and that old stamp-album of
yours is soaked through and through
and-

  mr boglip was on his feet the
stamp-album was a much treasured relic
of his boyhood

   send the children to me at once
martha lie said a gleam of hope shot
over mrs boglips face at the tone and
expression of her little husband

   are you going to punish them as
they deserve  she asked suggestively

  the query was well-meant but ill-
timed it served to remind mr bo  j
of his theories of discipline

   never mind calling them down i-
said after a moment of hesitation  it
go up to them

   finish your dinner first dear
coaxed mrs boglip

  mr boglip shook his head gloomily
ive  more appetite-and t dont
think the children will have any when i
get through with them with this he
ascended to the play-room

  mrs boglip sank in a chair she was
after all somewhat sorry for what she
had started she hoped that boglip
wouldnt chastise them too much she
hoped that he would keep his temper
they were only children and he was a
child once-and-

  mrs boglip heard issuing from the
end of the garden an agonized and
wheezy yelp she recognized the cry of
wally this was followed by a series
boglips canine party



of assorted and spasmodic  ki yis  and
she knew that once more mr boglip was
visiting upon the dogs vicarious ven-
geance bred of the misdeeds of his chil-
dren

  she hastened to the scene of trou-
ble determined that anyhow wally
should receive protection

  the conversation which ensued be-
tween husband and wife was decidedly
more to the point than usual mr bog-
lip had been wrought up to sheer exas-
peration mrs boglips trials of the day
were crowned by the howls of wally a
conflagration of tempers was inevitable

  mrs boglip accused her husband of
cowardly treatment of a  poor dumb
unresisting creature mr boglip de-
clared that wally had snapped at him
when he entered the enclosure mrs bog-
lip didnt believe it mr boglip averred
that he was speaking the truth and that
he had kicked the spaniel in self-defense

  mrs boglip wanted to know why he
had gone to the kennel in the first place
mr boglip responded that he had a per-
fect right to go where he wished in his
own house and in the domains attached
thereto or words to that effect

   but not to kick my dog  insisted
the lady

   yes maam to kick your dog or
anybody elses dog who snaps at me 
retorted mr boglip

  mrs boglip eyed her small spouse for
a moment in silence then she spoke
consolingly to wally turned on her heel
and walked toward the house

  ten minutes later mr boglips bad
temper was somewhaf evaporated he en-
tered the unlighted parlor found his
wife meditatively contemplating the
moon through a cluster of tree-tops the
children having gone to bed

  a week elapsed since the events just
recorded the children had been be-
having well and the dogs had not been
visited by boglip save in kindness but
returning to new rochelle one evening
mr boglip was greeted by his wife with
tales of ill-doing on the part of the kid-
dies to which was added the statement
made with earnest emphasis that if he
failed to do his duty toward them by
administering the corporal punishment to
which they were clearly entitled the wife
herself would set the birch a swinging

  by an unlucky coincidence and as be-
fore mr boglip on this particular day
had undergone a great many things
which had led to his discomfort he was
snappy and cross he replied that mrs
boglip didnt know what she was talking
about and that he proposed to treat and
train his children as he pleased and
what was more he would do as he liked
when he liked and where he liked around
his own home with this and a final
glare at mrs boglip he stamped up-
stairs to where the small culprits were
awaiting him

  mrs boglip waited for a moment and
then slipped quietly out of the room
she returned in about ten minutes with
something akin to a grim smile on her
face above she could still hear her lit-
tle hubby lecturing his recalcitrant flock
his remarks being occasionally punctu-
ated by a shrill protest or explanation

  finally the talk ceased the door
opened and the youngsters descended to
supper

  a little later mrs boglip heard her
husband come down into the hall rattle
quietly among the sticks in the umbrella-
stand retreat into the kitchen return and
open the door which led into the garden
then she went to the kitchen and found
the key to the kennel gone again she
smiled as grimly

  mr boglip as he made his way to the
dogs through the fast falling dusk was
fuming furiously if there is one thing
more than another which breeds bad
temper it is a growing conviction that
ones most cherished ideals are wrong

  it really did seem to mr boglip as
if moral suasion was a flat failure so
far as his children were concerned an-
gry with them with himself with mrs
boglip with everybody and everything
suffering from the unreasonable irrita-
tion which arises from frayed nerves
he as he neared the kennels felt his
gorge rise at the thought of the fat and
bronchial wally he determined that
he would wallop the brute with whole-
hearted joy in spite of his wife and the
whole world 

  so he turned the key in the lock and
entered

  the impressions made on mr bog-
lips mentality by the immediate subse-
quent events are to this clay of a some-


the railroad mans magazine

what blurred and confused nature vio-
lating the usual rule neither wally the
airedale nor the mutts were visible

  shining eyes from the depths of the
kennels told of the animals being at
home but of their disinclination to re-
ceive visitors on the outside

  mr boglip had scarcely time to think
over the queer behavior of the dogs when
something big squatty black emerged
from the farther corner of the enclosure
and growled gutturally as it swaggered
toward him

  notwithstanding the dark mr boglip
with a sensation as if his internal organs
had suddenly quitted him saw that he
was facing an able-bodied bulldog whose
voice and attitude told that it was con-
templating mischief

  naturally mr boglips first impulse
was to back for the door unfortunately
for him it closed outward with a snap-
spring arrangement before he could
open it the dog hurled itself at him
like a small cyclone mr boglip by
a bit of as neat footwork as was ever seen
outside of a sixteen-foot ring avoided
the onset and put one of the kennels be-
tween him and his assailant

  but like a flash the dos turned and
pursued the fleeing legs of the little man
mr boglip spun around to the other side
of the kennel just in time to preserve
the integrity of his calves then he had
to reverse the motion as the dog made a
counter attack

  twice or thrice was this repeated and
then the creature halted growled angrily
and tried to jump across the kennel-roof
mr boglip scared and perspiring felt
grateful that the quarters of wally were
tall and had a sloping roof which pre-
vented the paws-of the bulldog from get-
ting a hold

  an inspiration seized on mr boglip
and he yelled to the dogs in the kennels
for help the reply thereto was a chorus
of barks which could be translated into
apologetic mockery and even glee

  so it seemed to the beleagured one
and the memory of the undeserved flog-
gings which he had given the animals
came back to him with painful forceful-
ness

  next mr boglip howled aloud for
his wife but she answered not again
and again he sent out shrieks for assist-

ance the bulldog muttering an accom-
paniment of canine profanity and ever
and anon dashing around the kennel in
the direction of the boglip legs

  then he yelled for the children the
neighbors for anybody to come to his
help and his appeals loud-voiced and
pathetic as they were proved to be fruit-
less

  in the midst of his terror mr boglip
couldnt but help thinking that it was
very queer that nobody seemed to take
heed to his frantic calls for aid especial-
ly as the houses were not so distant from
each other and some people or other were
usually around after business hours

  in the meantime the bulldog was giv-
ing evidence of growing impatient his
growls grew more blood-curdling and his
actions more alarming he developed
a nasty wav of sidling around toward
mr boglip and then making a short
swift dash that called for a tremendous
amount of agility on the part of the gen-
tleman in question so that his person
might be preserved intact

  even as he thus escaped the dog
would grind his teeth angrily and re-
mark as to what would happen when he
got a good hold of the boglip calves

  mr boglip thought that it would be
a good thing to try something akin to
 moral suasion  on the dog so he be-
gan

 good bow-wow nicey bow-wow
fine dog-

  g-r-r-r-r-r-r  said the bulldog from
the other side of the kennel

   oh  replied mr boglip in all
sincerity  certainly if you think so all
the same i think you are a remarkably
well-developed specimen of your kind
and i do hope that-

  here mr boglips blarney was cut
short the dog made a brilliant at-
tempt to get at him via the kennel-roof
that it failed was another matter but
its effort gave mr boglip an idea which
he proceeded toput into effect

  the lop of the enclosure was a stout
sort of railing the space between this
railing and the top of wallys kennel
was some three feet mr boglip when
the dashes of the bulldog permitted had
taken cognizance of these facts and had
come to the conclusion that if he could
once gain the kennel-roof he would have
boglips canine party



no difficulty in jumping to the railing
and then to the ground

  outside of the enclosure he would be
safe even as he cast about for the
means and moment for his attempt to
gain his freedom he thought with gloat-
ing of the revenge that he would have on
the creature who had caused him so much
terror and loss of perspiration

  to stand on the other side of the wire
fence armed with a sufficient whip and-
twould be an act of justice at which even
his wife could not take exception

  at this instant the bulldog tired of
merely growling made a vicious rush
at mr boglip the little man using
both hands and feet vaulted upward
and to his delight and amazement found
himself on the kennel-roof poising him-
self he hopped over the intervening
space between himself and the railing
and the next instant found himself on
the lawn the feat was the occasion
for a volley of growls from the bulldog
and a chorus of barks from the other
animals

  mr boglip halted not but made for
the house determined that he would take
his revenge while it was hot and handy
in his late encounter he had dropped
the stick which he had taken with him
to the kennels but he had in reserve a
big dog-whip-a cruel business-like af-
fair-that could be felt through the
thickest hide and when he had this in
his hand he-

  a sort of triumphant  yap  caused
him to pause and look back to his
horror he saw the bulldog in the act of
clearing the fence

  there was only one thing to be done
under the circumstances and mr boglip
did it he fled for the shelter of the
houise the dog in hot pursuit the
kitchen-door was of the swinging order
and opened inward to it mr boglip
dashed beating the animal by a scant
yard or so

  once inside mr boglip stayed not on
the order of his going but got out of
the kitchen into the hallway from thence

into the sitting-room and back into the
hall up-stairs and down-stairs diving in-
to the cellar and emerging via the gar-
den back into the house again-shouting
and cursing while the dog jumped at him
bumping into him all the while growling
and snarling

  as he ran mr boglip ceased not his
appeals to mrs boglip or somebody to
come to his aid every leap of the dog
was followed by a yelltrom the pursued
one

  mr boglip had gone the circuit of the
house twice and was making a final dash
up-stairs sore and winded he had just
reached the top landing when his foot
slipped and down he rolled

  the dog was upon him it fastened
its teeth in the tails of boglips coat and
it held  as onlv a bulldog can

  there he was sprawled on the floor
his canine adversary right beside him
with its jaws set and determined on the
nether part of his garment

  help help oh help he yelled
come quick for heavens sake hes
killing me and these words were
followed by one of those indescribable
yelps that only the truly frightened can
utter

  a door opened at the head of the
stairs mrs boglip appeared calm and
cool the four children gathering around
her they stood on the landing and
looked down at their unfortunate master

   come here towser come here
good doggie said mrs boglip in the
kindest sweetest voice immediately the
bulldog released boglips coat and whi-
ning and wagging his tail ambled up-
stairs and curled in a heap at mrs
boglips feet the allegory of complete
docility

   i guess that will teach you a les-
son septimus said the wife  perhaps
you know enough now to keep your hands
off the dogs

  if septimus boglip had learned a les-
son nobody could have decided at that
moment he simply looked as if he had
lost all power to ever speak again

the master
mechanic

by robert h rogers

the annual convention of the american railway master mechanics
association will be held in atlantic city new jersey june - it
is undoubtedly the most important gathering of the year to the en-
tire mechanical department of the railroad world none but master me-
chanics in active service are eligible to sit in the councils of this body and
each of the seven hundred-odd members who will attend will represent mo-
tive-power ideas prevailing over thousands of miles of track

    in view of tine fact that these conferences make railroad history a dis-
cussion of some of the problems which are sure to be brought up for consid-
eration at the meeting is not untimely and is apt to prove entertaining
to those whose interest is with the trials and tribulations of the  captains of
the rolling-stock mr rogers deals with these problems in his article

what it means to be the  boss of the bosses it is difficult for him
to earn his title and when he does his life is beset
with worries of a superior brand

he position of division mas-
ter mechanic is hard to se-
cure because it is largely a
survival of the fittest it
goes without saying that he
who can write  m m after his name
must have been a machinist above the
ordinary or the quality of his work
would never have attracted enough atten-
tion to have raised him to even a gang
boss and certainly he must have been
a little better than the other gang leaders
when the powers that be elevated him to
foreman or roundhouse foreman

   without some distinguishing feats of

his own while in this latter capacity to
single him out from a dozen other com-
petent foremen he could never become
a general foreman for only the best of
these with the additional proviso that
things break somewhere near right may
at last achieve the enviable grade in the
service wherein the distinction may be
enjoyed of  bossing bosses

  this is the plane occupied by the mas-
ter mechanic or as time-honored shop

the master mechanic



only reason for advancement because a
man is a good foreman or even a good
roundhouse foreman which latter may
be likened to a veritable oasis in the field
of talent does not imply the certainty
that he will shine as a master mechanic

  while it is true that every foreman has
his troubles in plenty and not disputing
that he handles them in a way from which
it might well be inferred that he could
handle anything they are nevertheless
not the troubles which associate with the
head of things they are composed
largely of minor details which often carry
with them a great deal of vexation and
worry

  it is not hard to find a man in the busi-
ness who can handle a myriad of nerve-
destroying trivialities but the same man
will often fall down utterly while con-
tending with only one or two of the
graver problems

  the true gage of promotion is whether
or not a foreman can advance sufficiently
beyond the limitations of his own field
which although big as it may be to him
is after all only a unit in the organiza-
tion to assume with equal interest and
charity the role of guiding spirit to each
of the many departments which compose
the large terminal shops

    training a master mechanic

  there are probably one thousand mas-
ter mechanics in active railroad service
in this country and ninety per cent of
them at least have come up from the
ranks of the hammer chisel and monkey
wrench there are other foremanships
in plenty from which they might have
graduated but the school of the machinist
seems to stand the test of time the
writer can recall very few instances
where representatives of other occupa-
tions have been chosen only two boiler-
maker foremen and about a dozen road
foremen of engines have made good as
master mechanics but this proportion of
the total is so small as to be scarcely
worthy of mention

  some few roads have essayed the ex-
periment of training bright young men
through special apprenticeship courses
to enter directly into these positions but
the results have been disappointing the
shop men over whom these made-to-order

    	r r

master mechanics may be placed quickly
become aware of the fact that their supe-
riors never actually worked for a living
with the time-honored tools of the trade
and furthermore it is evident to them
in many cases that they cannot hold on
without special advice and assistance
which is never noticed in connection
with the master mechanic who came up
through the established routine

  for instance it may be necessary to
have an assistant master mechanic and
one or two other supernumeraries who
really carry their chief on their backs
and the men know if it is needless to
add that nothing so effectually destroys
the prestige of the big boss as for it to be
known that he is not resourceful

daily routine

  the duties of a master mechanic vary
on different railroads in minor details
but primarily they call for the adequate
maintenance of all rolling stock entrusted
to his care in order to insure the satisfac-
tory handling of the traffic and the exer-
cise of the greatest economy consistent
with the results desired

  it is necessary that he surround him-
self with capable heads of departments
and that he should see that these heads
have men capable of filling their posi-
tions in case of emergency his daily
conference vith the general foreman and
others whose presence may be necessary
maps out the work to be followed and
daily reports from or preferably visits to
his outlying terminals enable him to keep
in touch with the various conditions and
to adjust any irregularities

  as the master mechanic stands at the
head of all mechanical matters on his
division which is often two hundred
miles long with large main shops many
outlying points and probably three hun-
dred or more locomotives he must of a
necessity be practical and broadly in-
formed in the business

  fie is obliged to render momentous
decisions on points raised by foremen
representing two dozen trades or occupa-
tions every day even if there is a general
foreman boss blacksmith foreman boiler-
maker or what not who are charged with
the direct supervision

no matter how efficient a shop organ-


the railroad mans magazine

ization may be questions are arising all
the tune in the shops involving costs and
the best way to minimize the expense in
this connection he is considered an au-
thority on the best practises in running
and firing locomotives these matters
find their way eventually to the head of
the plant as the court of last resort and
it would be difficult to preside in that
capacity and retain the respect of this
formidable body of practical men each
a master of his own work unless there
was behind the incumbent a tremendous
reserve fund of experience gained slowly
and even painfully through many years
in the ranks or in subordinate supervis-
ing capacities

a census of worries

  once in a while you will find a master
mechanic who will tell you that the con-
ditions which he has to meet are impos-
sible and he will firmly believe it too
notwithstanding its evident fallacy mani-
fested by the fact that he does not hold
the only such position in the country and
that there are other men who are getting
along while combating the same prob-
lems

  the conditions are not impossible al-
though in a few places they may be
unequal if they were impossible the
annals of the job would record a series
of personal failures to make good such as
have never characterized any business
the fact is whether unequal or not
some men have their positions all their
lives through properly interpreting its
requirements and not looking for trouble
until it comes to them

  on different occasions during the past
few years the writer has asked ten master
mechanics with whom he was well ac-
quainted and who represented as many
sections of the country practically the
same question

   what feature in the duties of your
position gives you the most concern  that
is what do you find to be your greatest
source of trouble

  the replies were interesting although
curiously divergent two said to get
material to keep the engines going 
one to keep within the monthly appro-
priation and hold down the costs and
another  in keeping the men satisfied

four answered the engine failures
and what is coming to you after they
happen  another  to suit the superin-
tendent and the tenth  to keep my
job

  the question was put at random and
the replies are quoted exactly as given
they embrace the entire category of what
may be called the tribulations of a mas-
ter mechanic  the features in fact which
are hardest to combat and of which any
one is likely to have a vital bearing on the
tenure of his job there is no need to
look further and in the tact ability and
caliber of the man in general to meet
these issues squarely lies his chances for
holdiilg on to the position which has cost
the best years of his working life to
attain

  if these sources of trouble were ar-
ranged in their proper order of impor-
tance they would read first keep the
men satisfied second hold down the
engine failures third suit the superin-
tendent  fourth watch the monthly ap-
propriation and the supply of material
and fifth watch the job

  this is a more clever arrangement than
it looks although it may not be consid-
ered consistent with a divisional organ-
ization in that the superintendent is
placed third on the list but a moments
reflection will make it apparent that in
keeping the men satisfied and fighting the
engine failures the master mechanic has
already endeared himself to the superin-
tendent

  the reason why the most important
personal consideration  watching the
job is placed last is because measurable
success in the first four should insure the
last

getting along with the men

  a brief consideration of the five
troublesome items enumerated may serve
to convey a better understanding regard-
ing the human side of the master mechan-
ics work than much detail description
of the actual handling of the shops this
latter is largely routine work well looked
after by competent foremen and the
results promptly tabulated for ready ref-
erence by clerks in each department

  it merely remains to glance at the sum-
mary once in a while to estimate whether
tke master mechanic



affairs in general are moving for the good
or bad but the handling of these other
matters which the various master mechan-
ics assigned as trouble-makers are a per-
sonal duty and cannot be entrusted to
any one

  keeping the men satisfied should not
properly belong in the list of master
mechanics troubles on the other hand
it should be among the few rewards per-
taining to an office which has far more
thorns than roses it is no doubt the all-
potent factor in the success of any master
mechanic and it lies simply in two words
- be fair but more strongly than these
in  treat them all alike

  the time has passed long ago when the
master mechanic could stand on the edge
of the turntable pit and literally  cuss 
the engines in and out of the house they
will arrive and depart quicker and his me-
chanical delay-sheet will present a much
better average if every mans little weak-
ness is understood and deferred to so far
as consistent with the maintenance of the
proper discipline

an exponent of civility

  andrew j cromwell for thirty years
master mechanic on the baltimore and
ohio and for a lengthy period previous
to his death its superintendent of motive
power was the exponent of civility on
the part of boss to workman

  even when in his last-named position
he never failed to say good morning to an
ashpit man or any other laborer he might
meet on his way to the office and if in
walking through the shops he saw an
apprentice with his lathe loafing on
the slowest speed he would merely
say  dont you think you could
make better time joe by throwing that
belt up a speed this he thought
preferable to the time-honored form
 here  boy  sling that belt up  if you
were driving rfnails one would get away
from you whether it was any better
or not it made the boy feel better because
his opinion had been consulted by tlie
master mechanic and he ran his lathe up
to the normal speed from that time 

   it is merely in the study of human
nature said andy on one public occa-
sion  where lies the secret of the much
exploited and very much overdone  he

has the knack of handling men some
of you may say that you cant jolly all
men along but that is not what i mean
you can treat them all alike to the best
of your ability take an interest in their
affairs whether assumed or real and
when you have become endeared to them
there will never be a grievance which you
cannot settle in your own little office i
lay great stress on gaining the good will
of the men as it is half of the battle

unconscious good-fellowship

  once d r killinger who is now mas-
ter mechanic on the new haven road
somewhere while on a brief visit to
south boston gained the good will of
the largest body of railroad men in the
quickest time on record and without any
premeditated move in that direction

  pe had some forty or fifty engines
which were taken care of at that point
although it was located on another divi-
sion than his own and being rather new
on the road had their numbers typewrit-
ten in his own office which list he pasted
in the crown of his hat for ready refer-
ence before starting out

  while wandering through south bos-
tons grand maze of some hundred loco-
motives which put up there every dinner
hour it became necessary for him to look
within his hat every time he passed an
engine in order that it might be identified
from the list as one of his own or other-
wise

  this continuous hat-tipping was viewed
with much complacence by the engineers
firemen machinists boilermakers and
wipers who were loud in their praise of
mr killingers supposed polite saluta-
tions as he made his way among them
for that matter dave was naturally polite
enough in those days to give each one a
bona fide salute but these are the facts
even if the telling has been some delayed

engine troubles

  there is little humor in the second
tribulation the problem of engine fail-
ures so much has been said and so much
written  this bugbear that anything
else could scarcely fail in superfluity
but in brief an engine failure means
something which goes wrong with the


the railroad mans magazine

engine after being delivered by the round-
house and which may result in time being
lost while on the road

  engines are carefully watched by the
train despatcher while with their trains
and he can tell from his sheet as they
are reported by the various offices
whether they are holding the schedule

  if not he will wire the conductor of
the train asking the cause although in
all probability the conductor will be first
on the wire advising him these mis-
haps are tabulated in the superintendents
office every dav on a form which the erie
calls   and the  and o  

  it makes no difference what they are
called after copies have reached the
general superintendent and the super-
intendent of motive power they are
synonymous with  please explain  can
you tell us why etc and all the attend-
ing evils the bulk of which will fall on
the master mechanic in the handling of
an amount of correspondence which
would be staggering to a layman

  each and every engine failure must
either be explained no matter how trivial
and it requires a cool well-balanced head
to interrogate the engineer and to subse-
quently present the explanation on an
acceptable basis to the superintendent of
motive power who as a rule is equally
well versed if not sharper than the mas-
ter mechanic

making explanations

  some of these problems are knotty in
the extreme for instance two minutes
are lost on a certain important run on
account of what the engineer and con-
ductor report as  low steam if the
master mechanic should say in his ex-
planation that it was  up to the fireman
they would probably tell him to relieve
the fireman or question his judgment in
using ail incompetent man

   if he should say that the blower pipe
 tipped over or the  exhaust base
leaked he is called upon to explain why
he despatched the engine in a condition
allowing such things to be possible espe-
cially in view of the fact that everything
is inspected daily and the inspection
made a matter of record

  if he should claim that the engineer
was incompetent or at least did not take

proper advantages of opportunities on
the run in question and discipline the
runner in accordance with his ideas con-
cerning the gravity of the offense the
engineer would probably point to his
twenty or twenty-five years successful
record and no doubt send his grievance
committee after the master mechanic

   should the latter on the other hand
and for the sake of peace fall back on
the time-honored and time-worn  bad
coal to explain the two minutes the
superintendent of motive power if he was
on the job and he generally is would
likely come back asking the master me-
chanic to state definitely wherein the coal
was bad in other words how much slate
sulfur bone ash and other non-combusti-
ble substances figured in its composition

the safe middle course

   explanations of engine failures truly
place a man between scylla and cha-
rybdis because the middle ground is
restricted to a degree and once or twice
worked over there is no more to it some
of the explanations which desperation
evolves would make a dead man turn
over in his grave to wit

    this crosshead failed due to an old
concealed defect which could not be
detected in an ordinary roundhouse in-
spection   another  owing to a high
northwest wind which prevailed while
the engine was being sanded some par-
ticles were blown into the truck box
resulting in delay on the road of ten
minutes from box heating  and still
another  pipe to auxilliary reservoir
failed causing delay of twenty-seven min-
utes while engineer made temporary re-
pairs thisfailure was due to pipe being
short-threaded and was a builders de-
fect of a concealed nature this part
had never been repaired or removed since
the engine was received here

going into details

   a great many of these explanations are
soundly based but many are not so to
handle the matter intelligently an ob-
servant man will make each case an
object lesson and strengthen his organ-
ization to insure if possible against a
recurrence
the master mechanic



  sometimes letters will come back sta-
ting that the coal is as good as used on
any other railroad for locomotives costs
just as much per ton and that conse-
quently in the future bad coal would no
longer be accepted as an excuse

  this does not alter the fact however
that very often the coal is bad in the
broadest acceptance of the term and in
such a case the best thing for the master
mechanic to do would be to read up thor-
oughly on the subject of fuel and prove
his contention if he can

  along the lines of the coal problem
one of a master mechanics trials and
certainly not the least is for the rumor
to go broadcast over the division that the
fuel is not up to the standard and it
will require many days if not weeks to
swing the firemen back into line some
of his most exacting days will be spent in
missionary work among the-latter preach-
ing always from one text fine coal
does not necessarily mean bad coal
but a number of the firemen will always
remain outside the fold to insist that so
long as it has no lumps it is no good

  some engineers are prone to resent any
questions concerning any engine failure
considering them to be imputations on
their ability patience and tact are both
requisite to secure the facts

   why that was only a minute  some
of them will exclaim and they dont seem
to grasp the idea that just as long a letter
is required to explain a delay of a minute
as one of twenty

  it should be added however that en-
gineers to a man fight hard to keep a
delay off the run slip and this is all the
more commendable in view of the fact
that it is exercised irrespective of any
feeling which they may have against the
master mechanic or the shop no case
can be recalled by the writer in which a
delay was wilfully brought about

satisfying the super

   keeping the superintendent satis-
fied may or may not be assumed as a
trial to the master mechanic it depends
largely on his own attitude toward that
official the modern operation of rail-
roading divides the entire system into a
number of independent divisions over
each of which is placed a superintendent

  he is all powerful within his own ter-
ritory so much so that to all intent and
purpose he is practically general manager
of his own little railroad and the master
mechanic will be sorely tried if he fails
to gain his good opinion on the very
start

another complex situation

  the master mechanic must furnish the
power from his roundhouses in the shap
of locomotives to cover the regular time
card and any others at the call of the
despatcher which may be required for
freight or extra movement hence he has
become identified as the most important
member of the division staff and the way
he measures up to the requirements of his
job has a material bearing on the record
which the superintendent will make while
in office

  primarily the superintendent wants his
trains run on time and just as important
he wants power to move them when a
movement is necessary thus is brought
about another complex situation with
which many master mechanics are con-
tending every day

the devil and the deep sea

  a man could never be placed more
curiously between two fires than in trying
to please both the superintendent and the
motive power department especially when
the freight movement is heavy flis
natural inclination would be to keep
peace at home and to this end turn the
power as fast as possible it would be
easier if an engine arrives on his ashpit
with flues tight and otherwise o k in
its basic principle but still reporting
several little jobs to let these latter go
and turn it straight out on the road again

  this procedure is sure to gain friends
on his own division among the trans-
portation people but if the power runs
down for lack of care in the meantime
he will very likely fall into disrepute
with the superintendent of motive power
on the other hand if he holds the engine
in the roundhouse and painstakingly and
thoroughly does all of the reported work
a lament may go up from the same trans-
portation people in regard to slow move-
ments from the roundhouse and their


the railroad mans magazine

inability to furnish power for the require-
ments of the traffic

  this situation requires the middle
ground again and all the common sense
judgment and diplomacy which the mas-
ter mechanic can work into it some
superintendents may be what are called
 seven-by-nine  men but the large ma-
jority are  broad gage  in its fullest
acceptance and will stand by the master
mechanic nobly after the freight rush is
over and he has his shop full of engines
for repairs

keeping down the bills

 the question of keeping within the
appropriation for expenses is probably
as vexatious if not more so than the
engine failures the approved plan of
the present day is to allow each master
mechanic a monthly sum on which to run
his department that is so far as salaries
and wages are concerned if he has a
principal shop working about one thou-
sand men and three or four little outlying
roundhouses on his division he may be
allowed forty thousand dollars to pay
everybody on his roll the amount of
these appropriations is fixed by those who
have an intimate personal knowledge of
the territories in which they will be spent
which is well evidenced by the fact that
in the majority of cases they are just suffi-
cient to make both ends meet and no
more

  the master mechanic can pull through
on his appropriation by alloting a certain
daily amount to each department with a
grand daily total of one-thirtieth of what
it call -for but in order to tell just how
he stands on his expenditures it is neces-
sary that the accounts be totaled every
day

empty stock-rooms

  if rush work necessitates overtime to
be worked the appropriation is generally
so tight that he will be in a hole on the
close of that day and must try to get it
back the next if very much in the hole
through poor management or circum-
stances over which he has no control the
shops must be put on shorter working
hours until the balance is restored

scarcity of material is about on a line

with scarcity of money the material is
of course handled by the stores depart-
ment and the master mechanic is not
directly responsible for its being on hand
although kept in his own storehouse
the monthly requisition for what is
assumed to be needed is prepared by the
storekeeper who is not under the juris-
diction of the master mechanic although
it is not supposed to be forwarded for
action until approved by him the stuff
seldom ever returns in the bulk indicated
by the requisition or in season to forestall
the embarrassing situations which must
result when the supplies run out

  there is no greater trial for any mans
patience than to have a bunch of orders
returned to his office every day marked
 not in stock it is always something
for which the greatest need exists as a
rule the shortage is in connection with
the lighter supplies and the extremes to
which a man may be driven to counteract
the situation would scarcely be credited

  a temporary remedy is often sought
by the roundhouse foreman in robbing
one engine for another and when the
master mechanic sanctions reluctantly
this procedure he knows in his heart that
the thing once started it will never stop

robbing peter to pay paul

  the writer worked for a road some
years ago which possessed more than its
quota of able-bodied requisition slashers
who performed their functions on these
things after they reached the general
offices an example of their skill might
be quoted in the instance of one item
which will illustrate about what befell
the others

  it called for  six dozen coal scoops or
firemens shovels a very modest con-
sumption when  locomotives were
cared for every month but the requisition
cutter got busy with it by drawing his
pen through the word dozen thus
leaving  six coal scoops  for the pur-
chasing agent to furnish the six came
along in due course but they didnt last
long enough to get in the storehouse

  in addition to the shortage of shovels
the situation was also reflected in this
manner it was not out of the accepted
order of things to see an engine go out
on an important passenger run with a
the master mechanic



lantern wired in the headlight cage for
want of an interior and when onewould
arrive on the ashpit a gang of men would
be waiting to remove the grease plugs
coupler knuckles headlight reflector and
occasionally the air hose with which to
get another engine in service even the
fire hooks and shaker bars ran  first in
first out and it is recalled that they were
so hard pressed at times that the tanks
and reverse lever latches were put in the
chain gang

  that storehouse also ran out of nuts
they had plenty of course for two and
one-half or three inch bolts which would
have been quite acceptable in some marine
engine works but none of the common
sizes seven-eighths or inch which loco-
motives eat up in profusion

  in consequence a machinist at thirty
cents an hour would spend half a day
rooting in the scrap pile for old dis-
carded nuts and the other half tapping
the rust from the threads of the few he
was lucky enough to find

  the entire situation was distressing in
the extreme but in all fairness to the
general executive handling of railroads
this-was an exceptional case it is merely
mentioned as illustrative of what a master
mechanic may have to contend with and
what he must know how to meet if it
arises otherwise he cannot produce any
locomotives to haul the trains

how the tools get mixed

  the majority of roundhouses and ter-
minal points are short of locomotive tool
equipment that is oil cans headlight
chimnies lantern globes coal picks fire
hooks and other items of a similar ilk
they all have a system of tool inspection
and accounting beyond criticism but they
insist that it is an almost impossible task
to live up to the requirements

  the situation is held within reasonable
bounds when the engines are assigned to
regular crews who have a personal inter-
est in looking after the equipment but it
is practically hopeless when the engines
run in the chain gang by any crew whose
turn is  first out

  the engineers do not stop short of the
master mechanics office in filing com-
plaints regarding shortage along this par-
ticular line

   mr so-and-so i have a hammer and
a broken chisel on my engine and no
monkey wrench the tool boy says he
cant fit me out any better  will go
out if you say so but i will not be respon-
sible for want of tools to get into clear
with if the engine breaks down

  what will the master mechanic do in
that case with the matter put squarely
up to him time may be pressing and
perhaps even then the engineer should be
on his train he will try the storehouse
and they have no monkey wrenches the
tool boy could have told him that in
the last extremity and in order to prevent
a terminal delay he will order a monkey
wrench taken off an engine which is not
going out and away goes the tool system

holding down the job

  the problem based on the trial of
 keeping the job  is frequently influ-
enced by the often groundless fear of
losing it the surest way to lose it is to
be worrying all the time over such a possi-
bility many a poor fellow when he
feels that he is weakening and he is
entitled to sincere sympathy has been
known to sit in his office  like patience
on a monument smiling at grief mean-
while waiting for the lightning to strike
if he had gone out and hustled around
the shops a bit he would have felt better
anyhow and maybe the bolt would have
missed him after all

  there is however room for worry over
this particular feature especially when
things are not going very good the ex-
perience of more than one master me-
chanic can attest that it is harder to keep
the job under certain environment than
it is to get it and to get it implies just
about twenty-five years hard work in the
subordinate grades

  men have worked faithfully through-
out that long period in the quest of this
particular position only to lose it shortly
after acquisition in the drop of a hat the
causes which bring about retirement in
some instances are too subtle to define

  the majority no doubt are soundly
based on facts satisfying to the manage-
ment but some of them savor somewhat
of injustice which is not ordinarily asso-
ciated with railroads

although the position unfortunately


the railroad mans magazine

is of a tenure extremely precarious there
need be no alarm if vigilance is never
relaxed over the smallest item which may
-make trouble if a man puts in his best
licks the first year makes a material re-
duction in the number of engine failures
and maintains a reasonably better show-
ing than his predecessor he has estab-
lished a most convenient reference table
for guidance in the future

  in those twelve months the master
mechanic will have broken-down turn-
tables shortage of help lack of engines
to say nothing of material request from
every man under his jurisdiction for an
increase clamor from each outlying point
for an additional man or so and enough
letters requesting explanations to put a
border on the universe but when he is
over with it all and still has his job with
maybe a little raise in pay he can dismiss
the getting through bugaboo and look
the future in the face with a stouter heart

 if it is his initial experience in the posi-
 tion enthusiasm will not wane for a long
 time but when it does it would be better
 to forestall the inevitable by withdrawing

   it may be after all that enthusiasm
 rightly directed is the chief requisite for
 success in this trying position many mas-
 ter mechanics will never mention these
 trials and tribulations which this article
 has in a measure dissected they find
 a positive joy in fighting trouble because
 they know that they can beat it and they
 have only to glance back over their careers
 to realize that scarcely a situation could
 arise which has not confronted them be-
 fore and been effectually disposed of

   there is an inborn spirit of optimism
 in these successful men which rises su-
 preme above all petty grief when it is
 present the thought is untenable that they
 are special targets for adversity and they
 are ready to admit that the fellow on the
 next division may have his troubles too

clerk laughed

    am reminded at this station of a pas-
 sage of scripture where the saviour asked

walworth the snob

by robert t creel

           a battle royal that found the mettle of
           a victim of too much higher education

 ay percy would ye mind throw-
cp in a little coal in the bloom-
in fire-box ye know she
epj wont make steam unless shes
vffflx kept warm said snub hicks
jfflt gazing mildly at his new fire-
man

  adrian walworth jr hastened the de-
parture of a drop of perspiration that
hung on his chin closed the fire-door
and felt for his monocle the better to
perceive the man who had made such a
strange request

  for it was strange in view of the fact
that adrian walworth jr had been
shoveling coal steadily for the past six
hours though with small results in the
shape of steam having forgotten his
precious glass he was forced to make
such observations as he could with the
naked eye

   ah-my name is mister walworth
he stated resentfully it seemed that
this person must be kept in his place
his mocking speech was not to be tol-
erated

   not while youre tallow-pot on this
smoke-wagon quoth hicks  all you
got to do is keep er hot ill tend to
the sociabilities

   my word murmured the young
man returning to his work

  this thing of learning the business
from the ground up he reflected was not
without its embarrassments

  here was he the son of the vice-presi-
dent of the road recently returned from
an english college subordinate to a
common engineer this trying position
gave rise to another problem how
should he address his task-master

due respect for his own social stand-

ing prevented the use of the word
 mister  nor could he call the man
snub he had begun by calling him
 my good man but when the worthy
hicks jerked open the throttle and he
saw the greater part of his fire pass out
the smokestack lie rejected the term as
unsuitable

  with some disgust the elder walworth
had noted the alfected mannerisms of
his newly graduated son and after some
deliberation he decided that it was out
of the question to start the boy on his
career until he had outgrown some of
his snobbishness

  for this purpose he knew there was
nothing better than a period of service
as a fireman feeling assured that what-
ever qualities of manhood were in the
boys make-up would be brought to the
surface as in no other way so it was
that being spared the preliminary labor
of the roundhouse the young man had
been called for his first trip

  following a confidential talk on the
subject with adrians father hicks
firmly resolved to do his duty toward the
new fireman or  stoker as walworth
jr was pleased to call himself

  as his train consisted of a string of
empties the engineer feared that the
young man might find the work too easy
so from the start he had systematically
 cleaned  the fire when the gage began
to show a fairly good pressure dur-
ing one of the infrequent breathing in-
tervals adrian jr climbed wearily to
his seat-box

   gettin pretty cold in here percy
yelled hicks suggestively the embryo
fireman started to step down but on
raising his leg the muscle suddenly


the railroad mans magazine

cramped as tired muscles will a sec-
ond later hicks noted his strained atti-
tude

   what dyou think you are - a
chicken   he asked gruffly  put down
your leg an get up a little steam

   i believe ive a bally cramp old
chap ah its all right now

  no sooner was one leg released than
the other was drawn up in the same way
perhaps it was a touch of pity that
mad-e the engineer take the shovel

   get up on the tank an shove down
some coal while i put in a fire he
commanded  we got to be movin
along

   with a sigh of relief walworth jr
dragged his tired feet upon the tender
and did as he was bidden although his
determination to do his work well had
carried him thus far without serious
trouble he was much too sleepy to resist
the subtle warmth of the morning sun
and the rocking motion of the train

  he sat down as some philosopher
has observed one thing always leads to
another in this instance repose led to
slumber it also led hicks to profanity

  shovel in handhe advanced on the
erring fireman who slept serenely un-
conscious of impending disaster de-
liberately setting himself hicks swung
the shovel bringing it down forcefully
on the back of the sleeper

   it was as if the secret spring of life
had been touched the long form of
walworth jr sprang upright his lips
emitting a word that sounded like
 mercy 

    i must have fallen asleep   he ex-
claimed rubbing his eyes

  the two resumed their places in the
cab and neither spoke until they round-
ed the curve that brought them in sight
of meadow siding here were waiting
a gang of italian laborers who had been
employed on some construction work at
the place seeing the train the work-
men made a rusli for a flat car that was
standing with two box cars on the side
track the whole crew clambering aboard

  wonder whats doin said hicks
 them dagoes seem to be excited

  while they were taking water the
head brakeman came running up fol-
lowed by the station-agent

    we got orders to pick up them three

cars snub an that bunch of dagoes say
theyre goin to stay on till they get to
ardmore whatll we do about it
questioned the brakeman

  reckon we could put em off

   nope theres too many of em
all got knives

    think itd be all riglit to leave that
car here queried hicks turning to the
agent

  you might returned the other
 i guess there wont be any trouble
about it

  uncoupling the engine they switched
back to the rear of the train which they
pushed ahead for some distance leaving
a clear track for their maneuvers the
car chosen by the italians was in front
of the other two therefore hicks
deemed it best to approach them from
the rear

  it was the work of but a few minutes
to haul them out on the main line then
with suddenly accelerated speed to shunt
the flat car back on the siding and
while the italians were yet trying to
stop it push the two box cars triumph-
antly toward the waiting train

  these moves had been watched with
keen delight by young walworth who
so far forgot his dignity as to wave a
grimy hand at  the disgruntled laborers
as they passed no sooner was the ges-
ture made than he heard a noise differ-
ent from that ordinarily made by the
engine whereupon hicks cursed loudly
and closed the throttle

   were stuck for a few minutes kid
he said with an apprehensive glance at
the italians who seeing his predica-
ment were swarming along in pursuit
like angry bees  you try to stand em
off till i see if i can get er tinkered up
it was a nervous fireman that watched
the leaders of the rabble gain on the
slowly moving engine yet in his bear-
ing there was nothing of fear it was
rather the excitement of the thorough-
bred before going into action

  yelling to his followers the foremost
attacker mounted the first step then
stopping the full swing of adrians
heavy shoe with his chin he bit off a
word together with a portion of his
tongue and plunged over backward so
precipitately that it must have surprised
even himself
walworth the snob



stomach at that moment hicks hav-
ing completed his work and opened the
throttle turned his attention to the fight

  one of the italians had taken advan-
tage of the momentary diversion to gain
a foothold on the gangway and was aim-
ing a blow at the firemans back with
his stiletto seeing this the engineer
made haste to smite him on the head
with his trusty wrench performing the
feat in much the same way one would
drive a nail

  after breaking the force of his fall
with the back of his head he experienced
no difficulty in alighting and lay quiet

stopping the full
swing of adrians
heavy shoe with
his chin

thereafter as if satisfied with the days
work

  in the meantime his companions
pressed onward in such numbers that the
fireman using feet and shovel alternate-
ly found it no easy task to keep the
narrow gangway clear hicks working
madly shouted encouragement

   thats the dope you got em fud-
dled percy keep after em

  take that you beggar grunted
adrian striking valiantly at a man who
had slashed the leg of his overalls

   look out theres one cornin over
the tank cried hicks

  when the newcomer stumbling and
sliding on the coal lurched toward him
adrian shifted the shovel to his left hand
and drove his gloved right into the mans

  the man crumpled down in a heap
thus ending the struggle the others be-
ing already left behind by the swiftly
moving engine

  safely out of danger the engineer and
his fireman stood looking calmly at each
other

  if their faces were expressive of their
thoughts it was evident that each felt
himself guilty of misjudging the other

   i owe you something for that and
believe me i am sincerely grateful mr
hicks said the young man with respect-
ful admiration in his voice

   dont mention it youre the goods
an im glad to have you on the engine
mr walworth replied the older man
warmly

   heres my hand said walworth

we like to be as useful to our readers as we can but because of the great popularity
of this department we are forced to impose certain restrictions in future we
shall be compelled to limit its scope to the answering of questions of an inform-
ative technical or historical nature only letters concerning positions will not be
answered in this department all letters should be signed with the full name of the writer
as an indication of his good faith we will print only his initials

please state the length of a circle
formed by a one-degree curve and if
the distance around a two-degree curve
would be one-half of the one-degree curve-
h e san bernardino california

  the radius of a one-degree curve is 
feet or a diameter of  feet the radius
of a two-degree curve is  feet or a
diameter of  feet therefore a curve of
one degree is twice the size of a two-degree
curve

a fifty-foot car is to be weighed on
a forty-foot scale thus necessitating
the weighing of each end separately
to obtain the correct weight of the car is
it essential that each truck be placed the same
distance from end of scale under the
same circumstances what would be the re-
sult if scale was located  an incline-t
p d dallas texas

  the fiftv-foot car should be weighed by
placing each truck as near as possible in the
center of the scale and the sum of the two
weights will be the weight of the car within
a few pounds we have often weighed main
connecting-rods for locomotives one end at
a time and had them come out within half
a pound of the true weight but in the in-

stance of your problem care should be taken
that on the second weighing the end of the
car off the scale should be as level as in the
first weighing you will often notice that
the ground  both ends of the scale either
runs up or down hill which would make an
irregularity weighing anything on an in-
clined scale is never reliable a scale should
be absolutely level

  	with everything in proper condition

little to choose from in this regard between
any of the various gears the fastest mile
ever run by a steam locomotive was made
in  seconds by the famous  equipped
with stephenson link motion and balanced

accessible to repairs and inspection than the
other but the distribution of steam is no
better as is clearly shown by an analysis and
comparison of indicator cards taken under
the same conditions with each motion

engines on the  century  at this writing
the philadelphia and reading has made
most of its famous runs on the atlantic city
division with the atlantic or -- type and
on the atlantic coast line ten-wheel or

cent date a good many of these things
depend  the personal ideas of the various
motive-power management and there is no
hard and fast rule for any of them

   	its advertisement reads in part as fol-
lows   engines so equipped will pull a
greater tonnage with less fuel and water
and make the same time as engines equipped
with any other gear we never had any
practical experience with this motion and
know very little about it except that engi-
neers with whom we have talked who are
running it say that it is very serviceable and
economical

   	it is quite hard to outline this elabo-
rate operation in detail within this space and
more so when we are unaware how much
real knowledge you have of the subject the
best way and really the only way is to get
the centers of the main pedestals which can
be readily done from the center of the ex-
haust port in the cylinders and use this point
as the working basis after you have se-
cured the center of the pedestals mentioned
and squared them across the frames simply
work each way from that pedestal it is
impossible to go very far wrong in this job
if ordinary care is used but without the exer-
cise of this care grave complications will
ensue such as worn brasses and knuckle-
pins cut driving-tire flanges and a poor
riding engine

   	the best system is to put the wheels
under the engine with the eccentrics fastened
temporarily and go through the entire opera-
tion of valve setting when complete scribe
the key-ways off in the axle and cut them
by following this plan you will know to a
nicety what you have if however it is
considered absolutely necessary to cut the
key-ways before the wheels go under it can
be done but the liability for off-set eccentric
keys is always in evidence following the oper-


the railroad mans magazine

ation if an indireet-motion engine simply
place he main wheels with the crank-pin on
the exact forward center and advance the
forward motion eccentric toward the pin the
exact sum of the lap of the slide-valve and
the lead desired

  this can be done quite readily by means
of a heavy butt steel square placedon a
board under the eccentric after the right
angle position to the crank-pin of the latter
has been ascertained seven-eighths outside
lap and one-eighth inch lead would be a pro-
gressive movement of one inch on the board
for the square butt the back motion eccen-
tric should be set as far below the pin as the
forward is above there are some very
clever ideas in vogue for determining the
position of eccentrics without valve-setting
as a preliminary and the writer has prac-
tised them all-but in the long run it will
be found advisable to proceed as first indi-
cated in this answer

  the eccentrics are so heavy these days
and so liable to commence working at an
early date that anything like a  stepped key 
is a grievous fault and a  stepped key  is
quite likely in any plan other than honest
valve-setting

  	if the steam-chest has new or annealed
copper joints the general practise is to allow
one-sixteenth inch for the compression of
the copper when the cover is finally bolted
down there should be no less than three-
thirty-seconds of an inch between the pres-
sure-plate and the top of the valve

  	dont know of any joy valve-gear in
this country and  engines in the world
with superheaters in the fire-box

le d gastonia north carolina-the

	standard length of a rail is thirty
feet but they have been rolled much longer
than that we believe that at one time ex-
periments were made on the pennsylvania
with rails even sixty feet long there are
few now above thirty feet used anywhere

take two locomotives of some given
type and give each  tons to haul
and  miles to run if one of the
engines was taking steam eight inches of its
stroke and the other six inches what would
be the difference in coal and water and which
would use the least-o a d sedalia mis-
souri

  one of these engines is using two inches
less steam than the other for each one-half
turn of the wheels or a total saving of eight
inches reckoning both sides of the engine in
each revolution necessarily it will use
much less water and fuel than the one run-
ning in the eight-inch cut-off but just how

much we are unprepared to say as your
question does not embody sufficient data for
even a surmise it would in fact require an
elaborate indicator test to arrive at the exact
figures however roughly speaking the
saving should be at least two tons of coal
and maybe  gallons of water

pressure compresses it to about one-half the

is further compressed to the required reser-
voir pressure and exhausted into the main

  	the walschaert valvd-gear differs
from the ordinary link motion in having
only one eccentric-rod in altering the posi-
tion or travel of the valve by moving the
end of a bar attached to the end of the valve-
rod up and down in the link without moving
- by the light of the lantern



the link and in having the valve-rod also at-
tached to a lever that derives its motion
from the cross-head

  this last detail determines the lap and
lead of the valve and gives them a fixed
value whereas the ordinary link motion
gives a variable lap and lead affected by the
valve travel the welschaert gear derives its
motion from an eccentric crank or return
crank on the main crank-pin

  the eccentric-rod is secured to one end
of the link which is pivoted in the center on
a pin held by a bracket bolted to the guide-
yoke the link-block is secured to a radius
arm or bar one end of which is attached to
the end of the valve-rod and the other end
to the lifting arm of the reverse shaft the
motion imparted to the valve by the cross-
head connection is small as the cross-head
arm and union link are attached to the lower
end of the combining or combination lever
while the radius arm and valve-rod are con-
nected close to the upper end thus impart-
ing only a slight motion to the valve-rod

  for large locomotives walschaerts gear
is now extensively used because it has light-
er moving parts and these parts are more
accessible for inspection and repair than
those of the common form of link motion

tion write to either of the firms mentioned
in reply to your first question

  an article describing at length the wals-
chaert valve-gear its inventor and its appli-
cation to locomotives is being prepared for
an early number of the railroad mans
magazine-the editor

tem of locomotives classification which is
generally in vogue four-wheel switcher

   the figures following the names in each
 of the above definitions are intended to il-
 lustrate the wheel arrangement

   for example the -- or pacific type
 from the figures we gather that it has a four-
 wheel engine truck six connected drivers
 and a two-wheel trailer the hyphen be-
 tween the figures indicates that each section
 of the wheel arrangement is an independent
 unit this is conceded to be the cleverest
 arrangement yet devised to describe a loco-
 motive in the smallest space very little
 practise is required to become thoroughly
 familiar with its intent

    	it is very hard to pick out the  fast-
 est  locomotive all modern passenger
 power is fast enough if not overloaded and
 nothing but an exhaustive test would indicate
 the survival of the fittest however the fast-
 est passenger-train running regularly in this
 country is probably the twentieth century
 limited of the new york central lines this
 train is run at present by a pacific --
 engine one of which is numbered 
 it is equipped with walschaert valve-gear
 and weighs in working order 
 pounds

   with one exception one of the same type
 built for the pennsylvania this is the heaviest
 passenger locomotive ever built of this type
 although there is an articulated  the santa
 fe which exceeds the weight of either

    	it is practically the universal rule
 and independent of this consideration a

stealing an armored train

by frederick j liesmann

        an attempted hold-up brings back pleasant mem-
        ories of revolutionary days on the island of cuba

clearly remember that i had
  just glanced over john par-
  kers big irregular scrawl
  to hors shoing-
  when i heard a faint click-
  click and directly afterward
  the voice-thick guttural and it seemed
  to me just a bit tremulous

   hold up your hands  

  that and the quick rustle of reeses
newspaper as we both looked up

  the devil-i knew him by his horns
and long pointed red face-was leaning
in the big office-window his elbow stead-
ied on the counter that ran along the
grating in his hand was a large re-
volver-the muzzle was scarcely a foot
from the superintendents head

   scoville his pen poised in air glanced
at his satanic majesty with remarkable
indifference

  speaking to me he inquired

   y-yes im speaking to you

    just a minute please said scoville
and calmly resumed his writing

  for a moment the devil stared at sco-
ville as tt mesmerized then i saw that
the satanic visage was in reality a human
face topped by a low
slouched hat and masked
below by a soiled handker-
chief to my surprise his
pistol-hand sank slowly to the
counter

  holy moses he quav-
ered  i caint shoot a man
and him a writin

  scoville made a dab with
his blotter and swung easily
around

   say kid he drawled

 youre - a - peach take
     r r

that rag off your face and come around
here lesee how you look

  with ludicrous concern the bandit let
down the hammer of his weapon put it
into lis pocket and shambled into the of-
fice as if the entire proceeding was a
mere matter of course  

  it was a gaunt homely boy of eighteen
a hunger-marked poverty-stricken gro-
tesquely pathetic wretch that cowered
against the grating blinking at us with
the helpless look of a trapped rabbit
scovilles eye took in every detail of his
miserable figure	

  whats the idea of the stick-up
son he asked kindly busted

   busted murmured the boy  hun-
gry no work i caint git work his
voice was husky and i saw the glint of
a tear in his eye as he barked savagely at
scoville ive gotta eat aint i

   weve all got to eat said the su-
perintendent after a long pause  reese
get him a feed and a bunk and put him
on one o them snatch-teams to-morrow
seven oclock to-morrow boy you un-
derstand  he turned again to his desk
 say half whispered the boy as he
and reese went out  aint he
the limit 

   hm laughed the fore-
man  youve only seen him
hire a man you orter see him
fire one

  some seven years elapsed
after i left the acme people
before i saw reese again
we were building the south-
ern branch and on my first
trip over the line i met the
old fellow

r


the railroad mans magazine

scoville glanced at
his satanic majesty
with remarkable
indifference

  loquacious and friendly as ever he
insisted on showing me everything of in-
terest in the camp as we passed the big
fill he suddenly seized my arm

  bill said he dye know that
stumpy square-shouldered plug up there
on the dump

   why i asked  isnt that sco-
ville who used to be supe at the acme 
 right you are thats him that
young cub with hims johnny britt the
assistant supe them twos what i call
the stick-up twins

  the stick-up twins eh where do
they get that name 

  they earned it by jimminy they
earned it and i give it to them i seen
them two stiffs-you know what i seen
them two stiffs do i seen them two
thieves steal an armored railway train
from the kingdom o spain

  here here reese what kind
of a romance is this youre building

   just to give you a faint idea of the
magnitude o that there undertaking
said the old man  lemrne put you a
hypothetical question to wit

  if you was a cuban insurgent in an
insurgents uniform and you knew that
every spanish soldier in the island would
shoot you on sight-you understand-
that no matter what they would or w-ould
not do - afterward you was well aware
from previous experience that the first
thing theyd do would be to cut down on
you with intent to kill and cripple and
if you was the commanding officer field
staff and band of an insurgent column
consisting of yourself two other ameri-
cans and a cuban and while percolating
through the jungle four strong as men-
tioned you came out on a railroad and
saw standing thereon an armored train
guarded by eight hundred gallant galoots
o the spanish army all armed to the
teeth and loaded for bear  and whereas
 would you under them circumstan-
ces have the bronze audacity to-try to
-steal-that-armored train

   i would have the good judgment i
said to steal swiftly away from that
armored train

   well them two done it

  did what stole away
i

stealing the armored train



   naw exclaimed the old man stole
the train yes i mean that them two
cheap pilferers had the monumental mar-
ble gall to go and steal that armored
train

   oh ill admit- i helped em do it
he continued deprecatingly  but i only
helped em do it to show em they
couldnt do it-and by gosh they went
and done it

   reese said i  if you can demon-
strate to me how that thing was done ill
buy you the most expensive drink in the
state of colorado

  the old man crammed a horny finger
into the bowl of his pipe

   we had the class all right-scoville
and britt and me were there with bells
on and weber-say that dutchman
had the science of explosives down ta
the thin blue milk hed orter been an
anarchist honest i believe that plug
could a took a snowball and a box o
matches and cracked a bank

   then there was delgado he was a
negro but believe me bill he was some
grub-rustier and cook oh yes we had
the class all right but that bunch we
traveled with-say

    on the square bill they must a had
a bumper crop o colonelcies when they
invented one onto the honorable don
sebastian guillerme etc etc machado
i remember the day we hit up with him
weber says to me

  you r-reece dat distinggished-
looking officerr ve haf been assigned
to hiss commant

    what says i  that pot-bellied
gink with the wind-strainers draped on-
to his chops gentlemen weve had to
endure some freaks but suf-fering jupi-
ter  if that there darwinian party dont
prove to be the yellowest quittingest or-
neriest fizzle weve ever been up against
ill eat your old sock i dont claim no
gift o prophecy but youll find that ive
got the potent dope on mr machado all
o k	i

   and if that gallinipper could be a
superior officer you can well imagine
what the rank and file was the best-
balanced gun they ever issued me i bust-
ed over the upper right-hand corner of
his chief o staff aw well he didnt
have nothing to do with stealing the
armored train except that he started- it

yes machado started it he was always
for starting something he couldnt fin-
ish

   reese gravely relighted his pipe

   yep he continued  that was ma-
chados long suit if he could have fin-
ished all he started hed a been a pip-
pin

    colonel machado with all respect to
the fool had the world skinned in this
here one respect to wit

  he could put up a job on somebody
and demonstrate to your entire satisfac-
tion that the victim had no more chance
than an armless wonder would have with
a typewriter and yet when the other
fellow got through working on him
youd have to drag machado out with a
hook i think one o them hickory-
headed general staffs rolled this armored
train pill for him

   they were going to lay an ambush
for eight hundred spaniards and an ar-
mored train at a place where the railroad
made a long bend northward along a
deep dry creek while they were eating
them spaniards alive senor scoville was
to take his americanos and blow up the
track behind the train so she couldnt get
back when he intimated something about
the chance of failure

     the illustreeous senor says ma-
chado plumb napoleonic makes the
joke my genius knows not the failure
 that mind you when theyd cleaned
him every time hed faced the flag the
durned old package o peanuts was
simply born with a corn on his bean and
didnt know it

     what do you think of the colonels
scheme reese says scoville when we
were alone

  great says i when they give
him the grand run we being by our-
selves can beat it through the brush like
gentlemen without having a pack o cu-
bans running all over us

     ach r-reece says weber  youre
a bessimist youre alvays exberiencing
sour bickels

    all right thinks i id rather be a
pessimist under criticism than an opti-
mist under a headstone

    i will -say however in all justice
to the colonel that the deathtrap he
picked out for them spaniards was a
peach there were three different ways


the railroad mans magazine

by which him and the general staff could
take a swift sneak without exposing
themselves

   three ways understand outside of
plain running away id always consid-
ered the last-mentioned as amply suffi-
cient having never yet seen a bullet over-
take one o them heroes after hed got
fairly started as far as our part was
concerned-well if you cared to see box
cars jump around like fleas and railroad
tracks get right up and embrace each
other like long-lost brothers just let
weber place the dynamite

   wed fooled around all of two hours
after wed got our dynamite placed and
the wire strung into the brush smoking
and dialoging over the situation when-
bat bat br-r-rt bat-bat they
opened up

    were off says johnny britt

    yes says i  and ill bet the col-
onelll cut the corners as close as any of

   somehow we all felt sort o spotted
about that scrap from the very beginning
she didnt start right they just kept
bat-batting and pop-popping at each
other in a half-hearted indifferent kind
of a way until scoville says

    boys that there dont sound just
right to me somehow them spaniards
are extending to the northeast first
thing you know therell come a puff o
bullets from that flank and before they
all get by youll see machados outfit
coming out of that creek bottom like a
bat out of a burning house what i
wish particular to forecast is that when
they jump out in front of them spanish
mausers and try to beat it over the rail-
road dump the results are going to be
plumb astonishing

    what if they should come a pilfer-
ing down this side of the track   i asked

    were going up the line where we
can see them before they see us scoville
answered  it aint that i care a whole

youll find that ive got
the dope on mr machado
stealing the armored train



lot - only the place
where i want to
camp is due south of
here and i dont
want to have to out-
run the whole span-
ish army eastward
and then circle back
eight or ten miles
to find my roosting-
place

    weber can stay
here and look out for
the train hes got
sense enough to
run when a runs
right i gqess he can
slide through the
brush about as swift
by hisself as he could
with four of us stepping
on his heels anyway

   weber gave him one
contemptuous look

     bessimist  says he

 bickles 

   it certainly was dog-
gonecl white of em to
stay on their own side of
the track any man what
was ever hot - footed
through the tall uncut by
a bunch o rowdy rough-
necks can tell you that this here idea of
blundering onto a row of rifles is entire-
ly a vulgar and poisonous proposition so
there being absolutely nothing to hinder
us we eventually went and took a look at
that armored train then we all sat
down scoville looked her over a bit and
he says

     there she is reese

     say britt says i  there she is
thats her

    aw the dooce you dont say i
thought that there was a pair o gum
boots

     engine box car flat car caboose
says scoville  plated six feet high with
boiler-iron loop-holed for rifles loaded
with feed and ammunition steam up and
her safety-valve a popping off and not
one soul aboard so help me moses 

    dont overlook them twenty-five
gentry standing along the shady side of
her says i

    nor a hundred and fifty more

delgado came whizzing out of the firmament

strung along the dump below her britt
cut in but at that shes our train
got em again aint you says i
 did i hear you say she was our train 
  thats what i said

  all right dopey you can have
her

   we wrangled a bit and then britt
promulgated the following nutty notion
to my mind it had the fifth essence of
foolishness skinned plumb

    i tell you boys sajs he  weve
got the dope on em forty ways from
sunday and if we let this here oppor-
tunity get away from us well be yellow
dogs there theyve got all their dead-
lights on that flight we hop aboard the
train three of us shoot up the guard
reese pulls her out

    the first time one o them ginks
hears a  buzz past his receiver hell
run plumb to spain before that bunch
along the track realize whats going on
weve brushed by em like a pay-car pass-


the railroad mans magazine

ing a tramp and theyve got no more
armored train than a fish has feathers

   of course they wont shoot i put
in sort o sarcastic

  not through that armor scoville
gets back

     say look here says i  do you
two apple-knockers actually figure on
riding that train out o here 

     sure

     all right boys every fool to his
own foolishness ill help you do it
simply to prove to you that it cant be
done men britt to the engine delgado
to the flat car scoville the caboose
youre game  les go  

    in ten seconds we reached the train
britt no more than hit the engine than
he ran his rifle over the tender and as i
reached for the throttle crack-ow he
cut down on a little flop-eared tailor-
made lieutenant and shot the whole top
out of his new hat

   that individual made some kind of
a remark to heaven and took it north on
the air-line without even looking back
before scoville and delgado really got
started the other twenty-four were run-
ning him neck-and-neck and i had her on
the move britt ducked into the cab

  jerk us out o here reese he
squealed

    feeling the wheels grip i pulled her
wide open and we jumped at the gang
along the dump like we were shot out of
a gun

   surprised them galoots were so
surprised that if delgado hadnt heaved
a  past their snouts theyd be in a
trance yet

  get down yells britt and as we
went to the floor-pr-r-row they
popped it to us

    bill the amount o glass and splin-
ters and chunks of coal them fellows
knocked off o that train in the space of
two hundred yards was a holy fright
and noise when they finally got their
magazines empty the comparative silence
was so pronounced that you could hear
it as we slid away i looked back and
seen em jumping up and down shaking
their fists at us like crazy men

     aw peevish  peevish   says britt
 they look sort o irritated about some-
thing

     mr britt says i  weve come to

bury caesar not to praise him will you
kindly poke your nut out o that window
and give mr weber the high sign be-
fore the durned dutch yokel blows us
plumb off o the earth  

   as i slowed her down to the place
where the track was mined everybody
had his head stuck out to locate weber
finally britt saw him

    hey weber  he sings out waving
his hat its us dont shoot j
dye see him calls scoville

    yes he understands its all
right

    all right reese says scoville
 pull her across

    i guess i started her up a little faster
than weber expected i know we got
the box car and engine clean across and
britt was still waving when-whif--
oom dust smoke and cinders spouted
fifty feet into the air the flat car reared
up in the middle broke in two and rolled
off the dump

   amid a shower of bolts splinters
and mauser cartridge-clips the front end
of the caboose slid easily off into the hole
and sat there like a big awkward cow
as i glanced around delgado came
whizzing out o the firmament and hit the
ground like a ton o brick i started to-
ward him but scoville waved me back

    back to the engine reese he
never even knew what hit him

   just then webers rifle popped as
the bullet spatted into the dump we saw
a spot of smoke and under it the faint
flicker of webers legs going south

    aw youre making a brilliant re-
treat aint you - you oak-headed
dutch- squeals scoville shaking his
fist at the jungle

  to the engine yells britt les
take whats left and get out o here for
heavens sake listen to that firing

   i noticed then that the spaniards
were handing machado one awful pack-
age of mauser

     yes says i  les get out while we
can i think theyre flying the colonels
kite at that scoville hops onto the
car

     give her the juice says he

   you talk about your record runs i
jammed the throttle into the last notch 
i gave her every pound of steam that was
in her for a moment she struggled and
stealing an armored train



fought against her own weight
with the fury of a trapped ti-
gress-a writhing column of
smoke above her beneath her
a stream of fire and then-

   right and left the jungle
broke up and steamed away in
a jumble of little hills scur-
rying around each other like
rats rocks and trees jumped
up gave us a glance and flit-
ted past the track ahead was a
hurrying blur of brown dout-
le-striped with a shimmer of
gray

    above the clang and clat-
ter of her running-gear sound-
ed the rack-rack a-rack-
rack a-rack-rack of her
wheels hitting the joints her
funnel roared like a tornado
her cab was a madhouse of
spattering cinders and the wind
was whizzing through her bro-
ken window-panes

   ive coasted em down thp
long grades of the appala-
chian foot-hills so fast that you
had to look twice to see em
and slammed across the kansas
prairies neck-and-neck with the wind
but suf-fering jupiter this durned old
rattle-trap was a perfect cyclone of steam
and steel

    withoutone touch of brake or throt-
tle we hit the curve -like wed been flung
from the clouds for an instant she
tottered and bucked lurching from rail
to rail and then as we skidded into the
long bend along the creek i looked up
and saw machados jack-rabbit regiment
streaking it to the east with the mausers
kicking up the dust all around em and
away down in the rear behind the rail-
road dump machado and the general
staff nervously swinging into the saddle
for a run

   i dont know what made britt start
swinging the bell i know it attracted
their attention and as we flitted past one
big fellow he filtered aload of buckshot
in through the window and pretty near
got both of us

     pipe down on the monkey business
britt i yells  this aint no picnic

     well he grins back  i dont want
our own comrades to run over us

left

across

the rails hanging
it like a bridge

   before he quit talking there came the
bellow of a field-gun up in the brush
and a shell whizzed over us sputtering
like a wet snowball one look at that
battery was enough for me

    there idiot  i shouted  you see
what youve done 

  what says he-and bang bang
whop-ivhop-whack ivhoof

   one of em fanned through the ten-
der scattering coal all over the island of
cuba the other ripped a tunnel through
the road-bed ahead of us and left the
rails hanging across it like a bridge britt
took one look at the ground flickering
past us and turned white i turned my
head away and we smashed into it she
gave one sickening lurch to the left i
heard the crunch of her tracks as she
bounded over and righted snatching the
box car clear of the sagging rails the
crash of her wheels bumping the cross-
ties

   there was a shock and a roar for-
ward and as the pony trucks toppled
out over the embankment her boiler
plunged deep into the road-bed hurling

 hp hey are always telling that it is better
a on the railroad these days than in the
gocd old times said the old conductor
 and in a way life on the roads is better
than it used to be and in another way it
isnt things used to go along in an easy
manner and you didnt have to use a great
deal of brain power

   why not much more than ten years
ago a crew stopped a freight-train down at
sherburne and went to a dance and were
there an hour or more to-day if a train
is five minutes late you get a telegram
which runs like this

please advise us why no x was late
we used to stop trains at good swim-
ming-holes along the way and go in swim-
ming thats a fact you can see life was
a bit easier then

   xot a great many years ago they could
ditch a freight-train forty cars high set
them afire and go on with the rest and noth-
ing much would come of it to-day if you
bust the knuckle youve got to tie a tag to it
and send it in along with a letter telling
liow it happened

   when conductors had it in for the engi-
neer he would hook onto thirty cars-a
good load at that time it would make the
engineer mad the conductor would re-
port that he had hauled fifteen cars and
the head office wouldnt know the differ-
ence the next day the conductor might
take ten cars and report that he had taken
fifteen and thus juggle the figures as he
liked

  its different now the office hands
you out a fistful of bills and says  take
those cars to station z you take them all

spears

and report at the other end that you have
delivered them and you hand over the bills
with the number of each of the cars

   in the old days you wouldnt pass a
train in a hundred miles perhaps and you
didnt have to know a great deal about the
road

   but it isnt such a cinch now you must
know all the trains on the division and
practically at what time each one will be at
each of the stations you must know every
inch of the track the grades curves
switches and signals

   you must also know die book of rules
keep track of the bulletin-board know the
men you come in contact with he aware of
special rules study the mechanism of the
engine and be conversant with a heap of
other things

  youve got to be studying all the time
and along with this you have the manual
labor to perform heave coal if youre a fire-
mati work the levers oil the engine if youre
an engineer depending upon what you do

   they are always telling how many got
their hands and feet cut off and how many
were killed on the-road the fact is in
those days it was the regular thing to go f
out half-cocked and with a half-pint in
your hip-pocket a good many were drunk
when they got hurt to-day if they even
smell the trace of a drink on your breath
you get more than a cross-eyed look

the first railroad across
south america

by george w grant

the proud peaks of the andes that for years have defied all efforts of man
to gird their lofty summits with rails of steel have at last succumbed
to the unceasing pound of compressed-air drills and the rending tear-
ing force of high explosives where from the beginning of time silence
has brooded over the fields of eternal snow the shrill whistle of the locomo-
tive and the shriek of steel on steel is now heard-triumphant battle cries pro-
claiming that man has won another battle against the relentless forces of
nature that block his way to progress and civilization

     the history of the trans-andean railroad is a story of human toil and
suffering scores of lives have been sacrificed and failure upon failure
recorded but with a stamina and girt that is found only in heroes the men
who held in their hands the destiny of a continent have again and again flung
their forces against the cruel mountain steeps sometimes to pause blinded
and bleeding but only to go on with renewed vigor this finally won out
and the trans-andean system stands to-day a monument of human per-
severance and ingenuity	

how nine days of travel have been cut off between the pacific and
the atlantic ports of south america by the most strenuous
railroad building ever known in history

	far away that very few of even
the best - informed practical
men and scientific experts in
this country or in europe
know much about it one of
the most remarkable railroads
in the world has just been com-
pleted this is the trans-andean rail-
road of south america opened for traf-
fic early in the spring after thirty-seven
years of construction

  making its way over the worst moun-
tain ranges that steel rails ever climbed
planned with terrific grades that cost
might be reduced and the system prove a
success -commercially from the start it
joins the east and west coast of the south-
ern continent extending in a straight
line from buenos ayres to valparaiso

  the schedule - time of through trains
from ocean to ocean will be twenty-nine
hours

  there are many south american rail-
roads in operation the argentine alone
lias  miles of them across the pam-
pas or prairies besides its  miles of
tracks reaching to the slopes of the an-
des and  miles of them stretching
north of the boundaries of bolivia bo-
livia has what is probably the costliest
railroad anywhere - a mountain line up
among the northern andes that has never
paid

  all in all however the total mileage
below the isthmus of panama amounts to
scarcely a seventh of that of the united
states canada and mexico the trans-
andean railroad is the first transconti-

nental line in the entire southern hemis-
phere for africa thus far has none

  new names are now being added to the
history of railroading-names that in la-
ter years may be as famous as those of the
men who when the western section of the
united states was still the far west in
spite of every obstacle solved the problem
of girding the north american continent
from shore to shore  names such as theo-
dore judah leland stanford and collis
p huntington what these men did in
the sixties has again been accomplished
in this new atlantic-to-pacific line 
miles long with a mountain section con-
taining  miles of steep winding
grades

  c p white of england was the man
who took up the work when the original
projectors john and matthew clark
were unable to finance it any longer find-
ing after twenty-five years of experiment
and toil that no investors could be- in-
duced to put money into their engineering
theories

the master minds

  after six years as resident engineer
with the knowledge that his plans were
working out to perfection mr white
broke down his eyes becoming seriously
affected by the snow glare of the andes
and his health generally giving way under
the strain

  frank t mcginnis an american en-
gineer who succeeded him pierced the
last foot of granite in the summit tunnel
thus joining the argentine and chile and
finishing up all the work with the excep-
tion of the clear-up

  under white was the german engineer
plummerson who has since retired and
bertram norton an englishman

  no one has ever estimated the vast
sums that john and matthew clark spent
in attempting to drive a railroad over the
andes it was simple enough to build
along the argentine pampas where cat-
tle wine and wheat furnished the bulk
of the freight business and the route
from the chilean coast to the andes also
was an easy matter but when it came
to the stretch that is less than a hundred
miles in an air-line over the mountains
the years went by and a railroad was as
far off as ever

  by vast efforts the lower slopes were
finally conquered in  there were
forty-three miles still uncompleted how-
ever between the chilean and the argen-
tine terminals with all the heavy moun-
tain work between practically untouched

 the first failure

                   - -

  the clarks plans was a railroad in
spirals burrowing through the mountains
thousands of feet below their summits
in this way they intended to do away with
the enormously heavy grades that would
otherwise be necessary for at least thirty
miles driving the road through the
mountains the snow problem would also
be eliminated they argued for at least
five months in the year the coach road
across the frontier is made useless by
snow avalanches and torrents of mud
from the precipitous peak

  the wealth of the mines of golconda
poured yearly into this spiral construc-
tion might have made such a scheme pos-
sible most capitalists however while
willing to take big chances did not see
it in the light of a good investment but 
before the spiral idea petered out and oth-
er interests replaced the clarks backers
 worth of electrical machinery
for the work was carried up into these
mountains on mules and an army of chil-
ean peons put to work

  all the machinery is there yet in-
cluding a number of dynamos electric
drills and turbines an engineer who
has recently been over the work stated
that there was easily  worth of
copper reposing on the mountainside

  with all this nothing was accom-
plished the clarks bored in ten or fif-
teen places and then gave up

white takes charge

  white took the bull by the horns the
london houses of the new york firms
of w r grace  co and j p morgan

	co were then financing the under-
taking and had contracted to join the
two lines of road that stuck ineffectively
up into the mountains the chilean gov-
ernment guaranteeing the interest on the
bonds

  white jammed the road through car-
ing little for the steeps forcing it over
the first railroad across south america



the mountains in the shortest simplest
way the oroyo railroad the famous
peruvian road already mentioned has a
great many switchbacks construction
of that sort according to the ideas of this
master engineer was too costly to be con-
sidered even a one-meter road begins
to run into dollars very quickly when its
tracks double -upon themselves many
times

  therefore white ran the trans-an-
dean road up the precipitous barrier on
the chilean side as a railroad has seldom
been run before and never before over
such a distance

  he practically ignored grades for
mile after mile of this mountain section
the grades he planned and built are eight
per cent this means to the man riding
down that the track drops away so fast
that a few feet ahead it literally disap-
pears so far as the eye can see in or-
dinary railroading even in very moun-
tainous districts the maximum grade is
but four per cent

  under ordinary railroad conditions
such a line would not of course be prac-
ticable by making the steepest portions
a rack road however even heavily loaded
freight - trains can readily negotiate the
grades the rack comprises a cogged
track into which mesh specially cogged
wheels upon the engine thus the train
is prevented from slipping back and the
cogged wheels get a purchase that enables
them to climb a very heavy grade

  the operation of the rack system may
well be understood by those who are
familiar with the railroad up pikes peak
the trans-andean road is very similar
the engines have two sets of cylinders
and rack-wheels beside the ordinary dri-
ving-wheels which work simultaneously
and notwithstanding what seems a some-
what complicated mechanism the trains
are able to make close to twenty miles an
hour the engine enters the rack with
scarcely a sound

  peons and mules are the real forces
without which the boring of the fifteen
tunnels which occur in the thirteen high-
est miles of the road would have been im-
possible

  about  men have been at this work
for the past seven years ever since the
new engineering force climbed into the
saddle and mounted from los angeles on

the chilean side up the mountains along
the river aconcagua that has been
about the average size of the construction-
gangs but does not include the men in
the swamps cutting timber for the false
work nor the men scattered over the near-
by country buying mules

carrying a railroad on mules

  the chilean mule has been nearly as
great a factor in the-construction of the
ocean-to-ocean railroad as has the peon
small strong patient unlike the big mis-
souri mules but full of energy these lit-
tle animals have for the past seven years
been the advance guard of the railroad as
it climbed over the mountain-tops

  a mules load averages aiout 
pounds and tons and tons of heavy ma-
chinery to say nothing of timber and
supplies were transported in this man-
ner the hard work killed close to 
a month

  the tunnel work meant much compli-
cated machinery that had to be hauled up
the mountains if a mule could not car-
ry a part it had to be dragged by a team
of mules or at the worst pinched along
with iron bars

  pinching consists of prying underneath
the mass to be moved with crowbars and
advancing it inch by inch sometimes in
mountain railroad work there is no other
way the mules did most of the mov-
ing however and the triumph of this vast
and revolutionary enterprise belongs to
them in part

  one victory of the little beasts was the
carrying of four three-cylinder  horse-
power oil-engines and one of two-cylin-
der  horse-power that drove the air-
compressors for the tunneling at the
mountain-tops three of these engines
were moved with vast toil to the argen-
tine slope while two were placed on the
chilean side

  the larger four of these had to be
knocked down into  pieces it took
one man and four assistants three weeks
to put each engine together

  the peon workmen received six to
eight pesos  to  a day a cu-
rious labor feature was that many of the
gang-bosses were italians these ital-
ians have proved more successful bosses
than the chileans and were hired wher-


the railroad mans magazine

ever possible they received ten pesos
 a day there were practically no
italians at all working on the road as la-
borers

  peons subsist upon potatoes beans
charcha dried cows meat and drink
their native wine on the march of the
railroad they have been living in camps
of wooden buildings covered with corru-
gated iron

obstacles met with

  the dangers of building a railroad up
the chilean slopes of the andes the rest
of the work having been comparatively
speaking childs play have been little
told but we have numerous instances of
men working on narrow shelves being
swept oft into the river below by snow-
slides or engulfed in a torrent of mud
and stones the decrees of fate are ac-
cepted without complaint by these latin-
americans and as their companions dis-
appear one by one they simply cross
themselves say a prayer and go on with
their work oftener than otherwise
bodies are never recovered

  none of the figures of the death role
can be approximated all that is cer-
tain is that the work has gone doggedly
on and there is small fear that the trans-
andean construction company will not
collect the million and a half dollars
bonus due it for finishing the road ahead
of contract time heedless of every-
thing but that of moving forward as rap-
idly as possible engineers gang-bosses
and workmen have striven with the pre-
cision of the most well-drilled armies in
the field

  no part of the world more cruel from
the point of view of the railroad builder
can be imagined nearly  feet
above sea level with the cruel snows that
block the coach road over the uspallata or
c-embre pass between chile and the ar-
gentine to contend with and avalanches
of snow and mud always menacing the
situation is dangerous in the extreme
there is a persistent high and biting
wind and the snow glare grows fearful
to the eyes after a time shortness of
breath and other afflictions of high alti-
tudes add to the list of sufferings

  white the chief was not the only one
who was afflicted with snow blindness

it has been a common malady upon the
trans-andean and scores of engineers
have had to give up their work for this
reason 

  in no other branch of human effort
des ingenuity forethought and the
power of adapting circumstances to ends
count so much as in the construction of
a big mountain railroad

  one instance of where an engineers
keen mind saved a vast quantity of haul-
ing was shown by a scheme he devised
for moving supplies the point he de-
sired to reach was almost directly above
 feet higher up the mountain an al-
most vertical climb the trip by the
coach road required a detour of several
miles and by the railroad line partly
constructed it was almost as far

  the engineer did not hesitate a mo-
ment a glance showed him his oppor-
tunity though from point to point it
was almost a vertical air-line he man-
aged to build an inclined plane road up
the  feet cliff two box cars bal-
anced each other on this one ascending
while the other was descending for
months the box cars on the cable carried
machinery food oil timber doing ayay
with a haulage of at least more than two
miles considering the vast amount of
work it did this temporary inclined plane
road cost almost nothing

what one engine did

  engineering experts interested in the
progress of this andean road have not
yet ceased to talk of an american engine
that made a wonderful freight carrying
record from los andes the chilean end
of the road to the mountain-line ter-
minus

  this engine is -said to have done the
bulk of freight carrying for the construc-
tion work it handled enormous loads
over sections of track that are now using
the rack and did ss without any cog-
wheel traction devices whatever it was
a regular locomotive in all its details ex-
cept in its engine parts these consisted
of a three-cylinder vertical engine bolted
to the side of the boiler with its main
driving shaft connected by universal
joints to all the trucks of the engine and
tender thus making every truck a driver

it did the trick however and did it
the first railroad across south america 

well the history of the trans-andean
railway is filled with incidents such as
this which go to show how the problem
of half a century was solved in record
time it was a big job the biggest sort
of one and carried to completion in spite
of the thousand and one difficulties en-
countered even the timber used in the
tunnel building due to the quick-rotting
characteristics of the native redwood had
to be brought down from puget sound

  there are few bridges along the line
but none of them are very remarkable
whites plans kept the road hugging the
cliffs and closely notched deeply into the
sides of the mountains finding a foot-
hold wherever possible  digging blasting
and here and there bridging a chasm
with a space of concrete reducing ex-
penses and getting results at one and
the same time was his object

  wherever he had to he drove a tun-
nel the summit tunnel is the master-
work of all two miles long directly
under the boundary of the two republics
and  feet under the mountainside
precisely over its center by a peculiar
chance in the uspallata pass is the won-
derful bronze statue of the  christ of the
andes erected by chile and brazil
jointly to symbolize an eternal peace
pact between them

  one piece of bridge-work which de-
serves attention is the  salto soldato
or soldiers leap a single concrete
span which resembles the center of an
hour-glass the canon above and below
having the form of a double bottle

  american rolling stock american rails
and ties are to be used on this road it
must be said however that in the con-
struction work some belgian engines have
given famous service

  thus the trans-andean railroad has
become a reality and the time it takes to
travel from buenos ayres and other
cities of the argentine to valparaiso
santiago and all of chile has been cut
from ten days to twenty-nine hours up
to now unless one cared to ride a day
and a half on muleback or in a jouncing
coach over the uspallata or combre
pass and this was only possible in the
late spring summer or early fall the
only convenient way was to take a steamer
around cape horn such a journey
overland was too venturesome to tempt

many travelers to make it and the mov-
ing of much freight was impractical

a boon to travelers

  the new road also cuts off the same
number of days between chilean ports
and new york london and hamburg
hence its commercial advantages are
enormous and will rapidly grow even
greater building the mountain stretch
has cost over six million dollars but it
is well worth it

  it shortens the route between europe
and the east coasts of south america by
about  miles from ocean to ocean
it is  miles long even in its uncom-
pleted condition with the necessity of
making the journey over the moun-
tains by muleback or by stage the traffic
in  amounted to  passengers

  on the lower sections the tunnels were
driven by hand there are twenty-five
of them in all the locomotives which
are to be used are of the combined type
being equipped with rack wheels and
weigh about  tons each they were
decided on after much experimenting
the contractors believe they are the
heaviest meter gage engines ever built

  wheelwright was the name of the man
who first proposed the road he sent a
communication regarding it to the royal
geographical society of london just
fifty years ago but wheelwright was
only a dreamer he is all but forgotten
now coupled with the history of the
trans-andean road will go the names of
grace morgan white and mcginnis

  south america has long been waiting
for such a railroad it has many lines of
tracks but they only fragmentarily serve
the needs of trade the continents
great volume of commerce is principally
carried on over its vast network of rivers
in semi-primitive fashion huge sections
of territory yet await exploration in
brazil and bolivia here is still the
great field of river navigation the ori-
noco on the north the amazon the
parana and the river de la platte fur-
ther on the south the magdalena in co-
lombia the rio negro in southern ar-
gentina and the san francisco in cen-
tral brazil the amazon system alone
contains  miles of water that is
commercially navigable
taking orders from death

by peter mulligan

when coupling cars meant holding up a link with one hand and drop-
ping a pin with the other while the draw-heads tried to crush out
your life in their vise-like grip being a member of a train-crew was
on a par with wearing the khaki and letting molos take pot-shots at you with
their rusty mausers

    those were the days when the grim reaper claimed a heavy toll and the
railroad men who met death with their boots on was more than double the
number in these days of the standard gage and the janney coupler only
men who either put no value at all upon their lives or were brave to thepoint
of recklessness could have stood the strain of setting brakes on an old-fash-
ioned double-gage road with its broad and narrow jimmies jumping about in
the freedom of their three-link couplings and trying to shoulder each other
off the track-which they quite often succeeded in doing

although the door of the caboose was frequently hung with crape
it was difficult to dampen the spirits of the
courageous crews

like this with them as they pulled into
the main track never did reach to-mor-
row and there were others too who
laughed at its evil record and managed
to stop short of the line

  and at that it was one of those ab-
surd old-fashioned cabooses that rocked
and bumped and groaned and squealed
and seemed to have a premonition that
the train behind would catch up some
day and boost it down the grade making
it more ridiculous and undignified than
ever

   a cabooses grim record

  but of course it did not happen that
way premonitions are -great deceivers
the man who kept off the water because
he was sure he was preordained to be
drowned got hanged and the old ca-
boose that expected to be lifted from be-
hind and turned on its nose in the ditch
got mixed up in-but wait a minute let

he man who named the ca-
boose evidently regarded it
in a comical light try to
think a few tragic thoughts
about it and you find it is
impossible the name is
against it it is difficult for any one to
regard it seriously there it goes bob-
bing along at the end of the train like
an old woman shooing her chickens
caboose

  but there was a caboose that used to
make men shiver when they climbed
aboard there have been others too but
none that sent such cascades of cold
pouring down the spinal column as it
jerked forward out of the yard with a
groan every man in it would say to him-
self   i take that all back about what

i	was going to do to-morrow ill make
this little run first and then if  am still
moving around ill consider the matter
further

  quite a few men who carried thoughts
taking orders from death



the caboose come to its ignominious and
well-deserved end all in good time

  it was no -held in unpleasant
memory-and its wheels were six feet
apart to fit the track of the erie twenty-
five years ago this comical old piece
of rolling stock after taking home the
bodies of a score of men killed in hand-
ling the train rounded out its career by
wearing mourning for a solid year

  it is safe to say that this record is
unequaled in the history of railroading
it means that it was in at the death of
twelve members of its crew within twelve
months as mourning was only worn for
each victim one month with four or
five men in a train crew as they used to
be made up on the erie a toll of twelve
meant more than two complete crews in
fact it was three as the conductor lived
through it all only to ride old  to a
more sudden and unexpected end than
any of his crews

  war could not have done worse the
same piece of crape tacked to the door
hung there until it was weather-worn
each time as a month rounded towards
its close and the crew thought that at
last the spell had been broken then a
crash and a groan and  had regis-
tered another victim

   i was only on her for two months at
the end said the sole survivor in remi-
niscent horror  but i saw two of the
twelve die bennett who began break-
ing with me to take the place of a man
who had been killed was climbing over
an empty coal dump known as a  jim-
my and was right in the middle when
the train gave a jerk that opened the
dump and threw him flat on the track
the other was cline who succeeded him
at newburgh junction he was making
a three-link coupling when his foot be-
came caught between two rails and the
train cut off both his legs i helped carry
liim home-there was no other place to
take him-and there he bled to death

  of the other ten six were killed ma-
king couplings one was hurled from the
top of a box car by a sudden jerk and
the other three started out from the ca-
boose in the night to iset the brakes and
were found afterwards on the track
ground to pulp

  marvin the conductor figured it out
that he must have a charmed life but

one day while sitting in the old caboose
an engine which was getting ready to
blow up drew in alongside and when
it went off like a big fire-cracker it
caught  with marvin inside and did
not even leave the hoodoo

  this is the most complete single and
startling record left from the old days of
the double rail on the erie which lasted
for a period of ten years and is the
bloodiest piece of railroading ever
known where there is one man killed
on the erie to-day the veterans assert
that there were five hundred who met
their ends at that terrible time death
rode on every train and  they had a
man for breakfast  every morning

mixing the gages

  it was all brought about by a fact that
is not known even by most of the men
who are operating the erie to-day the
erie was one of the first railroads and
was laid with a six-foot gage once
started that way it was extended at the
same gage and for forty years engines

the train cut off both his legs


the railroad mans magazine

the size of a barn-door hauled cars as
wide as a house all the way from new
york city to thk great lakes

  when it was decided to narrow down
the old gage was left for the use of the
old rolling stock and cars of both gages
were hauled in the same trains death
lurked between the gages and the men
who worked those trains flirted with it
every moment of their runs

  in making up the trains there was not
time to separate the broad and the nar-
row gage cars and they were hooked
together indiscriminately the draw-
heads missed each other by a foot and
to make the coupling it was necessary to
use three links or two full links and one
broken link a coupling that was called
the toggle with so much iron between
the cars when the train was taut there
often was a jump of about five feet to
make

  if the cars were of the same height
this was not so bad but it was an adven-
ture to cross if they were not the com-
bination most disliked was having a
jimmy between two box cars the jim-
mies were mounted from the side and to
reach the steps the brakeman had to let
go with both hands and throw himself
forward trusting to luck that he would
land if just at that moment the train

suddenly picked up or dropped slack that
was safely the end of him

  in icy weather in pitch black night
on an uneven track-is it any wonder the
deaths were counted by hundreds

riding with death

  they were gay wild fellows who were
running the erie in those days if the
few who survived are any indication but
the accidents had a trick of happening in
such an order that they did not grow
hardened as soon as one big wreck
took place there would be two more al-
most immediately it was uncanny and
it sent many a train crew out for a run
with a pretty sure hunch that some one
was going to come to the end of his rope
with a sudcten jerk before the night was
over

  the first question every train crew
asked the moment it reached the end of
the division or upon appearing for work
was anybody killed if as was
usually the case they heard the details
of some awful accident they lost a little
of their starch and stepped lively to see
if they could not prevent themselves
from being counted two or three its
all well enough to laugh at it as a super-
stition now but it was too real to be
neglected

  coupling was the worst the old pin
was bad enough on any road but hook-
ing together a narrow and a broad-gage
car was ten times as dangerous the
brakeman had to stand so that one draw-
head would drive him into the other car
if he did not make the coupling right on
the second and jump back to safety
the stories of those who failed run be-
yond reckoning and all have the same
ghastly similarity

getting rid of the man-eaters

  some cars seemed to have a personal
animus and killed for the joy of slaugh-
ter two became notorious and were
known from one end of the line to the
other they were iron coal-dumps stan-
dard gage built as samples to see how
they would work in comparison with the
old-fashioned wooden jimmies fortu-
nately no others were ever put into serv-
ice for they could hardly have had
taking orders from death

bloodier careers if they had been built
as engines of destruction

  the dead wood at the end of the steel
dumps was just narrow enough to miss
the coupling on the jimmies but wide
enough to pin a brakeman fast at first
the danger in them was not realized but
it was noticed before long that a man
who was caught between one of them
and a jimmy did not get off with a mere
squeezing and a dislocated liver it al-
ways killed

  then word was passed along the line
that they were as dangerous to handle as
dynamite and an unspoken agreement
was made to get rid of them

  they began to have accidents they
did not seem to be able to keep the rails
and now and then they turned up un-
accountably in the ditch but each time
they were jerked back and put into the
service again and still their bloody
record grew inured as the crews were
to accidents they hated to see those
dumps in the train  they knew it meant
trouble

  a flagman a white-haired conductor
now solved the problem the two
dumps were together one night and were
being shoved up an incline that ended in
a sheer drop the flagman saw the
chance when the first was at the right
spot he signaled to give it an extra
shove and over it went tearing away
from the coupling and smashing into an
unusable mass

  just one mote little shove he cried
to the engineer  ah there she goes
and thats the last of those man-eating
dumps

  couplings had to be loose otherwise
the cars would have been jerked off the
track sideways at the best the strain
between two cars of different gages was
all the rails could stand when a train
started forward and couplings went taut
it sounded like a rattle of musketry
each car received a jolt more violent
than theone before and by -the time the
caboos was reached it was almost pulled
in two

   as the track was full of little pitches
every now and then an extra little jerk
would pass through the traina even in
motion and old timers tell many a tale
of men who were not expecting it being
whirled from the t<j>p of a car but much

   	r r

 more common was death from the break-
 ing of a coupling when the strain
 slackened and was picked up again sud-
 denly a pin was liable to jump out or
 a coupling break if a man was passing
 from one car to another at that inauspi-
 cious moment down he went between the
 wheels

how sully disciplined them

    stories that are much more easily told
 are of the funny things that happened
 there was one engineer pete sufly who
 made use of the slack for his own pur-
 poses he was older than most of the
 men and had an idea they needed a little

trusting to luck he would land safely
	the railroad mans magazine

disciplining as he could not tell what of leaning over the water barrel and

was going on in the caboose he would
give it a little jar now and then just to
keep the crew on the watch occasion-
ally he made a random shot that went
home

  dallas washer later a victim of a
broken coupling had a leaning towards
pie that struck pete sully as inordinate
and he always had something to say
about it if anything went wrong he
laid it to washers fondness for pie one
night as they were whirling through
west paterson on the late freight he
turned around and noticed that there
were no tail lights on the train

   there now he said  washers at
it again ill just jar him up a little so
hell know im thinking of him

  washer was in fact in the caboose

he buried his face deep in the thick
black paste

holding in both hands a whole thick
juicy huckleberry pie and he was just
putting it up to his mouth hungrily when
the jar came his hands flew up and
his head down and he buried his face
deep in the thick black paste

  sully of course heard about it and
it inspired him to other efforts trapper
winfield later a widely known erie con-
ductor but then a greaser had a habit

sticking his head out the window at times
when sully thought he would do better
to be at work but winfield only
laughed at sully and leaned over -the
barrel as usual sully planned his les-
son waiting until the train was just
starting on a steep down grade and all
the cars were being carried forward with
an extra impetus he threw on the reverse
and took up about eighty feet of slack

it came so suddenly that winfield did
not have time to draw back the jar
tore the water barrel loose from its fas-
tenings and over it went sousing win-
field to the skin sully saw his head dis-
appear as he went down to the floor and
cried out

   ah ha my fine boy your roosting
place is gone

  but sullys particular antipathy was a
dandified chap who lived in paterson
and ran down to new york several
nights a week the freight that sully
hauled left jersey city after the last pas-
senger-train and this man made a habit
of returning just in time to catch the
freight lie even went so far as to ob-
tain special permission from the company
to ride on that freight sully eyed him
with disfavor from the start and ques-
tioned the crew as to where he as in the
habit of sitting whether he went to sleep
and if so his relative position-to walls
benches and tables

         punishing a passenger

  waiting until one night when the pat-
erson man had on his evening clothes and
his high hat sully put his information
to use according to his custom the 
passenger leaned back in a chair and
braced his feet against the forward end
of the car in five minutes as usual he
was asleep with his head between his
knees and his high hat pointed directly
at the wall

  the train was extra slack that night
and when sully threw on the reverse it
jerked the caboose forward with a rush
and brought it to a dead stop sully was
entirely successful he drove the pater-
son mans hat clear up to his chinnd
they liitd to cut it off

  the jimmies made the trains partic-
ularly loose as they were short and had
taking orders from death



 only single trucks they were also
 highly sensitive and half a dozen of
 them between two heavier cars would at
 the least provocation jump over each
 other like a flock of sheep

mose jordan formerly yardmaster at
the jersey city terminal but a brakeman
and freight-conductor in the days of the
double rail gave some idea how it was
 from the stories he told

    one day we were coming through
 the outerkills he said  picking up
 empties at all the side tracks and before
 long we had nineteen jimmies in a string
 this left a lot of slack in the train and
 every time we stopped or started it
 sounded like a roll of thunder i was
 in the cab with billy johnson the engi-
 neer and he was picking up and letting
 out on the speed rather recklessly

when the jimmies jumped

    the trouble came all at once i
 had just turned around to see what had
 become of carter my rear brakeman
 when johnson threw on the reverse a
 little too sudden quick as a wink the
 whole train shortened up and the heavy
 cars in the rear set the jimmies to jump-
 ing carter was right in the middle of
 one when it broke its coupling and made
 a flying leap to the second one ahead
 at every jump he landed on top and
 after some of the finest gymnastics you
 ever saw there he was twenty-five feet
 in the air on top of the pile of nineteen
 jimmies

     it was right in front of a station
 but the operator lived on a farm half a
 mile away and i started across the fields
 to get him just about the time i was
 all out of breath from running and curs-
 ing the whole race of operators at the
 same time i tripped on a pumpkin-vine
 and there i lay swearing i would never
 run a train again in my life when i
 heard carter perched up there in the air
 give me the laugh johnson was another
 of those laughing fellows and there the
 two of them sat just watching me and
 enjoying it while i scared up the wreck-
 ing crew it made me hot and i got up
 anil came walking slowly back

  now mr carter i said you can
 just come down off your jimmies and go
 get your own wrecking crew

  johnson piled up so many jimmies
jordan went on that he gradually
grew more careful and after he had
smashed in the end of his own nose for
being too free with the throttle no mat-
ter what was in the road he would not
pull up in a hurry

ditching a section-crew

   coming around a curve one day he
saw the section-crew on a hand-car ahead

  the jar tore the water barrel loose

but he had no intention of jeopardizing
his jimmies for them although they
thought he had it didnt kill any of
them but it dumped the whole outfit
into a swamp johnson watched them
go and it struck him funny so he sat
there and laughed and kept on laughing
until the section-crew got sore since he
had hurt his nose his laugh also had a
peculiarly unpleasant sound there was
an old irishman in the crew and he was
sitting there in the swamp trying to
knock the dents out of his dinner pail

  laugh on you can afford it ol flat
nose he said as if he had not just missed
being run clown  but if you had to put
out a good dollar fer a new bucket youd

synopsis of previous chapters

vincent wilson having risen from the apprentice shop to mechanical superintendent
of the mainland system has discovered what he believes to be a leak in the affairs of
the company and criticizes to president harvey jones the action of the board of directors
on voting  for certain purchases wilson visits a former employee of the mainland
system ioc ferguson who imparts to him the information that kaintuck a former
friend of both had developed leprosy and been sent to the leper settlement at molokai  kain-
tuck  was betrothed to a beautiful girl meriel planquette whose address wilson is very
desirous of obtaining from doc doc refuses to give this information unless wilson
pays him  meriel planquette after kaintuck had been sent to the leper settle-
ment married john toylmore formerly new york representative of the mainland system
who shortly after their marriage had been killed in an automobile accident she now has
many suitors among them bertrand clivers an elderly broker and jimmie winters young
and impetuous she loves the latter and promises to marry him but is won over at the
very last moment by clivers and leaves with him for europe

jimmie with more courage than he ever
imagined he possessed called at the con-
tinental for the express purpose of seeing
meriel

  that love for woman that no man can
banish when once it gets hold of him
had laid its tentacles on jimmies heart
he was still madly blindly deeply in
love with the woman notwithstanding the
miserable manner in which she had treat-
ed him

  he was still mad in his infatuation it
would not wear away no other thought
seemed sufficiently powerful to cnish it
within him

  he must-see meriel-he was going to
see her and tell her that he still loved
her and that her husband had married
her for no good purpose

  he approached the massive entrance of
the continental-his courage increasing
every second

  the avenue was bright with the morn-
ing sunshine hundreds of gay prosper-
ous new yorkers were strolling along the
sidewalks-for fifth avenue is ever the
favorite place of promenade for the new

      the woman he loved

      o meriel planquette became
        airs bertrand clivers and
        jimmie winters made up his
        mind that he would be re-
        venged it mattered little to
        him when whete or liow-
        but he was going to be re-
        venged clivers would suffer for de-
        liberately stealing the woman he loved

  but mr and mrs clivers had not gone
to europe that was merely a bluff it
was simply intended to put jimmie off
the track they took a spacious suite of
rooms in the continental-a great glit-
tering hotel on fifth avenue

  it was announced in the papers to the
effect that  bertrand clivers the emi-
nent financier and promoter who recently
married the widow of the late john toyl-
more after a charming romance had ta-
ken rooms at the continental hotel
where they would entertain extensively
two days after this notice appeared


the railroad mans magazine

yorker-and on a fine day it is one of
the rare sights of the world

  carriages gay with many liveries and
smooth-sliding automobiles filed up and
down guided in the proper direction by
the well-knit military-looking mounted
police that constitute one of the most
prized departments of the metropolis-
the traffic squad

  jimmie winters wondered if all the
people that he saw were as unhappy as
lie he wondered if any other man had
nestling in his heart so cruel and hurtful
a thorn

  just then his eye was arrested by a huge
orange-colored touring-car that glided up
to the entrance of the continental

  it was hardly fifty feet from him

  the chauffeur brought it to a halt

  one of the liveried attendants of the
hotel pirouetted down the steps and
opened the door of thecar meriel
stepped out

  she was arrayed in all the gorgeousness
of the world of fashion from her dainty
shoes to her hat she was a thing for all
women to envy and all men to admire

  jimmie hastened his footsteps here
was his chance fate could not have
treated him more kindly

  in another moment he was by her side

   meriel  he said tremblingly  me-
riel  

  she turned full upon him the hotel
attendant who was carrying her cloak ad-
vanced as if to protect her

  but there was something in jimmies
face that told the attendant that he was
not so much an interloper as his action
might indicate

  meriel turned several colors in as many
seconds and drew herself up in all her
haughtiness before she spoke

   what do you want   she asked

   i want to speak to you meriel

   mrs clivers please

  her tone indicated her cold - blooded
imperiousness clearly she was the wom-
an who would marry for money who
would love for money who would give all
that was nearest and dearest to her for
money

   i want to speak to you meriel said
jimmie  i wrant to speak to you i
want to tell you-

  his voice was trembling she feared
that he would break down and create a

scene-and it would never do for her to
be the central figure in a fifth avenue
sidewalk tragedy especially as she had
reaped the goal of her desire-marriage
to a real millionaire of the new york
world of finance

   come in she said softly

  jimmie obeyed he was glad that she
seemed to be showing some degree of com-
mon sense once inside the hotel she
led the way to the oriental room-a heav-
ily furnished heavily perfumed dimly
lit parlor near the main office where two
people could hold a quiet conversation
in a quiet corner without being disturbed
by prying eyes

  meriel picked out a large divan hung
and surrounded by a mass of east indian
and turkish trappings she sat in one
corner partly hidden ffom any observer
and jimmie took a seat by her side

  jimmie what did you mean by ac-
costing me in that way 

   i couldnt help it meriel-i had to
see you-i just had to 

   how did you find out that i am stop-
ping at this hotel  

   i read it in the papers

  meriel brightened and smiled faintly
clivers was a good press-agent anyhow

   how could you have done it me-
riel you know that i love you-you
promised to marry me-you knew that my
whole life was centered on making you
my wife how could you meriel

  the woman smiled it was the sar-
donic smile of cheap contempt

  oh jimmie she said finally i
didnt take you seriously

   didnt take me seriously after what
i said-what i did great heaven me-
riel what do you call  seriously then 
come jimmie dont-be an angry
boy you will get over this sooneror la-
ter some nice girl will come along and
you will marry her and make her a good
husband

  his hand resting on the divan was close
to hers she stroked it as one would pat
a pet dog

   she arose as if to go

  jimmie rose too and confronted her
 meriel he said with some firmness
 where are you going 

  jimmie-you fool i must dress for
luncheon

  he caught her by the wrist llis grasp
-	s 

president of the line	

was tightened by his anger his fingers
seemed to press into her flesh like the
blades of a knife he hurt her his
face showed that he meant to hurt her-
but she knew better than to cry out

  jimmie-dont she muttered under
her breath

   meriel he said with more determi-
nation than she believed he possessed

 there will be no luncheon for you until
you have heard me

    you let that vile brute steal you from
me yes-steal you from me  the dog
stole you from me-and-by all that is
good he has got to pay the penalty 

   he gritted his teeth in the intensity of -
his meaning he weighed each word
carefully in order to bring out their full
impressiveness but spoke hardly louder
than an ordinary whisper the other oc-
cupants of the room had not the slightest
indication that anything out of the ordi-
nary was happening between them

   he stole you from me meriel-you
whom i love and worship-and he is go-
ing to pay for it i will have revenge
even if it takes my life i cant tell you
how much i hate him i cant tell you
how much pleasure it will give me to see
him suffer 

  -ie released his grip meriel looked
at him for a moment if she grasped the
fact that his determined face showed only
too plainly that he meant every word he
said she did not give any indication

   good-by she said  i must not
talk to you any more youre a bad boy
jimmie

  she walked away jimmies eyes fob
lowed her until she had turned the corner
of the hall and vanished indeed she
was beautiful such a face such a figure
such wonderful eyes such a fascinating
manner thought the young man-just the
sort of woman worth fighting for-and
fight he would

   i wish i didnt love her so he said
to himself as he stepped out into the main
office of the hotel

chapter vir

the conversation in 

timmie winters dropped into one
 of the huge leather chairs that
adorned the corridors of the great hostel-

ry pie wanted to think-he wanted to
be alone to plan his revenge

  the more he thought the more he be-
came convinced that he would never fal-
ter even in the slightest degree from the
course of his revenge when he had it
thoroughly planned

   even if i kill him said the boy to
himself  i mia  not care many a man
has killed for the woman he loves but
no-that would be cowardly

  he sank back in a reverie heedless of
the people who passed to and fro  just
why lie waited in the hotel he did not
know it did not occur to him to do
anything else some inward force told
him that he had better stay there for a
while something might turn up 

  he might see meriel again-and he
might see her husband

   the latter lie would walk straight
up to him and-

  he arose and walked up and down the
long hall lined with its rich and easy
idlers many of whom were gathering for
the luncheon-hour to the preoccupied
youth they were only automatic chatter-
boxes if there were any pretty women
among them jimmie didot notice them
he strolled up one corridor and down an-
other until finally he reached a little al-
cove off the main hallway

  in a corner of the alcove two men were
sitting their heads were together and
they were talking in an earnest whisper
looking furtively about- now and then as
if fearing an intruder

  one of the men was vincent wilson
the other was tom trade-the star
sleuth of the detective bureau of the new
york police department

  just what drew jimmie winters to be
interested in them he hardly knew try-
ing to appear as disinterested as possible
he took a seat near them pulled a letter
from his pocket and pretended to read

  the other men looked at him for an in-
stant and then assuming that he had no
interest in what they were saying resumed
their talk

  you say she is living here said
tom tracie to vincent wilson

   yes i am sure of it replied vin-
cent wilson  ive traced her to this
place

  what is her married name asked
the detective
 

the railroad mans magazine

   clivers said the younger man

  at the sound of the name jimmie gave
a sudden start-so sudden indeed that it
might have frightened the two men had
they not been particularly interested in
their own conversation

  they talked at length but although
jimmie jieard an occasional word or two-
in which certain large sums of money and
 graft  and  theft  were mentioned he
could gather nothing that would give him
a lead as to the direct nature of the sub-
ject of the two strangers

  still his keen intuition told him that
it was in connection with meriels hus-
band

  he must make the acquaintance of the
men

  it would not do to thrust himself upon
them-that would be undiplomatic

  he would wait until the proper time
came he would follow them and find
out where they went and call on them at
their offices if possible they finally
arose to go

  jimmie noticed them as they shook
hands the elder man said so loud that
he could plainly hear 

   i am sure that we will get at the bot-
tom of this 

  they walked down the hall together
stopping once or twice to renew their
talk and when they reached the main
street door they parted

  the detective turned down the avenue
the younger man went to the hotel desk
and nodded to the clerk who handed him
a key then he turned to one of the ele-
vators and went up-stairs

  there was nothing for jimmie to do
now but ask the clerk the mans name
he walked up to the desk and said ha-
stily 

   will you please tell me the name of
that gentleman to whom you just gave
his room key  

  the clerk alive to the numerous agents
and grafters and runners in for gambling-
places who frequent all large hotels
forestalled jimmie by saying that it was
not the policy of the hotel to give the
names of its guests to strangers

   i should like to know particularly
for i think that i can do him a service
said jimmie  my name is winters
and jimmie handed the clerk a card read-
ing

  mr james e winters walter f
winters  co brokers new york

   i am mr walter winterss son said
jimmie to clench his identity

  and clench it he did the name of
walter winters stood for all that was a
in wall street and the clerk knew it
besides the firm had branch offices on
the foyer hall of the hotel and it would
have been an easy matter to have proven
the identity further

   thats all right mr winters said
the clerk  the man to whom you refer
is mr vincent wilson he is a railroad
man connected with the mainland sys-
tem

   could you arrange for me to meet
him asked jimmie recognizing the
fact fully that his question was somewhat
nervy

  the clerk was not amiss to do the well-
known brokers son a favor certainly
there could be no harm in it jimmie
winters was a young man of great re-
spectability and furthermore thought
-the clerk any one could not go wrong
doing a favor to such a man

   i will certainly introduce you if i
happen to see him around said the clerk
 but -here he hesitated a second-
why not send up your card i will
phone to him and tell him who you are

   i wish you would said jimmie  i
will consider it a great favor-and i shall
be glad to return it some time

   not at all mr winters said the
clerk

  he went into the private office to tele-
phone j immie waited outside trem-
bling in every nerve-he knew not why

  presently the clerk emerged

   mr wilson will be very glad to have
you go up to his room it is no 
on the sixth floor front he continued
calling to a bell-boy  show this gentle-
man up to 

  jimmie tried to offer thanks but the
clerk politely bowed and was gone

  three minutes later jimmie knocked
at the door of 

  vincent wilson opened it and bade
him enter wilson recognized instantly
the young man who had taken the seat in
the alcove so close to tracie and himself
and broke the ice of the situation by say-
ing pleasantly
president of the line



   i believe i saw you sitting down-stairs
a short while ago mr winters

   yes replied jimmie  and you must
pardon me when i tell you that i over-
heard a part of the conversation between
you and your friend that is what brought
me here  dont know but i may be of
some service to you

   i hope so said wilson in the same
pleasant manner that always characterized
his conversation

   first of all let me tell you who i
am and why i am here jimmie began

  recognizing that he was the aggressor
so to speak vincent wilson had the right
to a perfect and thorough acquaintance
of the man who had intruded on him so
he told him all about his family as well
as himself and added that if mr wilson
had any doubts as to whom he was deal-
ing with all he had to do was to step
down-stairs into the branch office of win-
ters  co and satisfy himself

  vincent wilson was satisfied he in-
vited jimmie to a seat closed the tran-
som over the door evidently to indicate
that he wanted secrecy he was as anx-
ious to hear what jimmie had to say as
the young man was to tell it

   what did i say that aroused your
interest mr winters asked wilson

   you spoke of a woman - mrs
clivers

   do you know her 

   yes replied jimmie with just a
breath of hesitancy if a blush slipped
onto his cheek vincent wilson did not
notice it

   well said wilson  since you have
taken me into your confidence i will take
you into mine the only agreement that
i will ask regarding what i may say to
you is this in the event of our conversa-
tion turning out to be absolutely useless
to both of us we agree never to divulge
to a third party what we may say here

   i agree to that heartily said jim-
mie

  both men shook hands to seal the com-
pact

   i am employed by the mainland sys-
tem began wilson  and in my official
capacity with that railroad i discovered
certain things that led me to believe that
some one connected with the road is ta-
king money for his personal use to be
plain some one has been grafting

  my god exclaimed jimmie won-
dering how meriel could be connected
with such a charge

   i brought my suspicions before the
president of the company after con-
vincing myself that if i could find meriel
planquette  could secure from iter-un-
der pressure perhaps-certain informa-
tion that would lead to the culprit

   miss planquette was a poor girl in
our town and was engaged to a young
fellow now in the leper settlement at
molokai shortly after he went there she
fell in love with a man who showered her
with jewels and disappeared

   there is an old fellow out in our
town who keeps tabs on her pretty close-
ly for some reason or other his name is
 doc  ferguson i tried to get him to tell
me miss planquettes address but he de-
manded five thousand dollars for the in-
formation

   gee whiz-z-z  said the now startled
and surprised jimmie that was quite
a price 

   i guess that ferguson saw that 
needed his information badly and he put
his price at the top notch

   it isnt possible that she-that she-
could have-

  jimmie didnt attempt the rest of his
thought it was too much to think for
an instant that meriel-his meriel-
could have been mixed up in a shady
matter

   i dont say that she had any direct
connection with the theft but i do think
that she could give some information that
would lead to the possible capture of the
thief

   do you mean to tell me that she may
have been mixed up in a crooked transac-
tion or the friend of any one whom she
knew to be a thief and a grafter  asked
jimmie with considerable force hardly
satisfied with wilsons answer

   to the first part of your question i
would answer  no   to the second part
i would say  i do not know 

  there was a pause jimmie was think-
ing with set face wilson finally said 

   tell me your interest in her mr
winters remember we are speaking in
the strictest confidence

  jimmie did not answer

   you very kindly gave me the most
satisfactory reference as to your stand-


the railroad mans magazine

ing wilson continued  if you have
any doubts regarding me you are at lib-
erty to wire at my expense tothe presi-
dent of the mainland system-mr har-
vey jones our home offices are in louis-
ville kentucky

  -ie waited a moment then jimmie
said 

   thank you mr wilson there is no
occasion to do that i am satisfied as to
your position and i believe in you i-
i was engaged to mrs clivers you will
respect my feelings i know when i tell
you that i am deeply in love with her
and she seemed to be in love with me

   our wedding day was set i had gone
home to boston where my mother lives
to break the news to her when i returned
to new york a few days later and called
at her apartments  was told by her but-
ler that in the meantime she had married
clivers	 

   now said jimmie rising and bring-
ing his hand down on a near-by table to
add every possible emphasis to what he
was going to say- now clivers is the
man i want to get even with  he stole
the woman i loved when she promised to
marry me  hate him with a hatred
that is something awful mr wilson-
and i want to have my revenge

  if there was the slightest quota of
doubt in what jimmie had just said it
was shattered by the intensity of his ex-
pression vincent wilson saw in the set
and rigid muscles of the young mans face
that he was determined to make good his
threat

   did you always know her as meriel
planquette asked wilson

   when i first met her she had just
moved to new york she was then the
wife of a man named john toylmore
who was killed in an automobile acci-
dent

   what kind of a fhap is this clivers 
asked wilson again

   ive got him sized up as a fake pro-
moter and a paper capitalist he makes
money but just how nobody seems to
know we wouldnt carry his account
and i doubt if any respectable brokerage
firm in the city will have anything to do
with him hes a big burly man well
dressed and he certainly has plenty of
money	t

   this interests me mr winters i

 want to get a look at this man he is
 staying here with his wife lets go down
 and get some luncheon they may be in
 the dining-room now

        chapter viii
        meriel at luncheon

 yincent wilson and jimmie
  winters went down-stairs and
 found an unoccupied table at a far end
 of the large dining - room where most
 of the guests and those who regularly
 lunched at the continental took their mid-
 day meal

   the table was in the remotest corner
 of the room but so situated that wilson
 and winters had a complete view of the
 entire room

    they ordered a light repast over which
 they lingered for an hour and a half
 during which time they reviewed every
 detail of the case as they were interested
 in it at the end of their talk they were
 on an excellent understanding

    they trusted each other implicitly and
 while vincent wilson did not take too
 much to heart -the value of the revenge
 that jimmie would have orr his enemy
 he was willing to help his young friend
 and jimmie was willing to give vincent
 every possible assistance to learn the
 source of the leak in the mainland sys-
 tems finances

   they were about to give up their quest
 when jimmie who had been scanning the
 dining - room entrance suddenly stopped
 talking

 there she is now he said touching
his companions arm and indicating the
dark handsome well-dressed woman who
 was entering and asking the head waiter
to show her a table

   wilson saw her he would never have
 recognized the graceful gentle well-
 groomed woman as the poor girl whom he
 remembered only indistinctly in louis-
 ville

     by jove she does look fine  he said

   but where was mr clivers apparent-
 ly she was alone

   she was unaccompanied much to the
 discomfort of the two men she crossed
 the room under escort of the head waiter
 and took a table some distance from them

    now remember winters there is
president of the line



only one thing that i ask and that is that
you will arrange it somehow so that i
can see mrs clivers i only have eight
or ten questions that  want to ask her

   i will do the best i can said jim-
mie  suppose that i go over and talk
to her now  

   clivers may-be in the hallway lurk-
ing around suggested wilson

  oh im not afraid of him jimmie
replied smiling

  his plan was to get meriel in conver-
sation and then call vincent wilson to
her table under the guise of an old
friend

  meriel was not startled when she
looked up and saw jimmie by her chair
indeed she was too good an actress and
too diplomatic ever to let a situation get
the best of her she greeted jimmie as if
he had never had the slightest difference
with her

  jimmie was the first to speak

    meriel he said  i want you to for-
give me if i hurt you this morning you
must really overlook it i have worried
about you-and  am sorry

   dont mention it jimmie she said
 im glad to see you sensible again and
im sure that we can always be good
friends

  then she invited him to sit down a
waiter drew up a chair

   may i ask where the  better half 
is  he asked

    i just said good-by to him for a while
he has to run over to louisville for three
or four days on business it is a place
that i do not care much about so i stay
at home and she smiled as she spoke

   my said jimmie with feigned sur-
prise- fleeing from so beautiful a bride
already 

  then followed a lot of insincere small
talk for neither meant a word that was
said meriel had married the pompous
clivers for his money she knew it-but
she veered from talking about-it in her
heart she had all of her old love for jim-
mie but she wanted to smother it as much
as possible whenever he was around

  as for jimmie the method that he was
about to pursue was being slowly thought
out and carefully planned even as he
spoke to her if he could bring to her
in some way the proof that bertrand
clivers was not all that he represented

himself to be-merely an impostor-she
might be induced to divorce the financier
and return to him

  jimmie looked around and saw vincent
wilson still sitting at the table

    there is a friend of mine at a table
opposite said jimmie may i call
him over and introduce him 

  the tension of talking commonplaces
to jimmie had begun to wear and me-
riel glad of any interruption to change
the subject acquiesced

   jimmie with-his customary gallantry
arose bowed walked over to where wil-
son was still sitting and returned with
the railroad man after the introduction
and when the three were seated jimmie
broke the silence 

    mr wilson is a friend of mine from
louisville

    oh indeed  

    yes vincent broke in  louisville
has been my home for a number of years
i went to school there

    indeed repeated meriel

   i hope to go there some day said
jimmie   am told that it is a beautiful
city

   indeed said meriel again  have
you been to any of the theaters here since
your arrival mr wilson she contin-
ued turning to the railroad man and
somewhat anxious to change the subject
from louisville

  wilson said that he had not meriel
finished her last sip of tea jimmie pre-
cluded a lot of dry-rot conversation if
they sat there any longer and was greatly
relieved when meriel rose wilson did
not ply her with any questions

   just as tjiey were saying good-by jim-
mie asked meriel when mr clivers would
return from louisville it was not that
he cared to know he would probably
have been delighted if mr clivers had
met his death in louisville he asked it
only as a matter of the most abject polite-
ness

    sunday night replied meriel with
her sweetest smile he arrives here on
the seven oclock train

   	she entered the elevator and the men
were alone

   thank heaven you asked her that
last question said wilson  how did
you know that i wanted to know when
clivers would return


the railroad mans magazine

   i dont know why i asked her that
particular question replied jimmie

 it seemed to be the only thing that i
had in mind at the time somehow or
other it was mighty hard to talk to her

   will you meet me here sunday night
when clivers arrives asked wilson

   surely said jimmie but dont ask
me to introduce him to you i dont want
to insult you

    dont want to meet him said wil-
son   i only want to see him -for some
reason or other my intuition tells me that
 must get a look at this man i will
have tom trade of the detective bureau
with me

  all right said jimmie we three
will meet right here at seven oclock sharp
on sunday night

chapter ix

the late arrival

they parted and vincent wilson
- hurried down to the metropolitan
police building where he found tom
trade to the detective he related all
that happened that afternoon

  tracie listened eagerly he was per- 
fectly willing to make theengagement for
sunday evening as he had been assigned
to the case to ssist- wilson but he
couldnt see what good could be gained
by getting a peep at clivers

  but wilson insisted that he had a
 hunch  that clivers should be looked
over  and when i get these hunches
said vincent  something usually comes
of them

  at seven oclock sunday night the three
lfien after a jolly dinner at the conti-
nental at which jimmie made a most
agreeable host found a comfortable
lounge in the main hall of the hotel in-
quiry proved that the train from louis-
ville-the fast express on which passen-
gers traveled who wanted to make time-
was some fifteen minutes late and the trio
settled down to kill time

  as the moments wore on jimmie now
and then took out his watch with some
uneasiness

  maybe clivers wasnt coming that
night maybe meriel had made a mis-
take or weis only fooling them perhaps
after all it was a fools errand on which
they were bent

  it was nearly thirty minutes past sev-
en and clivers had not arrived jim-
mie was clearly nervous but the other
men more used to meeting obstacles
only laughed at his uneasiness

   i will go to the clerk and ask if the
train is any la-

   jimmie did not finish his sentence
clivers was entering two bell-boys
rushed toward him grabbed his valises
and made for the elevators they knew
mr clivers was already registered and
did not escort him as is customory to the
clerks desk

   there he is now said jimmie as the
portly arrival appeared there could be
no mistake a tall man he was perhaps
close to six feet with a very protruding
stomach and particularly large feet on
which he was not very steady because of
his terrible bulk his face was large and
adorned with a heavy black mustache if
he had removed his hat it would have
been observed that he was possessed of a
heavy shock of hair which he kept close-
ly plastered to his head

   where  asked wilson

   there replied jimmie- that big
man with the heavy mustache

   that replied wilson- that why
thats-thats- he seemed to be gasp-
ing  thats blander 

   who asked the other men in uni-
son

   thats blander repeated wilson

 wait i will go and speak to him

  that night vincent wilson wired to
harvey jones president of the mainland
system at his private house in louis-
ville 

  have a clue must remain here a few
  days longer will return tuesday night

                     to be continued

ninety years old but still at work in the roundhouse james harvey
lawrence a veteran wiper of the n y o  w enjoys the distinc-
tion of being the oldest regularly employed railroad man in america
there may be older railroad men in this country and if so we should
be glad to hear from them however our sources of information lead us to
have little doubt that to james harvey lawrence alone belongs the title of
 patriarch of the track

    the ranks of the old guard of railroad men who were boys when the
first locomotives went wheezing along their wooden rails are growing thin-
ner year by year but time has been kind to many of them and the healthy
out-door lives they led have kept them well and happy while their less hardy
brothers have been forced to answer the final call

ran a foot-race with the first engine on the erie when a boy and
has since established a roundhouse record of wiping
a thousand miles of locomotives

  t the age of nifiety james
   harvey lawrence a wiper
  i on the new york ontario
  and western stopped work
  l long enough one day to
  figure out for me that he
  had polished up locomotives enough to
  make a solid train reaching from new
  york to chicago having kept a record
   of them he was able to arrive at a
  total figure of  and any one who
  cares to verify his calculations may read-
  ily do so i was content to take it on
  faith but he was not satisfied with that
  and insisted on showing me his figures
  you can work it out for yourself but
  you should have no trouble in taking my
  word for it when you learn that here is
  a man who saw the first locomotives-
  built yet is still busy at his work of
  slicking them up

within the period of lawrences life

the railroad has developed from practi-
cally a small line to one of great value
he is probably the only man living who
saw the odd little trains of the early
thirties and is still up and busy every
morning

  his position in the railroad world is
so unique he has spent so many toiling
years at one of the most wearying tasks
that falls to the lot of those who serve
the mistresses of steel that i went to
middletown new york where he has
lived all these years to have a talk with
him and learn with how much courage
a man can face his days work in his
ninety-first year

patriarch of the roundhouse

  at his age one might reasonably ex-
pect to locate him at the warmest spot
behind the stove or sitting in the sun


the railroad mans magazine

on- the sheltered side of the house but
when i found him he was at work in the
roundhouse with a reasonable expecta-
tion of making his string reach to
omaha or at least des moines

   phil mitchell the yard boss and  a
white man  lawrence told me feelingly
took me over and introduced me in per-
son at the moment he was passing
around an engine with remarkable spry-
ness

    hallo pop mitchell hailed him jo-
cosely  the boys tell me youre thinking
of marrying and settling down

   the old man stopped and shaking his
head with the saddest expression in the
world solemnly assured mitchell there
was nothing in it

   you dont want to believe all you
hear phil he commented

   well its mighty funny mitchell
continued  but i notice you see all the
pretty girls as they go by

   oh i didnt say i couldnt appre-
ciate a pretty girl the old man laughed
 i dont expect ill ever be too old for
that

  from these pleasantries you might
gather that he is a young man for his
years but that is not so he is all of
his ninety years and they weigh down
on him the more  account of the hard
work he has done but in spite of it
he moves around for hours at a time
without sitting down to rest

    see this one he said pointing out
an ordinary freight-engine

    when i first looked  a railroad you
could have put all the locomotives in the
country inside her boiler but i didnt
begin wiping then why it was hardly
more than yesterday that i broke in at
the railroad business i was sixty years
before i ever wiped an engine

   most men would be ready to quit
about that time i ventured

   i wasnt so young myself he went
  but i had to work just the same i
had been a wheelwright but when they
began to build the big shops thirty years
ago it cut out all of the independent
blacksmiths and i had to turn to some-
thing else this was the first thing i
truik and i have been at it ever since

   and i have wiped some too he
said proudly  my record shows a list
id like to see duplicated until i was

eighty-two years old i was boss wiper
and turned out ten engines a day now
im too old for that and some one else
has to do it but while i lasted i was a
worker ask phil i was an old man
when he was only a boy but when i was
seventy i could do more work than at
any time in my life

races with first locomotive

  the erie as well as the new york
ontario and western passes through
middletown and i knew that the erie
had been built through that section when
there was hardly three hundred miles of
track in the country i asked him if that
was where he had first seen a train

   i lived eight miles from here he
replied  and  was a fairly well grown
youth near twenty years old before the
erie was built why i can remember
the days before steamboats were at all
common i remember in particular a
trip  took with my grandmother from
newburgh to new york down the hud-
son in a sloop and it took us three days
so you can guess everybody for miles
around turned out when the first train
came through anything that could run
ten miles an hour and keep it up unless
something happened to it was wonderful
perfectly wonderful  when i think
about it now it makes me laugh

   that engine was surely a comical
sight to see squeaking along but it didnt
seem that way to us then why it wasnt
much bigger than a sewing machine but
it made a powerful lot of fuss about
itself we were country boys from the
backwoods and of course we had to go
down the track to watch for the first
train to come in while our elders stayed
at the station and waited it was a pretty
long wait too as it was so hard to keep
the train on the rails

   finally we must have got two miles
down the track before the engine came
in sight when she was pretly near up
 us we started to run ahead and the
ergneer steamed up to get enough speed
to run us off the track but he couldnt
do it we turned around and mocked at
hm and only the little fellows had to
get out of the way

  the old man seemed to relish the
recollection
james h lawrence oldest railroad wage-earner

drawn by h m bunker from a jhotograth by the times-press middletown n y



   it was a long time ago and i dont
remember very well he continued  but
i can still see that little squeaking thing
swaying from one side to the other about
to bust itself scaring up enough speed
to drive a parcel of boys off the track

 off again on again

   just before or just after we reached
the station the rails spread and down
went the engine between them in the
mud you couldnt believe they ever
run trains on such rails as those they
were just strips of wood the size of a
scanning fastened along in a line with-
out any cross-ties to keep them the right
distance apart

   when you looked down a stretch of
track you could see that it was a prettv
crazy road to put a train over but
even if they did go off the rails it didnt
make any difference they never had
enough speed to hurt anything and three
or four men could just about pick up the

engine and set her back on the rails
after some one had kicked them into
place

   that kind of railroading didnt last
long and it wasnt a great while before
they had ballast in the road-beds when
i took a ride for the first time a few
years later we didnt get off the track
more than half a dozen times in fifty
miles at that time they were still using
wooden rails with iron straps along the
side but there were cross-pieces serving
the purpose of ties

   when you get on a train now you
dont look for anything to happen and
youre pretty sure of getting in some-
where near on time but a ride on a train
in those days was a different matter the
coaches were hardly bigger than wagons
and the engineer could shout his orders
to the conductor from the back of the
train

   but what gets me is that those little
engines with boilers no bigger than a
barrel used to make a heap more fuss


the railroad mans magazine

than these big fellows here in the round-
house they would come howling over
the hills like a band of indians and you
could hear them puffing on the grades
for miles

a panther with wheels

  mr lawrence didnt tell me this story
but it happened in the same part of the
country there was an old trapper on
the delaware who lived by himself and
carried on his operations in the hills so
that he did not see the rails laid and
knew nothing of the erie vaguely he
might have heard of railroads but he
had no visual knowledge of them every
day about the same time he began to
hear panther cries on the other side of
the hill and each time he stalked them
to the creek where he lost them

  day after day it kept up and he set
traps until the woods were full of them
but with no result the animals strange
conduct and few scattered calls in the
middle of the day mystified him and he
dgcided to be on hand to pounce upon
it the next time it let loose

  while lying in wait on the hillside he
heard the panther far down the creek
marking its progress with agonizing cries
that increased in shrillness as it ap-
proached any one who has ever heard a
panther and listened while itsvoice ran
from deepest pathos to a wild demoniacal
laugh can understand exactly how he felt

  with his old flintlock primed head
down sprinting through the underbrush
to get within range before the beast
got the scent he did not have time
to analyze the notes in the panthers cry
or he might have thought it had a
strangely metallic ring instead as the
cries came nearer he hurried the faster
and seeing what appeared to be a clear
space ahead he leaped out and opened
fire on the strangest monster he had ever
seen but before he could reload it
knocked him into the gutter beside the
railroad track

when i remembered that lawrence

was a grown man when this happened it
was borne in on me how old he really is

   why do you keep on working at your
age  i asked

  the lids of the old mans eyes quiv-
ered and i thought for a moment he had
been hurt by my brutal question but it
was not that-he was thinking- the
idea had never been presented to him so
pointedly and it took a minute to frame
an adequate answer

   theres more than one reason he
finally said  all my life ive had to
help my relations and it took every cent
ive laid by so when jhe time came
that i couldnt earn so much as a younger
man i had nothing saved and  simply
had to keep-on working

keeps on despite years

   it seems to me i interrupted  that
they might have helped you then

   they would he admitted  if id
let them i live with my granddaughter
and she keeps wanting me to stop but
you see i wouldnt be happy and thats
what i tell her after youve worked
every day for about eighty years you
cant stop and thats all there is to it i
wouldnt know what to do with myself
with so much time on my hands

   here i am perfectly happy i know
this place so well and i am so used to it
now that i miss it more than you imagine
when im sick you see its pretty much
all of life that i have left when eve-
ning comes and i am tired i sit at home
and read the paper and go to bed early

 but dont you ever feel in the morn-
ing that youd like to rest a little longer 

   im not as fresh as i used to be he
confessed  but i have noticed this he
addedconfidentially  when a man has
worked until he is pretty old and quits
he doesnt last long now i want to live
a few years yet so i think ill just peg
along until i cant do anything any
more

  with that he turned and left me and
went back to work

taming bad bill goode

by emmet f harte

     this time honk and horace purify thesacred pre-
     cincts of valhalla from the taint of trespassers

vhe completion of the spur
connecting valhalla with
the main line at millards-
ville was quite an event
we had a half-holiday and
speeches the company put
a brand-new splinterfied gasoline mo-
tor-car in commission on our branch it
made two round trips a day

  valhalla became a station and i be-
came station-agent it was the easiest
job ive had since the spanish war
when i-but post mortems are odious
according to my favorite author be-
tween the busy hours when the motor was
due out and in i spent my strenuous mo-
ments in catching grasshoppers and swi-
ping at the darkling pools of the purling
creeklet for trout in the mystic hills

  we had the medicine - house brought
over for our own accommodations and
life loomed large and pleasant in the
offing it seemed a palpitant strain of
delightful melody to me i gained fif-
teen pounds the first thirty days

  honk pretended to be very busy i
guess he was honk never was otherwise
he was like a peanut-vender trying to
operate six corn-poppers at the same time

  whenever anything went wrong with
any of the multitudinous array of ma-

  when he wasnt cobbling up the mo-
tor-car which had a penchant for break-
ing down without the slightest excuse he
was installing lights

  when he wasnt surveying charting
grades or putting in a new factory of
some kind he was piloting some of
dades would-be investors around in a
halo of hot air or dissuading some un-
desirable character from making val-
halla his final home

  honk constituted himself a strict cen-
sor over everything that came in whether
declared dutiable or not he claimed a
clairvoyant sense of discernment could
spot a person of questionable attainments
farther than a turkey buzzard could smell
ripe meat he said

  all this he told me during the evenings
while the phonograph played  chicken
chowder and he whiled away the time
perfecting a new-fangled typewriter that
would add subtract multiply extract
the greatest common divisor and match
you for the cigars

  what was it i started to tell oh
yes about bad bill goode ill recount
about how william goode happened to
light in our pleasant midst he came at
an inadvertent moment

  one night down to the power-house

chinery which was being unloaded and-which was now running all fine and dan-

set up daily around valhalla honk was
the man to adjust it he was a tinker
from tinkerton was honk

  when a motor jammed a spark-arrest-
er went to sleep on its beat or a cen-
trifugal pump got the colic who fixed it
honk

dy and was honks particular hobby the
man that hostlers around or did hostler
around he isnt any more the gentle
soul whose duties were to keep the brass-
work bright and shining and the cobwebs
from hanging down and getting in the
way carelessly and without due tact and

  when plumbing leaked wires refused discretion probably while dreaming of
to tote fair or bearings squeaked honk the dear old days when he toted a hod

  red green blue and variegated

er-house went out of business so quick
that the annunciator broke its arm get-
ting back to taw and the wheel-base fell
afoul of the doo-dad before the magneto
could whirl and annihilate the annihila-
tor

  at least that is my morbid conception
of the disaster gleaned from hearsay
you can take it or leave it i wasnt
present when the thing occurred

  they wigwagged for honk with the
siren ever rewind or rewire or rejuggle
an armature or whatever you call it
im no electric sharp or i might be able
to speak technically on the subject and
then nobody would understand me

  i know enough about the crazy stuff
to drop a zinc into a jar or to tell when
ive burned my thumb on a hot end-
thats all

  the whole line of dope is cards and
spades for honk though he knows
just where to catch hold and not get-
stung its all coconut candy for him
it took a sixty-hour shift for him and his
little toolbag however in this instance

  as a patriot and a promoter  re-
frained from fishing for the next two or
three days and checked in the visitors
during honks absence thats how the
two-times before mentioned goode party
got by the guarded gate

  honk said afterward that he would
have nailed him as a crook of the first
water before the motor had got done
squealing for town but thats as may be

  the gentleman appeared civilized
he was dressed modestly in male apparel
his shoes i noticed needed a shine sev-
eral days overdue his collar was tar-
nished and cuffs he had none but he
was sober his hat was broad black
and parted in the middle he carried a
traveling kit that might have contained
either burglar tools or a cook book so far
as i knew

  he walked unexcitedly over to where
i stood receiving the guests of valhalla
in my vice-honkian capacity and won-
dered where the best hotel was

  he had mild grayish eyes and a voice
between a tenor and a barytone-a tenor

prof undo or barytone crescendo you
might call it

  what line of business please i
asked politely

   common tourist he said without
asperity

   try the palazzo i recommended
 two dollars a day and up american
or european according to taste two
blocks up street next 

  he murmured thanks and sauntered in
that direction or maybe he didnt mur-
mur thanks i dont remember

  i mentioned him to honk later

    looks like either a ranchero a cabal-
lero or a hobo i cant say which i
said  or he may be a duke traveling
in apropos or whatever you call it
honk was inattentive

   that was as complete a burn-out as
t ever saw he said referring to the late
short-circuit  why man she crossed
her current through six separate layers
of insulation reversed the incongruity
and evolved a -if he didnt say that he
said something that sounded like it any-
way

  i happened to be passing the palazzo
in a day or two and stopped in to beat
the slot machine out of a cigar the
clerk was a crony of mine

  seen the poker player yet he
asked

  no i said whotis

   william w goode he made reply
 tall smooth-faced gent with a sad
look and a black hat rooms here and
eats when lies hungry hes a card ex-
pert last evening he trimmed our dear
beloved boss of this hotel here of a
thousand iron men in a friendly sitting
at a dollar limit in room  hes go-
ing to board it out

  i was charmed and diverted

   whered they get their permit i
inquired  we dont aim to make no
sportsmans paradise out of valhalla that
ive heard tell of this is spotless town
according to the blue-prints

  he winked adroitly

   i know he said  im aware of
the fact that your long hungry friend
simpson who has been czaring around
here ever since the p and p promul-
gated the place has got a bug of that
sort but- pshaw weve got a city
here now a municipality didnt we
taming bad bill goode



they come on me sudden and they re always fatal
to somebody

adopt a charter by
popular vote two weeks
ago didnt we elect
a mayor and three fran-
chise dispensers we
did

   were forging to
the front all we need
now is a little public
spirit civic pride and
a cafe or two and we
have arrived and our
friend goode is going
to fix it so he can open
up a cafe next door
here to the palazzo

wake up dreamy and
get in the procesh  

  now neither honk
nor i are identified
with the dry movement
personally we only
expected to start val-
halla off on the right
foot there be weak
mortals who cant re-
sist temptation like- he
and i can what we
had in the private
stores of the medicine-
house was nobodys
business

   you take it from
me son i said  im
grand vizier to the ca-
lif haroun a raschid heap biggity
muck-a-de-muck there wont be 
boozorium in valhalla soon not any
and ive got a mental panorama of this
card-artist star boarder of yours going
over the divide in a shower of sparks as
soon as hancock simpson hears of his
delinquencies why dont you get a de-
cent cigar-lighter around this dump  

  well what do you think bill goode
came down to the medicine-house that
evening and interviewed us the calif
and me his aide-de-camp bad bills
breath savored of the red red beverage
and his eye watered but he was firm of
sjep and garrulous

  simpson ef the p and p outfit
he inquired  ive heard of you some
you think youre it around here dont
you some says youlldo and some says
maybe my names goode im a hate-
ful and poisonous proposition i come

from the salty and brackish waters of
tough river and i cojne clean at
times i am mean in my conduct and dan-
gerous to be safe he went on to ex-
plain

   sorry to meet you said plonk
 when do you expect your spell to be
at its worst that seemed to irritate
our guest somewhat and in his moment
of anger he produced from either side
where they had been concealed beneath
his coat a large blue-barreled revolver-
two i counted em two-which he han-
dled familiarly one in either hand

   im losing control of myself now
he said  they come  me sudden and
theyre always fatal to somebody i be-
lieved him unreservedly honk seemed
unconvinced

   yes our visitor bellowed  i went
out of my way to hunt you fellows up
and settle this matter i hear you in-


the railroad mans magazine

 i hear im not nice enough
your yard more curses

tend to run me out of this town i hear
you dont like my style of beauty
curses
to play in
 ii

  shut up said honk youll
wake up our pet parrot there in his cage
-hes a light sleeper horace this
man he continued addressing me-
 this man is bad he admits it he
has come down here to pick a fuss out
of us horace

  i nodded it so appeared to me

   we will feed him to the tiger honk
resumed  he must be sacrificed it
will do him good besides benefiting
him

  he allowed his gaze to wander past
the armed man as if fixed on some ap-
proaching object try this some time 
it works

   steady steady hector he said
 nip him boy now 

i surprised honk in the act of devouring a
cold potato

  the bad man from borneo couldnt
resist the temptation to turn his head by
which lapse from vigilance we got him
when his guns were captured and our
bloodthirsty visitant somewhat messed
over honk lectured him gave him an
hour in which to leave valhalla forever
led him to the door and kicked him ruth-
lessly from the platform all spraddled
out

    so much for the hateful and poison-
ous proposition he remarked as we re-
turned to our cozy chairs  many are
called but few are chosen such is life
in the far west as i was saying the
absence of red rays in these vapor lamps
is a peculiarity which will render them
impracticable for illuminating purposes
in the ordinary sense but  my idea
would be- etc

   i went to bed leaving him still talk-
ing or talking still whichever you pre-
fer and filing a saw we did not no-
tice bad bill around for two days two
days four hours and thirty-nine minutes
to be exact

promptly at that minute he reappeared
with a team wagon and two camp-fol-
lowers all loaded down with guns pis-
tols knives cartridge-belts and thfe other
impedimenta of brigandage they drove
straight to the plaza in the center of
valhalla unhitched and
picketed out their plugs in
the park threw up a forti-
fied camp and took posses-
sion of the city in the name
of riot and disorder
wouldnt that blow off your
hat

they awed us on the first
jump ill have to admit
that you take three irre-
sponsible drunken ruffians
clothed in smoke and pro-
fanity and let them march
up and down the streets of
a peaceful community
shooting out window-panes
and otherwise roistering and
intimidating indiscriminately
in all directions and the
timid quake in their puttees

  it even wears on us more
  intrepid souls the noise of
  their shooting got in my ears
  so that i secreted myself un-
taming bad bill goode



der my bunk in the medicine-house and
walled up the opening with canned goods

  what honk did i couldnt say im
not his grand vizier all the time i have
my half-holidays it was said fhat bad
bill and his wayward crew swore to kill
maim and lacerate honk and me at sight
and that they craved the sight of us-
begged and pleaded for that boon in
fact

  all day the fusillade continued except
at intervals when the besiegers were re-
loading themselves and their guns  all
day business was at a standstill in val-
halla and the three drank deeply from
their stock of refreshments in the wagon
strewed bottles in all directions and took
pot-shots at everything in sight

  it was a reign of terror valhalla was
in a state of beleaguerment they came
down during the afternoon andshot out
most of the medicine-house windows i
remained under my bunk and held no
conversation with them whatsoever i
knew that if i got started id go too far
-several miles at least

  somewhere along about nine-thirty in
the evening i heard a stealthy step out-
side a key was inserted in the lock
guardedly and honk entered i knew
him by his sniff

  i emerged from my sanctuary some-
what crumpled and surprised him in the
act of devouring a cold potato he had
come home to eat

   how you startled me  he said
 whered you come from  i feared the
worst had happened to you well brisk-
ly whats the news from the front
ive just this minute returned from a
junket south of town the alfalfa-fields
look fine

   the news i said  is not reas-
suring valhalla is in the hands of the
goths rome is burning and the tom-
tom sounds in the market-place i re-
ported-

   now that i have arrived on the
scene he mused  we must devise ways
and means to stop the conflagration i
feel better since that sandwich first the
proposition is this we have before us a
problem a foreign and deleterious ele-
ment has appeared in our midst our
body politic is attacked by a malignant
cancerous parasitic growth - a fungus
has sprung up

   all problems have a solution all dis-
eases a cure all poisons an antidote ac-
cording to exact sciencc

  hip hip i cheered in a whisper
 whats the answer 

   ive been cogitating he continued
 dont hurry me all day while i lay
-i mean while you lay-secreted from
the eyes of men and the vandals ripped
and tore through the streets of this our
fair city i sat and busied my wonderful
brain with thinkings

   now since ive partly dined i dont
mind confiding that this bad bill goode
person and his confreres in hoodlumism
are my meat science wins over savage
ry   has been so all down through-
 bang bang  went something com-
ing down the street

   finish your diatribe later i said
 me fof the weeds  

  i hurried out leaped and lit running
later i discovered honk beside me it
didnt seem to exert him much to keep
up with my short stride he talked as we
marathoned

   as i was saying he resumed  sci-
ence has disclosed the curative and re-
juvenating properties in a ray of light
certain diseases disappear like they were
shot out of a gun upon the application of
the violet ray tottering invalids are
made whole sores healed devils exor-
cised

    all right i call the bet and raise you
a few chips if a violet ray cures a sick
man there must be something to sicken a
well man its the law of opposites

   every condition has its alternative
every argument two sides very plausible
reasoning

    if a violet ray fixes em up what tears
em down what are the primary colors
in a prism dont interrupt i slowed
down puffing but was too winded to an-
swer

   violet indigo red-etc he fell
over an obstacle in the darkness i wait-
ed  curses on the guy that left that
water cut-off sticking up  he comment-
ed  indigo and orange rays horace
will do the business how do i know
never mind shoot em at a living organ-
ism and what happens

   his blood clogs in the capillaries
his nerves curl up and sting him his
heart fails his lungs refuse to perform


the railroad mans magazine

their vital work of purification and the
little microbes that lurk in every nook
and corner of his system waiting for just
such a moment swarm out and go for
him

   there you are his harvest days are
over for a spell

   well then i said  you never had
a more glorious opportunity to inoculate
a bunch of marauders than now presents
what are you running away for 

   running away  he snorted  huh
youve got a gyroscope in your occiput
were not running away-were on our
way  to the power-house horace you
seemed in a hurry  thats all the difference
i can see

  we were in fact headed in that direc-
tion although  hadnt noticed it partic-
ularly a couple of blocks farther brought
us there and honk proceeded to put his
theories into practise

  butch poteet was chief cook and offi-
ciator at the power-house at night we
enlisted his services

  there was a thousand-candle search-
light over in the corner honk built it
one day while killing time it had never
been used but was warranted to stab a
hole in the dark for i forget how many
miles

  we put that search-light in shape pret-
ty shortly connected up a coil of wire
to it trimmed her with new carbons
greased primed and hoisted her up the
ladder on the two-hundred foot stack
above the boiler-room where we had a
sweep at every crook and turn of val-
halla

   they can t get away chuckled
honk  this stunt is too simple for
grown men to engage in but its inex-
pensive and will do the work we could
go down and clean em out at their own
kind of game but that is so littery this
is better

   it is i agreed- much better on
with the dance  

  i took an enthusiastic interest in the
setting of the stage for action i like
long-range fighting

  how do you color your lights i
queried  have you got any blue glass
to squirt it through  

   my boy honk spoke sympathetical-
ly  save your brain force for the ab-
struse problems of eating and waddling

around science is taboo for you dont
you know that light shining through a
blue glass is not a blue ray of course
you dont

   butch watch him to see that he dont
fall in the fire while im up aloft and
butch bring me that boxful of bottles
off the shelf-the one i warned you about
ill show you some sure - enough blue
rays

   just the same- i started to get
back but he was gone he scuttled up the
ladder and fastened himself somehow
with the search-light swinging in front
of him just below the hood of the stack
i climbed up about half-way to see the
show and to yelp the word down to butch
when to turn on the juice

  it was a good half-mile to the plaza
where the center of trouble was we
could hear faint hallos and the occasion-
al crack of guns and see little spurts of
fire honk passed the official call for
current i handed it on down and butch
flipped over his cut-in switch

  first came shooting the dazzling gleam
of white light that slipped through the
darkness like a sword-blade and waved
along the streets breaking and spraying
at the end into a cascade of light that
showed up the pores in the bricks a
mouse couldnt have hidden himself where
that ray struck

  honk located the despoilers in about
ten seconds there they were three
maudlin puppets waving their puny arms
and shaking their little fists in defiance

  bang bang bangity went their pis-
tols it sounded like the popping of pop-
corn at that distance and the bullets fell
considerably short-not any too short to
suit me though

  it looked like a moving picture with
the  gr-r-r of honks machine up
above goode and his partners stood
about half-way between the big fountain
in the plaza and the corner where the
two stone lions are and they kept on wa-
ving their flippers and wasting ammuni-
tion that was the way the scene looked
when honk turned on his medicine

  i dont pretend to say how he did it
he clinkered and squittered a minute
with his bottles and his light humming
a tune to himself the bright white beam
of light up above me suddenly turned a
ghastly gray then purple cobalt black
  

taming bad bill goode



almost gruesome horrible - looking i
looked once and shut my eyes it gave
me a chill

  when i looked again he was shooting
a thick gummy yellow streak of light
into them that made me still sicker to look
at i could guess what it was doing to
those guys at the end of the ray

  then he changed back to the blue
again and i saw one of the victims start
to run he made a jump then crumpled
up and fell on all fours like a dog i
imagined i could hear him ki-yi

  twas very interesting and instructive
to see bad bill try to fight that indigo
dope that was turning his microbes loose
to undo him and to see it finally wilt him
the other two were down and rooting in
the grass of the parkbefore we fetched
bad bill but he got his a plenty after so
long a time

  he ran fifty yards for a tree but
couldnt make it honk just actually
swamped him with poisonous rays before
he got there he threw up his fins and
fell like a corn-stalk before kabibonokka
the north wind and freedom rose up out
of the shrubbery whither she had fled and
reconnoitered

poring over the evening clarion noth-
ing excited butch except a dime novel

   i guess i didnt put em down on
their crawlers eh said honk lugging
in his paraphernalia  gimme a chew
somebody dont all speak at once say
that stuffs hard on the nerves look
how my hands are swelled up where it hit
em come along horace if you can
control your cowardly legs well go up
and clear off the mess on the lawn

  well there wasnt any bad men whoop-
ing around the plaza any more bad
bill goode and his huskies had reformed
there they sat on the grass all hunkered
up sicker than hounds with cholera in-
fantum looking around like their last
friend had made good his escape

   come come said honk lifting bill
goode by the ear  thisll never do the
big shows over the little boys must
skiddoo for home before the booger man
gets em this park is supposed to close
at nine oclock and here it is ten-thirty
you fellows are due for a rough-housing
right now

   no sir yes sir the wild and wool-
ly ones squeaked in chorus  dont hurt
us were sick were all shot to pieces

were not running

away-were on our
way  to the power
house horace

  valhalla had come scratched but in-
tact from the clutches of the enemy

  i clattered down the ladder while
honk unlimbered his apparatus butch
sat smoking his pipe nonchalantly and

  they looked it chills fever typhoid
pneumonia rheumatism pip roup and
boll-weevil they had em all not a
whoop or glare was left

  tottering limping and bent with mis-
ery they caught up their plugs at honks

   ta-ta good-by and farewell said
honk  whip up now and dont both-
ei to come back your work is finished
here if either one of you fellows ever
does come back as long as im hanging
out in this neighborhood please feel sor-

direction hooked them to the schooner
and hoisted themselves on board with
many creaks and complaints

  bad bill had a terrific chill before he
got both feet in which was followed by
faintness nausea headache and flatu-
lency the other two were having diz-
ziness and hot flushes alternated by tor-
pid liver and that all-gone feeling when
honk headed the team into the street

  the helm was hard aport and their
course was laid for the open sea

ry for yourselves youve had your last
sample next time youll get the real ar-
ticle now hike

  bad bill goode propped himself up
with a shaking arm and looked at us with
an air of apathy then a last flicker of his
outlaws spirit stirred him and he shook
a trembling forefinger at honk

   eh-eh-pooh pooh for you he
squeaked as they drove away into the
night  we aint afraid of you dad-
bust you whip up boys an lets go  

bronze instead of brass

an order recently issued by the atchi-
son topeka and santa fe will re-
sult in every car and coach on the system
being sent to the shops and the brass trim-
mings will give way to those of a statuary-
bronze the hat-racks side-rods light-
fixtures and every piece of brass will be
taken out or covered with a coat of bronze

  this will do away with the constant ex-
pense of polishing and keeping it in shape
bronze will hold its color unaffected by the
elements and will never grow dull and dis-
tasteful to the eye a little cleaning now

the science of rate-making

by thaddeus stevens

the whole range of commercial statistics knows of no more complicated
delicate and far-reaching process than the making of freight rates on
american railroads the vast territories covered the different re-
quirements of those territories and the widely varied products which the
enormous area yields combine to make a problem that only the best-balanced
and most orderly minds can cope with in addition to this all these conditions
are constantly changing and when it is considered that the rate-makers must
work within the lines defined by forty-six different state governments as
well as the federal government the size of the task can be imagined

     rate-making is a science in process of evolution-a science whose funda-
mental premises are being constantly changed and the professors of which
need to be more up to date than those of any other science because they are a
direct economic force in the community

the systematic manner by which the present elaborate but excellent
schedule is built up from the invention of an
ordinary freight clerk

he making of a freight-rate
between two points on dif-
ferent lines of railway is
not the work of one man
it is the joint product of a
hundred brains if the ar-
ticle covered is a new and hitherto un-
classified one perhaps a thousand peo-
ple will each have contributed their
quota of information or advice before
the price of its transportation is agreed
upon

  when one of the historic first rail-
ways in america was built out of cam-
den south carolina the wagon freight-
ers charged twenty cents per cubic foot
for light weight and a dollar a hun-
dred pounds for heavy articles this
was for twenty miles or less because
that distance was a days work the
camden railroads charter decreed that
its charges should not exceed ten and
fifty cents-half what the wagon freight-
ers were charging so the officials of



the infant railroad divided its territory
into ten-mile districts and adjusted its
rates at a hundred pounds per ten miles

  they soon awoke however to the fact
that the value of the goods hauled was
an important element in their cost of
transportation therefore the camden
and the other little lines then in exist-
ence evolved classifications of merchan-
dise fixing rates according to class in-
stead of commodity

birth of classification

  thus was born the basing of rates on
the class of goods a system which with
certain exceptions prevails on all the
american railroads to-day these ex-
ceptions are the special commodity rates
which are far in the minority

  every article of merchandise that a
railroad handles is supposed to be listed
in the official classification-book which
governs in the region where its trains


the railroad mans magazine

run in this book is listed alphabeti-
cally between eight and ten thousand
articles

  in the column opposite each is a fig-
ure or a letter of the alphabet showing
the class to which it belongs now this
classification is of no value by itself any
more than the thumb would be without
the fingers

  the freight tariff is its necessary com-
plement taking the two together the
rate is arrived at

  if you ask a clerk in a freight-office
for a rate on  blood dried in pack-
ages chicago to new york for in-
stance he will not start back in horror
and reach for his steel eraser as a weap-
on of defense he will reach for his
classification-book casually remark that
it is third class in less than car-loads and
sixth class in car-loads

chaos of standards

  then he will look in his tariff-book
and say that the rate on the former is
forty-two cents-or whatever it is-and
the rate on the latter twenty-one cents
if he had not had both the classification
and the tariff before him he could not
have told you the rate

  the basis then of the freight-rate is
the classification years ago each rail-
road had its own classification and the
man who wanted to ship a case of shoes
from boston to baltimore could get only
the haziest of ideas as to what the
through rate would be-he knew even
less what his competitor was likely to
pay

  before the adoption of the present
system-there are but three sets of clas-
sifications now-there were  distinct
classifications in the eastern trunk
line territory alone history is silent
as to how many there were in the middle
states and the west but there must have
been an appalling number

  the reduction in the number of clas-
sifications to three was brought about by
the growth of through traffic and of
friendly relations between the warring
railway officials these three classifica-
tions-born as one writer puts it of
 deliberation discussion and strife -
are as follows

  the official classification is supreme

 in the territory east of the mississippi
 and north of the ohio rivers and con-
 tains six classes the southern classi-
 fication with fourteen different classes
 in the territory east of the mississippi
 and south of the ohio rivers the
 western classification with ten classes
 in the territory west of the mississippi

   there is also a transcontinental clas-
 sification which applies on some classes
 of through freight from and to the pa-
 cific coast a few of the state railroad
 commissions have also muddled things
 by establishing local classifications with-
 in their boundaries but these are not of
 much importance

   even now after seventy-five years of
 study the classification arrangement is
 not perfect each of the three big clas-
 sifications differs materially from the
 other

   a universal uniform system will prob-
 ably come some day it almost came in
  when a uniform freight classifica-
 tion prepared with much travail and
 friction was approved by all the rail- j
 roads in the country but one-an east- 
 ern trunk line-which defeated the
 movement

   but changing the existing order of
things is considered by most traffic men
to involve pretty serious risks they say
that a uniform classification could be
adopted only through interminable fights
vand compromises that it would mean the
changing of rates all over the country
and would upset business conditions
mightily

 methods of agreement

   the classifications are made up and
guarded by the classification committees
appointed by the various railroads oper-
ating in the territories concerned these
classification committees are in session
every working day from nine in the
morning until five in the afternoon

   one part of their work is issuing ru-
 lings on the class certain commodities
 shall take local agents bill clerks-
 even general freight-agents and traffic
 managers themselves-are continually
 being  stumped  on how to classify
 certain articles which do not appear to
 be listed specifically or lo be covered by
 the frequent initials  n o s not
the science of rate-making



  otherwise specified placed after the des-
  ignation

    when the highest freight official in
  the general office cannot tell what the
  classification should be he refers it to
  the committee and they give their de-
  cision

    each classification as has been said
  contains between eight and ten thousand
  items these are grouped under from
  six to fourteen classes generally speak-

	ing whether an article in the classifica-
  tion takes the first-or highest-class or
  the tenth or fourteenth is determined by
  its bulk weight and value

    but there are a lot of other things
  which the classification committees have
  to take into account they have to con-
  sider whether the goods are crude rough
  or finished  liquid or dry knocked down
  or set up loose or in bulk  nested or in
  boxes or otherwise packed if vegeta-
  bles whether green or dry desiccated or
  evaported thg market value and the
  shippers representations as to their char-
  acter

variety of rates

    also they have to consider the prob-
  able cost of the service length and dura-
  tion of the haul the season and manner
  of shipment the space occupied and the
  weight whether in car-load or less than
  car-load lots the volume of annual ship-
  ments to be calculated on the sort of
  car required whether flat gondola box
  tank or special whether ice or heat
  must be furnished the speed of trains
  necessary for perishable or otherwise
  rush goods the risk of handling either
  to the goods themselves or to other prop-
  erty  the weights actual and estimated 
  the carriers risk or owners release from
  damage or loss

    for instance agricultural implements
  set up-ready for use-take double first-
  class rate  lounges of bamboo or rattan
  take three times the first-class rate
  ashes brick salt sand sawdust etc
  take the lowest or sixth class  all these
  are from the  official  or eastern clas-
  sification

     cost largely governs the classification
  the rate on silk is high because it is
  valuable and takes but little space
  feather beds are not vorth much but

they take up a lot of room therefore
they pay double first class rates

  value puts books blankets sixty-cent
watches etc in the first class along with
wash-boilers not nested nested wash-
boilers take second class because they
occupy less room the reason why sand
and sawdust and other bulky articles
take the lowest class and rate is because
they are cheap and the lowest rate is
 all the traffic will bear

  another delicate point for the classi-
fication experts to decide upon is for
instance if they conclude to charge
crackers in baskets at the first-class rate
in less than car-loads what the same
shall pay in full car-load lots they
take the fourth-class rate in such quan-
tities by the way

  now a car-load lot does not mean
how much can be crowded into a par-
ticular car it means for one thing how
little the minimum car-load in the
east the minimum is  pounds ex-
cept in certain classes of goods like
church furniture settees and tables
where the minimum is  pounds

  why exceedingly nice judgment is re-
quired in fixing the classes on car-loads
and less may be better understood when
it is considered that the railroad must
continually foster its business that by
means of shipping in car-loads a big
dealer can get his goods cheaper and
undersell his small competitor a wide
difference between the two rates would
hurt the new york jobber for instance
who wished to reach directly the retail
trade of the west and it would favor
the jobber in the west or south who re-
quired a low rate for his wholesale ship-
ments

territorial conditions

  one eminent expert-judge noyes of
connecticut-is the authority for the
statement that the  tendency of the
 official  classification is to protect the
eastern manufacturer by reducing the
difference between rates for retail and
wholesale shipments while the inclina-
tion of the  western  and  southern 
classifications is to promote the interests
of the wholesale dealers within their ter-
ritory

the fixing up and keeping in order of


the railroad mans magazine

the official classifications of goods is com-
plex enough but the making of the
freight tariffs which apply to them is a
task so enormous on each line and the
result-that is the relation between the
cost of the service and the price charged
for it-is so wavering and inexact that
rate-making is still one of the greatest
problems of railroading enough has
been written and printed about it to fill
a good many book-shelves and there is
as much diversity of opinion as to the
proper method of arriving at the cost of
hauling goods and how much to charge
the customer forit-the freight-rate-as
there is about the right road to heaven

  years ago before the birth of the in-
terstate commerce commission this busi-
ness was handled by railroad associations
which were known by the shorter and
more expressive word  pools each of
these was presided over by a high-browed
expert who actually knew more about
the science of rate-making than any of
the railroad officials had had time to
learn and therefore received an enor-
mous salary

  these associations were made up of
the competing lines in each territory and
it was their aim to agree upon uniform
rates between various points further if
one line should get more than its pro-
portion of earnings it should pay over
the excess to the other lines

end of railroad pools

  rate-cutting was a frequent feature
notwithstanding all these precautions
legislation finally abolished all railroad
pools and now the task of deciding on
joint rates is part of the days work of
the railroad traffic department

  the rate department on each large
road employs continuously from twenty
to forty skilled men whose sole business
it is to try to arrive at the probable cost
of hauling certain merchandise their
conclusions furnish a oasis for the fu-
ture arguments between the different
railroads concerned as to what rate to
put into the tariff and what share of a
through rate each road shall receive for
its haul

  there are two classes of tariffs those
based on the classification which tell
how many cents per hundred pounds to

charge for each class of freight between
two points and those which are arbitrary
rates independent of the classification
these latter are called commodity rates

 factors in rate-making

  in the making of a freight-rate en-
tirely different elements get into the cen-
ter of the stage from those concerned
with the building up of the classifica-
tions as one writer puts it  the clas- 
sifications determine the relation of
charges the tariff the specific charge
different roads with the same classifica-
tion must make very different rates for
similar services

  here are a few things which traffic
people have to keep in mind in arriving
at a rate basis

   are there heavy grades on the line or
even a mountain range to cross while the
competing line runs through compara-
tively level country the density of the
traffic also has a good deal to do with
determining the rate

   the road that runs through deserts or
a country that is sparsely settled must
charge a high rate-comparatively-or
else the receivers will get it so much
of the railroads expenses- go on whether
it does business or not that when it comes 
to figuring the cost of hauling the va-
rious classes of freight the usual cus-
tom is to regard this total expenditure
as a whole as a basis to figure from

   but great as the science of statistics
applied to railroading has become it is
still impossible to determine exactly what
it costs to haul any particular commod-
ity any particular distance

  there are a few basic principles in
rate-making that form the solid ground
from which the experts work one of
these is that commodities that move in
solid train-loads over long distances can
be carricd at a less cost per ton per mile
than those that are hauled in separate
car-loads on trains that carry different
kinds of freight or freight that moves
in less than car-load lots

   therefore the lowest rates are always
between the great consuming and dis-
tributing centers like chicago and new
york the rates between these two great
cities have been arrived at after years
of fighting and compromise between the
the science of rate-making



mighty warriors in the field of transpor-
tation and between the communities af-
fected as well they are called  one
hundred per cent rates

  in the-same way the rates between in-
termediate cities and territories have been
established as percentages of the one
hundred per cent rate new york to
pittsburgh is sixty per cent of the chi-
cago rate for instance cleveland is
seventy-one per cent detroit seventy-
eight per cent indianapolis ninety-three
per cent peoria beyond chicago one
hundred and ten per cent and st louis
one hundred and sixteen per cent of the
new york to chicago rate

the hundred per cent rate

  rates from boston and interior new
england points rates from the territory
surrounding buffalo and pittsburgh and
from other interior points are also estab-
lished in relation to the new york-chi-
cago rate as well as rates to and from
norfolk and other points in virginia
rates in the opposite direction-from
chicago to new york-are also on the
same one hundred per cent basis upon
which are likewise made practically all
the west to east rates from points on
the mississippi and ohio rivers and the
territory to the north and east of them

  it is interesting just here to tellwhat
happens when a railroad rate on an ar-
ticle of general production and consump-
tion is reduced or increased between an
eastern and a western point in the ter-
ritory specified all railroad rates are
reduced between all eastern and all
western points rates for combined lake
and rail transportation are cut  rates via
the erie canal and the great lakes are
lowered to maintain the proper differ-
ence between them and the all-rail rates
and the rail-and-lake rates rates on
through traffic from and to points west
of the mississippi river and from and
to points south of the ohio river come
down  rates may also be decreased to and
from points in canada experts say
that the change in but a single one of the
rate bases mentioned has forced the
changing of not less than eight thousand
rates

  this shows what a delicately balanced
house of cards is the rate system that

various railroads have so painfully and
laboriously built up between themselves
and how easily disturbed touch the
rate on iron products out of chicago
and joliet furnaces and pittsburgh rail-
ways will be thrown out of gear

  as a consequence of a recent change in
rates from baltimore to atlanta and
louisville to atlanta three-fourths of
the railroad rates in the united states
were affected and the total changes in
rates necessitated by this initial change
were not less than one hundred thousand

  the rates on the pacific coast are be-
set by the same complications as those
east of the rockies and must be kept in
adjustment with the ocean rates as well
the merchants in the vast territory west
of the mississippi river in brief are all
competing for trade in that vast territory

  the rate adjustment now existing
there is the result of all this competition
between themselves and among the rail-
roads yet changes have to be made
continually to meet the fluctuating con-
ditions of industry and commerce and
such changes are the things that call for
the exercise of the utmost diplomacy
and experience of the traffic on the great
lines interested

  even the commodities themselves com-
pete in rate-making it is a general
principle that crude or raw materials
should other things being equal pay
lower railroad rates than what is manu-
factured from them for instance the
rates on pig iron are lower than  steel
blooms and ingots though the only dif-
ference between them is that the latter are
worth a trifle more a change in the rate
of any raw material therefore affects
every article manufactured from it

invention of a freight clerk

  the system of  one hundred per cent
rates  explained above was devised by
ames mcgraham a clerk in the freight
epartment of the pennsylvania rail-
road it simplified enormously the ma-
king of tariffs and also removed the
complications surrounding the fixing of
rates from points common to two or more
routes via either of those routes to an-
other common point

  a citv like chicago or new york is
called a  basing point that is the


the railroad mans magazine

rate to such a point is one dollar for in-
stance to points beyond that within
certain territory it is such and such a
percentage in addition

  large cities are not necessarily basing
points however but geographical cen-
ters of vast freight movements are also
taken some of these are peoria daven-
port dubuque sioux city st joseph
and leavenworth

  the result of all this complicated sys-
tem of rate building that has been brief-
ly outlined is that every freight official
big and little and even the traveling
representatives of the freight department
and the station-agents of the big mod-
ern railroad are continually collecting
information leading to readjustment
after readjustment of freight-rates

  when it is finally decided by one that
a rate should be changed the matter is
carefuljy calculated statistically in the
rate department the result is submitted
to the head of the traffic department and
he discusses it pro and con from every
point of view with those who have ex-
pert knowledge bearing on the matter

  after it has been thoroughly gone over
and the arguments tested link by link
why it should be changed the traffic
manager like the ambassador and diplo-
mat of one great nation treating with
another takes it up with the road or
roads interested cautiously or vigorously
as the case may warrant then comes
the test of the relative abilities of the
various traffic managers

  the same difficulties of adjustment
apply to the commodity-rates as to those
governed by the tariff and classification
-in fact more because each relates to a
specific article of merchandise the
much greater part in bulk of the freight
transported in the united states moves
at commodity-rates although the greater
gross revenue is from the goods carried
at class rates

  these commodity-rates apply generally
on heavy or bulky merchandise or mate-
rial like grain lumber coal and iron

  commodity-rates are lywer than class-
rates for a variety of reasons one of the

principal of which is competition with
the water routes of transportation most
of the heavy transcontinental traffic
moves under commodity-rates

  these rates also are especially favored
by railroads wishing to foster new indus-
tries along their lines or to enable manu-
facturers to reach out into new markets
not infrequently a railroad will make a
low commodity-rate between two given
points only and leave otherwise undis-
turbed the class-rates in the same terri-
tory that is because they deem some
individual industry or group of industries
will be fostered thereby

  the railroads in this matter of rate-
making really play the part of paternal-
ly protective governments who desire to
foster growing enterprises within their
territories and do so by raising or lower-
ing the customs tariffs

  of course commodity-rates are fre-
quently withdrawn after their object has
been accomplished it is easier to do
this than it is to change the tariffs based
on the class-rates which may affect a less
restricted region

  a railroad however as might be gath-
ered from the above is far from a phil-
anthropic enterprise in the fostering of
weakling industries it is a public enter-
prise for private gain and one of the
principal bases for the fixing of a rateis
designated by that widely abused and
greatly misunderstood term  what the
traffic will bear

  a freight charge has to be in the long
run no greater than the difference be-
tween the cost of production at the place
of origin plus the merchants profits and
the price which can be obtained for the
commodity at the place of destination

  the railroad has to make its rates so
that it may earn a fair average profit
and yet so that the greatest volume of
goods may find a market over its lines
if the rates  dry-goods and on coal
were the same the roads total revenue
would not pay its expenses if it at-
tempted to charge as much for hauling
coal as for dry-goods the coal-cars would
not be in use at all

why he
with

swung back and forth for a moment

feeing as how flagstaff ari-
zona is several train lengths
removed from bunker hill
 and the rest of them famous
revolution stations one dont
expect it to celebrate the
fourth of july accordin to
the standard book of rules but  sure
remember two celebrations down there
that were full tonnage when it come to
the genuine fireworks

  the first one was the time old lon
kingsley from shevelon creek brought
that yaller hoss of hisn over to race a
flea-bit gray owned by an indian trader
at keains canon and the other was
when smoke lost his independence and
several large chunks of his epidermis

  after that lioss-race the town turned
out and give the stake-holder a decent
funeral and the company doctor was
pickin bullets out of four other fellows
for a week

  seein as how the doctor didnt know
much about the workin parts of a cow-
puncher havin been workin on railroad

e h herr

signed up the matrimonial  order
molly stevens after a fourth-
of-july baseball game

men all his life it haint no wonder that
two of the fellows didnt take kindly to
his back shop and passed in their checks

  i was right alongside of lon kingsley
when the celebration started and after
i see him draw one of them smoke-poles
with a muzzle on it as big as a diamond
stack i happened to remember that id
forgot something over to the roundhouse
and as i went right over there by the
shortest route to see what it was i wasnt
present at the concludin performance

  every one who stayed said that it was
worth the money but when the prose-
cutin attorney was huntin for witnesses
he couldnt find enough to convict any-
body and the town council decided that
for the public safety they would have to
lock the switch on hoss-racin in the fu-
ture

  of course the fourth of july has got
to be celebrated some way or another
and with hoss-racin off the time-card the
town voted for baseball the first year
a nine from the roundhouse took all the
steam out of the brakemens nine and
the next year the soldier boys from fort
apache came over and coupled onto a
double - header victory by heatin the
roundhouse in the morning and the brake-
men in the afternoon

  but the next year we had smoke du-
gan playin with us and we picked one
good team from everything between the
high switches we invited the uniformed
boys back believin that we would be able
to tie a large piece of hardware onto
them they come over and brought a
band with them and there was a special
from ash fork and another one from
winslow and ill bet my meal - ticket
against a blind gasket that bunker hill
or philadelphia couldnt done the job of
celebratin any better


the railroad mans magazine

  smoke was the whole works that day-
engine cars and caboose when it come
to railroadin  cant say that smoke was
very much i think he must of got his
early experience drivin a mule-car for
when sam parks give him a job in the
roundhouse he didnt know the difference
between a steam-chest and a sand-dome

  everybody looked on him as a harmless
sort of cuss good-natured with a facial
map about as handsome as a colorado
potato

  for a few days the gang let him make
mileage running after left-handed mon- 
key-wrenches screw oil and keys for the
steam gage until the day shorty studer
sent him out to polish the whistle on 
so that the tone would be more shrill

  smoke- polished that whistle for two
hours and the hostler being in on the
deal kept a little fire in the box and
enough steam on so that -smoke could
test the whistle semioccasionally of
course it was a little warm on top of
that boiler and the whistle was uncom-
fortably hot in spots but smoke was
there when it come to sticking with the
job tooting that whistle every ten min-
utes until it drew the attention of old man
parks himself and he went down and put
the boy next

  shorty studer had one real fight that i
know of it didnt go to a finish because
the gang stopped it but smoke was going
strong and after that he had more real
work to do and less light mileage

  he hadnt been workin moren two
weeks until he got out with the ball-
tossers from that day on he had right
of track over everything in town sam
parks himself beside being one of the
best master mechanics on the pike was
some judge of ball playin knowing some
of them perfessional players back east
by their first name

  the first time he saw smoke dugan
passin the pill over the pan he turned
to me and says

   that fellows a world-beater hes
got steam to burn

  of course i knew that the old man
knew that steam wont burn so i just
smiled and let it go at that steam wasnt
the only thing smoke had he could
twist that ball around so it would do a
reverse curb that made the crookton loop
look like a straight track

  he could send that ball up to the bat-
ter on a fifty per cent grade hed make it
come straight half the route then send
it off on a side track and the batter
would break in two trying to hit some-
thing that wasnt there

  after we had seen him workin for a
month or so we all had an idea what was
goin to happen to the soldiers on the
fourth

  but of course none of us fellows was
figurin that stevens girl in the results
of the game seein as how she wasnt one
of the players and only one of the en-
thusiastic fans but i reckon that a man
never makes a record run but what theres
a woman mixed up in it some place-if
its no more than a woman telegrapher de-
livering him an order

  all of us fellows who hadnt signed up
the matrimonial  orders were willing to
divide our checks with molly stevens

  she was so good-lookin that every fel-
low running out of flagstaff was whis-
tlin to her every time he went by the
house but she kept us in the chain-
gang for her favors running us first in
and first out being plumb nice to all of
us and puttin in her time keepin house
for her father just as if that was to be
her regular run for the rest of her days

  of course seein as how smoke dugan
was only a machinist helper and so
blamed homely we all thought that as
far as being called for a place in mollys
affections was concerned he was clear
down at the end of the extra list

  i guess there was more than one fellow
who felt his drivers slippin when smoke
showed up for the big game ivith  flag-
staff in spankin new silk letters across
the front of his uniform a loomin up like
an electric headlight on a dark night

  when i asked him where he filed his
requisition for such supplies his face got
as red as his uniform and it was the same
color as a danger-flag-and he managed
to make me understand that molly ste-
vens had put the letters there for good
luck

  i took the slow sign right there-but
then that aint got anything to do with
the celebration

  i bought me a first-class ticket for the
big game and went inside the ropes all
the time the boys were breakin in for the
real run i kept thinkin that it would of
smokes lost independence



been a blessing to have been born more
of a ball-player and less of an engineer
and the big game finally started and mol-
ly stevens hadnt showed up

  when that girl wasnt way ahead of
her running-schedule for a ball-game it
was because the track was soft and when
the game started and she hadnt regis-
tered in i was plumb-sure there had been
a wreck

  but smoke was shootin through the
pellet just as if everything was all right
and it wasnt long before things got so
interesting that i forgot everything but
the game

   the baseball track or switchin yard
was right across from the depot it was
just a generous chunk of the flat with a
rope around it any one who stayed out-
side the rope was a piker so everybody
paid his two bits and came inside i reck-
on no man ever got a bigger two bits
worth of baseball any other place in the
world

   the soldier boys had imported a pitch-
er from albuquerque and he was plumb
good when he started to throw that
ball he got in motion like a rotary snow-
plow and when that ball hit the catchers
glove it sounded like a mexican switch-
crew couplin into a dog-house

  why our boys had about as much
chance of hittin that pill as a hartd-car
has of beatin the limited on a level track
and at the end of the fourth trick our
boys hadnt been outside the yard limits
ceptin reub downs who got so scared
he jumped in front of the ball and got
the right-of-track to the first sidin and
even he killed so much time there that
he got twelve hours late on his runnin or-
ders and lost his rights there we was
with the inside of a link to our credit and
the soldiers down on the board with one
score

   believe me smoke was using the short
stroke with sand on the rails and beatin
her on the back all the way and if it
hadnt been that chuck burgette cor-
nered an ant-hill when he was about to
put the vent down on an easy pop-up the
soldiers would have been juggling ciphers
too

   then it come down to our take of the
fifth trick with chuck burgette first out
and smoke marked up as the second sec-

 	tion

     r r

  chuck managed to get the ball just
outside the main line between the second
and third station and reached the first
corner and then- well among other
things old man parks lost four dollars
and ten cents

  lie was standing up on the grand-
stand seat with his hands in his pockets
when smoke came up to bat after the

human rotary had let go the ball there
was an awful crash and just as soon as
the old man realized that smokes bat
and the ball had met head-on and that
the ball was a doin its best to make its
get-away to utah he jerked his hands
from his pockets grabbed his hat and
did several things unbecoming the most
dignified master mechanic in a respected
community when he pulled his hands
from his pockets he jerked all his money
out too and got so excited that he didnt
know it

  i noticed that smoke had asked some
of the boys the time between each in-
ning and just before he came up to bat
i looked at my watch and noted that it
was just twenty minutes until no 
carrying all those eastern tourists in the
finest string of varnished wagons ever on
a rail would be pullin down from belle-
mont

  i jes says to myself  those eastern
sports will get a glimpse of a plumb
good ball game then came that crash
and chuck burgette cut down the right-

so that the tone
would be more
shrill
	the railroad mans magazine

of-way giving each station the go-by as
if he was the only train operatin on that
piece of track when he crossed the
plate with the first score old man parks
and i was lookin for smoke he had
gone plumb crazy instead of follow-

ing the rails to that first sack he had
jumped the rope and was a good hun-
dred yards up the railroad track cap in
hand if he had been going any faster
he wouldnt have been touchin even the
high spots

  old man parks reaches down and
grabs me by the shoulder for a minute
i thought i had been caught between the
bumpers

   davis he says kinda husky-like as
if his flues were stopped up  the canon
bridge is on fire 

  about that time everybody saw the
smoke less than a mile up the track and
knowing that the bridge wasnt nothin
but wood most of the spectatorsstarted
for it

  parks led the bunch i carried more
tonnage than the
old man and i
stopped long en-
ough to look at my
watch  was three-
twenty no  had
been out of belle-
mont just two min-
utes if she was on
time and with ste-
vens pullin her it
was a good bet that
she was right on the
dot

  stevens-that ex-
plained it i knew
right away why
smoke had been
watching the time
mollie stevens well 
decided of a sudden that
i wanted to get to that
bridge myself and after
i got under way i made
pretty fair time too

the old man led me by
fifty yards and i led the
crowd by a hundred and
i was the last to start
guess theres nothin to be
ashamed of in that record

that bridge was burn-
ing the canon there is
a hundred feet deep and
about sixty feet wide and
its as straight up and
down as the sides of a box
car the smoke and
flames made it impossible to walk across
the ties were burning one rail had al-
ready begun to twist and there was
smoke in his red uniform the old man
without his hat and me minus everything
i could discard includin most of my
wind

   its almost time for  said smoke 
and while the old man quickly pulled his
watch i broke the silence tryin to in-
hale a little air

   in twelve minutes gasped the old
man thats every word that was spoken

the canon bridge is
on fire  
smokes lost independence



  the track between bellemont and
flagstaff is so crooked that a snake would
break its neck tryin to follow it its
down the mountainside and if a fellows
pullin a long string he has to slow down
his engine to let the caboose get out of
the way

   less than fifty yards west of the canon
bridge the track goes sharply to the left
along a precipice once around this curve
there is a mile stretch the longest piece
of straight track between bellemont and
flagstaff but with no flyin - machine
handy and that bridge nothin less than
the slatted gates of a chasm it didnt
look as if there was a chance to get a
signal around that curve

  im sure strong for evolution since
that fourth of july theres no doubt
but if you trace the line back far enough
youll find youre uncomfortably closely
related to an ape

  now there was smoke for instance
when he saw that one cable into which
the telegraph-wires were gathered run-
ning alongside the bridge he reverted to
type right away

  there wasnt nothin human about
him his face wasnt natural he was
just an ape dressed up in a red uniform
goin across some ravine on a grape-vine

  before the old man or i knew what
smoke was about he had stepped out on
one of the side girders of the bridge
balanced there a moment and jumped
toward the cable six feet away he
tcaught it with his hands swung back and
forth a moment then started hand over
hand toward the other side

   i dont reckin im from the same race
of apes cause it made me feel sick and
dizzy to see him swinging there with the
flames and smoke trying their best to
reach out after him

  i didnt like the sight of it but i
couldnt help lookin and as he neared
the other side and his steps with his
hands became slower and shorter i
couldnt help a sayin  my god  if he
just had a tail to help him hold on

   course that wasnt nothin nice to say
at that time but the old man didnt even
say that much and the crowd which had
got up just stood and watched and held
their breath

  he was all but over on the far side
the cable was strung from a pole so that

it was about twenty feet above the
ground he was right over the far bank
when the bridge settled and one of the
big uprights fell crashing into the cable
and sriappin it in two as if it had been
a string

   just turned my head away but that
didnt keep me from hearing the sound
of a whistle which came down the moun-
tainside

  the crowd began to yell and i turned
around again smoke was standing
across there on one foot about ten feet
from the canons brink

  his face was bleeding he didnt look
like smoke at all he was pullin off the
red shirt of his baseball uniform and if
he heard the cheering or the roaring of
the fire or the crash of falling bridge
timbers he didnt let on

  down on his hands and knees he went
and then the smoke and flames from the
bridge cut off our line of vision the
old man and f moved back from the heat
and we didnt either of us make any re-
marks addressed to the crowd

  i dont know how many pay-days went
by before i heard the long whistle which
told me that stevens was coming into
that straight track and i knew that the
old man and the crowd was waiting for
that little toot-toot that would tell us
stevens had the signal

  i was just about ready to send in my
application for the pension-list when it
came

	well i looked at the old man and he
looked at me a moment later an engine
pilot a smoke-stack and a number-plate
poked into view just at the curve-and
stopped

  that was a good celebration we had
in flagstaff that night

  all those eastern folks from no 
came round by the trail across the canon
and joined us there was red light from
the roundhouse to the station and clear
ui the main street and they kept sput-
terin as long as the supply at the store-
house held out

  i understand there was some speech-
makin too and that fort apache band
sure did cut up with them soldier airs
and smoke got in in time to see the
finish

  we went around the trail a good two
miles and brought him in with the town


the railroad mans magazine

got so scared he jumped in front of the ball

bus and as the bus wasnt big enough
to accommodate the whole town every-
body stayed behind but the old man and
the company doctor

  it was after dark when the bus backed
up to the one-room emergency hospital
but that didnt keep me and the rest of
the town from bein there and it wasnt
dark enough to keep me from seein that
molly stevens and her father got out of
the bus

  then i remembered that molly had a
habit of making trips with her father
when he had to take his run out or be
on the road on christmas the fourth of
july or her birthday

  an hour after the arrival of the bus
the old man came out of the hospital
walked over to the depot where from

the apex of a truck he de-
livered the real superior
goods in the way of a
fourth-of-july oration

  he paid his compliments
to the spirit of heroism for
which america is noted
and made a few remarks
regarding one smoke du-
gan who at that moment
was resting as easy as one
could with a broken leg
a lacerated face two badly
mutilated hands and mi-
nus several inches of skin
from various spots on his
anatomy

  i hose remarks on smoke
started the biggest night of
cheerin i ever lived
through it got so noisy
 had to go over to the
roundhouse and set down
by an engine that was
blowin off to find a place
quiet enough to think

  when the old man got
down from the truck after
the daniel webster stunt he says to me
he says

   davis this is a real fourth-of-july

 making up lost time

by john walters

while a general impression exists among laymen that making up lost
time means dashing down grades and around curves at a mile a
minute with a wide-open throttle maximum speed laws and time
spotters make such a performance somewhat risky

    how the lost minutes are to be caught up and pushed back into eternity
under the engine drivers is a problem that has brought gray hairs to more
than one eagle-eye and is more than ever the great question that perplexes
engineers

    now and then the regulations are broken and no one is the wiser-but
it is only the engineer who saves every second that might have been wasted
in starting and stopping and who plans the speed of his run down to a nicety
of seconds and rail-lengths who really succeeds in these days of fast schedules
and limited trains

the many changing factors which must be taken into account by
the man at the throttle in solving the brain-racking problem
of bringing in on time a train that is late

quickly as possible not many of the
railroads will tolerate anything like that
nowadays there are strict orders against
making up time in the spectacular way
in which most people think it is done

  railroad executives have come to be-
lieve that if the public thought for a
moment that the engineer was allowed
to dash ahead with a train and to rely
entirely on his own judgment as to the
margin of safety the passengers present
and prospective would be terrified and
the railroad would get a bad name
 absolute safety  is now the open motto
of railroad managers not a single
chance or risk must be taken

maximum speed rules

 not only are time schedules made so
that as large a margin as possible may
be left for delays but over every mile of
track there is clearly indicated the maxi-
mum speed at which a train can be run
where there is a stretch of steel for in-


          he reputation of having its
trains on time is one of the
most important assets of a
railroad delays however
are liable to occur when
least expected for a thou-
sand and one reasons a train may fail to
reach its destination at the moment the
schedule calls for it may be held up
in a block by some obstruction aheid the
rails may be slippery there may be a
hot box a fast freight may get in the
way-this has been known to happen-
brakeshoes may be tight and at certain
stations time may be lost in the handling
of baggage more frequently than the
public dreams of there is time to be made
up how is it done

  it is by no means as simple as it looks
the days are long past when the man in
the cab could drive ahead at reckless
speed- go through the curves instead of
around them as one old-timer said and
rush the train along with the single idea
of winning back the lost minutes as

stance where tune may possibly be eaten
up at the rate of eighty miles an hour the
directions are that sixty miles shall be
the top speed if an engineer is found
to have transgressed he suffers a bad
quarter of an hour in the superintendents
or trainmasters office

  but it is always the pride of every rail-
road to be on time the new york cen-
tral made a public announcement not long
ago that over a given period of several
months their twentieth century limited
to and from chicago had beenon time
ninety-nine and a fraction per cent of
its runs

planning a run

  the erie takes vast satisfaction in its
official statement lately that it was ahead
of all railroads coming into new york
in making a record of a fraction over
ninety-six per cent of all of its trains
being on time

  an engineer must not be caught break-
ing rules he must run with the avoid-
ance of every risk of preventable acci-
dents if he wishes to be thought a good
man in his business and a credit to his
railroad he must manage somehow to
get his train in on time to the dot with
unfailing regularity thus it is that a
curious set of unwritten laws has come
into existence among the engine crews
the substance of these is that lost time
must be made up somehow

  stretching the rules in regard to fast
running is officially not countenanced if
known and yet the man in the cab who
slips through on time despite every ob-
stacle keeps the best run and ranks high-
est in the regard of his superiors from
the president down

  as a matter of fact the engineer who
is not capable of planning successfully
in every way how to get back the lost
minutes is regarded as lacking in ability
hardly one of them however will ac-
knowledge this to an outsider all pref-
ace everything they have to say by the
statement that they are held down by the
official maximum rates of speed

  the executives also make the same
point this is strongly substantiated by
the fact that many railroads in the east
send out men who might be called time
spotters their business is to lie in wait

at points which it is believed present
peculiar temptations to the engineer for
the breaking of speed laws and to catch
him in the act

  the result is that the matter of making
up time on the eastern roads--the west-
ern still give considerable leeway-has
become a very complicated one it is a
problem that requires the utmost clever-
ness and skill in emergencies

  the factors of the problem are con-
tinually changing the engine the track
the weight of the train the weather etc
the success of the solution depends more
than all else on the personal skill and
experience of the individual engineer
making up time does not consist of a
series of hair-raising dashes over long
stretches of road it is done by gaining
it back a moment here another there and
so on

  it takes every atom of ingenuity to
do the trick that chances are taken now
and then cannot be denied but these
chances are not so great as they might
seem to any one who did not possess an
intimate knowledge of the strength and
power of track and engine and a nice
regard for the laws of gravitation

  firemen often brag more about making
up time than the engineers  finest
feller on the road to fire for one of
them will say about the man on whose
left-hand side he works

  hes no hand to make lunch-counter
runs he dont tell the girls at the bean-
ery how it happened so i have to he
will conclude with a grin

he got in on time

  making up time is more difficult on
some roads and on certain hundred-mile
stretches than on others from new
york to port jervis for instance is
eighty-eight miles on the erie the usual
running time is about two hours and fif-
teen minutes including stops this part
of the erie is full of curves and if an
engineer makes up ten or fifteen minutes
on this run it is considered pretty good
work

  the record of time regained there is
twenty-three minutes the  miles
from new york to albany over the cen-
tral is a fairly straight bit of track
 big arthur  allen who brings the
making up lost time



empire state express from the capital
down to high bridge has left albany
forty minutes late-but here is the story
as they tell it around the master me-
chanics office

   the super ripped around that they
were forty minutes late in pulling out
and big arthur sat in the cab and never
said a word

    now says the superintendent ra-
ther sarcastic   suppose you know that
this is the empire state express youre
running  

    yep says  big arthur

   well do you know what time hes
supposed to pull into high bridge

    yep says big arthur again and
thats all he did say but holy smoke
how he did run jim the fireman kept
her hot they say the porters on the
private car were scared green a hun-
dred miles an hour some of the way she
came in on time to the dot

a veteran engineer

  charles h mygatt of the erie has
probably run an engine longer than any
other man in the united states and has
made up as much time as any engineer
in the service certainly there is no
other engineer who has served on com-
pany so long on one division of the same
railroad

  it is fifty-three years now since mygatt
got his engine he started in  as
water boy and four years later became
an engineer railroads were young in
those days and so were the engineers
just lately having reached the age of
seventy he has been retired but still con-
tinues in the railroads employ in the
yard service at port jervis

  mygatt is the typical mechanical ex-
pert his gray chin-beard gives him an
air of picturesqueness big-framed rud-
dy-cheeked clear-eyed he does not begin
to look his seventy years riding behind
the thoroughbred mare he drives at a
brisk clip over the country roads recently
he told me of his experiences in making
up time

 let her alone when shes doing her
best said mygatt  dont drive her 
at first an engines like a horse-the
more you worry her the less shell do
the veterans thoughts began to wan-

der back through a long vista of yester-
days he could see himself again and
again with a heavy handicap of lost time
to be won back

   to do this he had to cajole and per-
suade the vast and complicated mass of
steel that he drove it was not simply
a huge bulk of metal that was governed
by purely mechanical laws but something
that seemed half-human that needed a
pat of approval now and then and a
thorough understanding if the best re-
sults were to be obtained the machines
that he had handled during his more
than half a century of service were not
so different from the mare that he was
driving now

   let her alone he said  when shes
doing her best

   theres a great difference in men
when it comes to running an engine
went on charley mygatt  never for-
get that time is made by the man who
knows how to get the most out of his
engine its the little things that count
then you might not think perhaps how
some will use up time at stations yet
as much as five minutes may be gained
in the skilful making of a stop

   one man will shut off steam long be-
fore he needs to and his train will come
into the station slowly another who
understands the road and his engine is
cool and watchful will keep up full
speed to the last possible second he
will calculate so that with not a particle
of time lost he will bring his train to a
stop precisely where he should

saving every moment

   yes in a run of a hundred miles you
keep figuring little matters like this and
you hurry right along we know just
what we are doing just what we can do
and when time is to be made up we can
tell every second how much we are gain-
ing an engineer doesnt keep taking
out his watch he can feel to the instant
how the miles are being eaten up

   keep steam up to the maximum pres-
sure the old engineer went on  that
means having ready for instant service
at every second all the energy there is
thats how to drive an engine and let
me say that not every engineer appre-
ciates it	


the railroad mans magazine

   but you cant make a really good
run without it everything depends on
the man who is firing for you there
are some firemen who cant keep up
steam one will go too fast at the start
and tire before the end of the run  an-
other will be too slow all the way and
so on

   making up time looks easy people
who dont know much about railroading
think that all a man has to do is to drive
ahead thinking of nothing but keeping
at top speed  might as well let this
mare run away that would be the same
principle

when to go slow

   i know what an engine can do even
better than the speed i can safely get out
of this horse when i have had time to
make up i have planned it all out from
the start

   risk no not if a mans competent
and knows his business track maximum
speed orders and all that it doesnt
do for a man in the cab to get the repu-
tation of being reckless

   a little of that and when anything
does go wrong you can imagine where the
blame lights first no a mans got to
make good in some other way-by think-
ing and calculating a railroad wants
a man who can bring his train in on
time without taking unusual chances

   when youre starting out to make
up time there are certain places where
for your own safety youve got to go
slow an engineer must know these
sometimes he doesnt one day on this
very division of the erie  was running
at a pretty good clip this part of the
road is full of curves and there is one
that was pretty bad

   the train i was hauling was an im-
portant one we had started late and
there was a lot of time to be made up
my engine was in the best of condition
we struck that curve a bit too fast she
made a jump and came down on the rails
with such a jolt that i thought she had
broken every spring in her

   yes she came down all right and
we got in on time but i was a little
nervous for a second or so but i knew
what my engine could do and she didnt
disappoint me

   thats the whole secret of running
and making up time you must know
your engine like a wife then when
its necessary shell come up to the
scratch you cant stay on any road for
fifty years without understanding that
each engine is different from all the
rest the same as women are and they
even vary in temper from day to day

   another thing to remember is that
a good part of the secret of making up
time is never to attempt it until you know
that your engine is in just the right con-
dition the engineer must test her as
he starts he can usually tell in a mo-
ment or so everything depends on how
she responds in a few miles you know
whether you can count on her to do her
prettiest

   some years ago i had a party of
officials of the road and it was necessary
to make some fast time as we pulled
out of jersey city i planned just how
i was going to do it i knew we would
have to take some of the curves at the
maximum of speed and i did it without
exceeding a fraction though it broke all
the dishes in the diner

   one safe way to make up time-the
one that is most commonly followed-
is to strike the best gait you can and
keep it up its surprising how many
minutes you can save by close attention
to that simple method

a narrow escape

  its harder nowadays to make up
time than it used to be years ago the
schedule for most of the runs used to be
about thirty miles an hour that left a
big margin when you were behind time
as it was possible to hook her up to sixty
or seventy miles an hour here and there

   now those same runs are scheduled
at forty or forty-five miles an hour and
at a good many points where you might
gain time there are maximum speed or-
ders out against you it takes a keen
engineer to do the trick of making up
ten or fifteen minutes in a short run
out west though on those long stretches
of level track its different

   in the course of years there are some
exciting moments yes they do come
but engineers never think much about
them once they are past just a part of
making up lost time



the days work heres one experience
 happen to remember

   it happened some years ago when i
was a comparatively young man we
were making up time in great shape no
maximum speed rules in those days it
was up in the mountains where the
simple and compound curves are as thick
as blackberries in summer

   i wasnt taking any chances but i
was making my engine do the best that
was in her danger no not when the
engineer knows his business everything
depends on that we had just hit a com-
pound curve and were negotiating the
first twist when the front drivers jumped
the track

   some minor official of the road was
with me in the cab i dont remember
now just who i only recall how scared

he was i suppose any one who didnt
understand engine driving would have
been it looked worse than it was it
simply required a moment of careful
handling

    wait till we get on the other curve
i yelled  cant do anything on this
track

   with the front drivers still off the
rails we whirled around that curve and
on to the next and then as my friend
in the cab held his breath the front dri-
vers dropped back on the steel and the
engine jogged along the same as ever

   i wouldnt care to try to duplicate
that feat every day in the week however
when those things happen we seldom
talk about them afterward we forget
them and they dont get on the official
records

 train despatching by telephone

growth of the new system which doubles the speed of message
transmission and gives fewer opportunities for
operators to make mistakes

one of the most important innovations
which has taken place in the history
of railroading is that being put into effect
now by many of the railroads throughout the
country namely a new method of despatch-
ing trains says k w endres in the rail-
way and engineering review the tele-
phone is gradually replacing the telegraph
for this service on many of the big railroad
systems in the united states and with the
change departs one of the most conspic-
uous features that has accompanied railroad-
ing since its early beginnings

  the aim throughout in train-despatching
is to eliminate mistakes and the result of
the effort which has been extended along

this line is in the development of experi-
enced men and first-class machinery to
handle numbers of trains in all kinds of com-
plicated and intricate maneuvers without
accident and without delay

  time is a great essential in handling train
movements with the telegraph a de-
spatcher lias always been limited to the
speed at which the ordinary operator can
receive messages and work the key and
this speed even with the most expert men
would not average more than fifty words
per minute

  with the telephone it is easily possible to
speak one hundred words per minute and
the gain in time is obvious furthermore


the railroad mans magazine

the operator at the way station writes it
down as he receives it the telephone
therefore eliminates one chance for mis-
takes which has been existent with the tele-
graphic method in that the despatcher sent
his message and then wrote it out as it was
repeated back to him by the way stations
now the despatcher can call in as many sta-
tion operators as he wishes can give them
the train orders and have each man repeat
the order back to him word by word spell-
ing out the stations and figures and under-
lining each word as it comes in

  the actual results in the two years the
telephone has been in use in this country for
this purpose have shown that not a single
accident has occurred due to the telephone
method of despatching

  another great advantage which the rail-
roads did not appreciate until after they had
their new system in operation was the gain
that resulted in discipline and cooperation
between the men

  it is a curious phase of human nature but
it seems to be a fact that when a way sta-

tion operator can call up the despatcher and
say  bill no  just passed he feels
much better acquainted with that despatcher
than if he said the same thing by means of
a series of dots and dashes one de-
spatcher said that he had never been
 mad  since the telephone system had been
put into operation

  the system about to be installed on the
georgia railroad will equip the division
between augusta and atlanta georgia a
distance of  miles and from camak
georgia to macon a distance of  miles

  other railroads in the south which have
been active in adopting the telephone method
of handling train movements are the south-
ern railway the chesapeake and ohio the
norfolk and western the seaboard air
line the atlantic coast line and the caro-
lina and ohio railway

  the system employed by all these rail-
roads is practically uniform throughout
it is what is known as the western electric-
gill system and employs the gill selector
with western electric telephone apparatus

third oldest pennsy employe dead

andrew nebinger the third oldest
pensioner  the pennsylvania lines
east of pittsburgh and erie died on april
 at his home in harrisburg pennsylvania
after an illness of fifteen weeks

  mr nebinger was ninety-one years old on
march  he was a native of york coun-
ty and came from a long-lived family his
mother having been eighty-seven at her
death and his father seventy-nine

  his name has been unique on the pension
rolls of the pennsylvania railroad com-
pany says the patriot of harrisburg in
an interesting account of the veterans life
because of the fact that he was one of the
three men whose ages are more than ninety
years and was one of the first benefited when
the company established its pension fund in


  he also had the distinction of having
voted for william henry harrison on the
whig ticket and of having eaten dinner at
harpers ferry with henry clay

  mr nebinger came to this city with his
family from lewisburg his birthplace in
i and for over fifty years resided in his

present home on north sixth street his
wife died eighteen years ago

  at the outbreak of the civil war he was
employed by the pennsylvania railroad as a
carpenter he entered the government serv-
ice and took an important part in mcclel-
lans campaign at the close of the wiy he
again entered the railroad service and con-
tinued until retired he was employed as a
master carpenter having built a number of
the bridges between harrisburg and phila-
delphia	

  the other two employees over ninety years
of age are andrew abels of philadelphia
who was born may   and retired jan-
uary   and david b price of sun-
bury division born november   and
retired at the same time

  the death of mr nebinger takes away the
second of the pennsylvanias oldest men
within a year the first being james cullen
of spruce creek who died last summer

  he is survived by one daughter mrs
henrietta lucas four grandsons one grand-
daughter miss henrietta l bishop and two
brothers lewis m and edwin nebinger

                 become a law unto themselves

               synopsis of previous chapters

fred erskine visits the general manager of the chicago st louis and western
railroad andrew warrington with a letter from his father who was an engineer
on the engine warrington fired it is understood that when fred has graduated warring-
ton will place him he now finds that he is unable to do so bonds of the value of half a
million dollars have been stolen and suspicion points toward warringtons son warrington
senior is suspicious of the motives of montresor who has gained the friendship of joe
warrington and apparently of louise warringtons daughter the old man gives the
task of solving the disappearance of the bonds to erskine he is to work absolutely in the
dark receiving no recognition from warrington using any means he wishes he is to
take louise to the opera that night but louise suspecting him has the coachman drive to
lincoln park and there fred is assaulted by a man whom he believes to be montresor
erskine is walking on the lake shore when he meets barney mcgrane the discharged coach-
man of the warringtons who is very loyal to miss warrington erskine succeeds in con-
vincing him that he is miss warringtons friend and the coachman agrees to work with him
others arrive and erskine gathers that it is their intention to kill warrington he meets
the young fellow who agrees to confide in him but as erskine leads the way from the shore
joe warrington is mortally stabbed during his last moments he discloses to erskine that
the bonds are being expressed by montresor to tacoma in a typewriter machine-box
erskine and barney decide to leave the city and follow up the box containing the bonds
they arrive at wapita falls barney sees louise and her mother alighting from the
train and imparts this intelligence to erskine who meanwhile has discovered the box
labeled for tacoma securing tickets for the train on which this box has been shipped he
finds the two women on board and visits them in their stateroom where he tells them of
joes death the two women leave the train near the washington state line and erskine fears
that they have stopped to telegraph to warrington accusing himself and barney of bring-
ing about the young mans death determined to recover the bonds at all costs he decides
to hold up the train behind which he knows carries montresor and the express box which
he is after he and barney slip from their pullman as the train nears two rivers and
securing a hand-car set out for the tunnel-mouth they have selected for the hold-up on
the way the hand-car runs away and upsets while they are trying to prevent its crashing
into a freight-train ahead but both escape with a few bruises

      a fateful encounter

hen mcgrane arrived
at the spot at which
the altoona man was
awaiting him erskine
bade him put down the
suit - case he carried
then slipped a revolver and cartridge-
belt into his hands

speaking deliberately erskine said

began in the march railroad mans



 as i have told you this revolver con-
tains nothing but blank cartridges fire
these whenever you think it necessary to
intimidate persons who may be disposed
to offer resistance the belt is filled
with ball cartridges which are not to be
used however until we get away from
the train is this clear to you now

   yes sir replied the irishman dubi-
ously then after a pause he added
but if i see montresor-

  if you see montresor be especially
careful that he does not recognize you

magazine single copies  cents


the railroad mans magazine

and above all things do not forget that
youx revolver must hold nothing more
than blanks all i will take from the
train is stolen property which i intend
to return to its rightful owner we
must score a bloodless victory

   and when the train stops where am
i goin to begin asked mcgrane

   you will get to the cab of the loco-
motive and cover the engineer and fire-
man neither of these must touch a
hand to a lever until i enter the cab
and give them the word to do so when

i	appear you will leave the rest to me
neither of these men must be injured
for  will have use for them when i get
from the express-car the box i pointed
out to you at wapiti falls now put
on this mask and tie it firmly

  in a moment both men were masked
from his suit-case erskine now took a
couple of signal torpedoes one of
these he placed on one of the rails
then bidding mcgrane follow him he
picked up his suit-case and ran on about
a hundred yards there he laid the
second torpedo on a rail

  with mcgrane at his heels the al-
toona man quickly continued on his way
up the grade once he halted and stri-
king a match he glanced at his watch
he saw that the cascade flier was now
due at two rivers

  the two men jogged on until finally
they came to the top of the grade there
erskine stopped and listened all was
still between the two rails the altoona
man now placed one of the two little tin
cylinders he had taken from his suit-case
a few minutes before the second cylin-
der he left in his pocket

   now barney keep a grip on your
suit-case until you are beside the cab of
the locomotive erskine said  when
you climb up on the engine drop the
case on the ground beside it and cover
the two men with your gun go a hun-
dred paces along the track and wait for
the train i will join you as soon as i
fire this flare

  mcgrane had scarcely left erskines
side when from the east there came the
long quivering shriek of a locomotive

  erskines heart seemed to leap to his
mouth but quickly mastering himself
he drew out a match-box and dropped
on one knee beside the little cylinder

  two minutes passed then erskine
heard the avhistle again he inferred
that the train having passed two riv-
ers without slackening speed was now at
the top of the grade down which the
hand-car had rushed from his match-
box he extracted several matches and
leaning forward peered back along the
line

  then faintly at first but growing
brighter each moment lie saw the glow
of the headlight of the approaching
train and now the desperate man felt
as if some remorseless hand suddenly jiad
sundered the last tie that bound him to
the cleanly things of life

  there seemed to come to him the
knowledge that all the ambitious plans
of his youth had gone for naught be-
reft of honor and self-respect he trem-
blingly awaited the brand of criminality

  into the honest rugged features of his
loving father he could look no more
failure would mean a long period of
confinement behind prison-bars success
-how little his reward would be after
all

  fie was wavering now with a wild
exultant thrill he suddenly realized that
it was not yet too late to draw back from
the desperate act he had meditated then
he seemed to see again the wan despair-
ing face of andrew warrington and he
remembered all that andrew warrington
had done for him

  in his ears eclioed the words of the
general managers dying son  my hon-
or and my fathers and he wondered
how-if he failed in his quest-andrew 
warrington would explain to louise his
reasons for causing her to become ac-
quainted with frederick erskine

  for several minutes the headlight of
the onrushing locomotive had disap-
peared from his view but the rumble of
the approaching train was growing loud-
er in his ears then like the crack of
a mighty whip goading him on to action
came the detonation of the first of the
torpedoes

  he struck a match and held it over
the top of the little tin cylinder between
the rails before the match went out
a little ruby glow began to spread be-
neath it

  brighter and brighter grew the red-
dish light erskine rose and tottered
without lights



from it and as he ran the detonation of
the second torpedo sounded in his ears

  it suddenly occurred to erskine now
that he had a race to run and gripping
his suit-case he plunged on madly from
behind him came the whistling of air-
brakes and a dull grinding sound that
assured him that the train was slowing
down the glow of the flare he had
lighted was so bright that he dared not
look over his shoulder lest the engineer
of the locomotive should see his masked
face and prepare to offer effectual resist-
ance or decide to put on speed again

   at length he became aware of the fact
that a dark figure a score of paces far-
ther on was crouching beside the track
and he knew it was mcgrane then the
red light vanished suddenly a whistle
sounded sharply and a broad stream of
yellow light shot ahead of him along the
track

  the locomotive of the cascade flier
was close behind him turning abrupt-
ly the altoona man leaped from the
track and a moment later the great hiss-
ing locomotive slowed down beside him

  erskine looked for mcgrane the
irishman already was in action and was
only four or five paces away

	 all right sir  mcgrane called re-
assuringly  then reaching up to the
hand-rail of the locomotive he swung
himself up to the cab

  for only a moment did erskine hesi-
tate then as he heard the irishman
shout  hands up  to the occupants of
the cab he dashed down to the express-
car

  the incidents that followed happened
quickly and ever afterward they seemed
to erskine like those of a nightmare
how he entered the express-car he did
not know he remembered seeing around
him two or three blanched faces as he
looked at them over his revolver he
had asked the occupants of the car if
they had a typewriter aboard this he
had assured them was all that he wanted
and as he spoke he knew by the expres-
sions on the faces of the men he addressed
that they believed him to be mad

   satisfied that he was a dangerous luna-
tic however they quickly decided to hu-
mor him one of them pointed to a box
in one of the corners of the car on the
box were the words  anxell typewri-

ter and the address he had read in the
baggage-room at wapiti falls

  he directed the men to take it to the
side door of the car and they obeyed
him with a thrust of his foot he sent
it out into the night

   when i go close the door and do
not open it again until you are out of
gunshot he commanded

  as he finished speaking he left the
car and the door was closed behind him
moving quickly erskine grasped the
rope handles of the box and hurried with
it to the front of the train there he
threw it on the platform at the doorless
end of the baggage-car this done he
tossed up his suit-case and mcgranes
beside it after which he hurried to the
locomotive and mounted to the cab

  just as he was about to enter the cab
a dark figure moved toward him and
erskine suddenly realized that he was
looking into the muzzle of a revolver

   mcgrane   exclaimed the altoona
man in a warning voice

  with an oath the dark figure leaned
toward him from the muzzle of the
revolver leaped a flash of flame that al-
most blinded him and the report of the
revolver pistols discharge rang in his
ears as he grappled with the man who
had fired at him erskine saw that he
was slighter than mcgrane

	erskines left hand had closed around
the right wrist of- his adversary and his
right hand gripped the strangers throat
it required only a second or two to con-
vince erskine that he was the stronger
of the two and satisfied of this he re-
laxed his hold on the throat of his as-
sailant

  with a quick movement of his right
hand he grasped the still smoking re-
volver then swung it against the others
head with a low groan the stranger
clutching erskines mask collapsed and
sank to the floor of the cab

  realizing that the revolver which he
had just taken was the one filled with
blank cartridges which he had given to
mcgrane erskine now drew from his
belt the weapon that he had carried at
the time he entered the express-car this
was loaded with ball cartridges and
dominated by a spirit of desperation he
was resolved to shoot any one who now
attacked him


the railroad mans magazine

  already his game seemed half lost for
unmasked as he was he was in imminent
danger of being seen by some one who
would be able to describe his features
to those who within a few hours would
essay the task of running him down

  by the light of the lantern that hung
above the gages erskine now saw the
finish of a struggle that had been waged
on the firemans side of the cab felled
by a powerful uppercut on the chin mc-
grane lay gasping in a corner while the
brawny square-shouldered man who had
put him there turned sharply to confront
the new intruder

  erskine was thinking quickly and act-
ing surely now resolved that no aid
should come to the engineer and fireman
from the cars behind him he stepped
across the body of the man he had
knocked down and opened the throttle

  a thrill of exultation passed through
him as the great locomotive began to
move a moment later his revolver was
leveled at the head of the black-capped
man in the blue jumper and overalls
who had mastered mcgrane

   hands up or ill let you have it 
erskine said in a low deliberate voice

   well blaze away you- began the
other leaping forward

  but he stopped-stopped with a hand
extended toward the weapon on the trig-
ger of which erskines finger was trem-
bling- stopped before it was too late
moved by a common impulse each of the
staring men drew back and the hand
that grasped the revolver slowly fell to
erskines side over the features of both
spread a look of horror and their eyes
grew glazed and wide

  the blue-clad man was the first to
break the silence that fell upon them

   fred-fred-oh heaven-my son  
he stammered

  and the other murmured feebly
 father 

chapter xvii
the hand on the throttle

 s motionless as if carved of stone
father and son continued to gaze
upon each other with expressions of hor-
ror that seemed to deepen as the moments
passed from a corner of the cab came

a half-stifled groan from the lips of the
still unconscious mcgrane on the elder
erskine this appeared to have no effect
to the younger man however it came
as a call to action and again he reached
for the throttle lever

   stop   old sam erskine command-
ed hoarsely

  the son opened the throttle wider
the father laid a hand on his arm

  boy-boy-are you mad he mut-
tered

  fred shook his head  no he an-
swered gloomily

  the old man pointed to the corner in
which mcgrane was lying

   is that fellow-the fellow with the
mask-a friend of yours fred he
asked in shaking accents

  the young man nodded the fingers
of the engineer sank deeply into the arm
they grasped the locomotive was rap-
idly gathering headway now the rum-
ble of its wheels was growing louder
and the two men swayed as it took a
curve old sams eyes wandered to the
body of his fireman who lay with his
feet in the cab and his head and out-
stretched hands on the floor of the tender
the eyes of the old engineer grew nar-
rower

   and it was my own flesh and blood
that struck down ned latlock  he mut-
tered then his face grew whiter and
more tense as he added  is that your
black mask thats a lyin there beside
him

  the younger mans only answer was a
nod the old engineer drew back and
his trembling hand fell from the arm
which it had been gripping

  fred-fred-boy-weve been dream-
in aint we sam erskine asked in
pleading accents  theres somethin
snapped in this old fool head of mine
and things is runnin queer it aint
true is it fred that you-that i-

  fred was on the engineers bench now
and was peering through the window
his left hand grasped the throttle-lever
a great numbness had settled on his fac-
ulties and he moved mechanically

  the old engineer breathing heavily
and with his features twitching spasmod-
ically waited for an answer he waited
in vain from the compressed lips of
his son there came no sound walking
without lights



unsteadily to the young man who now
occupied his seat sam laid a hand on his
shoulder

   it aint no dream son i guess he
said huskily  now what have you got
to say yes youve got to speak when
im on duty i aint got no mind or heart
for anything in all the world but my
engine track and signals

   when im out of my cab my mind
heart hopes and pride are all for you
im on duty now and im goin to run
this engine but first im goin to find out
why two masked men held her up and
laid out ned tatlock and so by
heaven youll speak or you and me will
start right now for hades together 

  with blazing eyes and clenched fists
the old engineer drew back threatening-
ly freds face was livid as turning
he looked over his shoulder at his father
but he met the elder mans gaze unflinch-
ingly

   speak  the engineer repeated
 why did you hold up this train to-
night 

  in the ears of the young man were
ringing the words the general manager
had spoken scarcely more than two days
before

   your relations with me must not be
known to any person other than our-
selves

  and like his fathers fred erskines
duty was clear andrew warringtons
confidence must be respected and his
orders obeyed to the letter

   speak boy - speak   commanded
erskine in a strident voice  i ask you
for the last time why did you hold up
this train  

  with the gaze of his bloodshot eyes
still on the face of his father fred
erskine answered grimly

  because thedale express-car just
behind you was carrying stolen prop-
erty-property which i have been sent
out here to recover

   was it stolen by the dale express
company  the old man demanded
sharply

   no but the dale express was acting
as carrier for the thief

   then by fleaven it is with the thief
you have to reckon-but youve got to
reckon first with me while the dale
car is runnin as a part of the cascade

flier the chicago st louis and west-
ern is responsible for its safe delivery at
tacoma

   if youve took anything out of the
dale car it goes back at the next stop
we make or into the hands of the sheriff
you go when we pull into weatherbee
this is my first run as its engineer
-and by heaven shes goin through
on time that bench is mine and youll
get down from it get down  say 

  pale and haggard fred erskine rose
as his father took a determined step in
his direction suddenly the old man
hesitated and darted a swiftglance at
the closed door of the fire-box sudden-
ly he was kneeling beside the prostrate
form of his fireman his eyes gleamed
wildly as he stood upright again

   well since youve done for him
youve got to do his work growled the
engineer  draw him in and lay him
alongside that four-flushing gun-fighter
of yours then get hold of a shovel and
heave in the coal come-step lively
there aint nothin more to say until we
get to weatherbee

  fred stepped down and a moment
later his father with a hand on the
throttle was peering out into the dark-
ness without pausing to cast off his
coat fred drew the inanimate fireman
to one side of the cab and then flung
open the door of the fire-box

  once in the course of the next five
minutes old sam erskine looked over
his shoulder his features were white
and grim but the expression of anxiety
in his eyes gradually gave place to one
of transient satisfaction as he observed
with what vigor his brawny son was ad-
dressing himself to his task

  wider and wider the engineer opened
the throttle and faster and faster
plunged onward the great swaying steel
monster beneath him the altoona man
-coatless and hatless now and with
streams of perspiration streaking the
grime that was settling on his face-
kept watchful eyes on the gages and
never permitted his energy to flag

  once while the interior of the cab
was aglow with the fierce light that is-
sued from the open door of the fire-box
fred saw that mcgrane had recovered
consciousness and leaning on one of his
elbows was gazing at him with wonder-


the railroad mans magazine

ing eyes nodding glumly the young
man went on with his work

  fred erskine had been thus engaged
for about ten minutes when a low ex-
clamation from tatlock the fireman
caused him to look in his direction ris-
ing with difficulty tatlock leaned for-
ward and looked malignantly at the man
who was in the act of throwing another
shovelful of coal into the fire-box

   what the deuce are you doing now 
the fireman demanded in a surly tone

   its all right ned said the engi-
neer in a hollow voice  just you keep
still and pull yourself together until we
get to weatherbee this boy knows what
he is doin and hes takin his orders
from me there aint goin to be no
more trouble ned-for you

  there was a pause then tatlock asked
 are you all right sam 

   yes son-all right replied the en-
gineer but there was a gulping sound in
his throat as he said it

  freds voice was the next to break the
silence

   what time do we get to tyrcone
he asked

   an hour and ten minutes  answered
the engineer shortly

   that is where you pass the coast
express is it not  the altoona man
went on

    yes

   are you scheduled to stop there 

  no our first stop is at weather-
bee

  fred looked speculatively in the di-
rection of mcgrane the irishman was
watching him closely and fully recov-
ered from the effects of the blow which
had rendered him unconscious seemed
now to be expecting some sort of a sig-
nal from the man under whose direction
he had been working

  fred erskine glanced again at the
gages then leaning  his shovel he
turned to the engineer

   well have to slow down at tyr-
cone he said doggedly

  as the old engineer turned slowly in
his seat his pale face was working con-
vulsively

   not this trip son he answered in
a shaking voice that was scarcely audible
above the clatter and roar of the speed-
ing locomotive	-

  trailing the shovel behind him the
young man stepped to where his father
was sitting and laid a hand on one of
his shoulders

   my friend and i must leave this train
at tyrcone he said	j

   we make no stop this side of wea-
therbee reiterated the engineer turning
again to his window

   come father- began the son in a
tone of conciliation

   we stop at weatherbee shouted the
engineer determinedly above the roar of
the engine

   well listen to me fred command-
ed in a tone that caused his father to turn
his head again  the law more humane
than you presumes a man to be inno-
cent until his guilt is proved this pre-
sumption is all i ask of you you demand
a proof of my innocence at a time avhen
those who are able to speak in my favor
and who have closed my own lips are
too far away to aid me in the situation
that confronts me now

   the situa-tion that confronts you now
is two black masks two revolvers a held-
up train a laid-out fireman and ten min-
utes lost from the schedule of the cas-
cade limited thundered the engineer
 and theres more youve said youve
took somethin out of the dale express-
car that the dale was responsible for the
delivery of

    i say  back it goes or into the hands
of the weatherbee sheriff go you and the
gun-fighter what wore mask number
two well thats all i guess-except
that we go by tyrcone aflyin and that
the first stop of this here train is wea-
therbee-cordin to train orders

   then by heaven youll be playing
into the hands of-

   ill be playin into the hands of the
chicago st louis and western rail-
road lad and thats why im right here
at this throttle

  for several minutes freds secret trem-
bled on his livid lips but duty scored
a partial triumph

   no he answered breathlessly all
unconsciously you are in league with a
criminal-a thief and a- murderer-and
you are betraying the interests of the
very company you are trying to serve
from the car behind us i took only a
box the person to whom it was con-
without lights



signed will never dare complain of its
loss for he is none other than the person
who stole it from its rightful owner it
is to that rightful owner that i purpose
restoring it

   the light of hope and restored confi-
dence flickered over the old mans face
but in a few moments it was gone again

  justice dont wear no black masks
nor hold up trains to get- whats cornin
to it son the engineer retorted jus-
tice stands up fair and square and
gets its own in the bright light of day
and so-and so-well son you see there
aint no use in talkin this here train
dont slow down until she gets to wea-
therbee

   you think then that- the son be-
gan

  the old man shook his head
v  it aint for me to do no thinkin
he answered moodily  an engineer on
duty has got to be all eyes thoughts
son aint his line of business what-
ever deep thinkin is to be done is done
by them what runs this road from offices
until them thoughts gets worked into
train orders theyre no business of an
engineers

    i got eyes for train orders cab-gages
track-signals and them there slots in the
quadrant and that about lets me out
when im on a run-unless black masks
and guns get in my way-and so un-
less i see a signal put against me this
old girl of mine keeps right on until she
gets to weatherbee

   it was not fear that set fred erskine
trembling as he drew back nor was it en-
forced resignation that chilled his mind
and heart he had been addressing a
man he never had known before-a man
who had the face and figure of his father
but withal a heart of steel and the cold
remorseless voice of an executioner and
yet he knew that under any circumstances
other than these the old man at the
throttle would lay down his life for him

  you wont trust me then the
young man cried reproachfully

  through the forward windows swept
a cloud of smoke and stinging dust which
had been belched from the smoke-stack
of the wildly rushing engine and the
deafening roar that followed plainly in-
dicated that the locomotive had plunged
into the darkness of the dumbell tunnel

      r r

  further conversation was impossible
now and again fred erskine throwing
open the fire-box door resumed the work
of throwing in coal on the left of the
cab mcgrane and the fireman each ig-
norant of the purpose of his chief sat
in gloomy silence

  from time to time the engineer glanced
at his clock and gages but for the most
part his gaze was directed along the
track ahead of him at length the loud
roar ceased suddenly and once more a
rush of fresh air swept from the cab the
choking smoke and dust that had filled
it the tunnel was behind them

  raising his arm fred erskine passed
his sleeve over his forehead and freed it
from the perspiration which was stream-
ing jnto his eyes he judged that the
locomotive was rushing onward at the
rate of sixty miles an hour if this rate
was maintained the train would be at
tyrcone in fifty minutes

  for the next half hour the four occu-
pants of the call were silent fred worked
indefatigably but as he worked he kept
watchful eyes on the clock at length
he motioned to mcgrane to come to
where he was standing

  as the irishman rose tatloek leaped
to his feet and looked at liim threaten-
ingly mcgrane hesitated and as he
returned the firemans gaze his eyes
gleamed balefully

   look sharp sam  cried the fire-
man to the engineer

  sam erskine turned quickly his son
addressed mcgrane

   theres a water-tap and basin in the
tender he said sharply  get rid of
some of that grime and blood and wait
by the tap for me

   is it all right sam 

  the engineer nodded and again looked
through his window mcgrane shuffled
out to the tender tatloek reluctantly
settled himself in the firemans seat
while fred erskine leaning on his shovel
looked gloorftily at the closed door of the
fire-box

  five minutes passed then fred moved
slowly to where his father was sitting
and laid a hand on his shoulder the
old engineer turned sharply he saw
that the left hand of his son still rested
on the handle of the shovel and that his
right was grasping a revolver


the railroad mans magazine

   we slow down four hundred yards
this side of the tyrcone station or-
the altoona man began but the express-
ion that he saw on the face of his father
stopped him it was such an expression
as hunters have seen on the faces of mor-
tally wounded animals which knowing
that death is inevitable turn their dazed
wondering eyes upon the agents of their
destruction

   or you go on alone the young man
finished

  the eyes of the old engineer grew
wider  you-you mean that you-that
you- he faltered

   i mean that if this train takes me
past tyrcone to-night it will take me
past as a corpse the young man an-
swered calmly

  for a minute longer each looked into
the others eyes then old sam erskine
slowly turned from the son who had been
his pride

  slipping the revolver into a pocket of
his trousers the altoona man drew back
again the fireman had risen and was
watching him warily

   here tatlock is your shovel fred
said quietly  i think you are able to
use it now

  as the fireman took the shovel from
his hand fred erskine turned and pick-
ing up the coat collar and neck-tie he
had removed shortly after he had as-
sumed the duties of a fireman he re-
treated to the tender there he found
mcgrane wiping his face and hands on
a handkerchief

  without speaking to his companion
fred filled the basin with clean water
and then proceeded to remove the grime
that had settled on his skin when this
was done he put on his collar and neck-
tie and then donned his coaf

   now lets get back to the tender
he said in a low voice to the irishman

  as he led the way up the sloping
mound of coal toward the rear of the
tender the young man paused and looked
over his shoulder

  at this moment tatlock threw open
the door of the fire-box and the white
cjlare that issued from the fiery furnace
revealed to fred erskines eyes the
turdy figure of his father at his post
the old engineers chin was on his breast
and as he stared out into the night one

 of his trembling hands lay idly on the
 lever which was the lever of his sons
 fate-and his

chapter xviii

caught in a corner

 tlie descent from the top of the big
 tender to the platform at the end
 of the baggage-car constituted an under-

 	taking from which even the-stout heart
 of mcgrane shrank aghast erskine ac-
 complished it successfully however and
 the irishman followed him

   the car on which the two men now
 found themselves was a blind baggage
 here on the platform the altoona man
 found the box and suit - cases he had
 placed there at the time he held up the
 train

   from one of the suit-cases erskine
 now produced a screw-driver and ham-
 mer with which he had provided him-
 self before he left chicago and in a
 couple of minutes he had succeeded in
 removing the cover from the box

   with a rapidly beating heart the
 young man began to examine the con-
 tents of the box which he had made such
 arduous efforts to obtain immediately
 beneath the cover he came upon a bunch
 of old newspapers casting these aside
 he found beneath them five packages of
 bonds of unequal sizes these he quick-
 ly transferred to the suit-cases after
 which he flung the typewriter-box from
 the train

   glancing now at his watch erskine
 saw that the train was due at tyrcone in
 five minutes once or twice mcgrane
 had spoken to him but the altoona man
 scarcely seemed to hear his words and
 they were unanswered

   the train was speeding on at the rate
 of about fifty-five miles an hour far
 darker than the night were the young
 mans thoughts as he sat on the car plat-
 form with his grim face turned to the
 dark mountains which the hurrying train
 was passing threatened with prosecu-
 tion on the charge of having been con-
 nected with the death of joseph war-
 rington and branded as a criminal by his
 father who seemed resolved to sacrifice
 his only son to a stern but misguided
 sense of duty frederick frskine felt as
without lights



if every door of hope was closed against
him the world seemed to have con-
tracted until it was no larger than a pris-
on-yard and he felt that no matter where
he might turn he would be unable to
escape the vigilance of scores of unseen
eyes that were watching his every move-
ment

  the unfortunate man knew too that
if his father proved to be so unrelenting
as to carry him on to weatherbee all
hope of escape would lie vain even if
his father kept silent on the subject of
the hold-up the men in the express-car
would speak  and tatlock the fireman
would- give a careful description of the
two men he had seen unmasked

  all this fred had realized when ap-
proaching his father he had threatened
to commit suicide if he should be car-
ried beyond tyrcone where the west
coast express which he had left at two
rivers now was awaiting the passage of
the cascade limited within his grasp
he held the bonds which represented the
honor of the warrington family and yet
the restoration of those bonds to their
proper place was to be prevented by his
own fathers unrelenting sense of duty

  and now the young man began to re-
proach himself for his failure to take his
father into his confidence he was satis-
fied that if andrew warrington had fore-
seen the situation that confronted his
agent he would have been willing that
samuel erskine should be given as much
information as might be necessary to en-
able him to act with more intelligence

  but it was too late now to effect this
compromise with the letter of his instruc-
tions while he had found it possible to
descend from the back of the big tender
to the platform of the baggage-car he
was manifestly unable to return by the
way he had come

  he was resolved that if he passed
tyrcone he would carry out the threat
he had made to his father gradually
it dawned on erskines mind that the lo-
comotive was slackening speed the
young man stiffened suddenly and he
slipped back into his trousers-pocket the
revolver he had half-drawn out the
spirit of hopelessness that had dominated
him only a moment before now gave
place to mingled exultation and self-re-
proach 

  sam erskine the father had tri-
umphed over sam erskine the duty-
bound engineer and the son had been
given the benefit of the doubt gripping
the handles of both suit-cases the al-
toona man turned to mcgrane

   when the train slows down weve
got to get away from it as quickly as we
can barney he said in quick nervous
accents  on a siding somewhere about
the station is the west coast express
which we left at two rivers we must
board it again

   there is only one chance in ten that
we can get to our berths without being
seen but we must take it keep close to
me and let me do all the talking

   weve got to make another jump
from the train while its movin asked
the irishman dubiously

   yes and prav heaven that it may
be the last erskine answered sifllenly

   there aint no use in prayin sir
growled mcgrane  for after we jumped
at two rivers i prayed that never again
might we take another header such as
that and that there prayer was scarce-
ly dry on my lips when we went a kitin
and a sommersettin from the hand-car
 youd better take one of these suit-
cases said erskine half reluctantly
 keep a tight grip on it and dont let
go when you strike the ground this
time i am going to let you jump first
when you find your feet come after me
as soon as you can there will be no
time for me to go back to look for you
all right sir the irishman assent-
ed  then after a pause he added
 youve changed your mind i guess
about miss warrington chargin us with
murder and havin the train searched for
us

   well have to take our chances bar-
ney since the train was not searched at
two rivers there seems to be ground
for the hope that it may not be searched
here

  rising from the platform on which he
had been crouching erskine descended
the steps on the right and grasping the
hand-rail leaned outward each mo-
ment found the train proceeding more
slowly and as fred looked forward
along the line he saw at last the lights
of the station which the train was ap-
proaching


the railroad mans magazine

   all ready barney he said quietly
and as lie spoke he moved back to give
place to his companion the irishman
stepped down

   dont jump until i give the word
directed erskine

  slower and slower moved the train
but it was not until it was within a
couple of hundred yards of the station
that erskine bade his companion take the
leap

  this time the irishman had no diffi-
culty in keeping his feet as they struck
the ground erskine followed prompt-
ly and in a moment mcgrane caught up
with him

  fred quickly led the way from the
track to the shadow of a warehouse and
screened by this he continued on in the
direction taken by the train the two
men had advanced only a few paces how-
ever avhen erskine saw something that
brought his heart to his throat

  the cascade limited was stopping at
the station knowing that this train was
not scheduled to stop at tyrcone there
was only one inference to be drawn from
the fact that it had stopped there to-
night the hold-up of the train was to
be reported to the proper authorities

  as a result of the brief stop at the
scene of the hold-up due to erskines
prompt action in getting the train into
motion no opportunity had been afford-
ed the men in the express-car to get into
communication with the conductor or the
engine-crew had the train continued
on its way such communication could
not have been had until weatherbee was
reached

  this would have given erskine ample
time to carry out the plan he had formu-
lated and so to the unfortunate young
man it seemed clear that a sense of duty
had triumphed over his fathers affec-
tions after all

  only for a moment did frederick er-
skine hesitate however  then turning to
mcgrane he urged him to greater haste

  the cascade flier had stopped between
the waiting west coast express and the
station platform and it was the space
between the two trains that erskine now
was heading toward the car from
which he and his companion had leaped
at two rivers was the second from the
rear of the train

  scarcely more than a minute sufficed
to enable the two men to get between
the trains as erskine had expected the
doors of the vestibuled platforms were
open and he and mcgrane quickly
mounted the steps of the car which they
had left at two rivers erskine who
led the way had advanced only a little
distance into the car however when he
drew back suddenly

  between the two long rows of green
curtains which screened the sleeping oc-
cupants of the berths from the aisle of
the car he saw the white-clad figure of
the negro porter had he and mcgrane
not been carrying suit-cases he would
not have hesitated for a moment when
he and his companion had left the train
at two rivers it had been impossible
of course for him to close behind him
the door through which they had leaped
from the vestibuled platform

  it was scarcely probable that this open
door had escaped the notice ofsome mem-
ber of the train-crew before tyrcone was
reached but it was most likely that the
person who had found it open had
ascribed the fact to some act of careless-
ness on the part of one of the trainmen
the return of two men with suit-cases
taken in connection with the report of
the hold-up of the cascade flier which
even now must be spreading in and
around the station most naturally would
be regarded with suspicion

  having retreated beyond the porters
view erskine was trying to formulate
some excuse for his presence with the
suit-case in that part of the car when he
suddenly realized that he was standing in
front of the door of the stateroom in
which he had interviewed miss warring-
ton miss warington had left the train
at bernardville and had not returned
to it

  it was most probable therefore that
the stateroom which had been vacated by
her and her mother was still unoccupied
trying the door he found that it was
unlocked in another moment he had
pushed it open

   quick barney-here   he directed

  as soon as his companion was in er-
skine closed the door the interior of
the stateroom was lighted but unlike the
berths in the other part of the car these
had not been made up for the night
without lights



  erskine looking at mcgrane scowled
slightly as a result of washing on the
locomotive tender the irishman was clean
enough but the sharp run he had taken
to the car in which lie now found him-
self had caused him to lose his breath
and he was panting slightly

  glancing in a mirror erskine sur-
veyed his own reflection critically he
too bore  marks of his recent adven-
ture but unlike the irishman he showed
no effect of his exertions thus far lie
had succeeded rather better than he had
expected it was essential however that
he get to his section with the suit-cases
with the least possible delay and this
must be done in a manner that would en-
able him to elude observation

   brace up barney and get your
wind he said impatiently  you look
as if you had been running a marathon
mcgrane was about to reply when
something struck the door and imme-
diately afterward the two men heard the
sound of voices

   sit down commanded erskine in a
low voice and as he spoke he sank into
one of the seats

  the two men were scarcely seated

when the door opened and a negro por-
ter carrying two suit-cases entered the
stateroom the newcomer halted abrupt-
ly and looked at erskine and mcgrane
with an expression of surprise fred
saw that it was not the porter who be-
longed to the car

  this aint yo room is it sah the
negro asked

   no erskine answered promptly
 the two ladies who occupied it got out
at bernardville and as my friend and i
were not quite in shape for sleep we
stepped in here has it been engaged
 yes sah said the porter  the
ladies is back again

  erskine started  the ladies who-
he began but the rest of the sentence
died on his lips

  from behind the negro came the low
cold voice of a- woman

   these men are known to me porter
you may put down the suit-cases and

go-

  the porter placed the suit-cases on the
floor and smilingly pocketed the coin
that was held out to him then he left
the room louise warrington and her
mother entered louise closed the door

 railroads to take up farming

new york centrals demonstration farms to encourage crop raising
-burlington for good wagon roads

the new york central has determined
to run at least three demonstration
farms along its road for the purpose of il-
lustrating the best methods in crop pro-
duction fruit growing etc these farms
will be under the control of experts sup-
plied by the state college of agriculture

   there is nothing philanthropic in this
work says the president of the railway
 it is simply a matter of business  f the
line can show how to increase the produc-
tion of farms along its route by the means

adopted it will thereby increase its own
business and add to its own profits

 in the same way railways are becoming
more interested in good roads as a business
proposition the burlington railroad has
done much for good road building and has
issued a booklet on the subject besides giving
other practical encouragement

  good roads help the railroads help every-
body everv state is awakening to this fact
and an era of good road building has well
started-illinois republican

one good rail isnt the whole railroad experience as an engineer
      doesnt mean you can run the railroad better than the presi-

the flight of the coyote
special

by c e van loan

the true story series whenever railroad men fall to

discussing shotgun runs and long-distance record-breaking specials
the conversation is sure to veer around to the trip of the coyote
special over the line of the santa fe between los angeles and chicago 
miles in forty-four hours and fifty-four minutes that was railroading
where have they beaten it 

   yes scotty was the man who did it have your own opinion about
him but there is one thing which you cannot take away from scotty and
that is the distinction of having bought and paid for the fastest ride over the
rockies and across the plains ever made possible by steam and steel the
coyotes record still stands and it is likely to stand for some time

how the craving for notoriety and love of the unusual of a califor-
nia miner brought about the fastest long-distance run
ever made in the history of railroading

true story number forty-six

one in the west calls  scotty was
a young man who was clever enough
to sell something which he never proved
he had to a lot of eastern millionaires
his appearance as a man of mystery was
an accident

  one night a husky young man in the
outfit of a cow-puncher walked up to a
los angeles cigar clerk and asked for a
fifty-cent cigar

he tendered in payment a one-hundred-
dollar note the clerk said he could not
change it

           alter scott has
             well been called the
             man of mystery and
             a lot of people are
             still puzzling their
             brains about him

  some say that he was hired by the san-
ta fe to advertise the road they say he
was a train-robber they say he was a
counterfeiter and wonderful tales have
been told of his cache of thousand-dollar
notes in a cave in death valley

  as a matter of fact scott whom every
the flight of the coyote special



  well change half of it said the
stranger whereupon he tore the bill in
two left half of it on the show-case and
walked away but he remembered the
number for whatever may have been
the matter with him scott was not crazy

  a reporter happened along saw the
torn bill and not being able to find scott
and talk with him- went away and wrote
him up as the man of mystery

  scotty believing everything he saw in
the papers at once made up his mind that
there must be something mysterious about
himself and thereafter he did his best
to live up to the part there is your ex-
planation of walter scott in a nutshell
as for his amazing supply of money he
got it in the most prosaic manner in the
world-in the form of drafts upon new
york banking institutions and the men
who sent him the drafts were convinced
that he had a mine

  in the first place scotty liked noto-
riety  that is he liked it before he got too
much of it in the second place he had
something to-sell it may have been a
mine and it may have been conversation
about a mine  at any rate it was for sale
and eastern men bought it

  the coyote special grew out of two
things-scotts love for notoriety and his
desire to convince people that he had a
good thing as a matter of fact
he had two good things but it
would be unkind to print their
names they furnished the
money and it bought them-
selves an interest in a gold-mine

  they were buying an interest
in themselves but they did not
know that until afterward it is
the general opinion out west
that if a man is smart enough to
sell a gold brick to an eastern
millionaire he is entitled to the
proceeds

  now about that train after
theincident of the torn one-hun-
dred-dollar-bill-and that trick
belonged to the justly celebrated
steve brodie who also went
back after the pieces-scotty
began to appear next to live
reading matter in the public
prints when he could not
think of anything else to do
he hired a special train from

barstow to los angeles-a matter of
one hundred and forty-one miles over the
cajon pass and through the garden-
spot of southern california

  scotty broke the record with a whoop
and a hurrah and he liked the sensation
so well that inside of ten days he slipped
quietly out to barstow and  received a
telegram from there saying that the man
of mystery was in the office at that point
arranging for a second special train i
wired him that he was crazy he wired
back

                                                       i

    pay no attention  im coming in to
  arrange for a special train from los
  angeles to chicago to lower the record
  made by the peacock special

  that was news scotty came rolling
in from barstow stripped to the waist
and working  the engine with finley
the crack driver of the division with
his usual blast of trumpets he announced
that he was going over to chicago in for-
ty-five hours

he tore the
bill in two


the railroad mans magazine

  the santa fe was annoyed the rec-
ord of the peacock special which had
made the fastest time over the road east
bound was fifty-seven hours and fifty-six
minutes and that was railroading to any
man who knows what the santa fe grades
are like in california arizona new mex-
ico and colorado

  for a few days scotty talked and the
santa fe figured every little while
scotty would  spur the ole santa fay in
the shoulder as he called it and eastern
newspapers began to wake up and send
in queries asking when the train was to
start

  on saturday july   scotty
walked into thg office of john j byrne
general passenger-agent of the santa fe
in los angeles and laid down a roll of
thousand-dollar bills

  ive come to buy speed said he
 whatll you take to do forty-five
hours 

  that was the beginning of a two-hour
confab byrne had an idea what the
road could do for the wires had been
humming for four days every division
superintendent along the entire route had
made a report byrne had the figures
under his hand it was his opinion that
to attempt anything like a forty-five-hour
schedule would be suicide

   i think i am safe in saying that we
will better fifty hours for you said he
 that would lower the record by almost
eight hours for the east-bound run

  no wouldnt do wouldnt do at
all scotty wanted speed as for that
peacock special he knew all about her
and byrnes eyes opened wide when
scotty began to tell about the number of
times she had been put in the hole for
hand-cars as scotty expressed it

   i know what this road can do if i get
the engines i want said the man of mys-
tery  and i want the right of way
over every train on the road with the
switches spiked half an hour in front of
me

   see here said byrne  how do you
come to know so much about prairie
types balance compounds and grades
and things 

    i ought to know a little said scott
 i beat my way over your old road about
thirty times i know every foot of it

  in the end passenger-agent byrne

  agreed to arrange a forty-six-hour sched-
ule for the two thousand two hundred and
sixty-five miles giving the special the
right of way over everything on wheels
including the palatial limited the pride
of the road

  as soon as the money was paid over
byrne sent out a flood of telegrams all
right get ready they said that hap-
pened late on saturday afternoon at
noon the next day the coyote backed
into the yard ready to start at one oclock

  there were four passengers--walter
scott his wife frank holman a friend
of mine who went along for the fun of
the trip and the writer

  when the minute-hand of the clock
crept to the top of the dial conductor
gerge simpson gave engineer john fin-
ley the finger old  coughed once slid
rapidly over the clattering switches and
the great run for the record was on

  from the first minute of the trip we
began fighting that forty-six hour sched-
ule finley had been allowed three hours
and twenty minutes in which to make
barstow - one hundred and forty-one
miles away over the steep cajon pass-
the record time for the run at san ber-
nardino sixty miles out we wrere to pick
up a second engine for the climb up grade
drop her by a flying-switch and go on
down the other side to the mojave desert

   all that it needed to get finleys fight-
ing-blood into action was a four-minute
stop on account of a hot tank-box after
that he knocked out miles under forty-five
seconds and came booming into san ber-
nardino foiir minutes ahead of the sched-
ule

  leaving san bernardino with an extra
engine the coyote tackled the first of the
five mountain ranges and conductor
simpson who had been in charge of the
peacock special and the lowe special
which established the west-bound record
kept his watch in his hand and one eye
on the mile-posts

  the run to the summit was made in
faster time than it had ever been made
before the second engine jumped ahead
took a flying-switch and was in the clear
as the short train came pounding by top-
ping the crest of the first range of hills

  the track twisting down to the desert
was a dangerous place on which to at-
tempt speed  but finley knew every inch
the flight of the coyote special	

we give the ole girl fits on that grade 

of it and he let the coyote out to the
danger-limit his best mile was done
in thirty-nine seconds flat from summit
to helen thirty-five miles on a bad grade
his time was thirty-three minutes with
old  screeching like a lunatic the
special whirled around the long curve in-
to barstow twenty-five minutes ahead of
the forty-six hour schedule

  scotty rode the engine from summit
to barstow and he came back into the
pullman spattered from head to foot with
grease and oil

   we give the ole girl fits on that
grade was his comment

  barstow was scottys stamping-ground
-the point at which he outfitted for his
many trips out into the death valley
country the desert rats had their own
opinion of scotty and his mine  but they
were all on hand to give him a cheer and
 sic him  onto the record

  those fellows knew scotty when he
ate his meals at a fifteen-cent lunch-coun-
ter and while they had an opinion that
they had entertained the king of the bunco
men they were not too proud to wish him
well

  then engineer gallegher took com-
mand for the run over the mojave desert
the thermometer in the car registered
one hundred and twenty degrees and the
silver-gray dust of the desert following
the train like a cloud sifted in at every
crack mrs scott retired to the drawing-
room as the motion of the train made her
ill

  with our coats and vests laid aside the
rest of us haunted the water-cooler and
i remember that gallegher took the horse-
shoe curve outside of bagdad at such a
terrific clip that it knocked us all out of
our seats	

  at  that evening we went through
fenner at better than a mile a minute
and on the switch was the east-bound
overland which had left los angeles at
 that morning with her start of five
and a half hours we had run her down
in five hours and thirty-eight minutes
averaging twice her speed by schedule
we were due in needles at  galle-
gher brought us in at  and grieved
because he had not done better

  needles made a record for a short
stop gallegher took  away and


the railroad mans magazine

jo-the new engine with a wild man
named jackson at the throttle-had the
coyote moving again in exactly sixty sec-
onds ly a stop-watch trainmaster mills
had rehearsed the whole program

 this fellow jackson said the new
conductor  came down and just natural-

ninety miles an hour they were shaking
hands and holding her old nozzle wide
open me for them  

  in the dark the coyote took to the
mountains on the arizona side of the line
at seligman four hundred and sixty
miles out wre picked up mountain time

we were trying to eat a salad when jackson hit tub abrupt curve on

the california side



ly bullied em into letting him haul this
train drives her like there wasnt a
curve on the line hey

  jackson did we were trying to eat a
salad when jackson hit the abrupt curve
on the california side of the colorado
river my salad landed in my lap and
the table was swept clean glasses were
smashed plates flew about the floor and
the two waiters turned from black to
gray hung on with both hands scotty
liked that

   do you know what finley and his
fireman were doing when they were com-
ing down the cajon this afternoon at

and the watches reported us eleven min-
utes ahead of the schedule

  everybody knew that it was on the
mountain divisions that the fight must be
won or lost on the santa fe  race-
track  east of la junta the balance com-
pounds were waiting and as scotty told
byrne  you aint got a man on your road
knows how fast them balance compounds
can go

  if the mountain divisions could de-
liver the goods and snake the coyote into
ia junta within the forty-six-hour sched-
ule the balance compounds across kansas
could be depended on for the rest
the flight of the coyote special



  between sunset and sunrise the coyote
streaked across arizona a night of fight-
ing against heavy grades the small ari-
-zona towns flickered by the windows of
the pullman like a hatful of sparks
tossed out into a gale and division su-
perintendent gibson held his watch in his
hand most of the night

  gibson is a great railroad man  noth-
ing surprises him nothing gets a rise
out of him when he hoisted himself
aboard the train at williams lie did not
congratulate anybody or make any talk
about what his division was going to do

  what delayed you was all he
asked and he put that question to men
who had been knocking the spots out of
the best running time ever made on a
mountain division

  i did not sleep any the first night
scotty being built of whalebone and in-
dia-rubber went to his berth and snored
holman prowled up and down between
the diner and the pullman not being
able to make up his mind which would
be the best place on the train in case of
a smash

  geyer the german chef who deserves
a medal prepared a midnight lunch for
holman and while we were eating the
train came to a stop at some unknown
place in the hills out in the dark high-
pitched and clear like the bark of a
coyote came a voice

   ohee scotty 

  the man of mystery was snoring in the
pullman and did not respond

   oh scotty come outen that and
show yourself 

  no answer

   you aint all swelled up because you
got money are you  i knowed you
when you was poor come out and say
howdy 

  silence from the train

   hey there im thirsty i am  i
aint got no fool pride like some people
id take a drink with a hawss-thief i
would ha-a-a-ay scotty 

  then the train began to move and
the unseen serenader gave vent to his
feelings with some of the most remark-
able profanity a man ever shuddered to
hear

   i guess that must have been bill
said scott the next morning  friend
of mine

  superintendent gibson had given his
word to knock half an hour off the best
time ever made over his division the
lowe special holding the record his
men made us a present of an additional
four minutes for we were in albu-
querque at  monday morning s
miles from los angeles we made our
longest stop at a station in albuquerque
where they restocked the diner and picked
up a new outfit which included train-
master jim kurn a fine specimen of a
mountain railroad man

   its a lot easier to be on a plains
division said kurn  but i like this
mountain country even if we do have to
put in twenty-two hours a day fighting
these grades well show you some regu-
lar railroading when we get down on the
glorieta

  railroad men the country over know
about the glorieta pass ed sears is the
name of the engineer who took us from
lamy to las vegas up one side of the
glorieta and down the other and a three
per cent grade on both sides there wjis
some repairing being done on the far side
of the glorieta and sears had two slow
orders to four miles an hour he rolled
them up into a little ball and dropped
them out of the cab-window

   if they pick us up in the ditch said
sears  never let it be said that they
found any slow orders  us were
off 

  sears jerked the coyote up apache
canon at forty-five miles an hour we
had a passenger on this part of the run
-a young man whose uncle was one of
the high officials of the road when the
coyote crossed the top of the ridge and
started down the other side sears showed
us the railroading that j im kurn had
been talking about kurn was out to
make up the time which arizona had lost
and send us out of the mountains with a
chance to beat forty-six hours into chi-
cago

  down the eastern slope of the glorieta
pass the road is one long succession of
compound curves laid out on the side of
a mountain strewn with immense boul-
ders the first time that ed sears
slammed into a compound curve the
wheels on one side of the pullman lift-
ed about two inches from the track and
came down again with a bang that made


the railroad mans magazine

the dust spurt out of the cracks in the
woodwork of the car 

  that was the program all the way-
down the side of the mountain i looked
at jim kurn he was doubled up in a
ball with his watch in his hand i ven-
tured to ask him what would happen if
the train should leave the track on one
of those dangerous curves

   the only question remarked kurn
 would be the size of the splinters
dont talk about it

  the pullman leaped and swayed from
side to side as it righted itself around
the curves scotty tried to walk down
the aisle and his shoulder went through
one of the windows our passenger did
not seem to be enjoying himself and-
i speak for myself-there was one man
aboard who was trainsick

  there was a piece of track on the side
of that mountain where it seemed that we
were running over choppy water that
was one of the places where the track
was being repaired one of the four-
mile-an-hour  slow orders ed sears
ran over at a mile a minute

  this is what you call fancy railroad-
ing remarked kurn when the engine
whistled for las vegas  they laid me
out a tough schedule but weve gained
eight minutes on her and youve had the
fastest ride down the glorieta that any

people ever had that came
out alive

  as we pulled into las
  vegas the passenger came
  over to say good-by

    i want to get over into
   kansas in a hurry said
   tie and im no quitter
   but ive had all this sort
   of thing that i want id
   rather ride on a slow
   freight than on this train
   send me the newspaper
   clippings will you  

  the porter on the pull-
  man also announced him-
  self after that glorieta joy-
  ride

   ridiculous plum ri-
  diculous   he said

  from las vegas to ra-
ton over the mountains
and then a tremendous
sprint from la junta and
the beginning of the  race-track  and
the balance compounds hud gardner
brought us into la junta exactly even
with the revised schedule to do it he
gave her nine notches and threw away the
lever

  engineer dave lesher took the co-
yote out of la junta and his actual run-
ning time for the first  miles was 
minutes it is  miles from la junta
to dodge city and it was done in 
minutes including three stops caused by
a hot box on the diner

   scotty worried about that hot box and
because of it elected to ride in the diner
with a bucket of cracked ice always with-
in reach once when the coyote was
forced to stop scotty was packing chunks
of ice into that hot box before the wheels
were through turning

  somewhere between newton and kan-
sas city after midnight i was in the
diner trying to find something to eat
one of the crew of the special a train-
master i think dropped in after a sand-
wich like most of the men east of la
junta he had never heard of walter
scott and had not the faintest idea as
to why the run was being made he had
heard in a hazy way that the man who
bought the train was a mining million-
aire

  at the same time scott came in from
the flight of the coyote special



the-engine stripped to his shirt and trou-
sers and sat down

   well said the trainmaster  what
kind of dash-blank fool is it thats hiring
this train whats his idea

  scotty winked i said that so far as
i could judge the idea was to get to
chicago as soon as possible

   man must be crazy said the train-
master  raving crazy nobody but a
fool would want to run this fasts aint
that so and he appealed to scotty
himself

   dont put it up to me mister said
scotty you see i happen to be that
darn fool youve been talking about
the trainmaster was still qualifying
his remark the last we saw of him

  at  in the morning we pulled into
kansas- city stopped just long enough
to make a flying change of engines and
we were off again with daylight we
figured that we had a chance to reach

chicago in forty-five hours the orig-
inal schedule had been smashed to bits
after leaving la junta

  at fort madison with  miles still
to go we were turned oyer to a big quiet
german named losee the engineer whom
the officials of the road had selected to
set the high-speed mark for the trip lie
had one mile in thirty-nine seconds to
beat and that mile was made by the first
engineer in charge of the train john
finley

  scott asked losee what he thought he
could make the distance in and losee
shook his head

   wait  he said  ill tell you when
we get to chicago

  between the two little stations of
cameron and surrey in illinois there is
a slight down-grade the distance is
two and eight-tenths miles it was here
that losee was to let her out and see
what a balance compound could do

 i happen to be that darn fool youve been
talking about


the railroad mans magazine

there were three split-second watches on
the train brought along for the purpose
of timing that dash between cameron
and surrey losee made the two and
eight-tenths miles in  flat or a trifle
better than  miles an hour trouble
with his engine laid him out for ten min-
utes but he did the  miles in 
minutes including three stops

  the coyote dusty and smelling to
heaven of scorched waste limped into the
polk street station in chicago at 
on tuesday morning thirteen hours and
twelve minutes ahead of the best time
ever made by an east-bound special and
seven hours and fifty-five minutes ahead

of the time of the lowe special west
bound she had bettered fifty miles an
hour between the points and a thousand
miles of the distance had been a tremen-
dous battle with mountain grades

  the thing which pleased scotty the
most was that he had beaten forty-five
hours a thing which general passenger-
agent byrne had said was impossible
here is the telegram he sent byrne re-
minding him of that circumstance

    forty-four fifty-four i guess im
  crazy 

  the man who beats it will have to be
crazy

a tell-tale that is popular

a tell-tale is not always a desira-
ble article of furniture to have
about but it is a thing that the new york
central finds absolutely necessary in order
to cope with certain conditions however
as the tell-tale is stationary and is sup-
ported on three legs not being therefore
of the uncomfortable human variety the em-
ployees of the road do not at all object to its
presence in fact it is a great help to them

this tell-tale is a spotter in more ways
than one and wherever it places its spot

and leaves it mark the tale it tells is taken
notice of with a degree of respect that could
never be given to a human spotter no mat-
ter how truthful he might by accident
happen to be

  this spotter is placed in the freight-yards
of the new york central in new york
city and also at the other end of the elec-
tric division the freight-yards are run
by the faithful old stand-by steam locomo-
tives and therefore there is no third rail
when the cars leave the yards they have of
course to run over tracks equipped with
third rail

  the third rail is fourteen inches higher
than the track and the purpose of the tell-
tale is to detect any object on the freight-
cars extended in such a manner as tofoul
the third rail-for instance a broken jour-
nal box or some other faulty part

  as will be seen by a glance at the ac-
companying diagram the device consists of a
skeleton frame carrying a pivoted marker
the while ends of the device constitute the
marker

  this marker is loaded thickly with white
lead and any obstruction which would run
amuck the third rail strikes the painted
board and swings it around until it rings a
bell in a switchmans shanty close by at the
same time receiving the mark of the paint
the switchman immediately locates the car
more easily notifies the yardmaster and the
car is cut out for repair or adjustment
whichever it may require

  the box-like arrangements at the top and
the foot of the frame carry the batteries
which are connected to the switchmans
bell by the wires that are also visible in the
drawing the new york new haven and
hartford has these detectors placed on its
line just before it joins the third-rail sys-
tem of the central the new havens elec-
trical system being overhead trolley

in the april issue of the railroad mans magazine as no  of these
old-timer tales we published the story of the wonderful record of
the  of the new york central lines in her day-some seventeen
years ago-the most remarkable of all locomotives she had a sister the 
built to resemble her so closely that every tiny bolt was an exact duplication

     it was hoped that the  would not only equal but actually eclipse the
wonderful record that her sister held for speed and regularity of performance
she was even constructed with more care in order to gain such an end but
alas only evil came her way hers was the direct antithesis of the story of
the illustrious -the story of a giant mechanism that went down to a
terrible doom

     many of our readers asked us to print this story of the  after the
story of the  had appeared we immediately assigned mr dosch to the
task of preparing it it is a pleasure indeed to serve our readers in this way

a locomotive built to make a startling record only to become the
victim of an unbroken series of mishaps and disasters
that finally sent her to her doom

learned is that a shifting-engine in the
albany yards bears the number  the
tragedy that made  into a shifting-en-
gine is forgotten

  it is the fate of sisters whether they
are ships or locomotives that one makes
a big name and becomes a household
word while the other remains in ob-
scurity  but few have been thrust into
ignominy by so cruel a misfortune as 

an unkind fate

  she had as engineer old nathan hager
who believed in her and he used to say
that she would equal or even break her
sisters record if she only had a chance
both were built to haul the empire state
express and both developed high speed

       ngine  on the new york
            central made the fastest
            mile ever run as railroad
            men all know but who
            ever heard of her sister
             the  

  built along identical lines every-detail
the same one flashed into the lime-light
to remain there for years while the other
-her spirit broken her speed gone-has
been condemned to a mediocre existence
by a fate that is almost human in its
pathos

  the story is only known among a few
railroad men on the albany division of
the new york central in the big of-
fices of the company in new york there
is a record of it buried among files that
are never opened but all that is to be


the railroad mans magazine

that  was sent to the columbian ex-
position and shown to be the fastest en-
gine in the world instead of  nathan
hager always laid to luck

  in fact he used to boast that he had
come pretty near to breaking the record
of  with the whole of the empire
state express behind him and tried to
do it nearly every night going east over
the level stretch of track between syracuse
and utica

  it was undoubtedly the greatest joy in
his life to see her limber up and begin to
burn the rails until the passengers rocked
in their berths

  but the evil genius that sometimes at-
tends mechanical sisters was with her and
she could not leave it behind even at six-
ty-seventy-seventy-five miles an hour
it was indeed while going at this ter-
rific pace that fate got between the rails
and sent  smashing into oblivion

  her body lives on the neat lines are
gone the graceful poise is lacking what
is left of her is pensioned oil as a shifter
but her soul left her that night on no-
vember   when four young idiots
who wanted to be desperadoes removed
the fish-plates and opened the rails before
her two miles west of rome new york

her breastplate preserved

  after the wreck a doctor from rome
who had attended the injured found her
breastplate torn from her body lying in
the mud picking it up he threw it into
the back of the buggy and carried it
back to rome where he made a present
of it to thomas li barry the chief of
police

  barry hung it on the wall and there
it has remained ever since marked on the
outer circle  schenectady locomotive
works  and in the center in large
figures  

  she bears another breastplate now but
the spirit of the old engine that was as
good as her sister  remains in the
police station at rome with the old breast-
plate

  when i went to rome to get the story
of  the first thing i saw when i
stepped into the police station in search
of information was the breastplate of 
looking down on me from the wall it
was like the face of some live thing-it

represented so much strength and power
that was gone-and now that i know the
story it seems to me as if the spirit had
actually been in that mask and had come
to life to tell its own tragic history

the spirit of 

  sitting there beside acting chief keat-
ing who had had an active part in the
most momentous occasion in the life of
 i looked up at the breastplate and
said

   you were an engine and all but hu-
man once i wish you could speak

and as well as a spirit can it replied

   it was just before dawn it began
 and it seemed as if nathan hager and

i	were the only live things in all that
stretch of waste country lying to the west
of rome

   didnt know nathan hager he
was a grand old man and my friend he
used to pat me and tell me that i was
as good a girl as my sister and some day
he would show them what i could do
for forty years ever since s he had
been in the service and i was given him
as a reward for a long record without
serious accident

  he had a father who was ninety years
old and a mother eighty-three who lived
at little falls to the east of utica every
night as we rushed through i used to
give a little low whistle for him so that
they would know it was we

   being old people who did not sleep
soundly they would hear it and drop off
again conscious that we were all right

   years and years before my time he
had been signaling them  and it came
to be as much a pleasure to me as to him
neither of us ever forgot 

   on that account hager always liked
to pass little falls on time if we were
a little late we tried to pick it up before
we reached there that night we were
fifteen minutes to the bad and as soon
as we cleared syracuse hager began to
open up

   we liked it both of us and that
night i was feeling good

   as we flew down the clean line of
the rails  lost all sense of time and
space if there was one piece of track
on which we felt safe just then it was
in the waste west of rome
cjuiihn

the evil genius of the 	

    two weeks before in the morning a
fish-plate had been found ton off and
some tools lying near made it look as if
some one had been trying to throw the
rails

    so a guard had been placed to patrol
the track only the night before we had
passed several track-walkers and we did
not know that they had just been taken off

            the wreck
                    i

   but guard or no guard we had an
eye out for the spot where the fish-plate
had been torn loose although we did not
let up on the speed all at once we could
see that the gleam along the tops of the
rails was broken two hundred yards
ahead

    two hundred yards  at the speed we
were going what could we do to save our-
selves in that little spac

   hager threw on the reverse and i
never worked so hard in my life as i
did in the next few seconds trying tolet
down on the speed

   it was all off with us we had no
chance and we knew it but we hoped
to save the twelve mail-clerks and the
passengers asleep in our cars it was a ter-
rible moment the steam rushed to my
throat and throttled me and my wheels
pounded up and down on the rails until
i rocked like a mad engine

   but i could not get down my speed
maybe it was fifty miles an hour maybe
it wasnt all  know is that i struck the
ties ten feet ahead of where i left the
rails and tore the track to - pieces for a
hundred yards before i jumped the em-
bankment and landed on my back in the
swamp

  just as i turned my light hashed
across the waste and showed four boys
legging it for all they were worth the
hat of one blew off but he did not stop
to pick it up hager saw them too but
the next instant he was deep in the mud
with all my weight on top

a crippled giant

   the recording ticker that reported the
rome patrolmen on their beats clicked
for a moment at my elbow and then the
spirit went on

    i didnt really know what speed was

	rr	n



                                           -

until then when i went into the ditch

i picked my tender off the track as if
it were a rock in a sling and threw it
over my head so hard that it buried it-
self in the mud

    when it left the rails it jerked the
 first of the mail-cars over us and threw
 it seventy-five feet beyond

    a deadhead robert bond of syra-
cuse was on the forward end of that
car and with the car literally flying he
had a ride in the last few seconds of his
life that beat anything that was ever
made on a railroad

    the mail-clerks were all in the sec-
 ond car and they were hurled to the rear
 end -like so many potatoes and well it
 was for them this car struck the first
 car and crumpled half its length but the
 mail-clerks lay unconscious in the un-
 harmed end

    the sleepers were so far behind that
 they had been jerked almost to a stand-
 still before they left the track all but
 one landed in the swamp

    quivering and stunned i lay in the
 ditch i was clear of the tracks and the
 wrecking crew did not bother with me
 then the breastplate was brought here
 and i clung toit for  knew the engine
 was dead

the desperadoes

   as the spirit paused i turned to keat-
 ing and he pointed over his head to a
 photograph of four boys subscribed with
 the names herbert plato fred bristol
 theodore hibbard and j watson hild-
 reth

   the first three he told me were na-
 tives off rome and the fourth the lead-
 ing spirit the wayward son of a new
 york lawyer

   the history of the crime is curious
particularly as several other gangs of
boys scattered through half a dozen
states tried to duplicate it within the
next few months it made a big stir at
the time

   hildreth was sixteen and brimful of
outlawry he had read about robber
chiefs and he wanted to be one after
being expetted from several schools he
had chosen rome as a seat for his
operations and had obtained an allowance
from his father on the pretense of at-


the railroad mans magazine

tending an agricultural college that had
no existence in fact with his allowance
he was able to organize a gang and sup-
ply it with ready money which he dealt
out in a grandiose manner he was the
boy leader of rome and the other three
numbered his lieutenants

  they drank and smoked and played
cards until late at night and in general
regarded themselves as hard characters
but card-playing palled and hildreth
had to offer his gang something more
thrilling so he suggested holding up
the express

  at once it appealed to their imagin-
ations as a desperately evil undertaking
so they pocketed their revolvers which
hildreth had bought for them and went
out early one morning to try it

  it was below their dignity to walk so
they hired a carriage and driver from
the brother of the chief of police and
drove a mile out of town there they
paid the driver grandly and started off
through the waste afoot

  this was the night they could not get
the fish-plates loose so they had to wait
until the guards had been removed but
at the first opportunity they were at it
again this time they thought it bet-
ter to go afoot and worked for an hour
between three and four in the morning
before they had set the death-trap

traced by a hat

  when they heard the express they
drew their revolvers once more and plato
fastened about his arm a hammer he had
brought along to knock out the brains of
the survivors with but when they saw

grade crossings

while invariably avoiding grade cross-
ings on new and revised construc-
tion work the pennsylvania railroad has
in the last ten years been eliminating all
crossings at grade as rapidly as practicable

  a compilation for the period since jan-
uary i iqoo shows that  grade crossings
have been removed  the lines of the sys-
tem east of pittsburgh and erie these
figures are of record of september  
and do not include the ten crossings to be
eliminated by the change of line to be made
through bristol pennsylvania  the new

 the wreck and understood what it meant
 for a train to be derailed at fifty miles
 an hour they turned and fled hildreth
 lost his hat and although it had his
 name printed on the inside he did not
 stop for it then vaguely however he
 realized that it would implicate him if
 found

   but he showed what a boy he was in
 rome there lives a newspaper corre-
 spondent dick howland who is known
 the country round and the moment any-
 thing happens some one always runs to
 tell him about it first on this morning
 he was still asleep when he heard a
 breathless voice calling under his win-
 dow looking out in the half light he
 could see the flushed face of hildreth

    w say dick he called out  theres a
 big wreck i thought id let you know

    with face still flushed the boy then
 went to thfe house of a girl he was in love
 with to get a cap she was up and cook-
 ing hot-cakes for breakfast

   he was hungry and those hot cakes
 smelled good to him so he stopped and
 ate his fill although by this time he
 realized that the hat was a dangerous
 piece of evidence when he finally re-
 turned to the wreck his hat had been
 found

    in the end all confessed bristol died
 before trial and the other three were sen-
 tenced to life imprisonment plato died
 there two years later and the other two
 were pardoned in  meanwhile the
 girl who cooked the fatal pan-cakes had
 had her faith so completely shattered by
 hildreths actions that she went into a
 decline and did not live through his
 term in prison

by henry h tinkham

            a case of the turning of the worm with
            some results that surprised the worm

 lattery slowly backed the
  wheezing old    down
  from the roundhouse and pre-
  pared to couple to his train

    as his ndme indicates slat-
tery was irish hp was still
on the near side of forty but
seemed to lack that strain of combative-
ness and initiative that is inbred in al-
most every individual of predominant
celtic blood he had always preferred
unobtrusively to slip along the pathway
of least resistance

  so it was while slattery was held on
 backwoods  and  brush  runs many
of his juniors in the service and his in-

feriors at the throttle graduated from his
class and gained their reward in the
proud possession of the fast spider-dri-
vered main-line engines for on the
stone island seniority did not rule

  for weeks something within him had
been worrying slattery he ceased to
view things with the same complacent at-
titude of philosophical satisfaction per-
haps it was his celtic blood at last assert-
ing itself he seemed awakening to a
belated realization that while others
forged ahead he had been hopelessly at
a standstill

  pride which had heretofore been an
unknown quantity in slatterys make-up

good dont say that word to me

i aint good for nuthin


the railroad mans magazine

was coming into its own he boiled in-
wardly as his quickened imagination pic-
tured the sorry figure he must have cut
all these years in the eyes of more favored
fellow workmen for slattery was ma-
king that very human mistake of ascri-
bing his own failures to the partiality of
unappreciative employers he became
ill-tempered critical and dissatisfied

  as he hung listlessly out of the cab-
window waiting for the signal to send
him away upon that despised run over
the gull mountain division he was in a
particularly sour mood in his mind he
ran over the cases of a dozen or more
younger men who had been pushed up
and over him to the choicest of main-line
throttles there was everett for in-
stance

  slattery had scarcely turned his mind
to the young engineer when no  the
main-line flier roared into the train-shed
from the west bringing a vast cloud of
dust and stopping with a businesslike
flourish and a shrieking of air-brakes
at the throttle of the big  one of
the finest machines on the whole road
which pulled the fast train was everett
the object of slatterys present bitterness

  slattery looked over the big pacific
locomotive with an envious eye he
gazed with secret admiration upon her
massive symmetrical lines the almost
human walschaert valve-gear her du-
plex pump the great low-pressure cylin-
der and even the little automatic bell-
ringer perched high upon her enormous
boiler he glanced at her safety-valve
drumming merrily at the apex of the
steam-dome under a pressure that would
have torn the little  to shreds

  everett the proud possessor of this
masterpiece of locomotive art had begun
his railroading under slatterys watchful
eye slattery had taught him all he knew
about locomotives

  slatterys unpleasant frame of mind
was amply reflected in his uninviting
scowl and as everett swung down from
the s lofty gangway with a cheery
greeting he returned an unfriendly
grunt everett looked at him curiously
and hesitated as if to pursue the conver-
sation but noting slatterys forbidding
frown turned away with a shrug and de-
voted himself to oiling

  five minutes later no  pulled out

the  picked up her thirteen pull-
mans as if they were a train of paper
coaches and they whisked past slatterys
little  as one snaps the long lash of
a whip slatterys scowl became even
more threatening

   mooney his conductor came up with
the orders he passed slattery his  flim-
sy and waited for him to look it over
slattery read

   train no  eng  condtr
   mooney engr slattery will stop on
   signal two miles east gulls head
   condtr mooney to transmit explana-
   tory instructions to crew

   mooney grinned appreciatingly as the
engineers frown dissolved and a puzzled
expression shone in his eyes slatterys
astonishment was real he slowly spelled
the order through a second time

    what is it all about he finally in-
quired

    were goin ter be held up ex-
plained mooney his grin broadening

   i know that said slattery shortly
but why

    real hold-up said mooney
   what

    yep continued the conductor en-
joying his engineers wide-eyed amaze-
ment  real goods goin ter flag us
shoot us up blow up the express-car and
go through the passengers and we got-
ter stand fer it thats th orders
slatterys none too patient temper was
gettingjiway from him

    aw cut that kiddin he said

    straight goods returned mooney
 some movin-picture concerns goin
ter take- a train-robbery picture down in
the rock cut  the gulls head hill
they fixed it up with th old man askd
him first if they couldnt pull it off on
no 

     nope mclane told em  i cant
bother no  then they asked about
us

     sure he says  s got all day ter
get inter lake city yer cn hold her up
if yer wanter and with that be wrote
an order to shanahan

    got all day to get there in- eh re-
peated slattery savagely

-	 we dont mount to much round
here mooney wouldnt bother no 
oh  shes too good theres that
the biograph bandits



kid everett why when i took him
off the farm he couldnt tell a draw-head
from a steam-gage taught him all he
knows an now hes so high and mighty
tlie old man wont even bother him but
slattery  slattery spoke his own name
with a world of sarcastic emphasis

  slattery he repeated he dont
mount to nuthin got all day to get
inter lake city hold him up throw
him in the ditch sure hes just plain
no account thats all

  slatterys tone was full of self-pity
but mooney to whom the whole affair
was a welcome diversion in the days
work chuckled at his
discomfort with un-
feigned glee

   whats matter

slat aint yer feel-
in good   he ques-
tioned

   slattery bristled

  good he echoed

 good dont say
that word to me i
aint good for nuthin

  mooney went tack
to his train shaking
his head a minute
later he gave slattery
the signal and no 
pulled out

jumped out per-
haps was more the
word for slattery
turned on the sand
and gave the old 
a wide throttle she
slipped wildly a sec-
ond then her drivers
caught and she nearly
pulled the knuckles off
the automatic couplers

no  left whitely
so precipitously she almost ran away
from the astonished mooney who stood
dreaming on the platform

  out in front slattery was breaking in
a green fireman whom he cursed criti-
cized and bulldozed until the boy was so
nervous he could hardly spread the coal

  the fire got thin a cold draft struck
thfe s scaly old crown-sheet and two
or three of her tubes began leaking

  as she refused to steam freely the en-
gineer continued for some time to vent

his sarcasm upon the inexperienced
youth but finally grew silent and grim-
ly devoted himself to running

  in spite of her leaking boiler-tubes he
drove the old engine with a nicety of cut-
off that conserved her run-down steam
supply  and as the fireman regained his
nerve she was soon
wheeling along close to
fifty miles an hour

mooney behind in the
train glanced appre-
hensively out upon the
hurrying scenery as the
trucks clicked over rail-

a figure waving a red cloth detached itself
from the group

joints at ever-decreasing intervals until
they blended in one wild incessant rattle
of gear the old coaches were jumping
and swaying like ships at sea and pas-
sengers were beginning to look alarmed

  in the cab slattery still running at a
furious pace kept growling to himself
as he repeated over and over mclaues
slighting reference

   hold her up if you want to shes
got all day to get into lake city but
no - slatterys temper blazed he


the railroad mans magazine

cursed anew and gave the creaking
bucking old  another notch of throttle

  no  was the single daily train over
the lake city or gull mountain division
she carried mail and express in a com-
bination baggage-coach from division
headquarters at whitely she followed
the main line twelve miles and then went
off to the north for a three-hour climb
over the sharp grades of gull mountain
to the mining-camp known as lake city

  gulls head mentioned in slatterys
peculiar orders was the junction-point
where no  was destined to leave the
main-line steel and roll out upon the
 gull mountain division

  the place specified in the order di-
recting no  to submit to the indignity
of a pseudo train robbery was a wild
stretch of track where the right-of-way
literally was carved out of solid gran-
ite an ideal stage setting for a hold-up
picture

  slattery had the old  going at a
pace that would have been a credit even
to the  favored  everett and his pet
prairie type passenger racer as she
dipped over the brow of the hill leading
to the rocky cut where the hold-up was
scheduled to take place ten miles of
hill and dale had been covered in ex-
actly ten minutes and no  was three
minutes ahead of time when slattery
noted with a grin the little group of
figures hurrying about far down the
track they evidently were not expect-
ing so early an arrival

  while he reviewed and soliloquized
over the many indignities he fancied had
been heaped upon him a sudden reso-
lution shaped itself in his overwrought
brain  at first it was but a wild vague
idea but in his poignant self-pity it
soon grew into a fixed resolve he de-
termined to demonstrate his independ-
ence to the company and to administer a
suitable rebuke for all the accumulated
wrongs - it had heaped upon a faithful
and devoted servant

  slatterys irish was beginning to be
very much in evidence and his awaken-
ing threatened to be as thorough as it
had been delayed his decision once
made the engineer devoted himself to
the execution of his wild plan in a
manner that would be well in keeping
with his ideas of a just revenge

  with steam pouring from her ill-
packed stuffing boxes her age-loosened
cross-heads and the driving and connect-
ing rod bearings uttering a wild chorus
of metallic remonstrance at the unaccus-
tomed shaking the old  fled down
the grade toward the waiting train-rob-
bers gaining speed with every turn of
her rusty driving-wheels

  as they drew near slattery saw that
an obstruction had been placed across
the rails and soon a figure waving a
red cloth detached itself from the ex-
pectant little group of biograph  ban-
dits  and started along the track toward
the approaching train slattery waited
until he was within three hundred yards
of the flagman before he acknowledged
the signal with a blast of the whistle
he grinned exultantly as the figures on
the track shuffled about in a pantomime
of anxiety it was quite evident that
they feared he was not going to stop

 at the last moment slattery tossed the
lever of the engineers valve into the
emergency notch and every truck buckled
up as the brakes locked tight to make
the stop more effective he threw the old
 into the reverse and turned a hatful
of steam into her cylinders

  she bucked like a yearling coughed
and snorted a few times locked her dri-
vers and settled back into the breeching
like a balky mule

   slattery then saw that the obstruction
consisted of several ties piled loosely
upon the rails and as the train lost head-
way he smiled to himself among the
little party out ahead arranged in ap-
proved bandit formation there was a
dull glitter of blue steel firearms

  when he was yet one hundred feet
away he threw off the air with one hand
and pulled the throttle wide with the
other he sent the sand streaming un-
der the tires of the driving-wheels to
give certain traction and cursing hap-
pily reached for the whistle-cord and
sent up a few wild shrieks of defiance

  on the down grade the old engine
caught the rails and leaped ahead like a
frightened doe there was precipitant
scattering of armed and masked men as
the low-hung pilot of the old  picked
up the ties and tossed them vindictively
hither and thither startled cries arose
from the would-be train-robbers
the biograph bandits



  slattery leaned far out of his window
and cursed them deeply and joyfully
their reply was a fusillade of shots and
involuntarily the engineer ducked low
though he knew the shots were the dis-
charge of blank cartridges somehow he
fancied however that he heard the whis-
tle of lead mooneys shrill summons to
stop was borne to the engineer on the sig-
nal-cord from the coaches that the  was
gaining momentum
with every turn of
her cranks slatterys
grin was wide and
-it was real

   sure they can hold
up no  he gurgled
to himself in high glee

 sure they can-not



  there was a

  precipitant
  scattering of
  armed men as the
  low-hung pilot
  of the old 
  picked up the
  ties

  the anxious fireman stole a wonder-
ing glance at his engineer finally he
leaned over and yelled in slatterys ear
 theyll  can  you sure

  slattery nodded not the least dis-
turbed at the prospect

   maybe they think they can play their
monkey-shines on me he yelled across
to the nervous fireman

 maybe theyll hold up old slattery
everett and his no s too good sure
but slattery-maybe theyll hold him
up yes maybe they will but not to-
day slattery laughed loudly

  the train came into gulls head all

smoking during the last mile
mooney vainly had been striv-
ing to scale the tank in irder
to get over into the cab but
 slattery was going so fast and
the cars were bounding so
high at the rail-joints he
dared not trust himself on the
plunging insecure footing
he had made a dozen futile
attempts to stop the speed-
mad slattery with the con-
ductors brake-valve but it
failed to operate

when they pulled up at the
junction mooney raced ahead and met
slattery as the engineer leisurely swung
down out of the cab the conductor was
apoplectic he choked and sputtered be-
fore lie finally managed to control his
outraged throat

   whats mattr you you blank blank
blankety blanked fool why in hades
didnt ye stop couldnt ye hear me
pullin yer down want me ter break
the darned oord mooneys questions
came so fast slattery couldnt have got-
ten in a reply slattery didnt want to
he enjoyed mooneys paroxysm

  can they hold up no  he


the railroad mans magazine

asked airily looking at the sky the trees
the little station and finally at the angry
conductor

  then he answered himself

   sure they can-not he grinned
broader than ever as mooney exploded
into a torrent of profanity

   no s too good continued slat-
tery  couldnt afford to bother no
 oh  everett might lose some
nickel off the  but no -huh

 shes got all day

   say moon old boy did they hold
us up slattery simply was hysterical
with glee

   did they hold us up yes they did

-not the gleeful engineer repeated
again and again

  the gulls head station-agent com-
ing down the platform interrupted slat-
terys boisterous merriment

   come into the office he said ad-
dressing the engineer  old man wants
to talk with you

handling  trains a day

by t s dayton

railroad man and weather prophet-thats the artistic combination
that is the make-up of a signal-man who handles the coney island
crowds if a storm comes up suddenly the great crowd of pleasure-
seekers make a rush for home and they are shipped there safely at the rate
of  a minute thats going some

     think of moving the entire population of st louis in all directions
some as far as twenty miles in a few hours the men who accomplish this
feat sometimes work so hard during their trick on the hot summer days that
water has to be thrown on them

the gigantic task at culver terminal coney island when over
 people make up their minds to take
a days outing

oping and praying for re-
  lief new york had tossed
  in its sleep and cursed at
  its work through three
  days of almost intolerable
  heat saturdays weather
  forecast promised no relief

  by three oclock that afternoon there
were more people at coney island than
there are in pittsburgh by six oclock
the number of pleasure-seekers was great-
er than the population of st louis over
seven hundred and fifty thousand people
swarmed the streets and beaches but
the daily miracle of summer railroading
was not half done

  at four oclock the boss of the  peak 
trick climbed the stairs of the switch-
tower at the culver terminal through
this railway station three-fourths of the
visitors to coney island pass this
train-despatcher or signal - man-un-
known to the general public and unno-
ticed by them-controls the lives and
safetv of more than a thousand people

each minute of the eight hours he is on
duty

  during his trick comes what the elec-
tricians call the  peak of the load
people get tired or a storm comes up
and every one tries to get home at once

  with a nod of greeting to the man he
was to relieve the  peak  boss took off
his coat and collar and rolled up his shirt-
sleeves he glanced at the brazen sky
and at the thermometer in the tower
then for a moment he studied the trains
and trolleys on the tracks below  at his
gesture that he was ready the man who
had been on duty since eight that morn-
ing gave place to him and the monoto-
nous calling out of track numbers to the
men at the switch-levers in the tower
went on without interruption   six elev-
en four five twelve

  as each number was called a switch
was set and a car or train moved in or
out the lever-men were stripped down
to sleeveless undershirts and trousers
like the gun-crew of a man-of-war in ac-

tion they worked swiftly but with the
unhurried haste of machines

  an extra waiting to relieve any one
who might drop with the heat dashed
water over their necks and shoulders from
time to tune or gave them drink the
chief signal-man kept his eyes on the
tracks the cars and the crowds with the
intense concentration of a cornered chess-
player

  a thousand people a minute were com-
ing in the cars were going out half
empty two hours went by the crowd
was still coming but a few cautious ones
were beginning to start for home so as
to avoid the avalanche of humanity that
would pack the cars later

the rush for home

  suddenly above the mighty roar of
carousel music the strident cries of the
barkers the tooting of motor-horns and
the endless shuffle of innumerable feet
came a distant rumble across the water
from the southwest it was so faint that
the men in the signal-tower glanced at
each other questioningly five minutes
later there was an unmistakable crash of
thunder

  an instant more and the black-cloud
curtain that had risen from the sea ob-
scured the sun and before all but the
most nimble were under cover the rain
came down in sheets

  almost before the first crash of thun-
der had died away the signal-man had
called up the general office in brooklyn
and had given this brief message

   bad storm coming rush cars cul-
ver terminal

  no one knows how many people piled
into the elevated and trolley-cars during
the next two hours the storm lasted
perhaps twenty minutes but the skies
were threatening for an hour afterward
the rush for home continued fiercely un-
til past eight oclock

  trolley-cars and trains went out in a
continuous string every one packed to
the platforms in those two hours more
than two hundred thousand people-
tired perspiring cross-pushed through
the gates dashed down the loading plat-
forms and hurled themselves aboard the
cars the very momentum of their on-
set packed them closer together inside

  while nearly two thousand people a
minute were being hurried homeward the
despatcher and the lever-men were work-
ing under a terrific strain as the signal-
man rapidly called out number after
number the men at the switch-leyers
sprang back and forth

  three dropped in their tracks during
those two hours but others were waiting
to relieve them and the work did not
slacken for an instant between eight
and nine oclock there was a lull and the
despatcher ate a sandwich he could not
have told you what he was eating his
eyes never left the cars and the crowds
waiting to fill them

  by ten oclock the multitude began
gathering again but it was not as densely
packed or as fiercely obsessed as the one
that had stormed the cars when the tem-
pest broke at midnight when the boss
of the  peak  trick went off duty the
rush had slackened noticeably

  people would keep on going home un-
til dawn then a fresh army would
commence hurrying to coney island once
more the despatchers changed places
with barely a word of greeting and the
work went on through the summer night

  the man who had been handling near-
ly two thousand people a minute for two
hours and without a single accident was
weary the strain and the heat had been
awful he climbed laggingly aboard a
waiting train and dropped into a seat a
talkative passenger w-as loudly berating
the railroad for its general inefficiency in
handling crowds

  the despatcher asked the guard to
wake him at his station and fell asleep
almost before the train started he was
not aware that he had done anything re-
markable that afternoon and evening
he only knew that it had been up to him
to make good on an unusually tough job
and that he had not fallen down it wras
all in the days work anyhow

a usy trick

  under ordinary circumstances the
despatcher in the tower at the culver
terminal handles more people a minute
during rush-hours than any other signal-
man in the world when d crisis arises
his achievements are among the most mar-
velous things in railroading
handling  trains a day



  no one can tell much in advance when
an emergency like this is likely to arise
but these sudden summer tempests are
looked for three or four times every sea-
son to make the most trouble they
have to come aboijit six in the afternoon
after a sizzling libi saturday or sunday

  every day the coney island railroad
people-and everybody else that lias any-
thing to do with that great resort-read
the days weather forecast the most
that can bedone to provide a little
against being swamped by the hundreds
of thousands of people who want to get
home at once is to fill the storage-tracks
with  storm-traihs as they are called
but this supply is quickly exhausted and
the only thing to do then is to keep the
traffic moving as fast as safety will per-
mit

run forty-five seconds apart

  there are four other trolley and ele-
vated terminals at coney island but the
culver gets three times as many people-
coming andgoing-as all the rest com-
bined because it is located the nearest to
the biggest of the most spectacular
amusement enterprises of that great re-
sort

  there are three sets of tracks - one
trolley and two elevated sections-all on
the same ground level each section has
but a single track in and a single track
out on the elevated sections six-car
trains each holding one thousand two
hundred passengers when packed are
sent out forty-five seconds apart-some-
times even a little closer when the emer-
gency is great on the trolley tracks the
cars are sent whizzing away at the rate of
one every ten seconds

  to some casual visitors to coney is-
land it seems that the crowd stays late 
to others that it goes home early both
of these impressions are correct all the
people who visit coney island do not
come from new york and brooklyn and-
the near-by suburbs there are tens of
thousands of excursionists every satur-
day and sunday from as far away as al-
bany and philadelphia-from every-
where in fact within a radius of one
hundred and fifty or two hundred miles

  several times a season excursions from
such distant points as buffalo unload a

few extra thousands on the island as
a rule these excursionists all have to
start on their homeward journey about
half past four oclock in the afternoon
and they do it with a rush

  there are also a few tens of thousands
of cautious people who decide to go home
at the same time in order to escape the
crowd the trains coming down to the
island are still comfortably filled at that
hour with people intending to spend the
evening there so the human income and
outgo about balance each other

  the tide neither rises nor falls per-
ceptibly about nine in the evening the
avalanche begins to gather force for its
homeward movement from that time
on until midnight even when there has
been no storm to set things askew the
despatcher in the tower and the superin-
tendents on the ground have no rest

  the despatcher at the culver terminal
on whom so much depends has an army
of between eight and ten thousand men
subject to his orders with the exception
of one surface line all the trolley-cars
and elevated railroads in brooklyn are
controlled and operated by the brooklyn
rapid transit company whose train
employees number about sixteen thousand
men

  when the weather indications point to
a clear day on saturday or sunday every
wheel and every man possible is diverted
ft the coney island traffic the result
is that nearly ten thousand trainmen run
to the culver terminal and there become
directly subject to the orders of the
despatcher in the tower by the sea

he rules the roost

  the trains and trolleys that center
there start from a score of different points
in brooklyn the majority of them
leave from the new york end of brook-
lyn bridge but there are many that get
their loads from the ferries that ply
across the east river and from the sub-
way stations in brooklyn

  the despatcher is directly subordinate
to the superintendents of elevated and
trolley traffic but these never interfere
with his work so long as everything runs
smoothly these superintendents are to
be found rushing about the tracks giving
directions to the men in charge of the


the railroad mans magazine

loading platforms and trying to be im-
mediately on the spot whenever bedlam
breaks loose-as it frequently does in such
vast tired crowds

  they may get excited and hurried in
their work but the man in the tower
must always be calm and cool and never
lose his head he must have a complete
grasp of the situation no matter what
happens his one thought is the hun-
dred thousand people an hour whose lives
he holds in his hands and how to keep
the loaded trains moving out swiftly and
as close together as safety will permit

  cars and trains are coming in as fast
as others go out he must see that a clear
path is made for each that each gets to
its proper platform and goes out again
with the least possible delay an in-
stants hesitation a single error in judg-
ment would mix things up in the yard
so that it would take half an hour to
straighten out the tangle

  any unusual delay in handling the
jostling excitable peevish crowd would
almost bring on a riot  yet so expert
are all these men who handle the des-
patchers trick one after another through
the day and night that there is rarely any
halt in the steady stream of trains rush-
ing in and out

  these despatchers work eight hours
each the one who goes on duty at four
in the afternoon and works until mid
night has the hardest task because he

gets the  peak  of the load of traffic
the lever-men in the tower who throw
the switches which simultaneously set the
block-signals also have an arduous task
they must unerringly follow the orders
of the despatcher every number he
calls out means the pulling immediately
of one of the big levers sometimes two
or three must be set almost simultaneous-
ly to make a clear path for an incoming
or outgoing train the physical tension
on these lever-men is so severe-especial-
ly on hot days-that extras are always
waiting to relieve without a moments de-
lay those who may be overcome by the
exhausting work and the heat

  they nominally work in eight-hour
shifts also but it is arranged so that one
fresh man comes on every hour

  the number of visitors to coney is-
land mounts up higher and higher each
year five years ago half a million peo-
ple in a day was considered the record
last year seven hundred and fifty thou-
sand was high-water mark

  new terminal facilities are being added
continually to keep pace with the ever-
rising flood of traffic but always the un-
erring brain of the calm cool despatcher
in the signal-tower by the sea is the key
to the situation coney island is the most
spectacular summer amusement resort in
the world and the problems of train-
despatching there-like everything else-
are unique and spectacular

pennsy instruction cars

to increase the efficiency of the men
operating its trains the pennsylvania
railroad has adopted the use of signal in-
struction cars on all of its divisions the
divisions on the main line between philadel-
phia and pittsburgh have just been equipped

  the company realizes that safety of
operation depends upon its employees hav-
ing a thorough knowledge of all signals and
i has decided that personal instructions
shall be given frequently to enginemen fire-
men conductors and trainmen which will
include not only block and interlocking sig-
nals but all other signals used in the move-
ment of trains

  the pennsylvanias new signal instruction
cars are sixty feet long divided into two
tompartments one room will be used for
examinations while the other will contain

a table upon which is to be placed under a
glass cover a large track-chart of the rail-
road which can be rolled back and forth by
means of rollers placed at each end

  this chart shows air main running tracks
switches cross-overs all signals track
troughs stations and mile-posts the men
will be given an opportunity to study this
chart prior to passing an examination on it
each car is provided with a set of model
signals which can be manipulated so as to
show the signal indications the men receive
out on the road

  the cars are in charge of examiners who
will have charge of all examinations with
the exception of those on machinery and
air-brakes the cars may also be used for
examination of employees on other subjects
than signals-such as train rules

synopsis of previous chapters

pierre a young french-canadian with indian blood in his veins while hunting and
trapping in the canadian woods rescues anne marie a young indian girl and her
old father whose canoe has been upset and demolished by a moose father and daughter
are badly injured pierre takes them to his tent but the old indian is so seriously hurt that
he dies and pierre is left with the girl tin his hands a half-breed and an indian appearat
the camp this half-breed simon who was the husband of anne maries sister but who
through his brutality has killed his wife is in love with the girl and tries to make pierre
give her up this pierre refuses to do and the girl and he scheme to escape in the canoe
it seems impossible and finally anne marie whose injuries are very painful endeavors to
make simon swear on the grave of her father that he will protect her and take her to the
home of her cousin antoine simon promises but refuses to swear he insults pierre
and a fight ensues in which pierre succeeds in felling the half-breed and with the help of
the girl binds him anne marie after damaging simons canoe in such a way that it will
take some hours to mend helps pierre and the indian to pack their canoe and she and
pierre start up the river leaving the indian to return and release simon simon and the
indian follow as quickly as possible but again pierre conquers the half-breed in a des-
perate hand-to-hand fight and he and his companion are made to take a solemn oath to cease
the chase anne marie develops a high fever which promises to delay the two in camp for
some time an inventory of supplies shows pierre that they have enough to last them
for about four weeks

chapter vii
the form by the fire

n the small hours of the night
pierre finally obtained some
sound sleep that lasted un-
til daylight the rain had
stopped and the weather
was cold with a keen frosty
bite some water that he had left out-
side the tent in one of his cooking-
pots was filmed over with ice a brisk
wind was blowing and the tinted leaves
were flying over the river and floating
down upon the dark water high over-
head from time to time triangular
flights of ducks were making their way to
the southward

  anne marie seemed to be suffering de-
cidedly less but her breathing was still
much oppressed she smiled when pierre
who felt more cheerful assured her that

she was ever so much better and would
soon be able to travel

  his confidence was not assumed for
the brighter weather had dispelled the
blues from which he had suffered the
day before he went about his prepara-
tions for breakfast with a vim whistling
and singing and occasionally interrupted
his work to throw a stick for paddy to
fetch

  he boiled some pike and decided to
catch more if they would only bite there
was a rocky place at the head of the little
bay where it might be possible to get some
dore and there he placed several set lines
baited with pieces of pike

  anne marie consented to drink some tea
and eat a bit of bread which she soaked
in it she was still very weak but the
fever was nearly gone yet whenever she
moved her respiration became very fast
and she was always glad to lie down again
and keep still

  the dog in his foraging about the
camp raised a hare of which pierre
caught a glimpse before paddy had fruit-
lessly chased and lost him in an adjoining
swamp

  rabbits were not to be despised and
pierre took a roll of copper wire that was
fastened to the small bundle of traps and
made some snares if he could catch a
few they would make a welcome diversion
in their diet

  the skins would also prove useful if
they were detained long for they were
ill-provided with clothing for a winter
journey

  the fish heads he had thrown away the
day before had disappeared from the
bank and tiny tracks revealed the identi-
ty of the thieves he could probably
have caught one or two mink with dead-
falls but he decided it wasnot worth
while

  he went off with his snares and
placed them in the little paths that ran
through the raspberry - bushes and low
shrubs near the shore when he was
through with this he went to inspect his
set lines and was glad to pull out a couple
of fat wall-eyes with gold-edged scales
the other baits had been stolen possibly
by chubs

  thus the morning passed away and the
constantly recurring subject of food came
up for it was nearly midday after
lunch he idled away some time speaking
to the girl now and then receiving nods
for answers as a rule and attending to
her wants assiduously

  it seemed strange that he could do so
little for her and that she never seemed
to want anything unless he suggested it
he had opened the tent-flaps widely so
that she might look out and as he moved
about her eyes followed him for she did
not understand him yet

  why did he take so much trouble about
her he had given up his voyage and
now was quietly biding his time waiting
for her to get well if he had ordered
her to get in the canoe and had paddled
off she would have thought it perfectly
natural

  she would have followed somehow
over the portages wounded things had to
drag themselves to places of safety or die
and she would have done likewise so long
as the breath of life clung to her body

  but this man said that she was not well
enough-that it would make her suffer-
and brought her food and covered her
at night with blankets these things
he did without appearing to think about
them and this day he whistled and sang
as if there were no hard riddles in the
world for men to solve

  when he started across the river to
troll for pike she followed him with her
eyes so long as she could and was glad to
see him again whenever he passed in her
line of vision on his way up and down the
shore

  on his return with several fish she was
happy and it seemed strange to her to
feel so pleased at a mans home-coming
to her that sort of thing had so often
meant the disgruntled return of the un-
successful hunter or the arrival of a fam-
ished one with skins to prepare with
clothing and moccasins to mend for
whom food had to-be made ready who
first partook of it and of the best thereof
often leaving scant pickings for the wom-
en and xhildren

  it was good to see them when they
brought plenty of food and pelts and it
was evil when they were empty-handed
but there was no deep pleasure in it no
expectation nothing that could be trans-
lated into a desire for a mere presence

  now that she felt that sensation she
did not understand it and accepted it as
one of the phases of an existence in which
the unexpected ever occurs she had seen
women that had borne children and had
noted how nearly at once the instinct had
awakened by which the mother and child
became inseparable things

  all these things were not clearly de-
fined in her mind there had merely
awakened in her a sense of possession such
as the child feels for its doll for even in-
dian girl baliies have dolls and play with
them and in them as in others the in-
stinct of motherliness develops even be-
fore the capacity for love this girl
knew that one should be grateful for
kindness and her sentiment appeared to
her as a manifestation of gratitude she
had so much to be thankful for that it
did not surprise her that this feeling
should take a new form

  when pierre returned she was very
glad though she scarcely showed it like
all indians she was afraid of being
a heart of the north



laughed at and possessed a sentiment of
dignity that could only melt away after
longer acquaintance

  her face was therefore nearly always
impassive when he spoke to her

  he had several fish and showed her
one that weighed probably ten pounds

   it isnt so bad he said l but im
disappointed either there are not many
of them or they are not biting well

   plenty pike she answered  but on
the first of cold weather fish often bite
badly

  he went off again to investigate his
set lines but found only a small dorc and
a big chub which he kept for bait after
cleaning his fish he went back to the
tent intending to cut some more fire-
wood the ax was very dull and he be-
gan to sharpen it with a small file

   he was seated near the girl in the wide-
ly opened tent and suddenly she grasped
his arm and he saw that she was pointing
at the opposite shore perhaps half a mile
up looking keenly he finally caught
sight of a large grayish animal showing
very indistinctly in the bushes among
which it stood the two watched it for
some time until it moved back into the
woods and disappeared

    caribou wasnt it 

   yes ateck answered the girl  big
doe

   pierre took the gun out of its cover and
felt in his pockets to see if he had a few
cartridges to spare

    im going to look he said

  she watched him go off pnce more
he left the dog with her for paddy was
of doubtful utility as a hunter of big
game the canoe went straight to the
other shore then gently up stream the
girl saw pierre land near the place where
they had seen the animal he pulled the
canoe up and bent down looking for
tracks and then waved his hand at her
and disappeared in the woods

  it was then within an hour and a half
of sundown and she settled down to wait
patiently the time seemed long as the
sun kept on going lower and lower and
she began to wonder that he did not re-
turn

  then faintly a long way off to the
east apparently among the distant hills
beyond the river she heard the booming
of a shot and then of a second one they

were very faint for the smokeless powder
made but little noise in fact an ear
less well trained than hers would scarcely
have noticed it

  then came upon her a feeling of some
anxiety for he must be very far away
and the sun had set he was only a mon-
sieur and he might get lost in the woods
coming home it would be dark before he
could get back

  it was a constant subject of laughter
among the guides both indians and hab-
itants this amazing ignorance of the peo-
ple they took with them to fish and hunt
some could not see a plain bear-track
before them and others could not fol-
low a blazed trail without getting lost
while there were hardly any who could
light a fire in the woods if there was the
slightest bit of rain or wind

  they were strange people with much
money most of whom could not speak
french and who went into raptures over
a ouananiche such as the boys at pointe
bleue sometimes caught with a hand-
line in the early spring

  but this man was not so stupid as all
that-he knew something of the woods
perhaps if he were lost he would climb a
tree to make out his bearings she ought
to make a big fire so that he might see
it from a high tree or from the top of one
of the hills

  painfully she dragged herself out of
the tent she had not realized how weak
she was every effort cost her pain and
every breath she took stabbed her wounded
side yet she gritted her teeth and went
on her hands and knees to the place where
the embers were still smoldering

  there was a good deal of wood ready-
cut and she gathered the burning ends
and fanned them with a piece of birch-
bark little by little she added other
bits and splinters and got a flame upon
which she placed the cut logs until she
had a great bright fire

  but she realized that all she had would
not last more than half an hour at this
rate and took the ax which pierre had
left behind and dragged herself to where
he had felled some dead trees

  here she had to rest for a long time
before getting up on her feet she gave
a few good blows and the chips flew in a
workmanlike manner but presently she
felt faint the ax dropped out of her

hands a dimness came over her eyes the
world went around and around and she
fell unconscious upon the mossy soil of
the forest

  paddy came to her and sniffed at her
put his paw upon her and whined a few
times then he sat by her and waited
patiently but as she did not move he
repeated these maneuvers and as they
proved unsuccessful uttered a long dis-
mal howl

  in the meanwhile pierre had followed
the tracks of a cow caribou the animal
was evidently making its way quietly to-
ward the east in wet and mossy places
there was the quadruple mark of each
hoof that he knew so well

  it was already getting late and he won-
dered whether he would be able to reach
her before sundown it was worth trying
however

  as venison it was really better than
moose and the back fat was desirable as
his supply of pork and butter for frying
was pretty low at any rate he would
follow on a little farther cautiously and
would then go back to camp and return
the following morning and make a day
of it

  in many of the wet places he noticed
that the water had not yet filled the
tracks she was probably quite near by
morning she might have traveled very
far in some mossy places she had
stopped for a moment to crop the lichens

   suddenly from a distance to his right
he heard the call of a stag and so near
to him as to startle him came the hinds
answer there was a little clump of
alders close to a brook about sixty yards
away and from this emerged the cow
sniffing in the direction of the stags call
something frightened her or she deci-
ded to make a dash toward the stag for
she started with a great leap

  at this moment the rifle rang out-
and she fell but she was up again in
an instant and pierre shot once more as
she disappeared among the trees

  pierre then realized that the night was
falling and that he had hardly been
able to see his sights still it was cer-
tain that the first shot had hit her hard
probably somewhere about the right fore-
shoulder the second was very doubtful

  it was getting dark so fast that he
could hardly follow her track but just

as he began to despair of finding her
he saw his quarry lying upon one side-
quite dead

  hastily he bled it and gralloched it
and removed a hind leg to take baqk with
him but all this took some time how-
ever much he hurried he took birch-
bark and split some sticks in which he in-
serted pieces of the bark and planted
them around the carcass

  he also placed a handkerchief over
the animal and fastened it with a stone
to scare away the wild prowlers and then
began to consider the problem before
him

  the weather was good enough and he
might have lighted a fire and remained
there until morning but he was rather
anxious about the girl the idea sud-
denly arose in his mind that while he
had left her the carcajou breaking his
oath might have come down and cap-
tured her

  the notion of such a possibility made
inaction intolerable he had taken the
gun she was left with no defense but
even if this had not happened sick peo-
ple were never so well in the evening
she needed food a fire tea perhaps
medicine	v

  of course she would not worry about
him she was an indian and accustomed
to waiting but after all it would not
be right to leave her there all night with
no care

  the great river was directly west of
him and he could certainly fetch it with
his compass though it would be a tough
job through the tangled woods and
swamps

  the caribou had led him through a
hard country yet she had unerringly
found good going but now it was out of
the question to follow the back track in
the dark

  he started hurriedly but in a short
time could no longer see his compass af-
ter a while he lit a match and looked at
it he had only about a dozen with him
they would not last very long if he
looked at his compass often and he must
keep a few to light a fire with in case
he could not get out of the woods that
night

  he walked on more slowly bending
every effort to keep his direction he
could not see the north star for the sky
a heart of the north



was cloudy and after an interval he de-
cided to light another match

  before doing this however he made
a torch of birch-bark and lighted it it
burned some time during which he made
progress

  he stopped often to consult the com-
pass but he soon got up to his knees in
swamps and had to push through im-
penetrable thickets of alders and vines

  i-iis torch went out but he had seen
just before the tops of a high clump of
trees in the direction he wanted to fol-
low they were limned very black
against the fainter darkness and for
some time he managed to keep them in
sight

  several times he fell and once sank
up to his shoulders in the black ooze of
the swamp but succeeded in pulling him-
self out the chill of the night struck
him and his teeth began to chatter

  finally a small crescent of light ap-
peared in a rift of the clouds and he
decided to climb a tree to see if he could
get a glimpse of the river a tall spruce
was ascended with much difficulty and
once at the top he could see nothing but
as he rested for a moment before begin-
ning his downward journey he discerned
probably less than a mile away a small
flickering light he kept on peering in
that direction and the light shone
steadily

   it must be the camp he spid to
himself

  the moon was showing more brightly
it would soon be quite high and it would
help him to continue in the right direc-
tion

  coming down from the tree he picked
up the gun and the meat and soon found
somewhat better going lighting an-
other torch he found that he still had
five matches the air was still and cold
and he shivered as he went on once he
stopped thinking that he had heard a
strange sound but decided that it must
have been the hooting of an owl

  by this time lie must be getting pret-
ty near the river and new courage came
to him falling over dead trees and
stumbling over rocks tearing through
tangles of alders and vines he suddenly
came out upon the shore of the longed-
for river

  he stopped delighted and wondered

    	rr

whether he was above or below the place
where he had left the canoe but on
looking up - stream he saw a flickering
light upon the opposite shore

  he could see his way fairly well now
but stopped suddenly for in the direction
of the light in the still cold air arose
a mournful howl prolonged increasing
in intensity toward the finish

   its paddy  he exclaimed  i hope
there isnt anything wrong

  he stumbled along the shore through
brambles and berry bushes fighting his
way through alder clumps now and then
advancing over loose stones and along
rocky ledges and when he arrived op-
posite the light he gave a long loud call

  but there was no other answer than
another howl this time followed by loud
barking

  he finally reached the canoe and pad-
died back to camp to be met on the shore
by the excited paddy who would not
stop barking and whining

  he hurried to the tent and groped in
the darkness calling anne marie but
she was gone

  paddy acted strangely coming to him
and running off following him pierre
a few yards away nearly stumbled over
the girls body

  he lifted her in his arms and carried
her back to the tent where he lighted the
precious candle

  what is the matter anne marie
he exclaimed

  she was looking at him and smiling
faintly the touch of this strange man
seemed to have brought life back to her
she did not know how long she had lain
senseless

   i went to cut wood for the fire she
said

   that was a stupid thing to do he
answered somewhat angrily  now
youve made yourself worse again

   yes stupid thing she answered
patiently with some sadness in her voice

   i killed the caribou cow he in-
formed her

   ah good

   i had a hard time coming back but
i saw the light

   yes i made a big fire she answered

  and pierres conscience smote him for
at that moment lie realized that she had
suffered much to give him help


the railroad mans magazine

   im sorry i said that just now he
said meekly picking up her hand and
pressing it at the same time

   i am very glad you have returned
safely she answered it is good to
see you

  he went to work to put on dry clo-
thing and to brew some hot tea while the
girl gazed at his face lighted by the fires
glowing a deep contentment in her
heart a feeling of peace and happiness
that was a very new element in her life
made this evening seem a very radiant
one to her

  pierre in some manner that he was
hardly conscious of felt attracted by
this little savage girls evident devotion
it was a pleasant thing her gratitude
and admiration were plain enough taci-
turn and quiet though she might be there
was now often in her eyes a light that
shed a brightness over him that-requited
him for the little he was doing for her
that gave him that wonderful and charm-
ing sensation that one is becoming neces-
sary to some ones comfort and happiness

  it was within his inner self a mere
slight feeling one as yet shapeless and
unformed the realization of which would
have given him great surprise

  he basked in the contentment that was
wholly due to his successful hunt to the
reaching of camp after weary toil to
the hot food before him to the welcome
of the dog and the girl and did not know
that either because pity is akin to love
or merely because her little heart was
going out to him his own was being
drawn toward her as it had long been
drawn toward the glorv of her land and
the beauty of her lakes and mountains
and the freedom of her life

chapter viii
the journey is resumed

ttext morning anne marie was still

   very weak and breathed with dif-
ficulty but the pain had left her side
and she felt pretty well as long as she
remained still

  pierre attended to her needs as usual
and after breakfast for which he fried
a good slice of caribou meat he went to
look at his rabbit snares

he had only caught two a rather

scanty return for his pains he cleaned
them quickly and stretched the skins to
dry then he placed near the girl every-
thing she might need during his absence
and cautioned her to remain quiet

  taking his tump-line and rifle he said
that he was going back to get the rest
of the meat

  anne marie assented in silence and
getting in the canoe he paddled over the
river to the place whence he had started
on his hunt

  as often happened to him in the
woods he began to think of the contrast
there was between the life of the wilder-
ness and that which pulsates in great
cities

  on their outskirts there always seemed
to be a kind of leprosy tumble-down
shanties anemic vegetation sordid ways
of making a living all showing like an
exfoliation due to decay within going
into the huddle of people one found
poverty crime disease and greater than
all these hunger in places adjoining
plenty of food cold where fuel was
abundant tears next to laughter

  out here a hungry indian would
nearly starve before disturbing a cache
he was as well provided as any that had
food for they would share with him

  out here the filth of the civilized
world was far away the air had been
unbreathed of man the water unpolluted
the land free the fuel belonged to all
the fishes and the beasts to whoever could
capture them

  what did it matter that it was a land
of cold and hunger it was also a land
of freedom full of riches for generations
to come and the people that dwelt in it
were strong and self-reliant they could
have laughter and good appetite and
sound sleep they could live long they
could have affections they might know
love

  his thoughts went back to the camp
where he had left ou-memeou had he
been unrestrained by his ties to another
world who knows but that he would
have sought her for a mate she was
very beautiful but he thought most ot-
her courage of the wild spirits she
showed of her instinctive modestv of
the deference she paid him as a superior
being

  yet was she inferior what leaven
a heart of the north



was there in him that had raised him
above her it was but a matter of ab-
surd conventionality and this was but a
fetter a thong that bound him his right
to his own life

  aye ou-memeou could be a fitting
mate to a real man a mother of strong
children

  but he shook off these thoughts smi-
ling vaguely at himself and began to
pay attention to the job before him

  he had to proceed slowly following
his own tracks and those of fhe caribou
but there were many places where nei-
ther seemed very distinct and he had
to look very carefully

  finally he reached the spot and near
it observed some bear tracks the ani-
mal had not touched the carcass how-
ever evidently fearing the indications
of mans presence pierre had left be-
hind him

  pierre went to work to cut up the
venison he took the other hind leg af-
ter divesting it of the bone and all the
meat from the saddle and a good deal
from the foreshoulders with some fat j
the liver and the tongue he wrapped it
all up in the hide tied it up into a
pack and slung it over his forehead

  it was a big load but he returned
quickly having blazed some of the trees
he deposited it in the canoe and cov-
ered it thickly with boughs against the
attacks of meat flies another trip
yielded about half a load more it was
noon before he was through and he was
greatly pleased with himself

  he sat smoking his pipe while rest-
ing a moment pie became conscious
that paddy on the other bank had de-
tected his presence and was barking at
him running up and down the shore

  a good shove sent the canoe into the
stream and it seemed to him as if his
arms had grown stronger as he wielded
the paddle as if his stature had in-
creased as if there was something in him
that made him a bit more of a man

  he landed petted the dog spoke
cheerily to the girl and took a huge de-
light in cooking a good lunch he boiled
the caribou tongue and insisted upon the
girl eating it it was a tidbit just the
thing for an invalid

  she looked surprised and refused it at
first but as he insisted she complied with

his wishes he was incomprehensible it
was not the indian way for a man to
give the best pieces to the women

  he ate a mighty lunch and paddy
fed so well that he slept all the remainder
of the afternoon during which his mas-
ter worked away at his meat cutting it
into strips and smoking it puffing away
at his pipe in the meanwhile in great con-
tentment he had hunted made a good
shot worked hard and he was busy all
this was enough to make a man mightily
happy

   we wont go hungry now anne
marie he said  even if we are kept
here some time but well be able to
start soon and i suppose in the end well
throw a lot of the stuff away

  she nodded with a smile and somehow
he caught himself wishing that she were
not so silent he would have enjoyed
jests and an animated talk but then he
realized that she was ill that she be-
longed to a race that is taciturn before
strangers that she was a wild thing that
was not yet tamed and he felt a desire
to talk to her to teach her something-
he knew not what-in order to attune her
to his own feelings

  on the next day during a period of
idleness he wondered why the girl con-
tinued to breathe so fast while apparently
seeming to have no pain and it was only
then-that he remembered that people with
pleurisy sometimes got a lot of fluid in
their chests and that it interfered with
respiration at times and that it often
had to be taken out

  when this idea came in his head he
began to feel much concern why had
he studied medicine such a short time
only in a few moments he had thought
over the matter carefully and recollected
that the chest full of water would sound
differently when struck with the fingers
than a healthy lung it is just like a
difference between hitting a full or an
empty barrel

   look here anne marie he said  i
want to examine your chest to see how you
are getting on

  she instinctively drew the blanket
more closely around her and he felt pro-
voked

   dont be a fool girl he said

  his tone was not as gruff as his words
though and as he drew the blanket down


the railroad mans magazine

she closed her lips tightly and allowed
him to have his way

  she was still wearing his spare coat
and this he removed as gently as possible
and divesting her of a few more things
partly bared her chest he felt some
surprise when he noticed how white the
skin was compared with her face and
hands he had not paid attention to it
before

  the few adhesive straps he had placed
on her chest were rather wrinkled up and
loose and appeared capable of doing
little good so he pulled them off

  she first time he tapped with his
fingers she gave evidence of pain and he
chided himself for a fool he ought to
have known better than to do that just
over the place where the ribs were
broken a little farther back however
his striking produced a dull sound at
a corresponding place on-the other side
of the chest the result he obtained was
entirely different

   thats it he decided here was
the deuce to pay as far as he knew
those cases perhaps never got well un-
less that fluid was removed and of course
he had nothing to do it with and did not
know very well how it was done but
after all in some instances they must
surely get well without that it could
hardly be necessary in all at least he
hoped it was not

  after he was through he replaced her
clothing and sat there beside her deeply
cogitating until he noticed that her eyes
were persistently fixed upon him ques-
tioningly

  you want to know anne marie
well youll be well soon-then well
start away he declared

  he was assuming a confidence he was
far from possessing but she seemed
pleased

   the poor little thing takes every-
thing i say as gospel truth he com-
mented to himself somehow it made
him feel very kindly toward her he
experienced a sensation somewhat similar
to the one he recollected having felt
when paddy was a pup and had begun
to follow him about in preference to
other men

  he remained seated by her idly cut-
ting up some plug tobacco

   yes its all right anne marie

well soon travel on at first you will
not be able to paddle but after a few
days you can help ill have to work
going over the carries with all that stuff
to pack across but its a good thing to
have plenty

  unconsciously just as he would have
petted the dog he stroked the girls head
but never saw the wonderful light that
began to burn in her great dark eyes

  then he amused himself for some time
by teaching her some english words
she knew a few already and a docile
pupil she repeated various sentences
after him  good morning are you
ongrv i ope you ave slept veil de
dog as e-ten de mit

   no not mit-meat-anne marie
she hung upon his lips so anxious was
she to please and repeated the difficult
word until her teacher expressed himself
as thoroughly satisfied

  this was really quite interesting she
was intelligent it was like teaching
paddy new tricks she was quick to
learn and moreover she did not forget
in the loneliness of the great woods she
was becoming a companion

  she was no longer the poor child he
had merely wished to help because she
was a living suffering thing gradually
she was losing her reticence and from
her he learned the legend of men fishes
that inhabited the great waters and of
whom the last had been shot within the
memory of the older indians it seemed

  she told him why the skulls of animals
were hung upon peeled saplings near the
camping places-to propitiate the spirits
of the trapped fur bearers  and told him
tales of the folk-lore of montagnais and
algonquins he had to stop her because
it seemed to tire her a good deal to talk

   thank you very much anne marie
he said  it is all very interesting and
you must tell me more about these things
another lime when you are stronger
unconsciously again he patted her
hand smiling and rose to make supper
ready he brought her food as usual
and was very attentive to all her needs
and the indian girl having found a new
life was lulled and rocked in it experi-
encing a strange quiet happiness she
could not understand but accepted with
a gratitude ever growing greater and
more intense
a heart of the north



  pierre worked- hard at his caribou
meat there was plenty of time and
he cut his strips very thin and smoked
them with great care they were hang-
ing all about the camp over many sticks
resting in the crotches of upright poles
there was no room in his packs for all
this extra food aiid he made ingenious
bundles with birch-bark

  with these preparations and the fish-
ing which daily grew poorer besides the
capture of occasional rabbits in his
snares which he had set on the other
side of the river in a swampy place where
they were fairly numerous about ten days
went by

  he had scraped the caribou hide care-
fully and rubbed it with brains and wood
ashes hoping it might be of some service
the weather grew colder day by day
the middle of october was approaching
and on two mornings there had been
sharp frosts

  the deciduous trees were nearly bare
and the winds blew keenly nature
seemed to be preparing for the coming of
an early winter the little stove had been
rigged up within the tent and in the
evening before going to sleep its heat
was grateful in the morning he made
it roar just for the pleasure of it and
did most of his cooking upon it

  annie marie was getting better her
breathing was becoming quite easy and
on sunny days during the afternoon
she sat under a tree where she spent
hours gazing at the placid stretch of
river and following with her eyes the
tall young man who with his pipe ever-
lastingly going was fussing with some of
the preparations for the trip

  one morning as he awoke rather late
he was surprised to find her up she
had lighted the fire in the little stove and
was sitting by it with a wonderfully
coarse needle and some thread she was
mending a hole in one of his heavy
woolen socks

   why anne marie he exclaimed
what are you doing

  she turned to him with a smile

   i could not lie down any more
she replied  i am better now time
to get ready for a start

   but you are not strong enough yet
he objected

  i can sitin the canoe no work

 well travel on easily get that much
 nearer to lake st john

   he reflected for a moment and thought
 that it was a wise idea if she could sit
 in a canoe it would do her no harm at
 any rate they could go on to the head
 of the next portage and camp there if
 she was not strong enough to walk across
 they could stay there for a day or two

    do you think we could start to-
 day he asked eagerly

    yes well make ready now

   with a joyful feeling he went to
 work whistling and singing his energy
 seemed to propagate itself to paddy who
 barked and scampered with delight when
 he saw the tent being pulled down

   everything was ready in less than two
 hours including the time he took to go
 across the river to collect his snares
 which he would not leave behind he
 found four rabbits which he brought
 back in triumph he was really very-
 tired of rabbit but anne marie enjoyed
 them and so did paddy there were
 enough skins to makea rough blanket

   the canoe was rather heavily loaded
 when the time came to start he care-
 fully led anne marie down to the shore
 vshe was very weak and at first it seemed
 as if her legs could only carry her a
 very short way

   she seemed surprised to realize it and
 he assured her that this would soon wear
 away he got her comfortably ensconced
 in the bow of the canoe and with a last
 look at the place they pushed off

  the journey was on again it was a
 fine frosty morning  the air was clear and
 bright and a fair wind blew down the
 river pierre paddled strongly and with
 each sweep of the paddle the little craft
 carried along by the current went a good
 distance

   again they were watching the shores
 that went by and noted the indications
 of life along the river there were ducks
 at times rising before them a long way
 ahead but most of the birds never very
 numerous in that region had already
 departed a couple of loons were swim-
 ming about in one broad lakelike expanse
 of the river and farther on a lone gull
 gave a rasping cry and sailed away from
 the top of a great rock then the river
 narrowed down again and became quite
 rapid


the railroad mans magazine

  you remember this portage asked
anne marie

   i suppose so-why 

   the water is very rapid just before
reaching the landing-place it takes two
to fetch it safely it would be easy to
be carried over the falls there is a
place higher up where they land at high
water we must stop there

  just as you say anne marie

  it was nearly noon when they landed
and pierre helped the girl out of the
canoe she was pleased to find that she
was a little more steady on her feet than
when they had started yet she was very
glad to lie down with her back propped
with the bundle of blankets while pierre
started a fire and began the never-ending
boiling of the kettle

  he made a strong stew of caribou
meat with a little rice with bread and
tea this made a fine meal and anne
marie ate with better appetite than she
had manifested for a long time

   let me see how long is this port-
age he inquired between mouthfuls

  it was ever a surprise to her to find
that he never remembered exactly the
places over which he had already passed
he recognized everything but was always
a bit hazy until he reached them he was
deficient in the training which to her was
second nature and she could hardly un-
derstand that this wonderful man should
lie lacking in any faculty but then he
was something out of the common that
could not be judged by the standards
applicable to her people

   it is not far she replied  few
hundred paces but there is a hard hill
to get down dont try to carry too
much

  but he lit his pipe and in the pride
of his strength piled up packs on his
back until he carried about a hundred
and fifty pounds he followed the path
which generations of indians had worn
over the portage and soon came to a steep
climb that made him stop for a rest

  then again he went on and reached a
place where the way led down a steep
and crumbling side hill covered with
scanty herbage everywhere but in the
path where the bare sand showed he
remembered that he had puffed hard on
his upward journey when coming up
that place

  slowly and carefully he made his way
down the sand was loose and gave an
insecure footing and whenever he slipped
a few inches his pack would thump down
hard and give his neck a wrench he
finally reached the bottom and placed his
load upon a flat rock and rested a moment
before going back two more journeys
consumed nearly an hour leaving nothing
more to carry but the blankets and tent
with the rifle and a small bag of pro-
visions

   what do you think anne marie
do you want to tr-yjt 

  she arose briskly and he took the
remaining bundles placing one arm
around her waist he started slowly they
progressed steadily while they were on
fairly level ground and pierre saw that
it gave her pleasure to feel that she was
getting on so well after reaching the
hill however she began to breathe hard
and soon stopped

  its too much for you is it he
asked

  with scanty breath she replied that
she would be better in a minute and they
sat down for a moment she then rose
again her teeth tightly clenched but
soon her mouth was open wide in an
effort to breathe --
 ill carry you he said

  lie bent down and with his right arm
encircled her knees

   bend down he directed her  and
put your arms around my neck

  he did this so quickly that she had no
time to protest she did as she was bid-
den and he lifted her easily like a child
she clinging with her left arm to his neck

  there were some vines and saplings
along the upward path and with his left
hand he grasped them during his climb
putting down each foot carefully

  before he reached the top he was
blowing hard the last few steps were
tough but he reached the summit and
put her down carefully

   you stay here and rest he told her
 until i bring up the rest of the things
 you are tired she said

   its nothing he replied cheerfully
 i-had a good deal harder time carrying
the canoe

  this was not strictly true but the girl
smiled and he went after the remaining
possessions and was back in a few minutes
a heart of the north



  she asserted her readiness to go on
there was a fairly level place on top of
the hill for about fifty yards and she
made it easily but when they came to the
steep descent pierre felt uncertain

   im afraid icl better not try to carry
you down there he said fearing a slip

  he went before her she leaning upon
his broad shoulders they had to stop
several times once when her feet slipped
in the loose sand an expression of pain
came over her face but he did not see it

  they finally reached the bottom the
girl was looking pale but was elated at
her success

   perhaps we have done enough for to-
day he suggested

   no bad place to camp here she
replied  only five miles to the next
portage

  he looked at his watch it was only
three oclock and the next carry could
easily be made

  is it a good camping place lie
asked

   yes good at both ends

  he loaded the canoe again but in order
to bring the girl down he had to lift her
to the shelf of rock upon which he stood
paddy jumped in and they started

  he turned his head back as the swift
water was carrying them away the better
to see the beautiful falls amid the spray
and spume of which they had started
the brown water roared down full fifty
feet in one grand leap in a furious mass
between jagged rocky cliffs the tops of
which bore a few stunted twisted wild-
looking trees

  the girl could like all her people
appreciate the beauty of nature but be-
fore his worship of it this feeling was
awakened in her to greater depths

   it is beautiful she murmured

  this time he was the one to answer
with a nod for it was too grand for
words but he felt glad that she shared
his admiration

  the falls disappeared behind them as
the river pursued its sinuous course and
pierre who was getting slightly tired
paddled easily there was plenty of
time in which to reach the next portage
and make camp before dark

  anne marie was thinking she had
known an old indian who had traveled

to be c

many hundred miles with his sick wife
to reach a doctor and consult him about
the old woman whom he had carried
over every portage in a rough chair sus-
pended from his tump-line but she was
a cripple and it was the only way

  in her case things were different if
the young man had allowed her to she
would have managed it somehow but
he had not permitted it he had bent
down and lifted her like a child master-
fully in a way that could not be resisted
and it had been a strange and pleasant
sensation

  and now to the child of the forests
the river was beginning to sing a more
beautiful song the spirits of living things
and of dead ones were smiling upon her
the foam and the roar of the great water-
falls spoke with an eloquence she had
never conceived possible she had been
as a child in those strong arms and their
possessor assumed in her eyes some of
the attributes of the great things that
were to be worshiped - the manedo of
her fathers the god of the present
generation

  whenever pierre chanced to look at
her he found that her eyes were fastened
upon him and each time the long lashes
fell and concealed them she had never
before spoken to a monsieur-one of the
breed of strange people who came from
the hotel to visit the reservation at pointe
bleue who looked upon the indians as
curious beings and then disappeared to
make room for others

  they were surely not like this one
who was singing at this very moment
a la claire fontaine with a voice
that was as the music in the church

  there could not be any others like
him they always took guides and she
could not understand why he had gone
into the woods all alone she did not
seek to fathom the mystery of how le
bon dicu had led him in her path when
she was drowning and had kept him
there making her present life so happy
notwithstanding the sorrows that had
gone before

  at times her lips formulated a prayer
that she hoped would reach high up in
the heavens for the welfare of the young
man who was singing blithely as they
approached the portage

        the distance that the brakeman traveled to the rear before he met the rear

        while brakeman traveled distance  x as all speeds are constant we
        have the proportion as follows

             the distance  x  traveled by the brakeman to the rear is to the dis-

to prevent accidents

a railway official has waxed sarcastic
as the result of the restrictions imposed
by municipal ordinances upon railway traffic
in ohio towns and proposes the following
rules

   when a train is approaching a team the
engineer must stop the train and cover the
engine with a tarpaulin painted to correspond
with the scenery

   in case a horse gets scared at an engine
notwithstanding the scenic tarpaulin the
engineer will take the engine apart as rapidly
as possible and conceal the parts  the river
bank

   on approaching a curve where he cannot
command a view of the track ahead the en-
gineer must stop the train blow the whistle

minutes

  in case a train conies up behind a pedes-
 trian he shall affect deafness until the en-
 gineer calls him a hard name

  all members of the police force shall
 give up sunday to chasing trains

 when a train approaches a crossing
where the tracks are dusty the engineer
must slow down to one mile an hour and lay
the dust with a hand-sprinkler-exchange



an old one but still good

a woman on the train entering grand

  here we listen to the hog head the fireman the

our main line has been straightened-
curves have been cut oft and grades
lowered-and we are going to run the august
train on a thirty-miles-an-hour faster sched-
ule perhaps you belong to the old order of
venerable conservative and capable railroad
men who have a well-founded prejudice
against such fast going but we have so much
steam bubbling in our domes and popping
out of our safety-valves in the august num-
ber that we are going to try for a record

  at any rate we have got such a fine batch
of new equipment that we cannot possibly
help breaking every speed record that we
have set up so laboriously in the past four
years

  in the matter of fiction we are running a
regular hummer by our old friend emmet
f harte in which he swings us over the
valhalla division with our old pals honk
and horace with the high-keyed laughter
whistle tied down and shrieking

  robert fulkerson hoffman will be aboard
with one of the most powerfully dramatic
stories he has ever written mr hoffman is
the keenest student of human nature as ex-
hibited in the railroad man that we have ever
known and in this story he brings all his
technical knowledge both of the railroad
and of story writing into play

  another old and tried friend j r staf-
ford will be among this galaxy of star engi-
neers and altogether we expect our fiction to
haul the biggest party of readers that ever
bought a ten-cent ticket  our line

  as a running mate for this crack fiction
flier we have got together a string of the
best special articles we have ever coupled
onto there will be a story of congressmen
who have risen from the ranks of railroad
men that every ambitious railroad man
ought to read for encouragement there will
be the first article of an entirely new series
by walter gardner seaver our old readers
will need no introduction to mr seaver
some time ago he gave s some of the best
yarns of actual railroad life that we could
couple onto he is a railroad man of tremen-
dous experience and the tales he tells bear
all the shopniarks of skilled veteran labor

  another story that we expect to make a

big hit is by arno dosch describing how
a modern locomotive plant is run it would
seem to be an impossible  feat for any
plant to turn out an order of say ninety loco-
motives to be delivered in sixty days espe-
cially when one considers the widely different
specifications to which various roads demand
that their engines be built but this is a feat
which often has to be accomplished-or at
least the equal of it and in this article by mr
dosch you will learn how it is done

  besides these there will be our usual
friends the observant j e smith who will
tell more of the experiences of schwartz in
his efforts to purchase land from the farm-
ers for the right-of-way of his company and
robert h rogers explaining to men who
aspire to the manifold duties of the superin-
tendent of motive power

  we shall also have a story of the pinker-
tons and an incident in the run of the first
black diamond express that will make a mo-
ving picture of speed look like a broken-down
freight-car on the rip track and as usual
there are lots of things that we are not going

master mechanics meet

the annual convention of the american
railway master mechanics associa-
tion will be held june  to  at atlantic
city new jersey in this connection it is
recalled that this influential body is now close
to the half-century mark in a career of use-
fulness practically incalculable starting in
 with six members it has now nearly one
thousand representatives from every railroad
in the united states canada and many for-
eign countries

   it is impossible to review in detail the work
which has been accomplished in the history
of this body unique in its devotion to the
locomotive and its problems alone it has in-
vestigated every conceivable subject con-
nected with its design maintenance and
operation developing criticising and dis-




the railroad mans magazine

citssing it as it progressed from the diminu-
tive sixteen-inch eight-wheel engine of i
to the magnificent articulated compounds of
the present

  that this great development has been
singularly immune from widespread mis-
takes is due largely to these annual conven-
tions and to the personnel of the association
its membership is limited to those who have
attained to the grade of master mechanic-
men logically qualified to discuss the impor-
tant papers which are read during the session
and this free interchange of ideas has re-
sulted in securing the very best in design and
shop practises

  it has effectually safeguarded against the
repetition of costly mistakes and this fea-
ture alone has no doubt saved millions which
would have been fruitlessly expended

  that the value of the conventions is fully
appreciated by railroad management every-
where is evinced by the encouragement which
they extend to their master mechanics to at-
tend them it is a judicious investment be-
cause these master mechanics manage the
largest collection of factories in the world
devoted to one substantially uniform product
-the repairing of locomotives

  although it may challenge belief this par-
ticular item alone costs the railroads over
eighty million dollars every year to keep
this tremendous expenditure down is one of
the great problems which the convention
must solve for the general good

  many of the master mechanics will present
their own views in the discussions while
others will be content to follow without
comment but whether speakers or listeners
they will return home with the renewed
energy and interest in their work which al-
ways results from communication with other
workers in the same field and with their
opinions modified new ideas conceived and
their experience broadened

the steam engine

we have had a great deal to say in re-
cent issues about locomotive practise
as it is commonly known and we will
have a good deal more to say on the subject
in the future in august we will publish
an article  filling large locomotive orders
by arno dosch and in september we will
publish  has the locomotive come to
stay by robert h rogers other pa-
pers of equal importance and interest will
follow

  many of our readers have written us ask-
ing if we have not laid too much stress on the
possibility of the locomotive holding its place
in american railways there seems to be a
general opinion that electricity is destined to
supersede the steam-engine we are sin-
cerely of the belief that it is a long way from
becoming the dominant railroad power and
we cannot be led to believe that it will ever
wholly take the place of the steam engine
any more than the monorail will replace the
double-rail track

  our attention is attracted by an editorial
on this particular subject in a recent issue of
the railway and engineering review we
give it herewith

  not more than five or six years ago the
average layman felt reasonably certain that
continued development of the steam locomo-
tive would be both impracticable and un-
profitable and that electrification as a sub-
stitute motive-power in all classes of service
was imminent

  electrification has been found justifiable
under a considerable number of conditions
but one at least which had come to be re-
garded as its particular field has in a very
great measure been preempted almost before
the electric locomotive was given a trial that
is that branch of the service in which the
mallet compound locomotive is finding its
greatest usefulness

  the opinion is almost universal at the pres-
ent time that present-day terminal and sub-
urban service can be efficient and up-to-date
only as it employs electricity as the propell-
ing agent and this idea at least as it regards
suburban traffic the writer believes is about
on a par with the notion held some few years
ago as above referred to in contemplating

suburban service as it is provided nowadays
with steam locomotives one cannot help be-
ing impressed with the general second-hand-
edness of the equipment that is assigned to
this department of the work

  both cars and engines are too often of a
type that was common in through traffic as
much as twenty or thirty years ago and
where a distinctive type of suburban engine
is used at all it too is one that has long
since become antiquated the ability to stop
and start quickly is one of the most important
features of this service and why we are not
getting the advantage of that feature is very
evident

  as a type the suburban locomotive has
been practically neglected during the past fif-
teen years and that it is subject to improve-
ments that would make it proportionately as
valuable to the service as are other improved
types of locomotives in their respective
classes of work goes without saying

  in england there has been in use for some
time a type of four-cylinder compound
wherein the intercepting valve is controlled
automatically by the movement of the re-
verse lever-this principle should prove valu-
able in providing a three or four cylinder
compound suburban engine with the ability to
accelerate rapidity with the least attention
from the engineer

  with engines embodying this feature and
light-weight cars preferably vestibuled and
without bulkheads similar to those used in
subway and elevated service improved con-
ditions as regards suburban traffic on steam
lines would surely result

new novel by a railroad man

 a powerful story of the struggles of
a man who mistrusts his own courage
is the taming of red butte western
by francis lynde a former railroad
man it tells how a young engineer made
superintendent for that purpose knocked
into shape a disorganized railroad manned
by untrained semi-outlaws

  it is filled with critical yet practical prob-
lems in railroading it tells of the obstacles
that may arise before a superintendent from
the pulls of inefficient men with the direc-
tors and from pressure brought to bear by
strong and unscrupulous mining interests
from the distaste for discipline of a body of
rebellious hands it is full of adventure
it moves forward with the rush and roar of
a fast express

  the author francis lynde is a railroad man
of wide experience in the early eighties
he held a position in the denver office of the
union pacific worked his way up quickly to
the place of head clerk and then became
passenger-agent then for a time he served
in st paul but later moving to st joseph
he became passenger-agent for a missouri
road

  in these years he wrote considerable fic-
tion and gradually gave up his railroad work

 when all at once jim yelled  merciful

 i jumped to his side o the cab an ahead
 bout two hundred paces or so

 stood a gal  the track her hands raised
      aloft

 an her face jist as white as the snow

 it seems she war so paralyzed with fright
 that she couldnt move forard or back
 an when jim pulled the whistle she fainted
 an fell

 right down in a heap on the track

 ill never forgit till the day o my death
 the look that come over jims face

 he throwed the old lever clar back like a
      shot

 sos to slacken the  s  wild pace

 then he let  the air-brakes as quick as a
      flash

 an out through the window he fled

 an skinned long the runnin-board clar out
      in front

 an lay down on the pilot ahead

 then just as we reached whar the poor crea-
      tur lay

 	he grabbed a tight hold of her arm

 an raised her right up sos to throw her one
      side

 out o reach of all danger an harm

 but somehow he slipped an fell in with his
      head

 on the rail as he throwed the young lass

 an the pilot in strikin him ground up his
      face

 in a frightful an horrible mass

 as soon as i stopped i backed up the train
 to the spot whar the poor fellow lay

 an thar set the gal with his head in her lap
 an a wipin the warm blood away

 the tears rolled in torrents right down from
       her eyes

 while she sobbed like her heart war all

 what has become of  mr sweeney of the
 end book 

  but there is no doubt about fort of the

stands and so does the traveling public-
and we are for him

bouquets and kicks

among our bouquets this month we have

-	another kick one of our readers tells
us that there is something that he does not
like about the railroad mans magazine
in spite of the fact that he starts off by say-
ing that he thinks its one of the best maga-
zines published and sad to say although
we would like very much to make things
right in this particular case we are at pres-
ent unable to remedy the difficulty

  this particular kicker says that instead of
pulling out onto the main line once a
month we ought to double up-on our sched-
ule and put on another train honestly
wed like to but the right-of-way is pretty
badly crowded and we cant get orders for a
clear track any oftener to save our lives

  besides were working a pretty full head
of steam as it is and are so busy making up
our electric-lighted solid-vestibuled that if
we tried to get out a special in between we
might lose so much time that the limited
would not get out on time

  however kicks of this sort please us al-
most as much as the bouquets we receive
and were too proud of both to keep them
tucked away in our locker so here are a
few on exhibition to show that weve got
some friends left and that theyre not afraid
to stand up for us

  i have been reading the railroad mans
magazine now for a long time and i think
it is one of the best magazines published
the only feature i dont like about the maga-
zine is that it dont come around soon enough

  it should be published twice a month at
least i especially like the light of the lan-
tern-t j m havre montana

  i am a regular reader of your magazine
and that you may know how much i appre-
ciate it i must tell you that it is a common
occurrence for me to be warned by the engi-
neer that the steam is down when i am read-
ing mv little red-covered railroad mans
magazine if it came out twice a month
i guess he would never have any steam
there is a saving on our road the central
railroad of new jersey that if it is not in
the railroad maxs magazine its no
good-w z b springfield new jersey

  i have been a reader of your magazine for
the last few years and take pleasure in tell-

ing you  admire it whether it runs hot or
not  can hardly wait from one month to
the next for its arrival-j r h altoona
pennsylvania

  t do not know whether you will want a let-
ter from me or not but i think every one
who has read the railroad mans maga-
zine sure has a  put in and should give
the magazine a boost i have been reading it
ever since it has first started and  think that
it is the best magazine on the market the
stories are the best that i have read in any
book-g h m honolulu h t

  i have been a constant reader of the
railroad mans magazine for some time
i can hardly wait till the time comes to get
it i am hard to please in reading matter
but the railroad mans magazine cer-
tainly pleases me i sometimes sit up till the
roosters crow in the morning reading it-
p mcl detroit michigan

  i am not a railroad man but am a watch-
maker and like to see the wheels go round
for the past two years the railroad mans
magazine has helped wonderfully to oil the
bearings of the wheels of time for me i
never miss an issue and have taken quite an
interest in its problems-l c m golden-
dale washington

   take eight magazines besides the rail-
road mans magazine but i find it the best
of them all-c r d alford pennsylvania

  i have been reading the railroad mans
magazine since copy number one and have
not failed to get every copy since it was first
printed i am greatly interested in the stories
and poems-b c m garfield kansas

  	have never seen any letter of praise or a
kick from this part of the world so will
send in my bouquet i have been taking the
railroad mans magazine for over a year
once a person starts to read the magazine it
becomes a habit that one wont quit my
copies are read by three families then if
there is anything left of the book i hand it
over to the telegrapher at reeds spring
give us a few more tragic train orders
some more of horace herrs and emmet
hartes pen pictures and some more slang
stories like  the excitement special the
serials are all good the magazine is an
education to any one who will read its arti-

at the telephone

  courteous and considerate co-operation is
as essential at the telephone as in the office
or home

  in every use of the telephone system three
human factors are brought into action-one at
each end one or both anxious and probably
impatient another at the central office an
expert at least as intelligent and reliable as
the best stenographers or bookkeepers

  for the time being this central office factor
is the personal servant of the other two and

is entitled to the same consideration that is
naturally given to their regular employees

  perfect service depends upon the perfect
co-ordinate action of all three factors-any
one failing the service suffers this should
never be forgotten

  all attempts to entirely eliminate the personal
factor at the central office to make it a machine
have been unsuccessful there are times
when no mechanism however ingenious can
take the place of human intelligence

      the marvelous growth of the belt system has made the use of the
      telephone universal and the misuse a matter of public concern
      discourtesy on the part of telephone users is only possible when
      they fail to realize the efficiency of the service it will cease
      when they talk over the telephone as they would talk face to face
