 you have probably known several
 cases like that  the medical records
 report lots of them and they all lead
 up to this warning

   dont take a cold lightly dont
 neglect it take care of it at once

help nature early

 if you feel a cold coming on or your
 throat feels irritated go to bed keep
 warm drink plenty of water and fruit
 juices eat lightly gargle full strength
 listerine antiseptic every two hours

   all of these simple measures are
 aimed to help nature to abort a cold
 quickly rest and warmth build up
 reserve juices and water aid elimina-
 tion food restores strength and lis-
 terine antiseptic kills millions of germs
 on mouth and throat surfaces    the
 very types of germs that many au-
 thorities claim are the cause of many
 of the distressing aspects of a cold
 tests showed germ reductions on tis-

 sue surfaces ranging to  fifteen
 minutes after the listerine gargle and
 up to  one hour after

 years of research

 and in tests conducted during  years
 of research those who gargled lis-
 terine antiseptic twice a day had fewer
 colds milder colds and colds of shorter
 duration than those who did not use it
 this success we ascribe to listerines
 germ-killing action on the mouth and
 throat surfaces

    we wish we could say that listerine
 antiseptic so used would always head
 off a cold but we cannot we do say
 that as a first aid it is deserving of
 your most serious consideration

tt youre that man heres something

 i w that will interest you

          not a magic formula-not a get-
rich-quick scheme-but something more
substantial more practical

of course you yourself need something
more than just the ambition to be an ac-
countant youve got to pay the price-be
willing to study earnestly thoroughly

 still wouldnt it be worth your while to
 sacrifice some of your leisure in favor of
 interesting home study-over a compara-
 tively brief period in your life always pro-
 vided that the rewards were good-a salary
 of  to 

 think of the thrill of cashing a good sized
 salary check of building a modern home of
 cruising about town in a new car of swelling
 your bank account

those are everyday events in the life of
many an accountant-who mind you doesnt
have to kill himself with work to afford
them his duties are interesting varied and
of real worth to his employers he has
standing

do you feel that such things arent for
you well dont be too sure very possibly
they can be

why not like so many before you inves-
tigate lasalles modern problem method

of training for an accountancy position 

  instantly youll appreciate its merits
youll realize its practical and thorough
yet its not expensive-considering time re-
quired and results gained

  just suppose you were permitted to work
in a large accounting house underthe personal
supervision of an expert accountant sup-
pose with his aid you studied accounting
principles and solved problems day by day-
easy ones at first-then the more difficult
ones if you could do this-and if you could
turn to him for advice as the problems be-
came complex-soon youd master them all

  thats the training you follow in principle
under the lasalle problem method

  however under lasalle the training is
much broader you learn more than one ac-
countant usually could teach at lasalle
theres a staff of experienced specialists to
guide you you get the benefit of their com-
bined experience

  you cover accountancy from the basic
principles right up through accountancy
systems and income tax procedure then
you add c p a training and prepare for the
c p a examinations as you go along you
absorb the principles of auditing cost 
accounting business law statistical  

control organization manage-
ment and finance	

w

your progress is as speedy as you care to
make it-depending on your own eagerness
to learn and the time you spend in study

   will recognition come  the only answer as
you know is that success does come to the
man who is really trained its possible your
employers will notice your improvement in a
very few weeks or months indeed many
lasalle graduates have paid for their train-
ing-with increased earnings-before they
have completed it for accountants who
are trained in organization and management
are the executives of the future

   as experts in finance accountants inter-
pret future trends through their ability to
analyze past records they advise on how
much a business may spend for sales promo-
tion or expansion because theyre familiar
with business law they know the tangles of
taxation a trained accountant can really
go places

argosy-march 
americas oldest and best all-fiction magazine

 editorial

   gain we want to speak of argosys
 new format and of the readers re-
 sponse to it the fact that there has
 been a response is the important thing
 for it enables us to chart the course
 of argosy with new assurance

   we do not stand alone on the
 bridge of the ship we have been
 joined there by the people who helped
 to build argosy and that is heart-
 ening

    to change without reason is absurd
 but to fear the process of changing is
 equally ridiculous last week we told
 you briefly why we felt that a change
 in argosys appearance was justified

  we still believe in our aim since
 none of your letters has disagreed with
 it what some of you criticize is the
 method we have taken to attain our
 aim and that is precisely the sort of
 comment we hoped to receive we
 were willing to try new things because
 we knew the readers could be counted
 on to help us

   consequently when we launched the
 new format we kept our minds open
 we offered what seemed to us the best
 solution to our problem but we were
 willing to admit that it was not per-
 fect

    it was up to you the readers to tell
 us in what details we had erred many
 of you have already done that and
 we hope to hear from many more of
 you in any case the comment we
 have received as well as the tremen-
 dous response we have gotten from
 newsstand sales has made it possible
 for us to give you an argosy that will
 meet the highest standards

and so to

death

ever had a nightmare-and dreamed you
killed a man and then did you ever wake
up and find him dead the gripping story
of a man whose worst dreams came true a
short novel

by cornell woolrich

author of cinderella and the mob all at once no alice etc

chapter i

the first horror

first all i could see was this beau-
tiful girls face like a white slight-
ly luminous mask swimming de-
tachedly against enfolding darkness as
if a little bluish spotlight of its own was
trained on it from below

  it was so beautiful and so false and i
seemed to know it so well

  there was no danger yet just this
separate shell-like face-mask standing
out but there was danger somewhere
around i knew that already and i knew
that i couldnt escape it

  i knew that everything i was about to
do i had to do and yet i didnt want to
do it i wanted to turn and get out of
wherever this was

  i even turned and tried to but i
couldnt any more there had been only
one door when i slipped in just now it
had been simple enough now when i
turned the place was nothing but doors
-an octagon of doors set frame to frame
with no free wall-space between

  i tried one another a third they were
the wrong ones i couldnt get out

  and by doing this i had unleashed the
latent menace that was lurking there
around me all the time i had brought on
all the sooner the very thing i had tried
to escape from though i didnt know
what it was yet

  the flickering white mask slowly be-
fore my horrified eyes became malign
vindictive it snarled there he is right
behind you get him the eyes snapped
like fuses the teeth glistened in a grin-
ning bite

  the light became more diffused it was
murky bluish-green now the kind of


light there would be under water and
in it my doom slowly reared its head
with a terrible inevitability

  this was male

  first it-he-was just a black huddle
like solidified smoke at the feet of this
opalescent revengeful mask then it
slowly uncoiled rose lengthened and at
the same time narrowed until it loomed
there before me upright

  it came toward me with cataleptic
slowness i wanted to turn and run in
the minute the half minute that was all
there was left now i couldnt move i
couldnt lift a foot i just wavered back
and forth on a rigid base

  why i wanted to get out what it was
going to do to me wasnt clear only
there was soul-shrivelling fear in it and
horror more than the mind could con-
template

  the pace was beginning to accelerate
now as it near its climax

  he came on using up the smll re-
maining distance between us his outline
was still indistinct clotted like a lumpy
clay image i could see the arms come up
from the sides and couldnt avoid their
lobster-like conjunction

  i could feel the pressure of his hands
upon my neck he held it at the sides
rather than in front as if trying to break
it rather than strangle me the gouge of
his thumbs was excruciating pressing
into the tender slack of flesh right beside
and under the jawbone

i went down in a sort of spiral around
and around following my head and
neck around as he sought to wrench them
out of true with my spinal column

  i clawed at the merciless hands trying
to pull them off i pried one off at last
but it wrenched itself free of my re-

straint again trailing a nail-scratch on
my forearm just across the knob of the
wristbone

  the hand clamped itself back where
it had been with the irresistibility of a
suction-cup

  i beat at his arched body from under-
neath then-as my resistance weakened
-only pushed at it at last only grasped
at it with the instinctive clutch of a
drowning man a button came off loose
in my hand and i hung onto it with the
senseless tenacity of the dying

  and then i was so long dying my neck
was so long breaking he tired of the
slower surer way he spoke to the ma-
cabre mask  heard every word clearly
hand me that sharp-pointed bore lying
over there or thisll go on all night

  i raised mutely protesting hands out
and past him and something was put into
one of them i could feel the short trans-
verse handle a thought flashed through
my mind-and even ones thoughts are
so distinct in those things- shes put it
into my hand instead of his

  i fixed my hand on it more securely
poised it high and drove it into him from
in back it seemed to go in effortlessly
like a skewer into butter i could even
feel myself withdraw it again and it
came out harder than it went in

  he went with it or after it and toppled
back after a moment i drew near to
him again on hands and knees

  and now that it was too late his face
became visible at last as if a wanly
flickering light were playing over it and
he was suddenly no formless mud-clotted
monster but a man just like i was harm-
less helpless inoffensive

  the face looked reproachfully up at
me as if to say why did you have to
do that
  i couldnt stand that and i leaned over
him tentatively feeling for the position
of his heart when id located it i sud-
denly drove the metal implement in with
ungovernable swiftness from straight
overhead and jumped back as i did so

  the mask still present in the back-
ground gave a horrid scream and
whisked away like something drawn on
wires

i heard a door close and i quickly
turned to see which way she had
gone so that i might remember and find
my own way out but i was too late
she was gone by the time i turned and
all the doors looked alike again

  i went to them and tried them one by
one each one was the wrong one
wouldnt open now i couldnt get out
of here i was trapped shut in with what
was lying there on the floor it still held
fear and menace greater even than when
it had attacked me

  for the dread and horror was now
more imminent than ever seemed about
to burst and inundate me its source was
what lay there on the floor i had to hide
it i had to shut it away

  i threw open one of the many doors
that had baffled me so repeatedly
throughout and behind it in the sap-
phire pall that still shouded the scene i
now saw a shallow closet

  i picked up what lay on the floor-and
i could seem to do it easily it had be-
come light i propped it up behind the
closet door there was not depth enough
behind it to do anything else

  then i closed the door upon it and
pressed it here and there with the flats
of my hands up and down the frame that
bordered the mirror as if to make it hold
tighter but danger still seemed to exude
through it like a vapor i knew that

wasnt enough i must do more than that
or it would surely open again

 then i looked down and below the
knob there was a keyhead sticking out
it was shaped a little like a three-leaf
clover tad the inner rim of each of the
three scooped-out leaves was fretted
with scrollwork and tracery

  it was of some yellowish metal either
brass or iron gilded over a key such as
is no longer made or used

  i turned it in the keyhole and i drew it
slowly out i was surprised at how long
a stem it had it seemed to keep coming
forever at last it ended in two odd
little teeth each one doubled back on
itself like the single arm of a swastika

 i pocketed it then the knob started
turning from the inside the door started
to open slowly but remorselessly in
another minute i was going to see some-
thing unspeakably awful on the other
side of it revelation the thing the whole
long mental-film had been building to
was upon me

 and then i woke up

chapter ii

the key

id lost the pillow to the floor and my
head was halfway down after it dang-
ling partly over the side of the bed my
face was studded with oozing sweatdrops

 i propped myself upon one elbow and
blew out my breath harrowedly i mum-
bled gee im glad thats over with
and drew the back of my pajama sleeve

lust as cliff was swinging the chair he
froze there was a man with a gun standing
behind me

across my forehead to dry it i looked
at the cloek and it was time to get up
anyway but even if it hadnt been who
would have risked going back to sleep
after such a thing i might have re-
formed and started in again for all i
knew

  i flung my legs out of the ravaged cov-
erings sat on the edge of the bed picked
up a sock and turned it inside out pre-
paratory to shuffling it on

  dreams were funny things whered
they oome from whered they go

  a basinful of stinging cold water in the
bathroom cleared away the last lingering
vestige of it and from this point on
everything was on a different plane-
normal rational and reassuringly fa-
miliar the friendly bite of the comb
the winding of the little stem of my
wristwatch the looping together of the
two strap-ends around my-

 they fell open and dangled down
straight again still unattached and stayed
that way i had to rivet my free hand to
the little dial to keep it from sliding off
my wrist

  i stared at the thing for minutes on
end

  i had to let my cuff slide back in place
and cover it at last i couldnt stand
there staring at it forever that didnt
answer anything what should it tell
me it was a scratch that was all


talk about your realistic dreams
well i thought i must have done
that to myself with my other hand in
the throes of it that was why the detail
entered into the dream-fabric

   it couldnt naturally be the other way
 around because the other way around
 meant transference from the dream into
 the actuality of a red scratch across my
 wristbone

   i went ahead the familiar plane the
 rational everyday plane the blue tie
 today i threw up my collar drew the
 tie-length through folded it down again

   my hands stayed on it holding it down
 flat on each side of my neck as if afraid
 it would fly away part of my mind was
 getting ready to get frightened fly off
 the handle and the rest of my mind
 wouldnt let it held it steady just like i
 held the collar

   but i hadnt had those bruises-those
 brownish-purple discolorations faintly
 visible at the side of my neck as from
 the pressure of cruel fingers-i hadnt
 had those last night when i undressed

   well-i hadnt yet had the dream last
 night when i undressed either why look
 for spooks in this the same explanation
 that covered the wrist-scratch still held
 good for this too i must have done it to
 myself seized my own throat in trying
 to ward off the attack passing through
 my mind just then

   i even stood there and tried to recon-
 struct the posture to see if it was phy-
 sically feasible it was but the result
 was almost grotesquely distorted it re-
 suited in crossing the arms over the chest
 and gripping the left side of the neck
 with the right hand the right with the
 left

  i didnt know maybe troubled sleepers
 did get into those positions i wasnt as
 convinced as i would have like to be
 one thing was certain the marks had
 been made by two hands not one

   but-more disturbing than their visi-
 bility-there was pain in them soreness
 when i prodded them with my own fin-
 gertips stiffness when i turned my neck
 acutely it seemed to weaken the theory
 of self-infliction how was it i hadnt
 awakened myself exerting that much
 pressure

   i forced myself back to the everyday
 plane again buttoned the cpllar around
 the bruises party but not entirely con-
 cealing them knotted the tie shrugged
 on vest and coat i was about ready to
 go now

   the last thing i did was what i al-
 ways did last of all one of those in-
 eradicable little habits i reached into
 my pocket to make sure  had enough
 change available for my meal and trans-
 portation without having to stop and
 change a bill on the way

   i brought up a palmful of it and then
 i lost a good deal of it between my sud-
 denly stiff outspread fingers only one
 or two pieces stayed on around the but-
 ton the large and central button

   i let them roll not stooping to pick
 them up i couldnt my spine-wouldnt
 have bent right then

   it was a strange button i knew i was
 going to check it with every article of
 clothing i had but i already knew it
 wasnt from one of my own things

   something about the shape the color
 told me my fingers had never twisted it
 through a buttonhole or they would have
 remembered it

   that may sound far-fetched but but-
 tons can become personalized to nearly
 as great an extent as neckties

  and when i closed my hand over it-
 as i did now-it took up as much room
 inside my folded palm it had the same
 feel as it had had a little while ago in
 

 that thing oh i could remember clearly

  it was the button from the dream

i threw open the closet door so fast
and frightenedly it hit the wall and
bounced there wasnt anything hanging
up in there that i didnt hold that button
against-even where there was no button
missing even where its size and type
utterly precluded its having been at-
tached

  it wasnt from anything of mine it
didnt belong anywhere

  this time i couldnt say i did it to
myself in the throes of that thing it
came from somewhere it had four cen-
ter holes with even a wisp or two of
black tailors thread still entwined in
them it was solid not a phantom

  but rationality wouldnt give in no
no i picked this up on the street and i
dont remember doing it that simply
wasnt so id never picked up a stray
button in my life

  or the last tailor i sent this suit out to
left it in the pocket from someone elses
clothing by mistake but they always re-
turn dry-cleaned garments to me with
the pocket-linings inside out id noticed
that a dozen times

  that was the best rationalization could
do and it was none too good i said out
loud i better get out of here i need a
cup of coffee ive got the jitters

  i shrugged into my coat fast threw
open my room door poised it to close it
after me and the last gesture of all
before leaving each morning came to me
instinctively feeling to make sure i had
my key and wouldnt be locked out when
i returned that evening

  it came up across the pads of my fin-
gers but it was only visible at both ends
the middle part was bisected obscured
by something lying across it my lips
parted spasmodically and refused to
come together again

  it had a head-this topmost one-a lit-
tle like a three-leaf clover and the in-
ner rim of each of the three leaves was
fretted with scroll work and tracery it
had a stem disproportionately long for
the size of its head and it ended in two
odd little teeth bent back on themselves
like half of a swastika

  it was of some yellowish composition
either brass or iron gilded over a key
such as is no longer made or used

it lay lengthwise in the hollow of my
hand and i kept touching it repeated-
ly with the thumb of that same hand
that was the only part of me that moved
for a long time that foolish flexing
thumb

  i didnt leave right then for all my
preparations i went back into the room
and closed the door after me on the in-
side and staggered dazedly around for a
moment or two

  once i dropped down limply on the
edge of the bed then turned around and
noticed what it was and got hastily up
again more frightened than ever

  another time i remember i thrust my
face close to the mirror in the dresser
drew down my lower lid with one finger
started intently at the white of my eye-
ball even as i did it i didnt know what
it would tell me it didnt tell me any-
thing

  and still another time i looked out of
the window as if to see whether the out-
side world was still there it was the
houses across the way looked just as
theyd looked last night the lady on the
third floor had her bedding airing over
the windowsill just like every morning
there was nothing the matter out there
it was in here with me

  i decided id better go to work maybe

that would pull me out of this i fled
from the room almost as if it were haunt-
ed it was too late to stop off at a break-
fast-counter now i didnt want any any-
way my stomach kept giving little
quivers

  in the end i didnt go to work either
i couldnt i wouldnt have been any
good i telephoned in that i was too ill
to come-and it was no idle excuse

  i roamed around the rest of the day in
the sunshine wherever the sunshine was
the brightest i sought and stayed in that
place and when it moved on i moved
with it i couldnt get it bright enough
or strong enough

  and yet the sunshine didnt warm me
where others mopped their brows and
moved out of it i stayed-and remained
cold inside and the shade was winning
the battle as the hours lengthened the
sun weakened and died the shade deep-
ened and spread night was coming on
the time of dreams the enemy

chapter iii

               dead end

                  i

t went to cliffs house late the first
time i got there they were still at
the table i could see them through the
front window i walked around the block
repeatedly until lil had gotten up from
the table and taken all the dishes with
her and cliff had moved to another chair
and was sitting there alone

  i did all this so she wouldnt ask me
to sit down at the table with them i
couldnt have stood it

  i rang the bell and she opened the
door dried her hands and said heartily
hello stranger i was just saying to
cliff only tonight its about time you
showed up around here

  i wanted to detach him from her but
first i had to sit through about ten min-
utes of her she was my sister but you
dont tell women things like i wanted to
tell him

  finally she said ill just finish up
the dishes and then ill be back

  the minute the doorway was empty
i whispered urgently get your hat and
take a walk with me outside i want
to tell you something-alone

  on our way out he called in to the
kitchen vince and i are going out to
stretch our legs well be back in a cou-
ple of minutes

  she called back immediately and wam-
ingly now cliff only beer-if thats
what youre going for

  it put the idea in his head if nothing
else but i said no i want to be able
to tell you this clearly its going to
sound hazy enough as it is lets stay out
in the open

  we strolled slowly along the sidewalk
he was on his feet a lot and it was no
treat to him i suppose but he was a
good-natured sort of fellow and didnt
complain he was a detective i prob-
ably would have gone to him about it
anyway even if he hadnt been but the
fact that he was of course made it the
inevitable thing to do

  he had to prompt me because i didnt
know where to begin so whats the
grief boy friend

  cliff last night i dreamed i killed a
fellow i dont know who he was or
where it wais supposed to be his nail
creased my wrist his fingers bruised the
sides of my neck and a button came off
him somewhere and got locked in my
hand

  and finally after id done it i locked
the door of a closet id propped him up
in put the key away in my pocket and
when i woke up-well look
    we had stopped under a street light
 i turned to face him i drew back my
 cuff to show him can you see it he
 said he could

    i dragged down my collar with both
 hands first on one side then on the
 other can you see them can you
 see the faint purplish marks there
 theyre turning a little black now

    he said he could

    and the button the-same shape and
 size and everything was in my trousers-
 pocket along with my change its on
 the dresser back in my own room now
 if you want to come over you can see it
 for yourself

    and last of all the key turned up on
 me next to my own key in the pocket
 where  always keep it ive got it right
 here  show it to you ive been car-
 rying it around with me all day

 tt took me a little while to get it out

 	my hand was shaking so it had shak-
 en like that all day every time i brought
 it near the thing to feel if it was still on
 me

    he took it from me and examined it
 curiously but noncommittally

     thats just the way it looked in-when
 i saw it when i was asleep i told him
 the same shape the same color the
 same design it even weighs the same
 it even-

    he lowered his head a trifle looked at
 me intently from under his brows when
 he heard how my voice sounded youre
 all in pieces arent you he put his
 hand on my shoulder for a minute to
 steady it dont take it that way dont
 let it get you

   that didnt help sympathy wasnt
 what i wanted i wanted explanation
 cliff you ve got to help me you dont
 know what ive been through all day 

     hed the key up and down
 where d you get this from vince i
 mean whered you first get it from be-
 fore ou dreamed about it

    i grabbed his arm vith both hands
 but don t you understand what ive just
 beentelhng you i didnt have it be-
 fore i dreamed about it i never saw it
 before then and then i wake up and it
 turns real

    and that goes for the button too

    i quirked my head

    youre in bad shape over this arent
 you well what is it thats really got
 you going its not the key and button
 and scratch is t are you afraid the
 dream really happened is that it

 by that i could see that he hadnt
 understood until now hadnt really got-
 ten me naturally it wasnt just the tok-
 ens carried over from the dream that had
 the life frightened out of me it was the
 implication behind them

 if it were just a key turned up in my
 pocket after i dreamed about it why
 would i go to him the hell with it
 but if the key turned up real then there
 was a mirrored closet door somewhere
 to go with it

 and if there was a closet to match it
 then there was a body crammed inside
 it also real real dead a body that
 had scratched me and tried to wring my
 neck before i killed it

 t tried to tell him that i was too
 weak to shake him but i went through
 the motions dont you understand
 theres a door somewhere in this city
 right at this very minute that this key
 belongs to theres a man propped up
 dead behind it

 and i dont know where nor who he
 is nor how or why it happened only that
 -that i must have been there i must
 have done it-or why would it come to

 my mind like that in my sleep why
 youre in a bad way he gave a
 short whistle through his clenched teeth
 you need a drink lil or no lil come
 on well go some place and get this thing
 out of your system he clutched me
 peremptorily by the arm

    but only coffee i said lets go
 where the lights are good and bright
 we went where there was so much
 gleam and so much dazzle even the flies
 walking around on the table cast long
 shadows

    now well go at this my way he said
 licking the beer-foam off his upper lip
 tell me the dream over again

     i told it

    i cant get anything out of that he
 shook his head did you know this
 girl or face or whatever it was

    i pressed the point of one finger down
 hard on the table no now i dont but
 in the dream i did and it made me brok-
 en-hearted to see her like she had dou-
 blecrossed me or something

   well in the dream who was she
 then

    i dont know i knew her then but
 now i dont

    cripes he said swallowing more beer
 fast i should have made this whisky
 with tabasco sauce well was she some
 actress youve seen on the screen lately
 maybe or some picture youve seen in
 a magazine or maybe even some pass-
 ing face you glimpsed in a crowd all
 those things could happen

 i dont know i seemed to know her
 better than that it hurt me to see her
 to have her hate me but i cant carry
 her over into-now

 and the man

 no i couldnt seem to see his face
 through the whole thing i only saw it
 at the very end after it was already too
 late and then when the door started to
 open again it seemed tss if i was going
 to find out something horrible-about
 him i guess but i woke up   
 last of all the place you say noth-
 ing but doors all around you have you
 been in a place like that lately have
 you ever seen one in a magazine illus-
 tration in a story you read in a movie

 	no

 well then lets get away from the
 dream lets leave it alone he flung
 his hand back and forth relievedly as if
 clearing the air it was starting to get
 me myself now whatd you do last night
 before this whole thing came up
 nothing just what i do every other

 night i left work at the usual time had
 my meal at the usual place-

    sure it wasnt a welsh rabbit

    a welsh rabbit is not responsible for
 that key a locksmith is drop it on the
 table and hear it clash bite it between
 your teeth and chip them and i didnt
 have it when i went to bed last night

 tte leaned toward me now listen
 vince theres a very simple expla-
 nation for that key there has to be
 and whatever it is it didnt come to you
 in a dream either you were walking
 along you noticed that key picked it up
 because of its peculiar-

   i semaphored both hands before my
 face no i tried to sell myself that
 this morning it wont work id remem-
 ber the key itself even if i didnt re-
 member the incident of finding it its a
 unique key and i never saw it before
 all right it dont have to be that ex-
 planation theres a dozen-and-one other
 ways it could have gotten into your pock-
 et without your knowledge you might
 have hung the coat up under some shelf
 the key was lying on and it dropped off
 and the open pocket caught it-

    the pockets of my topcoat have flaps
 whatd it do make a u-turn to get in
 under them

   the flaps might have been left ac-
 cidentally tucked in from the last time
 your hands were in your pockets or it
 may have fallen out of someone elses
 coat hung up next to yours in a cloak-
 room and been lying there on the floor
 and someone came along thought it be-
 longed in your coat put it back in-

    i shoved my hands in and out of those
 pockets a dozen times yesterday and
 the day before and the day before that
 where was it then it wasnt in the pock-
 et but it was this morning after i
 saw it clear as a photograph in my sleep
 during the night

    cliff rubbed his chin thoughtfully for
 a minute all right have it your way
 lets say that it wasnt in your pocket
 last night that still dont prove that
 the dream itself was real

    no i shrilled it gives it a damn
 good foundation-in-fact as far as im
 concerned

   listen vince theres no halfway
 business about these things either you
 dream a thing or it really happens youre
 twenty-six years old youre not a kid

    dont worry youd know it and youd
 remember it damn plainly afterward if
 you ever came to grips with a guy and
 he had you by the throat like in this
 dream and you rammed something into
 his back

 i dont take any stock in this stuff
 about people walking ip their sleep and
 doing things without knowing it they
 can walk a little ways off from their
 beds maybe but the minute anyone
 touches them or does something to stop
 them they wake right up they cant
 be manhandled and go right on sleep-
 ing through it

 i said i couldnt have walked in my
 sleep anyway it was drizzling when i
 went to bed last night the streets were
 only starting to dry offwhen i first got
 up this morning i dont own rubbers
 and the soles of both my shoes were
 perfectly dry when i put them on

 dont try to get away from the main
 point at issue have you any recollec-
 tion at all no matter how faint of being
 out of your room last night of grappling
 with a guy of ramming something into
 him

 no all i have is a perfectly clear
 recollection of going to bed dreaming
 i did all those things and then waking
 up again


  then thats all there is to it then it
didnt happen and he repeated stub-
bornly you either dream em or you
do m no two ways about it

  i shook my head you havent helped
me a bit not a dimes worth

  he was a little put out maybe because
he hadnt naturally not not if you ex-
pected me to arrest you for murdering a
guy in a dream the arrest would have
to take place in a dream too and the trial
and all the rest of it what do you think
i am a witch doctor

  im going to sleep in the living-room
at your place tonight i said to him
im not going back to that room of mine
till broad daylight dont say anything to
lil about it will you cliff

  i should say not he agreed dyou
think i want her to take you for bugs
youll get over this vince

  first ill get to the bottom of it then
ill get over it i answered sombrely

chapter iv

the eighth image

 slept bout an hours worth and it
was like any other nights sleep id
had all my life-until the night before
no better and no worse cliff came in
and he stood looking at me the next
morning i threw off the blanket theyd
given me and sat up on the sofa

  howd it go he asked half-secretive-
ly on account of lil i suppose

  i eyed him i didnt have any more
dreams if thats what you mean but
that has nothing to do with it if i were
convinced that was a dream i would have
gone home to my own room last night
even if i were going to have it over
again twice as bad

  but im still not convinced now are
you going to help me or not

  he rocked back and forth on his feet
what dyou want me to do

  how could i answer that youre a
detective youve got the key the but-
tons over in my room you must have
often had less than that to work with
find out where they came from find
out what theyre doing on me

  he had my best interests at heart may-
be but he thought the thing to do was
bark at me now listen cut that stuff
out yhear i dowanna hear any more
about that key ive got it and im keep-
ing it and youre not going to see it
again if you harp on this spooky stuff
any more ill help you all right-in a
way you wont appreciate ill haul you
off to see a doctor

  the scratch on my wrist had formed
a scab it was ready to come off i freed
it with the edge of my nail then i blew
the little sliver of dried skin off and
i gave him a long look more eloquent
than words he got it but he wouldnt
give in

lil called in come and get it boys

  i left their house-and i was on my
own just like before id gone there me
and my shadows

i stopped in at a newspaper office and
i composed an ad and told them i
wanted it inserted in the real estate sec-
tion i told them to keep running it daily
until further notice

  it wasnt easy to word it took me the
better part of an hour and about three
dozen blank forms this ad

  i am interested in inspecting for
  lease or purchase a house with an
  octagonal mirror-paneled room or al-
  cove location size and all other de-
  tails of secondary importance provid-
  ed it has this one essential feature



  desired for reasons of a sentimental

 nature communicate box  a

  world-express giving exact details

 on the third day there were two re-
plies waiting when i stopped in at the
advertising office one was about a house
with a mirror-lined powder room on the
second floor only foursquare but
wouldnt that do

  the other told of an octagonal break-
fast nook of glass bricks   

 there wasnt anything on the fourth
day on the fifth there was a windfall
of about half a dozen waiting for me
when i stopped in five of them were
from real estate agents offering their
services the sixth from an individual
owner who was evidently anxious to get
a white elephant off his hands for he of-
fered to have a mirror-paneled room
built in for me at his own expense if i
agreed to take a long-term lease on the
property

  they started tapering off after that
one or two more drifted in by the end
of the week but they obviously werent
what i was looking for and after that
the ad brought no further results ap-
parently the supply of mirrored com-
partments had been exhausted

  the advertising office phoned to find
out if i wanted to continue it no kill
it i said disheartened

 meanwhile cliff must have spotted it
and recognized it he was a very thor-
ough paper-reader when he came home
at nights or perhaps he just wanted to
see how i was getting along at any rate
he showed up good and early the next
day which was a sunday he was evi-
dently off for he was wearing a pullover
and slacks

  sit down i told him

 no he said with some embarrass-
ment matter of fact lil and i are going
to take a ride out into the country for the
day and she packed a lunch for three
cold beer and   

  so that was it listen im all right
i said dryly i dont need any fresh-air
jaunts to exorcise the devils in me if
thats what the strategy is

 he was going to be diplomatic-lils
orders i guess-and until youve seen a
detective trying to be diplomatic you
havent lived something about the new
second-hand chev hat hed just gotten in
exchange for his old second-hand chev
and just come down to the door a min-
ute and say howdy to lil she was sitting
in it

  so i did and he brought my coat out
after me and locked up the room so i
went with them

i

fphe thing was a hoodoo from the be-
 ginning he wasnt much of a driver
but he wasnt the kind that would take
back-seat orders on the road from any-
one either he knew it all

  we never did reach where theyd orig-
inally intended going he lost it on the
way and we finally compromised on a
fly-incubating meadow after a thousand
miles of detouring

  lil was a good sport about it it looks
just like the other place anyway she
said we did more slapping at our an-
kles than eating and the beer was warm
and the box of hard-boiled eggs had dis-
appeared from the car at one of those
ruts hed hit

 and then to complete the picture a
big bank of jet clouds piled themselves
up the sky and let go all of a sudden and
we had to run for it

 the storm had come up so fast we
couldnt even get back to the car before
it broke and the rest was a matter of
sitting in sodden misery while cliff

groped his way down one streaming
rain-misted country road and up anoth-
er getting more thoroughly off our
bearings all the time

  lils fortitude finally snapped short
stop at the first place you come to and
lets get in out of it she screamed at
cliff i cant stand any more of this
she hid her face against my chest

  i cant even see through my wind-
shield much less offside past the road
he grunted he was driving with his
forehead pressed against the glass

  i scoured a peephole on my side of the
car and peered out a sort of rustic
arch sidled past in the watery welter
theres a cut-off a little way ahead
around the next turn i said if you
take that itll lead us to a house with a
big wide porch we can get in under
there

  they both spoke at once he said
how did you know that she said
were you ever up around these parts
before

  i couldnt answer his question i said
no to hers which was the truth

  even after hed followed the cut-off for
some distance there was no sign of a
house are you getting us more tangled
up than we were already vince he
asked in mild reproach

  no dont stop keep going i insisted
youll come to it-two big stone lan-
terns turn the car left between em-

  i shut up again as jerkily as id com-
menced at the peculiar back-shoulder
look he was giving me i poked my fin-
gers through my hair a couple of times
gee i dont know how i knew that my-
self i mumbled half-audibly

  he became very quiet from then on
i think he kept hoping id be wrong
there wouldnt be any such place

  but it was lil who tapped him on the
shoulder and said there they are there
they are turn cliff like he told you

  you could hardly make them out even
at that faint gray blurs against the
obliterating pencil-strokes bf rain you
certainly couldnt tell what they were

  he turned without a word and we glid-
ed between them all i could see was
his eyes in the rear vision mirror on
me id never seen eyes with such black
accusing pupils before like buckshot
they were

  a minute passed and then a house with
a wide sheltering veranda materialized
through the mist phantom-like and came
to a dead halt beside us i heard his
brakes go on

i wasnt much aware of our dash
through the curtain of water that sep-
arated us from the porch roof lil squeal-
ing between us my coat hooded over her
head

  through it all i was conscious of the
beer in my stomach it had been warm
when i drank it back at the meadow
but it had turned ice-cold now as if it
had been put into a refrigerator

  i had a queasy feeling and the rain
had chilled me-but deep inside where
it hadnt been able to wet me at all
and i knew those werent raindrops on
my forehead they were sweat turned
cold

  we stamped around on the porch for a
minute the way soaked people do

  i wish we could get in lil mourned

  the keys under that window-box
with the geraniums i said

  cliff traced a finger under it and
brought it out he put it in the keyhole
his hand shaking a little and turned it
and the door went in he held his neck
very stiff to keep from looking around
at me that beer had turned to a block
of ice now
  i went in last like someone toiling
through the coils of a bad dream

   it was twilight-dim around us at first
the rainstorm outside had gloomed up the
afternoon so i saw lils hand go out to
a china switch-mount sitting on the in-
side of the door-frame on the left

  not that one thats the one to the
porch i said the one that controls
the hall is on the other side

   cliff swept the door closed revealing
the switch it had been hidden behind
the door until now he flicked it and a
light went on a few yards before us over-
head lil tried out hers anyway and the
porch lit up then blackened once more
as she turned the switch off

  i saw them look at each other then
she turned to me and said what is this
a rib how do you know so much about
this place anyway vince poor lil she
was in another world

   cliff said gruffly just a lucky guess
on his part he wanted to keep her out
of it out of that darkling world he and
i were in

phe light was showing us a paneled
- hall and stairs going up dark pol-
ished wood with a carved handrail ma-
hogany or something cliff said point-
ing his call up the stairs good after-
noon anybody home

  i said dont do that in a choked
voice

   hes cold lil said hes shaking
but she could not know the origin of
my strange chill

  she turned aside through a double
doorway and lighted up a living room
we both looked in there after her with-
out going in we had other things on our
mind than warmth and comfort

  there was an expensive parquet floor
but everything else was in a partial state
of dismantlement dust covers made
ghostly shapes of the chairs and sofa and
a piano

  away for the summer lil said know-
ingly but funny theyd leave it un-
locked like that and with the electric-
ity still connected your being a detec-
tive comes in handy cliff we wont
get in trouble walking in like this  

  there was a black onyx fireplace and
after running her hands exploringly
around it she gave a little bleat of satis-
faction and touched something elec-
tric

  it glowed red she started to rub her
arms and shake out her skirt before it
to djry herself off and forgot us for the
time being

  i glanced at cliff and then i backed
away out of the doorway i turned and
went up the staircase silently but swift-
ly i saw him make for the back of the
hall equally silent and swift we were
both furtive in our movements somehow

  i found a bedroom dismantled like
downstairs i left it by another door and
found myself in a two-entrance bath

i went out by the second entrance and
i was in another bedroom

  through a doorway left open i could
see the hallway outside through an-
other doorway likewise unobstructed i
could see-myself

  poised quivering with apprehension
arrested in mid-search white face star-
ing out from above a collar not nearly
as white i shifted came closer-dying
a little wavering as i advanced

  two of me three four five six
seven

  i was across the threshold now and
the door brought around from its posi-
tion flat against the outside wall and
pulled in after me flashed the eighth
image of myself on its mirror-backed
surface

chapter v

inquisition

t tottered there and stumbled and

 	nearly went down-all nine of me
 cliffs footfall sounded behind me and
 the eighth reflection was swept away
 leaving only seven his hand gripped
 me by the shoulder supporting me

   i heard myself groan in infinite desola-
 tion this is the place god above this
 is the place

  yeh he bit out in an undertone
  have you got it i said

  he knew what i meant he fumbled
 he had it on a ring with his other keys
 i wished he hadnt kept it i wished hed
 thrown it away

  the other keys slithered away and
 there it was fancy scroll-work--a key
 such as is no longer used or made   

   one glass was a door the door wed
 come in by four of the remaining seven
 were dummies mirrors set into the naked
 wall-plaster you could tell that because
 they had no keyholes they were the
 ones that cut the corners of the quadri-
 lateral the real ones were the ones that
 paralleled the walls one on each side

   he put the key into one and it went
 in smoothly something went- cluck be-
 hind the wood and he pulled open the
 mirror door

   a ripple coursed down the lining of
 my stomach there was nothing in there
 only empty wooden paneling that left
 two

   lils hail reached us what are you
 two up to up there from that other
 world so far away

  keep her downstairs a minute i
 breathed desperately

   he called down hold it vince has
 taken off his pants to dry them

   she answered im hungry im going
 to see if they left anything around to-
 and her voice trailed off toward the
 kitchen at the back

   he was turning the key in the second
 door and when he said look i saw
 a black thing in the middle of the closet
 and for a minute i thought-

   it was a built-in safe steel painted
 black but with the dial left its own color
 it had been cut or burned into

   thats what he was crouched before
 that-night when he seemed just like a
 puddle on the floor i heard myself say
 and he must have had a blow-torch
 down there on the floor in front of him
 thats what made that bluish light and
 made her face stand out in the reflec-
 tion like a mask-

  a sob popped like a bubble in my
 throat and that one that you havent
 opened yet is the one i propped him
 up in

   he straightened and turned and start-
 ed over toward it

   i turned to water and there wasnt
 anything like courage in the whole world

 i didnt know where other fellows got
 theirs no dont i pleaded and caught
 ineffectively at his sleeve wait just a
 minute longer give me a chance to-
 cut that out he said remorselessly
 and shook my hand off he went ahead
 he put the key in and turned it   

  he opened it between us i mean i
 was standing on the opposite side from
 him he looked in slantwise first when
 it was still just open a crack and then
 he widened it around my way for me to
 see i couldnt until then

 that was his answer to my unspoken
 question that widening of it like that
 for me to see nothing fell out on him
 nothing was in there not any more

 he struck a match and singed all up
 and down the perpendicular woodwork

 there was light behind us but it wasnt
 close enough

   when the match stopped traveling you
 could see the faint blurred old discolor-
 ation behind it old blood dark against
 the lighter wood

  there wasnt very much of it just
 about what would seep through a wound
 in a dead back ooze through clothing
 and be pressed out against the wood

   he singed the floor but there wasnt
 any down there it hadnt been able to
 worm its way down that far you could
 see where it had ended in two little
 tracks one longer than the other
 squashed out by the blotter-like clothed
 back before they had gotten very far

   the closet and i we stared at one an-
 other

  the match went out the old blood
 went out with it

   someone that was hurt was in here
 he conceded grimly

  someone that was dead i amended
 with a silent shudder

 t il dozed off right after the impro-
 vised snack shed gotten up for us in
 the kitchen tired out from the excite-
 ment of the storm and of getting lost
 the two of us had to sit with her and go
 through the motions while the knowledge
 we shared hung over us like a bloody ax
 poised and waiting to crash

   he could hardly wait to tackle me all
 through the sketchy meal hed sat there
 drumming the fingers of his left hand on
 the table top while he inattentively
 shoveled and spaded with his right

   my own rigid wrist and elbow shoved
 stuff through my teeth i dont know
 what it was and then after it got in
 it wouldnt go down anyway stuck in my
 craw

   whats the matter vince youre not
 very hungry lil said one time

   he answered for me no he isnt
 hed turned unfriendly

   we left her stretched out on the cov-
 ered sofa in the living room the electric
 fireplace on both our coats spread over
 her for a pieced blanket

   as soon as her eyes were safely closed
 he went out into the hall beckoning me
 after him with an imperative hitch of his
 head without looking at me i followed

   close the doors he whispered gut-
 turally i dont want her to hear this

   i did and then i followed him some
 more back into the kitchen where wed
 all three of us been until only a few
 minutes before it was about the furth-
 est you could get away from where she
 was it was still warm and friendly from
 her having been in there

   he changed all that with a look at
 me a look that belonged in a police-
 station basement

c

 tte lit a cigarette and it jiggled with
 awrath between his lips he didnt
 offer me one policemen dont with their
 suspects he shoved his hands deep in
 pockets like he wanted to keep them
 down from flying at me

   lets hear about another dream

 his voice was flat cold

   i eyed the floor you think i lied
 dont you	m

 that was as far as i got he had a
 temper he came up close against me
 sort of pinning me back against the wall
 not physically-his hands were still iff
 pockets-but by the scathing glare he
 sent into me

 you knew which cut-off to take that
 would get us here from a dream didnt
 you

 you knew about those stone lanterns
 at the entrance from a dream didnt you
 you knew where the key to the front


door was cached from a dream didnt
you

  you knew which was the porch switch
and which the hall-from a dream didnt
you

  you know what id do to you if you
werent lils brother id push your
lying face out through the back of your
head and the way his hands hitched
up he had a hard time to keep from
doing it then and there

  i twisted and turned as if i was on a
spit the way i was being tortured

  he wasnt through

  you came to me for help didnt you
but you didnt have guts enough to come
clean to say cliff i went out to such-
and-such a place in the country last
night and i killed a guy such-and-such
a guy for such-and-such a reason

  no you had to cook up a dream

  i can look up to and respect a guy
no matter how rotten a crime hes com-
mitted thatll own up to it make a clean
breast of it and i can even under-
stand and make allowances for a guy
thatll deny it flatly lie about it thats
only human nature

  but a guy thatll come to someone
trading on the fact that hes married to
his sister making a fool out of him like
you did me-

  hes lower than the lowest rat we
ever brought in for knifing someone in
an alley look i found this key in my
pocket when i got up this morning
howd it get in there look i found
this button-

  playing on my sympathies huh get-
ting me to think in terms of doctors and
medical observation huh

  one hand came out of his pocket at
last he threw away his cigarette some
dream that was all right well the
dreams over and babys awake now
his left came out of the pocket and sol-
dered itself to my shoulder and stiff-
armed me there in front of him

  were going to start in from scratch
right here in this place you and me
im going to get the facts out of you
and whether they go any further than
me or not thats my business but at
least im going to have them

his right had knotted up i could see
him priming it how could that get
something out of me that i didnt have
in me to give him

  what were you doing out at this place
the night it happened what brought
you here

  i shook my head helplessly i never
was here before i never saw it until i
came here today with you and lil

  he shot a short uppercut into my jaw
it was probably partly pulled but it
smacked my head back into the wall
who was the guy you did it to what
was his name

  im in hell already you blundering
fool without this i moaned

 he sent another one up at me i
swerved my head and this time it just
grazed me my stubbornness-it must
have seemed like that-inflamed his an-
ger are you gonna answer me vince
are you gonna answer me

   cant youre asking me things i
cant a sob of misery wrenched from
me ask god-or whoever it is watches
pver us in the night when were uncon-
scious

  he kept swinging at me who was the
guy whyd you kill him why why
why

  finally i wrenched myself free retreat-
ed out of range we stood there facing
one another for an instant puffing glar-
ing

  he closed in again youre not going

	

x

toget away with this he heaved ive
handled close-mouthed guys before i
know how to youre going to tell me or
im going to half kill you with my own
hands-where you killed somebody else

  he meant it i could see he meant it
the policemans blood in him was up
he could put up with anything but what
he took to be this senseless stubbornness
in the face of glaring inescapable facts

  i felt the edge of the table the three
of us had peacefully eaten at so short a
time before grazing the fleshy part of my
back i shifted around behind it got it
between us

  he swung up a rickety chair it prob-
ably wouldnt have done much more than
stun me i dont think he wanted it to
he didnt want to break my head he
just wanted to get the truth out of it

and i-i wanted to get the truth into

it

  he at least had someone he thought he
could get the truth out of i had no one
to turn to only the inscrutable night
that never repeats what it sees

  he poised the chair high overhead and
slung his lower jaw out of line with his
upper

  i heard the door slap open it was
over beyond my shoulders he could see
it and i couldnt without turning i saw
him sort of freeze and hold it and look
over at it not at me any more

  i looked too and there was a man
standing there eyeing the two of us
holding a drawn gun in his hand ready
to use it

chapter vi

there was a murder

he spoke first after a second that
had been stretched like an elastic
band to cover a full minute had snapped
back in place whatre you two men
doing in here

  he moved one foot watchfully across
the threshold

  cliff let the chair down the slow easy
way with a neat little tick of its four
legs his stomach was still-going in and
out a little i could see it through his
shirt

  we came in out of the rain that suit
you he said with left-over truculence
that had been boiled-up toward me orig-
inally and was only now simmering
down

  identify yourselves-and hurry up
about it the mans other foot came in
the room so did the gun so did the
cement ridges around his eyes

  cliff took a wallet out of his rear trou-
sers pocket shied it over at him so that
it slithered along the floor and came up
against his feet help yourself he said
contemptuously

  he turned went over to the sink and
poured himself a glass of water to help
cool off without waiting to hear the ver-
dict		

  he came back wiping his chin on his
shirtsleeve holding out a hand peremp-
torily for the return of the credentials
the contents of the wallet had buried the
gun muzzle-first in its holster rubbed out
the cement ridges around his owners
eyes

  thanks dodge he said with notice-
ably increased deference homicide
division huh

  cliff remained unbending how about
doing a little identifying yourself

  im a deputy attached to the sheriffs
office he silvered the mouth of his
vest-pocket looked-a little embarrassed
im detailed to keep an eye on this place
i was home having a little supper and-
uh-

  he glanced out into the hall behind him
questioningly howd you get in i
thought i had it all locked up safe and
sound

  the key was bedded in a flower box
on the porch cliff said

  it was he looked startled must
be a spare then ive had the original
on me night and day for the past week
funny we never knew there was a
second one ourselves-

  i swallowed at this point but it didnt
ease my windpipe any

  i was driving by just to see if every-
thing was okay he went on and i saw
a light peering out of the rear window
here then when i got in i heard the
two of you-

  i saw his glance rest on the chair a
moment he didnt even ask what we
had been scrapping about cliff wouldnt
have answered it if he had i could tell
that by his expression his attitude was
plainly that it was something just be-
tween the two of us 

  i thought maybe  had broken in
or something the deputy added lamely
seeing he wasnt getting any additional
information

  cliff said why should this house be
your particular concern

  there was a murder uncovered in it
last week you know

  something inside me seemed to go
down for the third time

  there was cliff echoed tonelessly
there wasnt even a question-mark after
it id like to hear about it he wait-
ed a while and then he added all about
it

he straddled the chair legs to the
back he took out his pack of smokes
again then when hed helped himself
he pitched it over at me but without
deigning to look at me

  like you throw something to a dog
no not like that you like the dog as
a rule

  i dont know how he managed to get
the message across but in that simple
unspoken act i got the meaning he want-
ed me to perfectly whatever there is
between us im seeing that it stays just
between us-for the time being any-
way so shut up and stay out of it im
not ready to give you away to anybody
-yet

  give one to the man he said in a
stony-hard voice again without looking
at me

  much obliged got my own the dep-
uty went over and rested one haunch on
the edge of the table that put me be-
hind him which maybe was just as well
he addressed himself entirely to cliff

  he expanded felt at home you could
see this was shop talk with a big-
time city dick on a footing of equality
he haloed his own head with comfort-
able smoke this house belonged to a
wealthy couple named fleming-
cliffs eyes flicked over at me burned
searchingly into my face for a second
whipped backto the deputy again before
he had time to notice

  how could i show him any reaction
guilty or otherwise id never heard the
name before myself it didnt mean any-
thing to me

  the husband frequently goes away on
these long business trips he was away
at the time this happened in fact we
havent been able to reach him to notify
him yet the wife was a pretty little
thing-

  was i heard cliff breathe

  the deputy went ahead he was tell-
ing this his way

  -kind of flighty in fact some of
the women around here say she wasnt
 above flirting behind his back but no one
 was ever able to prove anything

   there was a young fellow whose com-
 pany she was seen in a good deal but
 that dont have to mean anything he
 was just as much a friend of the hus-
 bands as of hers three of them used to
 go around together his name was dan
 ayers

   this time it was my mind that sound-
 lessly repeated was

 the deputy took time out spat scoured
 the linoleum with his sole it wasnt
 his kitchen floor after all it was no-
 bodys now some poor devils named
 fleming that thought he was coming
 back to happiness

   bob evans-he leaves the milk around
 here-he was tooling his truck in through
 the cut-off that leads to this place just
 about daybreak that wednesday morn-
 ing and in the shadowy light he sees a
 bundle of rags lying there in the moss
 and brakes just offside

   luckily bobs curious well sir he
 stops and it was little mrs fleming
 poor little mrs fleming all covered with
 dew and leaves and twigs-

   dead cliff asked

   dying she must have spent hours
 dragging herself flat along the ground
 toward the main road in the hope of at-
 tracting attention and getting help she
 must have been too weak to cry out very
 loud and even if she had there wasnt
 anybody around to hear her 

   she must have groaned her life away
 unheard there in those thickets and
 brambles shed gotten nearly as far as
 the foot of one of those stone entrance
 lanterns they have where you turn in
 she was unconscious when bob found
 her

   he rushed her to the hospital let
 the rest of his deliveries go hang both
 legs broken skull fracture internal in-
 juries they said right away she didnt
 have a chance and they were right she
 died early the next night

   breathing was so hard id never
 known breathing to be so hard before
 it had always seemed a simple thing
 that anyone could do-and here i had
 to work at it so desperately

   the noise attracted the deputy he
 turned his head then back to cliff with
 the comfortable superiority of the pro-
 fessional over the layman kinda gets
 him doesnt it this stuffs new to him i
 guess

   cliff wasnt having any of me how
 he hated me right then what was it
 he went on tautly without even giving
 me a look

   well thats it we didnt know what
 it was at first we knew that a car did it
 to her but we didnt get the hang of
 it at first had it all wrong

   we even found the car itself it was
 abandoned there under the trees off the
 main road a little way down beyond the
 eut-off there were hairs and blood on
 the tires and fenders and it was dan
 ayers car

    well practically simultaneous to that
 find waggoner thats my chief had come
 up here to the house to look around and
 hed found the safe busted and looted
 its in an eight-sided mirrored room they
 got on the floor above ill take you
 up and show you afterwards-

   cut it out cliff snarled unexpect-
 edly not at the deputy

   i put the whiskey-bottle back on the
 shelf where it had first caught my eye
 just now this was like having your ap-
 pendix taken out without ether

   why dont he go outside if this gets
 him the deputy said patronizingly

   i want him in here with us he should

get used to this cliff said with vicious
casualness

well that finding of the safe gave
 us a case gave us the whole thing
entire and intact or so we thought you
know those cases that you dont even
have to build that are there waiting for
you-too good to be true

  this was it ayers had caught on that
fleming left a good deal of money
in the safe even when he was away on
trips had brought her back that night
and either fixed the door so that he
could slip back inside again afterwards
after pretending to leave or else re-
mained concealed in the house the whole
time without her being aware of it

  some time later she came out of her
room unexpectedly caught him in the
act of forcing her husbands safe and
ran out of the house for her life-

  why didnt she use the telephone
cliff asked unmovedly

  we thought of that it wasnt a case
of simply reporting an attempted rob-
bery she must have seen by the look
on his face when she confronted him
that he was going to kill her to shut her
up there wasnt any time to stop at a
phone

  she ran out into the open and down
the cut-off toward the main road to try
to save her own life she got clear of
the house but he tore after her in his
car caught up with her before she made
the halfway mark to the stone lanterns

  she tried to swerve offside into the
brush he turned the car after her and
killed her with it just before she could
get in past the trees that would have
blocked him

  we found traces galore there that
reconstructed that angle of it to a t
and they were all offside off the car-
path it was no hit-and-run it was no
accident it was a deliberate kill with the
car chassis for a weapon

  he knocked her down went over her
and then reversed and went over her a
second time in backing out he thought
she was dead she was next door to it
but she was only dying

  i blotted the first tear before it got
free of my lashes but the second one
dodged me ran all the way down gee
life was lovely all i kept saying over
and over was i dont know how to drive
i dont know how to drive

cliff took out his cigarettes again and
prodded into the warped pack he
threw it at me and looked at me and
smiled have another smoke kid he
said ive only got one left but you
can have it

  and i lit it and smiled too through
all the wet junk in my eyes

  he rode the car a spell further down
the main road away from there and
then he thought better of it realized
there must be traces all over it that would
give him away even quicker than he
could drive it so he ran it off a sec-
ond time ditched it there out of sight
where we found it and lit out some less
conspicuous way

  i dont want to spend too much time
on it this is the case we thought we
had all wednesday morning and up un-
til about five that afternoon

  we sent out a general alarm for dan
ayers broadcast his description had the
trains and roads and hauling-trucks out
of here watched at the city end

  and then at five that afternoon mrs
fleming regained consciousness for a
short time-waggoner had been waiting
outside there the whole time to ques-
tion her-and the first thing she whis-
pered was is dan all right he didnt

kill dan did he and then she talked

  what she told us was enough to send
us hotfooting back to the house we
pried open the various mirror panels
wed overlooked the first time and found
ayers dead body behind one of them
hed been stabbed in the back with
some kind of an awl or bit

  hed been dead since the night be-
fore she died about eight that next
evening there went our case

  cliff didnt ask it for quite a while
maybe he hated to himself finally he
did did you get anything on the real
killer

  practically everything but the guy
himself she was right in the alcove
with the two of them when it happened
she got a pretty good look by torchlight
and she lasted long enough to give it to
us all the dope is over at my chiefs
office

  cliff smacked his own knees as if in
reluctant decision he got up lets
go over there he said slowly lets
go over and give it the once over
he stopped and looked back at me from
the doorway cmon vince you too
ill leave a note for lil

  he stood out there waiting until i
had to get up my legs felt stiff

  cmon vince he repeated i know
this is out of your line but you better
come anyway

  havent you got any mercy at all
i breathed as i brushed past him with
lowered head

chapter vii

whong way oct

cliff trod on my heel twice going
into the office from the deputys car
short as the distance was he was bring-
ing up behind me it might have been
accidental but i think without it i might
have faltered and come to a dead halt t
think he thought so too

  waggoner was a much younger-look-
ing and trimmer man than i had ex-
pected the four of us went into his
inner office at the back of the front
room and the three of them chewed the
rag about it-the case-in general-terms
for a while

  then he said yes to cliffs ques-
tion opened a drawer in one of the
filing cabinets and got out a folder

  we do have a pretty good general
description of him from her heres a
transcription of my whole interview with
her at the hospital i had a stenogra-
pher take it down at her bedside

  from the folder he removed a type-
script on onionskin

  all that i thought dismally

  the room had gotten very quiet our
reconstruction of the car assault on mrs
fleming was perfectly accurate as was
our motivation of the safe looting and
its interruption

  the only thing is theres a switch of
characters involved thats where we
went wrong instead of mrs fleming
being killed by ayers mrs fleming and
ayers were killed by this third person

  she saw the awl plunged into ayers
back fled from the house for her life
was pursued down the cut-off by the
murderer in ayers car and crushed to
death the murderer then went back
completed his interrupted ransacking of
the safe and concealed ayers body

  he also relocked the house to gain
as much time as possible  his voice
became an unintelligible drone and
so on and so on

  he turned a page then his tracing
finger stopped heres what you want
dodge the killer was about twenty-


five and fairly skinny his cheekbones
stood out cast shadows in the torch-
light as it wavered on his face-

  i cupped my hand lengthwise to my
cheek the one turned toward the three
of them and sat there as if holding my
face pensively x was over by the night-
blacked window and they were more in
the center of the room under the cone
light waggoner had turned on over his
desk

  his tracing finger dropped a paragraph
lower stopped again he had light-
brown hair she even remembered that
it was parted low on the left side-take
a woman to notice a thing like that even
at such a moment-and an unusually
long forelock that kept falling in front
of his face

  my hand went up a little higher and
brushed mine back it only fell down
again like it always did

  his eyes were fixed and glassy as if
he was mentally unbalanced-

  i saw cliff glance thoughtfully down
at the floor then up again

  he had on a knitted sweater under
his jacket and she even took in that it
had been darned and rewoven up at
the neckline in a different color yarn-
lil had made me one the christmas
before and then id burned a big hole
in it with a cigarette spark and when
id taken it back to her she hadnt been
able to get the same color again it had
left a big star-like patch that hit you in
the eye

  it was back at my room now i looked
out the window and i didnt see any-
thing

his voice went on it took us hours
to get all this out of her we could
only get it in snatches a little at a
time she was so low she went under
without knowing ayers had been killed
along with her

  i heard the onionskin sheets crackle
as he refolded them no one said any-
thing for awhile then cliff asked
they been buried yet

  yeah both temporarily in her case
we havent been able to contact the hus-
band yet i understand hes in south
america

  got pictures of them

  yeah we got death photographs care
to see them

  i knew what was coming up my blood
turned to ice and i tried to catch cliffs
eye to warn him in silent desperation
dont make me look in front of them
ill cave ill give myself away i cant
stand any more of it im played out

  he said off-handedly yeah lets have
a look

  waggoner got them out of the same
folder that had held the typescript
blurredly i could see the large gray
squares passing from hand to hand i
got that indirectly by their reflections
on the polished black window square

  i was staring with desperate intensi-
ty out into the night head averted from
them

  i missed seeing just how cliff worked
it with my head turned away like that
i think he distracted their attention by
becoming very animated and talkative all
at once while the pictures were still in
his hands so that waggoner forgot to
put them back where hed taken them
from i lost track of them

  the next thing i knew the light had
snapped out they were filing out and
he was holding the inner office door for
me empty-handed coming vince
we passed through the outside room to
the street

  the deputy said ill run you back
there its on my own way home any-



way he got in under the wheel and
cliff got in next to him i was just
going to get in the back when cliffs
voice warded me off like a lazy whip

  run back a minute and see if i left
my cigarettes in mr waggoners office
vince

  then he held waggoner himself root-
ed to the spot there beside the car by
a sudden burst of parting cordiality i
want you to be sure and look me up
anytime youd down our way 

  his voice dwindled behind me and
i was in the darkened inner office again
alone i knew what id been sent back
for he didnt have any cigarettes in
here hed given me his last one back at
the fleming house i found the still-
warm cone curbed its swaying lit it
they were there on the table under my
eyes hed left them out there for me
purposely	v

  the womans photograph was topmost
the cone threw a narrow pool of bright
light her face seemed to come to life
in it held up in my hand sight came
into the vacant eyes

  i seemed to hear her voice again
there he is right behind you and
the mans came to life in my other hand
that look hed given me when id bent
over him already wounded to death on
the floor what did you have to do
that for   

phe cone light jerked high up into the
a ceiling and then three pairs of feet
were ranged around me there where i
was flat on the floor i could hear a blur
of awed male voices overhead

  out like a light

  what did it you suppose the pic-
tures things like that get him dont
they i noticed that already over at
the house before when i was telling
you about the case

  hes not well hes under treatment
by a doctor right now he gets these
dizzy spells now and then thats all it
is the last was cliffs he squatted
down by me on his haunches raised my
head held a paper cup of water from the
filter in the corner to my mouth

  his face and mine were only the cups
breadth away from one another

  yes i sighed soundlessly

  shut up he grunted without moving
his lips

  i struggled up and he gave me an
arm back to the car hell be all right
he said and he closed the rear car-
door on me it sounded a little bit like a
cell grating

  waggoner was left behind standing on
the sidewalk in front of his office in a
welter of so longs and much obligeds

  we didnt say anything in the car
we couldnt the deputy was at the
wheel we changed to cliffs car at the
fleming house picked lil up and she
was blazing sore

  she laced it into him halfway back to
the city i think youve got one hell
of a nerve cliff dodge leaving me alone
like that in a house where i had no
business to be in the first place and gor-
ing off to talk shop with a couple of
corny keystone cops

  once near the end she said whats
matter vince dont you feel well shed
caught me holding my head in the rear-
vision mirror

  the outing was a little bit too stren-
uous for him cliff said bitterly

  that brought on a couple of post-
scripts no wonder the way you drive
next time try not to get to the place
were going and maybe youll make it
i would have given all my hopes of
heaven to be back in that blessed every-
day world she was in-where you wran-

gled and you squabbled but you didnt
kill i couldnt give that because i didnt
have any hopes of heaven left

  we stopped and he said ill go up
with vince a minute

i went up the stairs ahead of him he
closed the door after us he spoke
low without fireworks he said lils
waiting downstairs and im going to take
her home before i do anything

  i love lil its bad enough what this
is going to do to her when she finds out
im going to see that she gets at least one
good nights sleep before she does

  he went over to the door ready to
leave run out thats about the best
thing you can do  meet your finish on
the hoof somewhere else where your
sister and i dont have to see it happen

  if youre still here when i come back
im going to arrest you for the murder
of dan ayers and dorothy fleming i
dont have to ask you if you killed those
two people you fainted dead on the
floor when you saw their photographs in
death

  he gave the knob a twist as if he was
choking the life out of his own career
take my advice and dont be here when
i get back ill turn in my information
at my own precinct house and they can
pass it on to waggoner then ill hand
over my own badge in the morning

  i was pressed up against the wall as
if i was trying to get out of the room
where there was no door arms making
swimming-strokes im frightened i
said in a still voice

  killers always are he answered
-afterwards ill be back in about half
ah hour he closed the door and went
out

  i stayed there against the wall listen-
ing to his steps grow fainter and fainter
and finally fade away

  i didnt move for about hal the time
hed given me then i put on the light
over the washstand and turned the warm
water tap i felt my jaw and it was a
little bristly i wasnt really interested
in that

  i opened the cabinet and took out my
cream and blade and holder from sheer
reflex of habit then i saw id taken out
too much and i put back the cream
and holder

  the warm water kept running down
i was in such pain already i didnt even
feel the outer gash when i made it the
water kept carrying it away down the
drain

  it would have been quicker at the
throat but i didnt have the guts this
was the old roman way slower but just
as effective i did it on the left one
too and then i threw the blade away i
wouldnt need it anymore to shave with

   i was seeing black spots in front
of my eyes when he tried to get in the
door i tried to keep very quiet so
hed think id lammed and go away but
i couldnt stand up any more

  he heard the thump when i went down
on my knees and i heard him threaten
through the door open it or ill shoot
the lock away

  it didnt matter now any more he
could come in if he wanted to he was
too late i floundered over to the door
knee-high and turned the key then
i climbed up it to my feet again you
could have saved yourself the trip back

i said weakly

  all he said grimly was i didnt
think of that way out and then he
ripped the ends off his shirt and tied them
tight around the gashes pulling with
his teeth till the skin turned blue above
them then he got me downstairs and
into the car
chapter vni

the candle flame

they didnt keep me at the hospital
just took stitches in the gashes sent
me home and told me to stay in bed a
day and take it easy i hadnt even been
able to do that effectively these safety
razor blades no depth

  it was four when we got back to my
room cliff stood over me while i got un-
dressed then thumbed the bed for me
to get in

  what about the arrest i asked
postponed i asked it just as a simple
question without any sarcasm rebuke or
even interest i didnt have any left
in me to give it

  canceled he said i gave you your
chance to run out and you didnt take
it as a matter of fact i sent lil home
alone ive been downstairs watching the
street door the whole time

  when a guy is willing to let the life
ooze out his veins there must be some-
thing to his story you dont die to back
up lies youve convinced me of your
good faith if not your innocence

  i dont know what the explanation is
but i dont think you really know what
you did that night

im tired i said im licked i dont
even want to talk about it any more

  i think i better stick with you to-
night he took one of the pillows and
furled it down inside a chair and hunched
low in it

  its all right i said-spiritlessly i
wont try it again i still think it would
have been the best way out 

our voices were low we were both
all in from the emotional stress wed
been through all night long and in my
case there was the loss of blood

  in another minute one or both of us
would have dozed off in another min-
ute it would have eluded us forever for
no combination of time and place and
mood and train-of-thought is ever the
same twice

  he yawned he stretched out his legs
to settle himself better the chair had a
low seat and he was long-legged the
shift brought them over a still-damp
stain from my attempt there were
traces of it in a straight line from the
washstand all the way over to the door
he eyed-them

  you sure picked a messy way he ob-
served diowsily

  gas is what occurs to most people
first i imagine i said equally drowsi-
ly it did to me but this house has
no gas so there was no other way but
the blade

  good thing it hasnt he droned if
more houses had no gas thered be
fewer-

  yeah but if the bulb in your room
burns out unexpectedly it can be damn
awkward that happened to the fel-
low in the next room one night i re-
member and he had to use a candle-

  my eyes were closed already maybe
his were too for all i knew my som-
nolent voice had one more phrase to
unburden itself of before it too fell
silent it was the same night i had
the dream i added inconsequentially

how do you know he had to use a
candle were you in there at the time

  his voice opened my eyes again just as
my last straggling remark had opened
his his head wasnt reared but his face
was turned toward me on the pillow

  no he rapped and stuck his head in
my door a minute and he was holding
the candle he wanted to know if my

 light had gone out too i guess he wanted
 to see if the current had failed through
 the whole house or ft was just the bulb
 in his room you know how people
 are in rooming houses

   whyd he have to do that couldnt
 he tell by the hall cliffs voice wasnt
 as sleepy as before

   they turn the lights in the upper
 halls out at eleven-thirty here and i
 guess the hall was dark already

   his head had left the pillow now
 thats still no reason why he should
 bust in on you id like to hear the
 rest of this

    there isnt any rest ive told you all
 there is to it

   thats what you think watch what
 i get out of it to begin with who was
 he had you ever seen him before
 oh sure i said we werent stran-
 gers his name was burg hed been
 living in the room for a week or ten
 days before that wed said howdy pass-
 ing each other on the stairs

   wed even stood and chatted down
 at the street door several times in the
 evening when neither of us had anything
 to do

   how is it you never mentioned this
 incident to me before as many times as
 ive asked you to account for every single
 minute of that evening before you fell
 asleep

   but this has nothing to do with what
 came up later youve kept asking me
 if i was sure i didnt remember having
 the room at any time and things like
 that i didnt even step out into the hall
 when he came to the door like that

    i was in bed already and i didnt even
 get out of bed to let him in now what
 more dyou want

   oh you were in bed already

   id been in bed some time past read-
 ing the paper like i do every night id
 just gotten through and put out my own
 light a couple minutes before when i
 heard this light knock-

 cliff made an approving pass with his
 hand tell it just like that step
 by step tell it like to a six-year-old
 kid hed left the chair long ago and was
 standing over me i wondered why this
 trifling thing this less than an incident
 should interest him so

   i turned over called out who is
 it he answered in a low-pitched voice
 burg from next-door 

   he wrinkled the skin under his eyes
 low-pitched furtive cagey

   i shrugged he didnt want to wake

 	up everyone else on the whole floor
 i suppose

   maybe it was that go on

   i can reach the door from my bed
 you know i stuck out my arm flipped
 the key and opened the door he was
 standing there in his suspenders hold-
 ing this lighted candle in front of him
 so he asked if my room light was okay
 we tried it and it was

  then did he back right out again
 well not instantly we put the light
 right out again but he stayed on in the
 doorway a couple of minutes

   whyd he have to stand in the door-
 way a couple of minutes once hed found
 out your light was okay

   well-uh-winding up the intrusion
 signing off whatever youd want to call
 it

   in just what words

   gee he was worse than a school teach-
 er in the third grade you know how
 those things go he said he was sorry
 hed disturbed me he wouldnt have
 if hed realized i was in bed he said
 youre tired arent you i can see youre

tired  i looked up at cliffs face

  with the light out it was a com-
mentary not a question

ffffhe candle was shining into my face

  a he said yes youre tired youre
very tired and the funny part of it was
i hadnt been until then but after he
called it to my attention i noticed he
was right

  kind of repetitious wasnt he cliff
drawled youve quoted him as saying
it four times already

  i smiled tolerantly i guess hes got
kind of a one-track mind used to mum-
bling to himself maybe

  all right keep going

  theres no further to go he closed the
door and went away and i dropped right
off to sleep

  wait a minute hold it right there
are you sure that door closed after him
did you see it close did you hear it or
are you just tricking your senses into be-
lieving you did because you figure thats
what must have happened next any-
way

  was he a hound at getting you mixed
up i wasnt so alert any more i told
him i was sort of relaxed

  did it go like this he opened it
slightly eased it gently closed the
latch-tongue went click into the socket
did it go like this he opened it a
second time this time eased it back in
place holding the knob fast so the latch-
tongue couldnt connect even so the
edge of the door itself gave a little thump
as it met the frame

  he waited said i can see by the
trouble youre having giving me a posi-
tive answer that you didnt hear either
of those sounds

  but the door mustve closed i pro-
tested what was he going to do stay in
here all night keeping watch at my bed-
side the candle seemed to go out
so he mustve gone out and left me
the candle seemed to go out how
do you know it wasnt your eyes that
dropped closed and shut it out

  i didnt say anything

  i want to ask you a few questions
he said what sort of an effect did his
voice have on you especially when he
kept saying youre tired 

  sort of peaceful i liked it

  he nodded at that another thing
where did he hold that candle in respect
to himself off to one side

  no dead center in front of his own
face so that the flame was between his
eyes almost

  he nodded again did you stare at
the flame pretty steadily

  yeah i couldnt tear my eyes off it
you know how a flame in a dark room
will get you

  and behind it-if he was holding it up
like you say-you met his eyes

  i guess-i guess i must have he kept
it on a straight line between my eyes
and his the whole time

he worked his cheek around like
he was chewing a sour apple eyes
were fixed and glassy as if he was men-
tally unbalanced i heard him mutter

  what

  i was just remembering something
in that deathbed statement mrs flem-
ing made to waggoner one more thing
when you chatted with him downstairs
at the street door like you say you did
once or twice what were the topics can
you remember

  oh a little bit of everything you
know how those things go at first gen-
eral things like the weather and baseball
argosy-march 	
and politics then later more personal
things-you know how you get talking
about yourself when youve got an inter-
ested listener

  cliff said mmm    did you ever
catch yourself doing something you did-
nt want to do while you were in his
company

  no oh wait yes one night he had
a box of mentholated coughdrops in
his pocket he kept taking them out and
offering them to me the whole time we
were talking gosh if theres one thing
i hate its mentholated cough drops id
say no each time and then id give in
and take one anyway before i knew
it id finished the whole box

  cliff eyed me gloomily testing your
will power 

  you seem to make something out of
this whole thing i said helplessly what
is it

  never mind i dont want to frighten
you right now you get some sleep
kid youre weak after what you tried
to do just now i saw him pick up his
hat

where you going i asked i thought
you said you were staying here tonight
fm going back to the fleming house
-and to waggoners headquarters too
while im at it   

  and vince he added from the door-
way dont give up yet well find a
way out somehow dont take any more
short cuts

chapter ix

kill me again

it was noon before i woke up and
even then he didnt show up for an-
other two or three hours yet i didnt
dare leave my room even for a cup of
coffee i was afraid if i did id miss
him and hed think id changed my
mind and lammed out after all 

  he finally showed up around three
and found me worriedly coursing back
and forth in my stocking feet holding one
bandaged wrist with the opposite hand
stiffening was setting in and they hurt
plenty

  but i was fresh as a daisy compared
to the shape cliff was in he had big
black crescents under his eyes from not
getting to bed all night and the first
thing he did was sprawl back in the
easy chair and kick off his shoes then
he blew a big breath of relaxation that
fanned halfway across the room

  were you up there all this time i
gasped

  ive been back to town once in be-
tween to pick up something i needed
and get a leave of absence

  hed brought a large flat slab wrapped
in brown paper he picked it up now
undid it turning partly away from me
scissored his arms and then turned back
again

  he was holding a large portrait-photo-
graph in a leather frame against his
chest for me to see he didnt say any-
thing just watched me

  it took a minute for the identity to
peer through the contradictory details
trifling as they were

  the well-groomed hair neatly tapered
above the ears instead of shaggily un-
kempt the clean-shaven upper lip in-
stead of a sloppy walrus-tusk mus-
tache   

  and above all a look of prosperity
radiating from the perfect fit of the cus-
tom-tailored suit-collar the careful neg-
ligence of the expensive necktie the ex-
pression of the face itself-instead of the
habitual unbuttoned tieless slightly
soiled shirt-collar the hangdog look of


middle age inevitably running to seed

   i said hey thats burg the man
 that had the room next to me whered
 you-

   i didnt have to ask you that i al-
 ready know it from the landlord and
 one or two of the other roomers here
 ive shown it to

   he reached under it with one hand
 and suddenly swung out a second panel
 attached to the first it was one of
 those double-easel arrangements that
 stand on dressers

   she stared back at me and like a
 woman she was different again shed
 been different on each of the three times
 this was the third and last time i was
 to see her

   she had here neither the mask-like
 scowl of hate at bay i had seen by torch-
 light nor yet the rigid ghost-grin of
 death she was smiling calm alive love-
 ly-

   i made a whimpering sound

   burg is dorothy flemings husband
 cliff said waggoner gave me this from
 their house

 he must have seen hope beginning
 to flicker in my eyes he snuffed it
 out with a rueful gnawing at his under
 lip a slight shake of his head

   he closed the photofolder and threw it
 aside no he said no theres no out
 in it for you look vince dyou want
 to know now what were up against once
 and for all youve got to sooner or
 later and it isnt going to be easy to
 take

   youve got bad news for me

   pretty bad but at least its better
 than this weird stuff that youve been
 shadow-boxing with ever since it hap-
 pened its rational down-to-earth some-
 thing that the mind can grasp

   you killed a man that wednesday
 night you may as well get used to the
 idea theres no dodging out of it no
 possibility of mistake no shrugging off
 of responsibility

   it isnt alone mrs flemings death-
 bed description conclusive as that is
 and she didnt make that up out of thin
 air you know fingerprints that wag-
 goners staff took from that mirror door
 behind which ayers body was thrust
 check with yours i compared them pri-
 vately while i was up there from a
 drinking glass i took out of this room
 here and had dusted over at our own
 lab

   i looked and my glass was gone

   you and nobody but you found your
 way into the fleming house and punc-
 tured dan ayers heart with an awl and
 secreted his body in a closet

   he saw my face blanch now steady
 a minute you didnt kill dorothy flem-
 ing you would have i guess but she
 ran out of the house and down the cut-
 off for her life

   you cant drive and she was killed

 	by somebody in a car somebody in
 ayers car but not ayers himself obvi-
 ously since you had killed him upstairs
 a minute before yourself

   now that proves of course that some-
 body brought you up there-and was
 waiting outside for you at a safe dis-
 tance a distance great enough to avoid
 implication yet near enough to lend a
 hand when something went wrong and
 one of the victims seemed on the point
 of escaping

 that didnt help much that halved
 my crime but the half was still as
 great as the whole after being told
 youd committed one murder where was
 the solace in being told you hadnt com-
 mitted a dozen others

  i held my head but why didnt i
know i was doing it i groaned

  we can take care of that later cliff
said i cant prove what i think it was
right now and what good is an explana-
tion without proof theres only one way
to prove it show it could have happened
the first time by getting it to happen all
over again a second time

  i thought he was going crazy-or i was
you mean go back and commit the
crime all over again-when theyre both
already buried

  no not quite-that dont ask me to
explain until afterward if i do youll get
all tense keyed up youre liable to
jeopardize the whole thing without
meaning to i want you to keep cool
everythingll depend on that

  i wondered what he was going to ask
me

  its nearly four oclock now he said
we havent much time a telegram ad-
dressed to mrs fleming was finally re-
ceived from her husband while i was
up there hes arriving back from south
america today

 waggoner took charge of it and
showed it to me hes ordered her re-
buried in a private plot and will prob-
ably get there ins time for the services
i trailed him downstairs to his car got
in beside him limply where we going
i asked

  he didnt start the car right away
gave me a half-rueful half-apologetic
look what place would you most hate
to go to of all places right now
that wasnt hard that eight-sided
mirrored alcove-where i did it

  i was afraid of that im sorry kid
but thats the very place youre going to
have to go back to and stay in alone to-
night if you ever want to get out from
under the shadows again whaddye say
shall we make the try

  he still didnt start the car gave me
lots of time

  i only took four or five minutes 
slapped in my stomach which made the
sick feeling go up into my throat and i
said im ready

  

id been sitting on the floor outside
it to rest when i heard him come in
there were other people with him the
silence of the house tomblike until then
was abruptly shattered by their entrance
into the lower hall i couldnt tell how
many of them there were they went
into the living room and their voices
became less distinct

  i stood up and got ready but i stayed
out a while longer to be able to breathe
better i knew i had time yet he wouldnt
come up right away

  the voices were subdued as befitted a
solemn post-funerary occasion every
once in a while though i could make
out a snatch of something that was said

  once i heard someone ask dont you
want to come over to our place tonight
joel you dont mean youre going to
stay here alone in this empty house after
-after such a thing

  i strained my ears for the answer-a
lot depended on it-and i got it im
closer to her here than anywhere else
presently they all came out into the
hall again on their way out and i could
hear goodnights being said try not to
think about it too much joel get some
sleep

  the door closed a car drove off out-
side then a second one no more voices
after that the tomblike silence almost
returned

  but not quite a solitary tread down
there returning from the front door told
that someone had remained it went into




the living room and i heard the clink of
a decanter against a glass

  then a frittering of piano notes struck
at random the way a person does who
has found contentment is eminently
pleased with himself

  then a light switch ticked and the
tread came out started unhurriedly up
the stairs it was time to get in

  i put one foot behind me and followed
it back i drew concealment before me
in the shape of a mirror panel all but
the ultimate fingers breadth of gap to
be able to breathe and watch

  the oncoming tread had entered the
bedroom adjacent to me and a light
went on in there i heard a slatted blind
spin down then the sound of a valise
being shifted out into a more accessible
position and the click of the key used
to open it

  i could even glimpse the colored labels
on the lid as it went up and over south
american hotels

  i saw bodiless hands reach down take
things out striped pajamas and piles of
folded linen that had never seen south
america that had probably lain hidden
on a shelf in some public checkroom in
the city all this time

  my heart was going hard the dried
blood on the woodwork at my back of
someone i had killed seemed to sear me
where it touched it was the blood of
someone i had killed not this man out
there no matter what happened now
tonight nothing could absolve me of that

  there was no possibility of transfer of
blame cliff had told me so and it was
true

  a light went up right outside where i
was and an ice-white needle of it splin-
tered in at me lengthwise from top to
bottom but not broad enough to focus
anything it fell on-from the outside

  i could see a strip of his back by it he
had come in and was squatting down by
the damaged safe mirror-covering swung
out of the way he swung its useless lid
in and out a couple of times i heard him
give an almost soundless chuckle as if
the vandalism amused him

  then he took things out of his coat
pockets and began putting them in ob-
long manila envelopes such as are used
to contain currency and securities lumpy
tissue-wrapped shapes that might have
been jewelry

  then he gave the safe door an indiffer-
ent slap-to as if whether it shut tight
or not didnt matter what it held was
perfectly safe-for the present

  then he stood before turning to go
out this was the time now

chapter x

the spark went out

i took the gun cliff had given me
his gun out of my pocket and raised
it to what they call the wishbone of the
chest and held it there pointed before
me then i moved one foot out before
me and that took the door away in a
soundless sweep

  i was standing there like that when he
turned finally the mirror covering the
safe-niche had been folded back until
now so he didnt see the reflection of
my revelation

  the shock must nave been almost gal-
vanic his throat made a sound like the
creak of a rusty pulley i thought he
was going to fall down insensible for a
minute his body made a tortured cork-
screw-twist all the way down to his feet
but he stayed up

  i had a lot to remember cliff had told
me just what to say and what not to say
id had to learn my lines by heart and

particularly the right timing of them

 that was even more important hed
warned me i had a very limited time in
which to say everything i was to say i
would be working against a deadline that
might fall at any minute but he didnt
tell me what it was

 hed warned me that we both-this
man i was confronting and i-would be
walking a tightrope without benefit of
balancing poles everything depended on
which one of us made a false step first

  it was a lot to remember staring at the
man whom i had only known until now
as burg a fellow rooming-house jodger
the man who held the key to the mystery
that had suddenly clouded my existence

 and i had to remember each thing in
the order it had been given me in the
proper sequence or it was no good

 the first order was make him speak
first if it takes all night wait until he
speaks first

 he spoke finally somebody had to
and i didnt howd you get here it
was the croak of a frog in mud

you showed me the way didnt you
i could see the lump in his throat as
he forced it down to be able to articulate
youre- you remember coming here
you didnt think i would did you
his eyes rolled you-you couldnt
have

 the gun and i we never moved then
how did i get back here again you ex-
plain it

 i sav his eyes flick toward the en-
trance to the alcove i shifted over a lit-
tle got it behind me to seal him in i
felt with my foot and drew the door in
behind me not fast but leaving only a
narrow gap

  how long have you been in here like
-like this

  since shortly after dark i got in while
you were away at the funeral services
whod you bring with you

just this i righted the gun which
had begun to incline a little at the bore

he couldnt resist asking it he
wouldnt have been human if he
hadnt asked it in his present predica-
ment just how much do you remem-
ber

  i gave him a wise smile that implied
everything without saying so it was
cliffs smile not mine but formed by my
lips

 you remember the drive up he
said it low but hed wavered on the wire
that tightrope cliff had mentioned you
couldnt have you had the look the
typical look-

 what look

  he shut up hed regained his equilib-
rium

 i was holding a thumb tack pressed
into the palm of each hand the whole
way

 then why did you do everything i-
you were directed to so passively

 i wanted to see what it was leading
up to i thought maybe there might be
some good in it for me later if anyone
went to all that trouble

 you purposely feigned i cant be-
lieve it you didnt even draw back ex-
hibit a tremor when i let you out of the
car put the knife in your hand sent you
on toward the house told you how to get
in and what to do you mean you went
ahead and consciously-

  sure i went ahead and did it because
i figured youd pay off heavy afterwards
to keep me quiet and if id tried to
balk then i probably would have gotten
the knife myself on the way back for
my trouble

 what happened what went wrong
inside

  i accidentally dropped the knife in
the dark somewhere in the lower hall
and couldnt find it again i went on up
empty-handed thinking id just frighten
them out the back way and get a chance
at the safe myself

  but ayers turned on me and got me
down he weighed more than i do and he
was going to kill me-to keep it from
coming out that he and your wife were
cheating and had been caught in the act
of breaking into your safe in the bargain

  only by mistake she put the awl that
he cried out for into my hand instead
of his i plunged it into him in self-
defense

  he nodded as if this cleared up some-
thing that had been bothering him ah
that explains the change of weapon that
had me mystified also how it was that
she got out of the house like that and i
had to go after her and-stop her myself

  luckily i was crouched behind the
hood of ayers car peering at the open
door when she came running out she
couldnt drive herself so she didnt try
to get in but ran screaming on foot down
the cut-off

  i jumped in without her seeing me
tore after her and caught up with her
if i hadnt the whole thing would have
ended in a ghastly failure i might have
known you were under imperfect con-
trol

hed fallen off long ago gone hurtling
down but i still had a deadline to
work against things to say without
knowing why

  your control was perfect enough
dont let that worry you you havent
lost your knack

  but you just said-

  and you fell for it i didnt know
what i was doing when you brought me
up here and sent me in to do your dirty
work for you that night

  havent you missed something from
your late wifes bedroom since youve
been back there was a double photo-
folder of you and her the police took
that

   i happened to see both pictures in one
of the papers i recognized you as burg
id also recognized my own description
by a darned sweater i wore that night
and had a vague recollection-like when
youve been dreaming-of having been
in such a house and taken part in such a
scene

  youve convicted yourself out of your
own mouth to me right now i havent
come back here to be paid off for my
participation or take a cut in any hush
money nothing you can give me from
that safe can buy your life

  you picked someone with weak will-
power maybe but strong scruples i was
an honest man youve made me commit
murder i cant clear myself in the eyes
of the law-ever

  youre going to pay for doing that to
me now this way

  his face was working his voice hoarse
as he said

  wait dont do that that wont help
you any alive maybe i can do something
 for you ill give you money ill get you
out of the country no one needs to
know

  my consciencell always know ive
got an honest mans conscience in a mur-
derers body now you should have let
me alone that was your mistake here
you go fleming

  he was almost incoherent drooling at
the mouth wait-one minute more just
sixty seconds he took out a thin gold
pocket watch and snapped up its bur-
nished lid he held it face toward me
open that way


             j

i saw what he was trying to do cliff
had warned me to be careful i
dropped my eyes to his feet kept them
stubbornly lowered brow furrowed with
resistance while i held the gun on him
something kept trying to pull them up

  a flash from the burnished metal of the
inside of the watch-lid wavered erratical-
ly across my chest-front for an instant
like when kids tease you with sunlight
thrown back from a mirror

  look up he kept pleading look up
just one minute more see-the hands
are at six to look just until they get
to here

  something was the matter with the
trigger of the gun it must have jammed

i kept trying to close the finger that was
hooked around it and it resisted or
else maybe it was the finger that wouldnt
obey my will

  i kept blinking more and more rapidly
the flash slithered across my shuttering
eyes slid off came back again they
wanted so bad to look up into it it
prickled

  there was a slight snap as if he had
surreptitiously pulled out the stem-
winder to set the watch back that did
it

  i glanced up uncontrollably he was
holding the watch up brow-high-like
he had the candle that night-as if to give
me a good unobstructed look at its dial
it was in about the position doctors carry
those little attached head-mirrors with
which they examine throats

  i met his eyes right behind it and all
of a sudden my own couldnt get away
any more as if theyd hit glue

  a sort of delicious torpor turned me
into wax i didnt have any ideas of my
own any more i was open to anyone
elses my voice control lasted a moment
longer than the rest of my functions i
heard it say carrying a left-over message
that no longer had any willpower behind
it im going to shoot you

  no he said soothingly youre
tired you dont want to shoot anybody
youre tired the guns too heavy for
you why do you want to hold that
heavy thing

  i heard a far-away thump as it hit the
floor as far away as if it had fallen
right through to the basement gee it
felt good to be without it

  i felt lazy all over the light was going
out but very gradually like it was tired
too the whole world was tired

  somebody was crooning youre tired
youre tired-you dirty bum now ive
got you

there was a white flash that seemed
to explode inside my head and ithurt
like anything

  something cold and wet pressed against
my eyes when i tried to flicker them
open and when i had instead of getting
lighter as when youre slowly waking up
the world around me seemed to get dark-
er and weigh against me crushingly all
over

  the pain increased traveled from my
head to my lungs knives seemed to
slash into them and i couldnt breathe

  i could feel my eyeballs starting out
of their sockets with strangulation and
my head seemed about to burst the
pressure of the surrounding darkness
seemed to come against me in undulating
waves

  i realized that i was under water and
was drowning i could swim but now i
couldnt seem to i tried to rise and
something kept holding me down

  i doubled over forced myself down
against the surrounding resistance groped
blindly along my own legs one seemed
free and unencumbered i could lift it


quite easily from the mucky bottom

  about the ankle of the other there was
a triple constriction of tightly-coiled
rope like a hideous hempen gaiter it
was tangled hopelessly about a heavy
iron cross-bar

  when i tried to raise this one scimitar-
like appendage came free the other re-
mained hopelessly hooked into the slime
it had slashed into from above it must
have been some sort of a small but
weighty anchor such as is used by
launches and fishing craft

  i couldnt release it i couldnt endure
the bend of position against my inner
suffocation i spiraled upright again in
death-fluid my jaws kept going spas-
modically drinking in extinction

  a formless blur came down from some-
where brushed lightly against me shunt-
ed away again before i could grasp it
shot up out of reach i couldnt see it so
much as sense it as a disturbance in the
water

  there were only fireworks inside my
skull now not conscious thoughts any
more the blurred manifestation shot
down again closer this time it seemed
to hang there flounderingly upside down
beside me

  i felt a hand close around my ankle
then a knife grazed my calf and with-
drew i could feel a tugging at the rope
as if it was being sliced at

  self-preservation was the only spark
left in my darkening brain i clutched
at the hovering form in the death-grip
of the drowning i felt myself shooting
up through water together with it inex-
tricably entangled

  i wouldnt let go couldnt something
that felt like a small ridged rock crashed
into my forehead even the spark of
self-preservation went out

chapter xi

last ordeal

when i came to i was lying out on a
little pier or stringpiece of some
kind and there were stars over me i
was in shorts and undershirt wringing
wet and shivering and water kept flush-
ing up out of my mouth

  somebody kept kneading my sides in
and cut and somebody else kept flipping
my arms up and down

  i coughed a lot and one of them said
there he is hes all right now he
stood up and it was cliff he was in his
underwear and all dripping too

  a minute later waggoner stood up on
the other side of me he was equally
sodden but hed left on everything but
his coat and shoes there hadnt been
any time by then i guess

  he said now get something around
him and then the three of us better get
back to the house fast and kill the first
bottle we find

  there was light coming from some-
where behind us through some fir trees
that bordered the little lake it played
up the little pier by it i could see my
own outer clothes neatly piled at the very
lip of it

  there was a paper on top of them
pressed down by one of my oxfords cliff
picked it up and brought it over and read
it to us

     im wanted for the murder of those
  two people at the fleming house
  theyre bound to get me sooner or
  later and i have no chance i see no
  other way but this

                   vincent hardy

  it was in my own handwriting the light
was strong enough for me to see that

when he showed it to me i was silent

  he looked at waggoner and said do
we need this

  waggoner pursed his lips thoughtfully
and said i think were better off without
it these coroner-inquest guys can be
awfully dumb sometimes it might sort
of cloud their judgment

  cliff took a match from his dry coat
and struck it and held it to the note until
there wasnt any to hold any more

  i was feeling better now all but the
shivering i was sitting up i looked
back at the glow through the trees and
said whats that

  flemings car cliff answered he
tried to take a curve too fast getting away
from here when we showed up on his
tail and he turned over and kindled

  i grimaced that was about all that
could have still stirred horror in me after
the past ten days a cremation alive

  i shot him first cliff said quietly
one of us did waggoner corrected
we all three fired after him well never
know which one hit him we dont want
to anyway the machine telescoped and
we couldnt get him out and then i had
to give dodge a hand going down after
you hes no great shakes of a swimmer
we had to hit him cliff said it was
the only way of breaking the hypnosis in
time you were drowning down there
by your wn act and there was no time
to chase him and force him at gun-point
to release his control or whatever it is
they do

  we only found out about the anchor
after wed located you

  a figure was coming back toward us
from the glow which was dwindling
down now it was the deputy he said
nothing left now i wet it down all i
could to keep it from kindling the trees
lets get back to the house cliff said
the kids all goose pimples

  we went back and i got very soused on
my third of the bottle i couldnt even
seem to do that properly they let me
sleep it off there the four of us spent the
night right there where we were

in the morning cliff came in and had
a talk with me before the other two
were up i knew where i was going to
have to go with him in a little while but
i didnt mind so much any more

  i said did that help any what i did
last night did it do any good

  sure he said it was the works it
was what i wanted and had to have
what dyou suppose i was doing around
here all day yesterday before he got
back why dyou suppose i warned you
to make him stay right there in the alcove
with you and not let the conversation
drift outside

  i had it all wired up we listened in on
the whole thing the threi of us were
down in the basement taking it all down
weve got the whole thing down on
record now id emptied that gun i gave
you and i figured hed be too smart to
do anything to you right here in his own
house 

  only he got you out and into his car
too quick before we had a chance to stop
him we darned near lost you we turned
back after one false start toward the city
and a truckman told us hed glimpsed a
car in the distance tearing down the lake
road that gave us the answer

  we wouldnt have even been able to
hold your suicide against him you did
all that yourself you know even to
shackling your foot to that boat-anchor
and dropping it over ahead of you a
person who is afraid of the jump into
water but determined to go through with
it might have taken such a precaution as
that
  i had a hunch it was hypnosis the
minute you told me that candle incident
but how was i going to prove it so
much of that stuff is fake that most peo-
ple dont want to believe in it

  now ive got two other police officers
beside myself who saw-or rather heard
-the thing happened all over again

  you were in a state of hypnosis when
you committed this crime thats the
whole point you were simply the weap-
on in the actual murderers hands your
own mind wasnt functioning you had
no mind

  he stopped and looked at me does
that scare you

  does it i must have looked sick

  it wguld me too id better begin at
the beginning joel fleming used to be
a professional hypnotist in vaudeville
years ago i found enough scrapbooks
old theater programs and whatnot in
trunks here in this house to testify to
that stage name dr mephisto

  he undoubtedly possesses a gift of
hypnotic control-over certain subjects
with my wife lil for instance im
afraid hed come a complete cropper-
and wind up helping her dry dishes
he was trying to cheer me up i grinned
appreciatively

tte went on more seriously well
he got out of vaudeville years ago
while the getting out was still good and
he went into another line of business en-
tirely which doesnt need to concern us
here and he made good dough

  then he made the mistake of marry-
ing someone years younger than him a
hat-check girl he met at a nightclub

  it wasnt only that she married him
simply for his money and to be able to
quit handling peoples sweatbands at four
bits a throw she was already the sweetie
of a convict named dan ayers who was
doing time just then for embezzlement

  you get the idea dont you ayers
got out found a ready-made situation
crying to be profited by-so he profited
by it he cultivated fleming got in solid
with him he didnt have to get in solid
with dorothy he was already

  all right fleming did make these
trips to south america all but the last
time its obvious that he found out what
was going on quite some time back
somewhere between the last real trip he
made and the fake one just now

  its equally obvious that he brooded
and he planned revenge it wasnt just
a case of marital disloyalty involved ei-
ther he found out they were planning
to make off with all his available funds
and securities the next time he was away
just strip him clean and goodbye

  you notice he didnt entrust her with
the safe combination here in the house

  thats conjecture the three principals
are dead now and cant give evidence
im not trying to defend fleming but i

can see why he wanted ayers dead-and
wanted dorothy dead too

  but he picked a low lousy way of
getting it done he wasnt going to en-
danger himself no he started off for
south america dropped from sight
holed up in a rooming house in the city
under the name of burg

  then he picked an innocent kid who
had never done him any harm who had
just as much right as he had to life and
the pursuit of happiness to do his mur-
dering for him

  he tested you out saw that you were
a suitable subject and-well the rest we
got over the dictaphone last night to
give him his due he wasnt deliberately
trying to have you apprehended for the
crime either he would have been just as
satisfied if you were never caught

  but if they ever caught the man the
clues pointed to if they ever caught the
killer it would always be you not him

  true he had to drive you up there
because you dont drive it was just as
well he did from his point of view you
lost the knife only killed ayers by a
fluke in struggling with him and dorothy
would have gotten away if he hadnt been
lurking outside to lend a hand himself

  if she had lived to raise the alarm
you probably would have been nabbed
then and there before you could make a
getaway-which would have brought the
investigation back to the rooming house
too quickly to suit him so he crushed
her to death and whisked you back to
immunity

jd been thinking hard through all of
this but cliff i said how is it i
remembered the whole murder scene so
vividly the next morning especially
their faces-

  his control wasnt one hundred per-
cent effective i dont know if it ever is
the whole scene must have filtered dim-
ly through to your conscious mind and
remained in your memory the next morn-
ing after you woke up-just the way a
dream does

   and other particles that remained im-
bedded in your subconscious at first also
came out later when they reproduced
themselves in actuality i mean your
memory of the stone entrance lanterns
the cut-off the spare door key the hall
light-switch and so on

  all that stuff is way over my head
im not qualified to pass expert judgment
on it id rather not even puzzle too hard
about it it scares me myself

  why did i seem to know her when i
didnt why was i so sort of hurt heart-
broken at the sight of her face

  those were flemings thoughts not
yours filtering through your mind she
was his wife about to desert him help-
ing another man to rob him

i was sitting down on the edge of the
bed lacing my shoes that reminded me
the end

of something else it was drizzling in
town that night when i went to bed and
the streets were only starting to dry off
when i woke up the next morning

  yet the soles of my shoes were per-
fectly dry how could they be if i fol-
lowed him even across the sidewalk to
where he had a car waiting

  i remember you mentioned that to me
once before and its puzzled me too the
only possible explanation i can think of
is this-and thats another thing well
never know for sure because that point
didnt come up when he was giving him-
self away in the alcove last night

  can you remember whether you got
your shoes off easily that night when
you were undressing in your own room
or as sometimes happens with nearly
everyone did the laces get snarled so
you couldnt undo the knot of one or
both of them

  i tried to remember im not sure but
i think a snag did form in the laces of
one of them so i pulled it off the way
it was without opening it properly
and in the morning

  they both seemed all right

  thats what it was then you couldnt
undo the knot in time while you were
hurriedly getting dressed under his di-
rection you followed him out and around
to wherever the car was in your stocking
feet shoes probably shoved into the side
pockets of your coat he got the knot out
for you at his leisure in the car before
starting

  it wasnt raining up here that night
and by the time you got back to town
again the sidewalks were already starting
to dry off so your shoes stayed dry
but wouldnt my socks have gotten
wet

  they probably did but theyd dry off
again quicker tljan shoes

i was ready now waggoner and his
deputy went over ahead without wait-
ing for us i guess he figured id rather
just go alone with cliff and he wanted
to make it as easy as he could for me

  he said bring the kid over whenever
youre ready dodge

  cliff and i started over by ourselves
about half an hour later i knew id
have to go into a cell for a while but
that didnt worry me any more the shad-
ows had lifted

  when we got out in ront of the office
cliff asked are you scared kid

  i was a little like when youre going
in to have a tooth yanked or a broken
arm reset you know its got to be done
and youll feel a lot better after its over
sort of i admitted forcing a smile

  youll be all right he promised giv-
ing me a heartening grip on the shoul-
der ill be standing up right next to
you they probably wont even send it
all the way through to prosecution

  we went in together

the devil s
garden

by robert arthur

author of afternoon of a
faun postmarked for
paradise etc

presenting another chapter in the improbable reminiscences of mur-
chison morks-an eerie tale of hindu revenge

tn calcutta i saw the most
i amazing sight said i henderson
l the stout paint manufacturer who
is a member of our club he had just re-
turned from a world cruise and was
telling about it in detail i saw a hindu
fakir naked except for a loin cloth ly-
ing on a bed of sharpened nails with a
fifty-pound rock on his chest and never
even murmuring he-

  in bombay a melancholy voice in-
terrupted him i saw a sight much
stranger than that

  henderson turned a little purple it
was morks who had interrupted mur-
chison morks his full name is and it is
always he who interrupts it is quite
impossible for anyone else to narrate an
experience when morks is around for
morks invariably has done something
more exciting or dangerous along the
same lines

  i was technically responsible for
morks for it was i who had given him
the guest card to our club but i was
hardened by now to receiving black
looks for that error in judgment there
were even times when i took a perverse
pleasure in inviting morks to the club
for luncheon and a drink in the hopes
someone would say something that
would start him off

  morks cost me quite a bit one way
and another for he is not a man to pay
for his own meals or his own drinks
but i have a way of recouping i take
down the tales he occasionally tells and
when they are not too improbable sell
them in the end though ive never


made a careful check i believe that
morks annoying though he is returns
me a profit

  now he had gotten started i knew it
would be impossible to head him off
until he had told whatever tale was
forming in his memory-or his imagina-
tion but henderson tried valiantly

  this fakir i say he went on raising
his voice was lying on needle-sharp
nails with this rock on his chest then
two assistants got up on the rock and
began to jump up and down

  the fakir that i saw in bombay
murchison morks interposed in his voice
a note of quiet insistence like the drip-
ping of a leaky faucet was sitting in a
little garden surrounded by toads
snakes lizards rats and filth indescrib-
able from time to time he took a long
sharp pin and stuck it completely
through his hand his foot his arm his
leg deep into the flesh of his thigh and
other portions of his anatomy

  every time he did it he laughed
and every time he laughed i saw an-
other man a friend of mine wince with
pain as if the pin had gone into him
instead

  and then henderson said loudly
just when i thought nothing more
could-

  i learned later-morks voice had a
carrying quality that beat down hender-
sons words as if they were the pipings
of a child-that this filthy old man
never stirring out of his garden of muck
or from among his nest of snakes and
rodents and other horrible crawling

creatures had killed at least three men
-white men i mean-just as he meant
to kill my friend by sticking pins into
himself pouring slime upon himself
and by stroking fondling and otherwise
touching his dreadful pets

  henderson let out a deep breath his
face was furious but he saw it was no
use morks had gotten the attention of
all the club members within earshot
when he was sure of that he let himself
sink into a large well-padded chair ab-
sently picked up a drink that had been
left there for someone else and surveyed
us his long solemn face sober

  but i know you wont believe me
unless i tell you the whole story he
murmured deprecatingly so-

the story does not start in bombay
though morks began at least my
part of it doesnt and im only going to
tell you the part i know about for my-
self since that is the only one i can
vouch for as being completely and un-
questionably true

  my share of the story begins half
around the world from india in the
quiet peaceful atmosphere of surrey
england where i was visiting an old
friend of mine john paget recently
succeeded to the title of earl of quim-
berly and engaged to lucy horrocks
one of the loveliest girls ever to have an
income of twenty thousand a year in her
own name

  being in london i had dropped down
to see jack paget for just a weekend
but finding him nervous and distraught

the ancient fakir tabbed again
and my friend flinched with- pain
not at all his old self i determined to
remain until i could discover what was
wrong for that something was was
evident

  it was several years since i had seen
jack on the occasion of our last meet-
ing he had been a bronzed powerful
young fellow a little over tense perhaps
but as fine a specimen as england was
ever likely to turn out

 nowf just when he should have been
bubbling over with happiness at the
prospect of marrying lucy and restoring
the family estates to their old glory he
was pale and wan jumpy as a nervous
old woman his eyes sunken and haunted
he was given too to starting unexpect-
edly and violently-a gesture he tried
to check but never could

  it was only after an incident happen-
ing on the third day of my visit that he
broke down and told me what lay behind
the change that had come over him

 we were having a spot of tea in the
library of ancient quimberly hall and
jack was adding a dash of soda to
mine when his hand jerked he dropped
the siphon and involuntarily he clapped
his wrist to his mouth

  then pale and shaking he tried to
murmur something about nerves but i
knew better i made him hold out his
hand there was a tiny puncture on
his wrist from which a drop of blood
was oozing exactly as if a pin had
jabbed him an invisible pin wielded by
unseen hands

  and looking closely i saw half a dozen
marks that represented similar pricks
healed or healing

  for one wild instant i suspected him
of having become a dope fiend but
common sense quickly told me whatever
was wrong with jack it was not that
for he had actually been squirting the
soda into my glass when the pin prick-
if that was what it was-occurred and
there had been nothing to cause it noth-
ing whatever

 sheepishly when he saw that i had
noticed the other marks paget showed
me his left hand it was marked in the
same way

 im covered with them from head to
foot he told me then huskily the look
in his eyes that of a hunted animal ive
been to a doctor harley street chap
told him about it he thought i was
dotty i could tell by his face thought
i was one of these fellows who stick
things in themselves for the fun of it
listened to me with a straight face and
then gave me some nerve tonic nerve
tonic

  he laughed bitterly

  as if i was imagining-these

well to shorten the story i dragged
all the facts out of jack without
more nonsense they were scanty
enough it seemed that he had gotten

back from india only about six months
before when his uncle died leaving the
title to him he had been working in
bombay in a bank hed chucked the
job up to come back and be earl of
quimberly and this-well this thing
that was happening to him had begun
the day he stepped off the boat

  since then day and night he had suf-
fered at unexpected moments from these
pin pricks-these invisible unseen pin
pricks coming any place without any
warning whatever real pin pricks that
drew blood like the one i had seen
and hurt naturally

  but its not that jack told me his
face drawn i mean being stuck by a
pin isnt pleasant but it doesnt hurt
that much if you told me i was going
to have one jabbed into me a dozen times
a day at regular intervals i wouldnt
mind it so much not fun of course but
a man could stand it it-its the never
knowing

  his lips twitched and his eyes were
appealing

  i mean aside from never daring tell
anybody yure being stuck with pins
that dont exist by some force that cant
be seen-and the wondering what it is
thats after you of course-aside from
that its the uncertainty

  i get up i eat i tend to business i
talk to people i go to bed-and i never
know but that the next instant it is
going to happen i cant help jumping
when it does and of course people notice
and i cant explain

  all the time im tight as a spring
waiting for it eternally waiting for the
next time cant let myself go cant
forget myself cant put my mind on any-
thing else cant even talk coherently to
lucy-old horrocks is beginning to won-
der if im not a bit off cant blame him
i wonder myself

  the lord knows im not sleeping and
i cant eat and-well if it doesnt stop
soon i will be crazy thereve been times
already when i was so edgy i wanted to
jump off a high building

  he passed his hand over his forehead
and took the drink i handed him of
course i could see what he was getting
at after all when one is likely to have
an invisible pin jabbed into one any
minute of the day or night a man is
bound to get jumpy and overstrung

  and jack was getting worse i could
see unless i was able to help something
desperate might happev that remark
about wanting to jump off a high build-
ing wasnt like jack not in the slightest
but i confess i was baffled i didnt begin
to understand until jacks next remark

it a nd the queer thing he said hav-

   ing finished off the drink morks
did likewise is that every time it hap-
pens a picture comes into my mind a
beastly sickening picture id give a lot

to be able to forget completely but i
cant it keeps coming back and every
pin prick recalls it to me

  its a picture of an old moslem fakir
i saw in bombay just the day i was sail-
ing for home i was wandering around
in the native section looking for a pres-
ent for lucy when i got somehow into
a little alley that led into a kind of
square where a low wall marked off a
garden

  at least i suppose you could call it a
garden plants grew in it-sickly vicious
looking plants that had their roots in
slime and muck inches deep the stench
was enough to gag a man and even the
natives who used the alley went by
quickly with their noses up and they
werent the fastidious kind those natives

  but worst of all was the chap sitting
in the middle of the garden on a low
rock a fakir he was i suppose making
his living by begging anyway he had
a brass bowl and i noticed that the na-
tives who passed even if they did hurry
never missed tossing something into the
bowl

  but i didnt see the bowl at first be-
cause although it turned my stomach to
look at him i couldnt take my eyes off
this beggar in the middle of his diabolical
garden he was a wizened old scarecrow
wrinkled like a wadded up glove his
eyes were just gleams of blackness be-
hind half slitted lids he was quite bald
and wore nothing but a rag around his
middle

  and in the garden with him he had
-pets rats lizards snakes toads
all of them crawling and writhing and
hopping around in the muck and slime
that surrounded him

  from time to time he would reach out
and pick up one of the rats or a snake
or a toad and fondle it sometimes hed
stick out a bare foot and let it rest on
the wriggling back of a serpent or on
the warty wet cold skin of a toad oc-
casionally hed pick up one of the cobras
and let it wriggle across his thighs or his
stomach or one of the rats would scam-
per over his legs

  when he wasnt doing that he was
paddling his hands and feet around in
the muck about him splashing it onto his
body and letting it harden there to add
another layer to a crust that must have
been inches thick

  but his final trick and the one that
was too much for me was to take pins
and stick them into himself-into his
arms his legs his hands his feet his
thighs and laughing when he did it
grinning at me with toothless gums ex-
posed

  of course ive seen fakirs drive pins
and needles into themselves before who
in india hasnt but never as if they en-
joyed it never with the rare and hellish
relish this old devil seemed to get out
of it


  then while i stood there gagging but
unable to tear my gaze away the chap
lifted his bowl suggestively inviting a
contribution i was going to give him
something just to get away but i
couldnt i was too ill i tottered a little
vays off and -well i was sick

  as soon as that was over i fled for
clean air feeling his eyes jabbing irito
my back like burning glasses but i
couldnt do anything else it wasnt until
my ship was well at sea that i was able
to get the stench out of my nostrils

  and now-paget wiped his forehead
-whenever it happens there i see the
old fakir again sitting in his garden of
filth making a pin cushion out of him-
self and thats almost worse than the
being stuck part tell me morks-do
you think i am off my head

  well i told him he wasnt far from
it for the time being i contented myself
with saying that something very real and
substantial lay behind what was happen-
ing to him and i added that if he could
only stick it out a few days longer i
wanted to run up to london to have a
talk with a man i knew there who was
rather an expfirt on matters like this

  he took heart and in the morning his
chauffeur drove me  london

i didnt go to harley street though

i went to soho soho you know is
in the slums near the docks and there
in a dark little room overlooking a smelly
stretch of water i saw the man i had
in mind

  i put jacks story up to him and he
nodded as i told him my conclusions i
know the man this friend of mine said
he has killed many of white men at
least three whom i knew myself or
knew of

  one was an english lord a man of
the utmost cleanliness the slightest dis-
array of his clothing or the faintest soil-
ing of his person was unbearable he
also viewed this fakir whom your friend
saw and unfortunately failed to give
money to

  the filth of the scene nauseated him
he likewise hurried off failing to make
a contribution to the begging bowl

  he was making a cruise about the
world at that time scarcely had he
reached his ship before he began to feel
distressed he hack the sensation that
his body was unwashed as if he had not
bathed he bathed in hot water and
donned fresh clothing

  an hour later at dinner again the
feeling of being unwashed came over
him he struggled against it but in the
end could not help bathing once again
and again changing his clothes to no
avail the sense of having dirt adhering
to his body and hands even to his face
and hair persisted

  he tried to ignore it it became worse
until he was half beside himself finally
he consulted the ships doctor the doctor
suggested that he had a touch of the sun
and prescribed sedatives they helped
for a time but when the effect wore off
the sensation of being dirty returned
the unfortunate man struggled against
it as long as he could in time however
it became an obsession that quite under-
mined his self control and before the
boat docked once more in london he
threw himself overboard

  the second whom i knew he said
was an american a countryman of
yours but not fond of beggars he stum-
bled upon this same fakir and turned
aside his eyes refusing baksheesh

  a short time later he began to be
troubled in the night by sensations of
unseen creatures some soft-furred some
scaly some cold and damp running


across his legs he would wake up and
feel the scaly dryness of a snake upon
his skin or the furry body of a rat
would scamper across his chest

  i need not say there was nothing
there at any time he began to have a
horror of the night time and of the ne-
cessity for sleeping he tried sleeping by
day and still suffered in the end the
unnerving horror of forever touching
unseen and revolting creatures drove
him to madness he was killed while
trying to escape from them in an asylum

iiphe third-and my friend shrugged
his story is similar except that
he unexpectedly would feel that he had
just stepped in his bare feet into a pud-
dle of slime or had placed his hand in
one or at night as he tried to sleep
would be overcome by the sensation that
he was lying in mud and water

  he too sought relief from the doctors
and he too was told nerves in the end
he too killed himself with a revolver
your friends case is not different save
that he feels himself pricked by pins he
too will either go mad in the end or kill
himself to escape madness there is
nothing that can be done

  my friend shrugged in the fatalistic
manner of the easterner but i was not
to be discouraged so easily

  you mean theres no way to fight this
thing i asked

  my friend shook his head

  there is none it is a matter between
the man paget and the one in bombay
no one else may intervene if the man
paget were a priest or a fakir too he
could work an equal spell upon the one
in bombay and force a truce as he is
not he is doomed unless he kills that
one-which might be dangerous even
if he would do it

  jack wouldnt kill anyone i told
him vexed and he certainly isnt a
priest but im going to get him out of
this devils grip somehow by hook or
crook

  my friend refilled my glass morks
paused and waited expectantly someone
shoved a fresh glass into his hand
whereupon he continued and after i
had drained it my brain began to humm
and buzz a bit

  listen i exclaimed from what i
know of these things they arent strictly
one-way propositfons are they i mean
whats sauce for the goose is sauce for
the gander

  my friend agreed

  that is true he told me but the
holy one is immured by long years of
self control to all sensations there is
nothing that anyone could do that would
disturb him

  i wasnt so sure about that but i had
learned what i wanted and already a
scheme was forming in ray mind so i
said goodbye and hurried back to quim-
berly hall

i found jack all in a stew waiting for
me with the pathetic hopefulness of
a small boy expecting a present but
dreading he wouldnt get it i didnt
promise anything definite but intimated
that i had hopes i could help matters a
bit anyway then i ordered him into
the highest stiffest tightest stand-up
starched collar that could be procured

  the one we finally dug out was a relic
of the nineties and had a true srw-tooth
edge jack kifcked like a wild horse at
putting it on but i was adamant in the
end he wore it although i must admit
the staff of servants looked at him very
strangely and hurried out of his way
whenever he ventured out of his rooras
for a stroll

  hopefully then i waited jack suffered
of course especially since i made him
wear the collar both night and day even
to bed but he was an englishman and
he stood the ordeal well it would have
killed a man of any other nationality im
sure

  and for a time it worked there were
a few pin pricks the day he put the col-
lar on but they ceased rather abruptly
the next day there were a couple more
of a tentative nature then for several
days they ceased altogether

  i was jubilant and jack actually was
beginning to eat heartily agin when the
great disappointment came he began to
be jabbed by the invisible pins twice as
savagely as before-as if the force at
work were getting even with him for
something

  and before i had concocted another
plan he was almost out of his mind

  but i never count too much on the first
idea working and i always try to have
an alternative if it doesnt in this case
i was as resourceful as ever

  jack i asked after long thought
what kind of fakir did you say this
chap in bombay was hindu moslem
sikh buddhist

  moslem he groaned what am i
going to do morks in heavens name
what

  ill tell you what youre going to do

i asserted with decision youre going
to get packed weve got to go to india

three days later we were in bombay
the empire airways service got us
there we skimmed above thousands of
miles of sea and mountain and jungle
but i hardly noticed -t jack was too
miserable to pay much attention to
scenery either i was still making him
wear the high collar which attracted a
lot of attention from the other passen-
gers and he was worrying about the
contents of the valise he was carrying

  the valise had a pet in it a mascot i
had bought for jack in london

  youll probably be leading it around
on a leash wherever you go for a good
many years to come i told him and
so you might as well have a trained one
besides that way itll be easier to ex-
plain to lucy why you have to keep it
in the bedroom with you nights

  easier jack choked-for the collar
was tighter than ever easier to ex-
plain to lucy why-

  then he had to stop to get his breath
with that collar on he couldnt speak
more than a couple of words at a time
but it was working it had gained us a
couple of days respite again but of
course i couldnt go on indefinitely mak-
ing him wear a collar tighter and ever
tighter for eventually he would have
strangled so i was pinning a lot of hope
on this trip

  we reached bombay in mid-morning
before noon we had set out to find that
fakir squatting in his puddle of slime
surrounded by his toads and rats and
serpents

  jack still did not know why we had
come and i had not explained knowing
that his english resistance to new ideas
would have made it impossible for him
to believe me and might have made him
refuse to cooperate

  we had to search most of the after-
noon but in the end we found the fellow
by bribing a naked street boy two cents
to take us to him the boy led us there
and fled and the ancient fakir in his
nauseous garden looked up met jack
pagets eye and smiled hideously

  then he deliberately took up a long
pin and jabbed it into the flesh of his
wrist	x
  beside me jack winced and almost
dropped the valise i saw a spot of blood
ooze out on his wrist at the exact point
where the beggar had jabbed himself

  still grinning the old devil took half
a dozen more pins and one by one thrust
them into his own flesh

  and every time he did it jack winced
and jumped and the blood oozed at the
same spot on his body

tt was the old fakirs vengeance on
a him of course for failing to pay him
his baksheesh and it was horribly ef-
fective-effective and simple it was what
i had suspected when i went to my
friend in soho and though i had guessed
how it worked in general he confirmed
my guess

  i dont know the mechanics behind it
but in some way the old beggar was able
to establish a psychic twinship with any-
body he wished evil to youve all read
how when one of the two twins becomes
ill the other often gets sick too though
miles away it was something like that
except that in this instance the fakir was
able to make his victims feel exactly
what he was feeling at the moment he
put himself in contact with them

  you might say he managed to broad-
cast his own sensations and forced his
subjects to pick them up and feel them
too there was more to it of course and
thats putting it very roughly but that
gives you an idea of how the thing
worked

  so there he had been in bombay all
these months occasionally remembering
paget and getting in tune with him as he
stuck a pin into himself with the result
that jack thousands of miles away
winced and jumped and was slowly go-
ing mad until i came along

  that was how hg had operated on the
other chaps too naturally that my friend
had told me about he had intuitively
known their own special weaknesses and
had played upon them

  of course he was inured to it but
you can perhaps get the feelings of his
victims just by imagining   

  now as we faced him he was sticking
pins into himself and jack was wincing
at their thrust but as i had learned it
wasnt all one-sided if he made jack
feel what he was feeling he felt what
jack was feeling too you follow me
if jack had thrust a pin into his arm
then the old fakir would have felt it also
tit for tat only he wouldnt have
minded and jack did

  now you begin to see why i made jack
wear the high collar if there is anything
civilization has perfected more uncom-
fortable than a high starched collar with
a sawtooth edge i dont know what it is
and if anything could make the hideous
old beggar stop and think twice i rea-
soned it would be the sensation of wear-
ing a high collar much too tight that
he would get from jack every time he
set out to torment him

  well as you know it had worked for
a while now every time he stuck him-
self the old fakirs eyes popped out a
little and the smile he wore faded as if
he was being half-strangled by an un-
seen collar about his scrawny throat
but he was game he could take punish-
ment he was used to being uncomfort-
able and he would last a lot longer than
jack could

so now before jack had more than
realized what was happening i played
our trump card open the valise jack
i ordered coolly take elsie up in your
arms and pet her

  elsie was the mascot i had bought in
london jack obeyed mechanically he
opened the valise and lifted elsie out
elsie was white and clean and very cute
sha was highly trained and could walk
on her hind legs spell out her name
and turn somersaults i had become
much attached to her but for some rea-
son jack couldnt seem to share my
fondness however he obeyed orders
he held elsie tightly in his arms and
stroked her

  and then i knew we had won that
old beggar stopped abruptly in the very
act of driving home a pin into his thigh

he shuddered and flung out his arms

he paddled his hands frantically in the
muck as if to remove the sensation he
was getting from jack of stroking elsie

  he gagged and gobbled something to
himself and then fell over backward
getting off his rock he gurgled some-
thing frightful at us and i leaned over
the low fence that held his toads and
snakes penned in

  see i asked and remember if
theres any more monkey business my
friend is simply going to pick her up
and pet her and youll feel her every
time you try to torment him with your
infernal pins youll feel her

  i dont know if the old wretch under-
stood or not but howling he dashed into
his hut-the first time in twenty years
hed gone inside i heard later and
carrying elsie jack marched off with me
in triumph nor was he ever bothered
again by those invisible pins i can in-
form you

  although otherwise there was one
little hitch lucy horrocks broke off
their engagement and he finally married
a nice little girl from somewhere in
sussex who didnt object so strenuously
to the idea of elsie going every place
with them on leash as well as sharing
their bedroom nights

         

  morks finished looked about him with
a searching eye silence followed the
conclusion of his tale-a silence that
hendersons voice broke brutally

  and just what was this elsie whose
touch even at second hand gave the old
fakir such a case of jitters he de-
manded in a grating tone thats some-
thing youve neglected to tell us

  oh have i morks asked innocently
well of course i thought youd guessed
you see the old fakir was a moslem
very strict and devout and though rats
and snakes were all right with him elsie
was quite another story elsie was a
very pretty little-at least i thought so-
trained pig

  did i hear someone suggest another

  the night before the asafrics cap-
tured new york completing their con-
quest of the western hemisphere and
thus of the entire occidental world an
attempt was made to evacuate several
thousand children from the doomed city

  the motorcade was discovered by a
yellow airman who in the report dis-
covered by the writer among the charred
archives unearthed beneath the ruins of
the empire state building claimed to
have entirely destroyed it by machine-
gun fire and a fpw judicious bombs

  he was mistaken however in that one
truck of the hundreds escaped among its
load of children between the ages of four
and eight was a youngster then known
as richard or dick carr the very in-
dividual celebrated in legend as dikar

  the aged couple who were the only
adults with the group contrived some-
how to bring the children unobserved to
an uninhabited mountain deep within the
forested recreation area that at the time
stretched for some miles along the west
bank of the hudson no more ideal sanc-
tuary than this height could have been
found

  not only did thick woods screen its


surface from aerial reconnaissance but
quarrying operations had ringed its base
with a precipitous cliff so that the only
practicable approach was by a narrow
viaduct of rock that the stoneworkers had
left for their trucks

  barely however ha the party begun
to orient itself when an asafric platoon
appeared on the plain below with the
evident intention of scouting the moun-
tain in this desperate emergency the
two old people blew up the narrow ramp
heretofore mentioned burying under
tons of riven boulders the green-uni-
formed soldiers-and themselves

  the children afterward to be known as
the bunch were now completely iso-
lated from an inimical world as to how
they survived the primitive environment
in which they found themselves we can
only guess survive they did for a dozen
years later we find a band of youths
bronzed half-naked and armed with
only bows and arrows descending on an
asafric motorized column to snatch from
his chains the man called norman fen-
ton

ris amazing foray is conceded to have
been the first skirmish of the great
uprising but it was the capture of the
asafric stronghold at west point for
which general fentons memoirs give
full credit to dikar and his bunch that
set ablaze the fires of rebellion through-

out a heretofore cowed american nation

  in preceding chapters we have seen
how a ragtag and bobtail mob rallied
around norman fenton at west point
how the second continental congress
came into being here and elected fenton
president and commander-in-chief of
the armies of liberation how here was
evolved the brilliant strategy with which
viceroy yee hashamoto found it so diffi-
cult to cope

  the reader doubtlessly recalls the es-
sential elements of these tactics the
feinted raid on some sparsely garrisoned
outpost the real assault on the strong-
hold weakened by the dispatch of rein-
forcements to the point first threatened
the looting of the fortress of its guns
ammunition all its portable munitions
the americans swift dispersal before the
asafric planes and tanks could return to
annihilate them

  they split up into roving groups well
armed now and ferocious as only men
can be who bear on their backs the
scars of cruel whips in their hearts the
memory of homes in flames

  all across the continent these guerilla
bands harassed hashamotos far-flung
thin lines they ambushed and slew the
small detachments through which he had
maintained his subjection of his white
slaves

it is apparent how well dikar and his
brothers were fitted for such a cam-
paign silent brown shadows never more
than half-steen they stalked men now in-
stead of deer and all the woodcraft they
had learned on theirs mountain their
tireless endurance even their naive ig-
norance of fear came to their aid in their
new pursuit

  is it any wonder that about the hidden
campfires the tales of their prowess
should grow to sagas of supernatural
feats is it remarkable that it should be
whispered that they were not flesh and
blood at all but risen out of long-for-
gotten graves the same lean-flanked
forest rangers who once seized ticon-
deroga from the scarlet-garbed mercen-
aries of an earlier oppressor

prom the writings of walt bennet
- fentons devoted aide we learn how
tremendously the growing myth bolstered
the patriots morale but it does not ap-
pear that during that first memorable
winter the bunch otherwise greatly in-
fluenced the course of the uprising to
which they had given its great leader

  by the beginning of spring the asa-
frics while still nominally in command
of the entire country had for all practical
purposes been compelled to relinquish
their hold on vast stretches of territory

  save for the fortified strongholds to
which they had retreated they had vir-
tually abandoned the great central plain
north of the panhandle of texas from
the rockies to the missouri-iowa-min-
nesota border east of the mississippi
they had fared somewhat better but a
map colored black where hashamoto was
still in full control would have shown
two enormous patches of lighter hue

  the larger of these had spread north-
ward from the americans first foothold
at west point to include virtually all
new england south to georgia new
york city itself remained the asafric
headquarters and a hundred-mile wide
strip all along the seacoast lay under the
shadow of their fleets big guns but the
americans commanded the central half of
pennsylvania and piedmont virginia and
the carolinas to the western slope of the
blue ridge range

  on the other side of the appalachians
fentons forces iad retrieved the south-
ern three-quarters of indiana ken-
tucky and tennessee as far east as the
cumberland river

  these latter two liberated regions ap-
proached each other most nearly in the
neighborhood of the great smokies and
the strip separating them contained
norris dam and other works at the head
of the tennessee valley development

  if general fenton could close this gap
not only would he cut in half the asa-
fric army of the east but he would be
enabled to shut off the supply of electric
energy to the industries of the deep
south this in the last week of april
he moved to attempt

  but viceroy yee hashamoto was fully
aware of the strategic importance of this
region and he held the mile-high
smokies in force   

chapter i

world of thunder

since the day when the asafric
planes first came into the sky over
wespoint dikar had heard their
thunder many times many times he had
heard the black eggs scream earthward
out of the planes opening bellies heard
the eggs burst in terrible sound

  but this was something even more ter-
rible-a noise too great to hear dikar
felt it rather like an enormous hammer
that never lifted but only got heavier
and lighter and heavier again as it
pounded him into the ground on which
he lay face down

  the thunder was a hammer pounding
him and a hammer somehow inside of
him pounding outward against tlje walls
of his body till it seemed his body must
burst like a bomb

  outside him and inside him was the
thunder and dikar was a part of the
thunder the thunder a part of dikar
dikar was one with the thunder one
with its terror

  yet one thought remained with him
in spite of the hammers beating his body

and his brain-the thought that some
where near him lay marilee

  he had caught her up in his arms
when the sky suddenly darkened with
the black planes and hed half-jumped
half-fallen into this gully she had pulled
from his arms to lie beside him as the
thunder of the asafric guns pounded
down on them from the smoking tops of
the mountains

  was marilee still here beside him or
had some bit of flying iron some sharp
arrow of splintered wood taken her from
him forever

  dikar got hands under his great chest
the muscles of his broad shoulders
tightened the muscles in his arms
bulged his arms quivered straightened
lifted the weight on his shoulders he
raised his face from the red earth and
he looked to where marilee should be

  dikar saw nothing but green brush
green leaves beaten down as no storm
had ever beat down the brush on the
mountain he stared a huge fear rising
in him and then he gave a choked cry
for now he saw a white sarong that
clung to the graceful young body of a
girl he saw an arm a shoulder rounded
silken-skinned in the hollow of a be-
loved throat he saw a pulse fluttering

  some gust of sound brushed aside a
spray of quivering leaves and dikar saw
the firm little chin the delicate oval of
marilees face

vsithin the shadow of their long
 lashes marilees gray eyes were big
with terror they saw dikar and into
them came a sudden smile

  a beam of sun was somehow in the
thunder-shaking gully it made little
glints of red in the rippling cascade of
brown and shining hair on which marilee
lay as on a bed it made a shining in
dikars blue eyes and now the thunder
that beat at dikar was noise only no
longer terror

  dikar smiled at marilee and he came
up on his knees and looked over and past
marilee for the boys and the girls he
had led so far from their mountain

  the gully was narrow and its side

      only one man in the world knows the secret

      of sen-sen behind closed doors he blends its
      precious ingredients and some people feel
      theres magic in its making

       certain it is that sen-sen sweetens your breath
       and thrills you with its unusual haunting flavor
       but some say it does more    gives men and
       girls who use it a special fascination

     try it yourself sen-sen is potent yet
     pleasing sold everywhere in five and ten
     cent packages


 steep and it was filled by a tangle of
 bushes with long thick leaves and great
 purple and white flowers like none dikar
 had ever seen before peering into that
 thunder-tossed tangle dikar saw a little
 white bundle of fur a long-eared rabbit
 crouched flat to the ground its eyes
 glazed with terror it crouched there
 right next to franksmith and did not
 fear him

   franksmiths arm was flung out to one
 side and his hand clasped tight the hand
 of a black-haired girl bessalton boss
 of the girls the sight of that brought a
 sudden warmth to dikars heart al-
 though most of the older girls of the
 bunch had found themselves mates
 bessalton had walked alone since tom-
 ball had died and it was good that she
 would be alone no longer

   past those two were more of the bunch
 flat to the ground but even dikars sharp
 eyes could hardly make them out

   the girls of the bunch in their white
 sarongs were a little easier to see than
 the boys who wore dappled fawn-skins
 that melted them into the shadows all
 of them lay very still the way theyd
 fallen when they jumped into the gully
 as still as the rabbit there by frank-
 smith

   the creatures of the woods lie very
 still when there is a danger tod strong
 for them to fight and too swift for them
 to run from this was a thing the boys
 and the girls had learned from the ani-
 mals arid the birds

  the gully was narrow and deep and
 just as the leaf-roof of the mountains
 wcods had hidden the bunch from the
 asafric planes its thick brush tangle
 might hide them here dikar looked up
 to make sure that the green tangle was
 thick enough overhead-and his breath
 caught in his throat

  there was no hiding roof over him
 the wind of the thunder had stripped
 the leaves and the great purple flowers
 from the branches of the brush and was
 stripping the very bark from the bran-
 ches dikar could look right through
 what had been a safe covert he could
 see clods of earth flying over the gully
 on the breast of the thunder-wind and
 bits of wood that had been trees and
 there were flying red fragments that
 could be human flesh

 not only the bunch had been caught
 here when the black planes came
 into the sky and the guns started to
 thunder from the mountain-tops hun-
 dreds of other americans had moved
 down into this valley from far away
 they had marched by night slept by day
 to gather here in answer to the orders
 general normanfenton had sent out over
 the secret net

  never before had so many americans
 marched together an army dikars
 friend walt had called them never be-
 fore had an army of americans moved
 so far so slowly and this had worried
 dikar worried him all the more because
 till today the asafrics had made not the
 least try to stop them

  yesterday walt had laughed when
dikar told him about his worry and
begged him to tell normanfenton to be
careful

   hashamoto has no idea of what were
   up to walt had said all the shenan-
   doah valley down which we have come
   and this northwest corner of north caro-
   lina was swept clear of his blacks a
   month ago and no white man or woman
   would betray us

   we have one more night to march my
   boy and one more day to sleep tomor-
   row night well surprise the asafrics in
   their mountain stronghold while our
   

 friends in tennessee storm the cumber-
 land gap from the otherby sunrise two
 days from now the smokies will be
 ours

  the smokies dikar had repeated
 look walt had pointed and dikar
 had seen that what hed thought a blue
 cloud low in the sky was really an up-
 tossing of the earth such as hed never
 seen before mountains walt had an-
 swered the question in dikars face so
 high that you could put your mountain
 on top of one like itself and another on
 top of those and still not have them as
 high as the lowest of those theyre so
 high that theres always mist about their
 summits and thats why the indians
 called them the smoking mountains

  a shadow had darkened walts face
 general fenton was telling me only
 last night how when he was very young
 he heard over the radio franklin roose-
 velts speech dedicating a great national
 park there to the enjoyment and pleas-
 ure of our people for all time

   for all time he had repeated bitter-
 ly and then had said up there is an
 asafric army dikar but its officers dont
 know were anywhere within hundreds
 of miles of them

   hed been so sure of that it had been
 no use for dikar to tell him about the
 tracks hed seen in soft grouiid of feet
 turned in at the toes the way the feet of
 the blacks turn in it had been no use
 for dikar to tell him how the breeze had
 brought him now and again in the past
 week the smell of blacks very near
 walt had been sure everything was all
 right and walt was lots smarter than
 dikar hadnt normanfenton picked walt
 to be always close to him

   so the army had marched all last night
 this morning before the sun rose they
 had found sleeping places in barns and
 houses under bushes in woods like this
 one where the bunch had slept almost
 as good as the bunch at hiding them-
 selves were the other americans they
 had learned to be this last winter

  but dikar lying by marilee on a
 sweet-smelling bed of ferns had not
 slept through the boughs of the tree
 over him hed watched the sky grow
 pale with the coming dawn hed seen
 the red blush of sunrise touch the tops
 of the mountains close now and so high
 his breath was taken away looking up
 and up hed seen the brightness spread
 up there

  and he had seen a black speck come
 into the sky from behind those mountain
 tops and another and another while a
 distant low tlmnder of planes growled in
 his ears before he could cry out there
 had been a bright flash from the moun-
 tain top and with that the first black
 egg had dropped screaming from the
 belly of the first black bird-

   a burst of flame swept over dikars
 head blinding him the gully side
 heaved its green was cracked with
 earthy redness it was all red earth and
 it was falling down upon him

  marilee her name burst from his
 throat in a great shout he himself could
 not hear and dikar threw himself across
 his mate just as the earth came down
 and buried them both

chapter ii

the boss and the bunch

   the blackness was a solid thing against
   dikars down-bent face on dikars
   back was a terrible weight of dark earth
   so that his straddled thighs his thrust-
   down aching arms shook

   dikars chest heaved desperately pull-
   ing in dank air out of the black space

 that was roofed by his back walled by
 his arms his thighs and the earth crush-
 ing against his sides

  dikar fromjthe black space out of
 which dikars failing strength still held
 the earth came marilees cry dikar
 where are you

  here hard to talk as to breathe
 right above you yoi-all right

  ah right dikar my legs-i cant
 move my legs but-but i think thats be-
 cause of the dirt on em oh dikar a
 sob caught at her voice what are we
 goin to do

  do how long could he hold up this
 awful weight on his back hold it from
 crushing marilee get out of this
 but how was he to get marilee out of this
 living grave	-

   its movin dikar the dirts comin in
 over me

   just settlin marilee im holdin it

  if i could only see you dikar if i
 could only feel your arms around me
 only once more

  only once more she knew hed lied
 im holdin it he lied again because he
 could not think what else to say the
 earth was alive with movement alive
 with its blind will to crush them dikar
 could hear the soft dreadful rub of the
 earth as it moved in under him

  where it moved marilee was talking
 but not to dikar now i lay me down to
 sleep she was saying the now-i-lay-
 me the old ones taught the bunch to
 say each night when bedtime came i
 pray the lord my soul to keep an if i
 die before i wake-

  no dikar groaned into the dark
 no marilee youre not goin-to die
 but the terrible weight of earth was
 growing it was pressing the strength out
 of his arms and back

  quick dikar its comin over my
 face it was sliding in under his belly
 quick before-

  marilees voice choked off dikars
 arms let him down dikars arms found
 marilees warm body earth following
 down crushed dikars body to marilees
 somehowhis lips found hers

  all of a sudden the thunder was loud
 in dikars ears again and he could
 breathe dikar a near voice jabbered
 dikar man dikars head flung back
 and he blinked earth from his eyes as
 the voice cried dikar old fellah
 there was light in dikars eyes again and
 upside down in the light was a hollow-
 cheeked earth-smudged face he knew
 the face of walt his friend

  thank god walt gasped his hands
 scraping earth away from around dikar
 thank god youre alive when i saw
 the bank cave in on you-

  dikar heaved up and was on his knees
 and his tight-clenched arms brought
 marilee up out of the red earth she
 clung to him and he could feel her quick
 breathing

 walt was still jabbering and now
 there were hurrays around them
 dikar saw that it was franksmith hur-
 raying and bessalton and pimply-faced
 carlberger and there were others of the
 bunch here too and they were all red
 with earth their hands red and shape-
 less with earth

   it fell on us too franksmith burst
 out but not deep and when we shoved
 up out we saw walt here diggin with his
 hands so we came an helped him

  dikar wondered that he could hear
  them all so plain in spite of the thunder
  and then it came to him that the thunder
  was much less loud than it had been be-
  fore he looked up into the sky there
  were no planes in it now

private notes
frommrsm--s
diary

answered dikars look and theyll have
to fly so far back to get more that theyll
hardly be able to return before night-
fall but the guns are still at it
bessalton and alicekane took marilee
from dikars arms and started to clean
the earth from her walt dikar went
cold all over with a sudden thought
whyre you here is normanfenton-
the presidents in a deep cave up
ahead i took him there walts gray-
blue uniform from the stores theyd
found at wespoint hung in rags about
him what you said yesterday had me
jittery there was stiff hair on his face
and the hair on his head was clotted

  he looked almost the way hed looked
when dikar first found him a starved
beast-man in the woods below the
mountain you were right dikar the
asafrics laid a trap for us and we
marched the army right into it

  the army walt all killed

  many too many but according to
the reports ive been gathering not near-
ly as many as we thought at first our
men dispersed as soon as it began found
gullies like this one caves other shelter
even those who could not find better
cover than the woods were so scattered
that each bomb or shell caught only two
or three

  weve lost only about six or seven
hundred men that still leaves us nearly
five thousand effectives but we can no
longer count on surprising the asafrics
so a frontal assault on those natural ram-
parts cannot possibly succeed

  dikar didnt understand all walts
words but he knew what he meant
then weve given up were licked
not quite the back of walts hand
scraped at the stiff hair on his chin
theres still one slim chance thats
why fenton sent me through that hell-
fire to look for you

  why for me

  because if anyone can make good that
chance its you and your bunch look
walt pointed up and up to where dikar
had seen the guns flash this morning
you see that fold in the mountains right
there

  yes the flashes were still there
bright against the dark green of the high
woods and the thunder of the guns still
rolled down from there sure i do
thats newfound gap the highest
point on the highway that goes over these
mountains when the smokies were
made a national park the engineers built
a wide level place there where hun-
dreds of cars could park while their pas-
sengers looked over the view

  the asafrics have emplaced their
biggest guns there monsters with a fifty-

mile range commanding not only all this
valley but the whole length of the high-
way up which wed planned to steal to-
night to make our surprise attack

  i know dikar broke in but now
the asafrics will be watchin for us an
kill us all if we try it

ifcxactly they have the range of
 every-inch of it on the other hand
if we can capture those guns we can still
snatch victory from defeat you see
dikar we could swing them around and
shell the enemy out of the reaches be-
tween the smokies and the cumberland
plateau that would make it possible for
our army of the tennessee to break
through join up with us and clean up the
rest of the enemy forces in the moun-
tains

  howre we goin to capture those guns
if we cant get up to em

  look there to the left dikars eyes
went along the line of soaring dark
green peaks up from which drifted a
blue-gray haze like smoke from hidden
fires there thats clingmans dome
so high was the mountain walt pointed
to that far above a cloud blanked out
its middle half and its top seemed a mon-
strous impossible island floating in the
sky

  it rises a thousand feet above new-
found gap walt was saying and there
is another battery emplaced there of
automatic air-craft guns like the archy
you fired from the roof when we cap-
tured west point theyre toys com-
pared to the ones at the gap but theyre
placed just right to annihilate the crews
of the big ones

  a chill prickle ran up and down di-
kars backbone but he only said very
quiet all right walt well go up
there an-

  wait walts voice was sharp wait
till i finish dikar had a queer feeling
that his friend didnt want him to go up
there with the bunch general fenton
wants you to understand exactly what
the job means 

  i dont care-

  listen dikar marilees clear sweet
voice- interrupted listen to what walt
has to say she was standing close to
them and the others of the bunch were
gathered around the boys eyes were
shining and eager but the girls eyes
watching walt were shadowed

  a ridge along which runs an auto-
mobile road connects newfoufid gap to
the north-east of it with clingmans
dome its eastern slope the one toward
us and the southern are comparatively
gentle and easy to climb and so are cer-
tainly carefully watched the domes

western side however is a steep cliff al-
most as unscalable as that around the
base of your mountain-

  and you think they wont be watchin
that side but theyd be crazy not to if
they know were around

  if they know our army is in the vi-
cinity theyll certainly be on the alert
but suppose we pretend to withdraw
suppose now that the planes have left
we send numbers of men to expose
themselves on roads visible from the
mountain-tops apparently fleeing from
the valley-

  the asafrics will think theres lots
more runnin away in the woods where
they cant see em an theyll get a little
careless-

  exactly if the ruse should succeed it
might barely be possible for a little band
of men to reach the summit of cling-
mans dome unobserved under cover of
the night

  might be dikar walt repeated but
if you try it you will be climbing in
darkness along ledges so narrow that
they will barely give you foothold ledges
clinging to the side of precipices that
slant outward to push you off

  above you will be blacks and their
hearing is as keen as an animals an
exclamation the clink of metal against
rock even a stone dislodged would warn
them of your approach if youre shot
at and only wounded if you make a
single misstep you will fall three thou-
sand feet or more into what they call
hereabouts a rhododendron hell a
tangled and trackless thicket

  walt pulled in breath put a hand on
dikars arm the chances are a thou-
sand to one against your ever reaching
the top my boy and even if you do the
odds are almost as great that youll die
up there

  again he stopped talking for a moment
lines cutting deep into his gaunt cheeks
thats why general fenton will not
order you to make the try but has sent
me only to ask if you will

taikar looked up again at the misty
island in the sky looked down at
walt the sun was warm on his skin
the smells of the woods were warm in
his nostrils and he knew in that moment
how good life was

  he said slowly you know what my
answer would be if i had to answer only
for myself but this is somethin you ask
of the bunch the boys to climb up there
an the girls to wait here below won-
derin what is happenin to us up there in
the dark and so i cannot answer but
only the bunch can answer in council
dikar saw in marilees eyes that what


he was saying was the right thing to say
he wet his lips and said a little louder
i call a council right here an now i
call a council of the bunch

  walt pushed back out of the crowd
and the bunch crowded in close dikar
looked around him at the boys and girls
whom the old ones had made him boss
of a long time ago he thought of all
their years on the mountain and how
happy their life on the mountain had
been and how hed led them down off
the mountain because of his dream that
in them was the hope of a new tomorrow
for america

  in that moment between breath and
breath dikar thought of all the councils
he had called on the mountain and all
the councils hed called in the far land
after hed led the bunch down off the
mountain this was the strangest coun-
cil hed ever called here on this torn red
earth with the thunder of the asafric
guns rolling overhead the asafric shells
bursting all around

  and then dikar had taken his breath
and was talking again you have all
heard walt you know what it is we are
asked to do you know what it means to
america if we can do it an you know
what it means to us if we fail what an-
swer do we give walt to take back to the
president of america

  what answer could we give john-
stone black-haired black-bearded came
back at once we do it of course what
say boys am i right

  right yelled carlberger and pat-
mara and hook-nosed abestein right
yelled the boys every one of them and
then franksmith thin and tall and red-
bearded was saying settled dikar we
do it and you knew all the time thats
what wed say

  dikar saw bessaltons hand start out
to catch hold of franksmith and then
pull back inside her cloak of black hair
and he saw the look that had come into
bessaltons eyes yes franksmith
dikar said i knew what you boys
would say but the girls have full voice
in the council of the bunch an i have
not heard from em what do the girls
say bessalton

  bessaltons hair was black as night in
the deep woods but her face was white
as new snow with the sun on it her lips
were gray as they moved and no sound
came from them and then words came
from them

  the girls say there is only one an-
swer to what is asked dikar the girls
say that it must be done

  and the jaces of all the girls were
white and drawn their eyes dark with
agony but not one girl spoke up to say
that bessalton did not talk for her

chapter iii

climb to jeopardy

dikar held tight to a knob of rock
just over his head his weight was
all on the ball of his right foot clinging
to a two-inch shelf of rock his left leg
swung free over emptiness

  if dikar looked down he would see the
night-filled emptiness fall away from
him down and down to a black sough of
wind in trees and brush if dikar looked
down he would let go he would follcy
his look down into the black depths

  the muscles of his neck tightened to
keep his head from turning to look
down all his strength was in his neck
and there was no strength in him to move
his left leg which swung back and out
over the awful depths

  for an endless time dikar hung like
that between the depths and the over-


hang of the terrible cliff above him

  there was no moon but when dikar
had climbed up out of the brush tangle
that was so terribly far below now when
hed climbed up above the black whisper
of wind in the treetops starlight had
glimmered on the face of the high sheer
cliff just enough light there had been
for dikar climbing first to find a ledge
a slope of earth ledge again and slope of
broken rotted bits of stone

  slowly painfully dikar had led the
boys up the western face of clingmans
dome ledge and slope ledge and slope
again they had climbed starlight laying
their shadows black on the glimmering
rock slowly theyd climbed hardly
daring to breathe almost not daring to
move lest the next reach of hand or foot
send some little stone rattling down the
mountainside and give them away to the
asafrics above

  death waiting above death waiting be-
low dikar had led the boys up until this
last ledge suddenly had narrowed to give
hold only to the balls of his feet and
then had melted into an out-thrust of
rock like a rounded wall corner

  dikar could see nothing beyond the
outthrust of rock above him the cliff
slanted outward as if to push him off
and there was no foothold on it only the
one little knob which his right hand
clutched there was no way to go but
back

  before dikar could get the boys back
to where there was a choice of path the
dawn would be here to show them to the
asafrics to go back was to give up

  holding on to the knob of rock dikar
groped with his left hand along the rocky
outthrust around its bulge and he found
a tiny crack into which his fingernails
could catch pulling in breath dikar
swung his left leg back off the two-inch
ledge to get it around the bulge

  in that moment the pull of the black
depths took hold of dikar and his
strength ran out of him he hung against
the side of the cliff and along the ledge
beyond him the boys waited unable to
help him

the cold of the high places lay icy
against dikars skin to make the
climb the boys had taken off their fawn-
skins they wore only the little aprons
of plaited twigs theyd worn on their
mountain and thrust into the belts of the
aprons were long sharp knives sheathed
by leather

  rifles would have been too clumsy to
carry on that climb the little guns called
revolvers would have been too heavy
knives were better anyway for what
they had to do at the end of the climb

  but this was the end of the climb di-
kar thought with a quick surge of fear
for slowly surely against his strength
against the tight cords in his neck his
head was turning

  for a moment dikar kept his head
frim slanting down to look into the black
depths for a last fleeting instant he
looked instead into a velvet-black sky

  they were so close the stars that
dikar had only to reach out to touch
them they were the same stars that had
been close and friendly when hed gone
up to the tall oak on the very top of his
mountain to dream how some day he
would lead the bunch down off the
mountain to free america

  this was the end of his dream this
fall into the black depths

  no suddenly dikar had strength to
break the pull his head snapped back
to the cliff his left leg swung against
the outthrust of rock groped around it
his toes found something an edge of
stone slid over and found a hold a place

  for his foot as far in as it would go with
  his thigh hard against the rocky bulge

    dikars weight went from right foot to
  left the nails of his left hand pried into
  the crack his right hand let go some-
  how dikar was around the corner he
  was safe on a wide almost level shelf of
  rock held breath went out of him and
  he dropped to his knees clammy with
  sweat in spite of the cold

   dikar looked up above him not
  twenty feet was a wavering red glow of
  firelight and against the glow a sharp-
  edged black mass

    that was the top of clingmans dome
  up to it sloped clean rock on which bare
  feet would make no sound an ascent
  that would be like a level road after what
  dikar had climbed tonight

    like a level road but it was clean of
  brush or grass or even boulder to hide
   behind and it was pale in the starlight
  the smallest creature moving on it would
  stand out plain and nothing could live
  in the sweep of gunfire from up there

  a faint rub of flesh on stone turned
  dikar to the fold of rock around
  which hed come a hand groped ifito
  sight dikars fingers grabbed its wrist
  held tight a bare foot crept around the
  stone dikar had hold of that was guid-
  ing it to firm hold franksmith came
  around the rock corner into dikars arms

    franksmiths pale face twitched and
  his gray lips started to open but dikars
  palm was on his mouth stopping the
  words dikar pointed to the glow of the
  asafrics fire above to show franksmith
  why it was not safe to speak

    and then another hand came around
  the rock-corner dikar helped alfoster to
  safety one by one they came around the
  bulge abestein louvance patmara one
  by one till dikar was gesturing the six-
  teenth johnstone to lie flat and silent on
  the rock beside the others

    dikar was down on the rock his fin-
  gers were on the hilt of the knife to make
  sure it was loose in its sheath he was
  stealing up the starlit slope the boys
  following behind

    they made no more sound than the bat
  makes flitting through the gray dusk
  but in dikars ears the drum of his blood
  was so loud that he was sure the asa-
  frics must hear it and where he crawled
  the stone was ruddy with firelight

    all of a sudden it was black with a
  shadow dikar froze the shadow was
  thrown by a sort of low wall of rocks to
  which hed come

    he waved for the boys to come up into
  the shielding blackness knew that they
  obeyed because he could see the black-
  ness take them he moved to the wall
  was motionless again except for his head
  and shoulders which lifted very slowly

    dikars eyes came above the top of
  the wall and his head stopped lifting

    the fire was a big pile of red-glowing
  logs in the middle of a broad space of
  level ground the wall ran all around
  the edge of the space but on dikars left
  it was broken by a gap through which he
  could see the beginning of the road to
  newfound gap near this a low stone
  house slept door closed windows glint-
  ing with reflection of the fire

    beyond the fire long and slim and
  black the barrels of the eight anti-air-
  craft guns slanted up against a vast and
  empty sky then there was the long
  low line of the wall

    now something blotched the sharp line
  of the wall it was the head and shoul-
  ders of a man the firelight did not reach
  him so he was just a black shape to di-
  kar but the little hairs at the back of
  dikars neck bristled as his nose caught
  the smell of him
   the smell of hashamotos black sol-
 diers

    dikar made out another and another
  and their backs were to him each
  leaned on the wall peering down over it
  dikar saw that each held a rifle on the
  wall in front of him his hands on it
  there were twelve and they stood al
  along three sides of the wall but there
  were none on this fourth side as walt
  had thought they were sure tha the
  terrible west sida of the dome would
  keep anyone from coming up here

 dikars lips twisted in a humorless
 smile he beckoned the boys up to
 him he let them get a glimpse of the
 asafrics waved them down below the
 wall again pointed to each of the boys
 pointed for each in the direction of an
 asafric nods told him that they under-
 stood

    dikar pulled his knife from its sheath
  and drew a long breath he came up
  straight leaped the wall he was run-
  ning silent-footed across the space with-
  in from the comer of his eye he saw the
  silent shadowy shapes of the boys run-
  ning across the space fanning out the
  firelight glinting on the blades of their
  knives

    dikar went past an archie was close on
  top of the asafric hed picked for him-
  self his right arm swung up down the
  blade of his knife slid into flesh scraped
  bone without a sound the black
  pitched over the wall

    dikars knife was crimson but the fire-
  light didnt make it so a scream like a
  trapped rabbits shrilled in his ears di-
  kar twisted to it saw an asafric wheeling
  around to carlberger saw the asafrics
  rifle swinging like a club

    as dikar leaped there was a cracking
  sound carlberger dropping had a mis-
  shaped something where his head had
  been the asafric screamed again eyes
  white in the shiny black round of his
  face teeth white between thick purplish
  lips dikars knife sliced across the black
  throat a new bright light was all
  around dikar as the black fell

   the new light came from the door of
 the stone house open now it framed a
 squat yellow man in uniform of asafric
 green with undressed blacks crowding
 behind him the slant eyes saw dikar in
 that same moment and the officers re-
 volver spoke dikar dropped hit the
 ground with a thud

chapter iv

out of the night   

 the yellow officer yelled something
 and came out of the door his re-
 volver barking a black came out be-
 hind him rifle to shoulder another
 and another

   dikar had dropped behind the iron
 bottom part of an archie in the eye-wink
 before the officer had shot he saw a
 bronzed shape lunge for the yellow saw
 the boy knocked down by a red streak
 from the rifle of one of the blacks there
 was something hard under dikar-the
 rifle of the asafric whose throat hed cut
 dikar grabbed it up saw the blacks
 spreading out from the door of the little
 house got the butt of the gun to his
 shoulder sighting the yellow officer and
 pulled the trigger

    the officer dropped rifles dikar
  yelled grab the rifles of the asafrics
  youve killed he brought down a
  black plain against the bright light from
  the house-door a bullet spanged on
  the iron of the archy-another

   then suddenly the bright light was
 gone the door had slammed closed on

 the blacks whod dived back into the
 house

   hurray a clear high voice cried
 hurray fellers weve won louvance
 came out from behind an archy and an
 instant later he was knocked down by a
 red streak from the dark wall of the
 tone house

   cover dikar yelled keep your
 cover theyre shootin through holes in
 the wall of the house they can see us
 an shoot us but we cant get at em hold
 your shooting till you have a mark

   all of a sudden it was quiet there on
 top of clingmans dome so quiet that
 dikar could hear the hard breathing of
 someone whod been hurt he saw that
 the breathing came from the first boy
 whod been shot

   but the boy wasnt where hed fallen
 when the yellow officer had shot him
 hed dragged himself much nearer the
 house and there was a dark glistening
 path on the ground from where he had
 fallen

   shots sounded dully inside the house
 but the boy hung against the wall and
 he was doing something with his knife
 he was cutting wires dikar saw that ran
 up along the wall to the roof and then
 straight out from the roof overhead to
 a pole on the road to newfound gap

   more dull shot-sounds but no red
 flashes that meant they were coming
 from a hole in the wall right up against
 the boys body the boy slid down along
 the wall and lay still at its foot but the
 wires hung loose now cut through

 wvrrhat-what did he do that for a
 sick-sounding voice asked right
 behind dikar what did he do that crazy
 thing for

   dikar looked back saw that johnstone
 had crawled to him in the black shadow
 of the wall that ran around this space
 not crazy dikar said not crazy at
 all dont you see what kind of wires
 those are

   there was a queer sound in john-
 stones throat and then yeah theyre
 telphone wires-

   to the gap he cut em to keep the
 asafrics here from callin for help from
 there we cant get at em in that house
 an they cant get at us as long as we hide
 behind these big guns but they could
 have held us here till soldiers from new-
 found gap came whoever that was he
 could have laid still an maybe been safe
 but he gave his life to save the rest of us
 it was a brave thing who was he
 franksmith johnstone said ldw-
 voiced

   dikar thought of the way bessaltons
 hand had come out to take hold of
 franksrrsfh he thought of the look in
 bessaltons eyes as her gray lips had
 made the words the girls say it must
 be done

   what do we do now dikar john-

 stone was asking were pretty safe as
 long as we stay behind these archies but
 we cant shoot em at newfound gap un-
 less we go out in front of em an we
 dont dare do that so long as there are
 any asafrics left in that house

   right so weve got to get em out of
 there dikar made up his mind listen
 johnstone you crawl back along the
 wall an tell all the boys to start shootin
 at the house the minute i whistle

  johnstone was gone and dikar
 crouched behind the archy started count-
 ing while he counted to twenty he care-
 fully thought over all that walt had told
 him about shooting off the archies then
 he made himself not think at all while he
 counted to thirty to forty only watch
 how a faint grayness was coming into
 the sky how the stars were paling but
 as he counted forty-five dikar thought
 about marilee   

   fifty he counted and whistled loud
 and shrill the boys rifles crashed their
 red fire streaking the night dikar darted
 out from behind the cover of the gun and
 jumped up into the little iron seat fas-
 tened to it right in full view of the asa-
 frics in the house he grabbed a wheel
 and turned it and the gun started to
 move but a bullet spanged on the guns
 iron another sang over his head and a
 third fanned his cheek

   the gun was turning on its mount but
 it was turning slowly and dikar was a
 fair mark from the stone house he
 pulled at an iron stick which made the
 guns barrel start coming down as it
 turned something plucked at his left
 arm and something burned across his
 thigh the gun had turned so that it was
 between dikar and the little stone house
 and its barrel was all the way down now
 so that it pointed right at the little house

    dikar pulled another little iron stick

   the archy jumped under dikar thun-
 der deafened dikar blinded him the
 archy jumped again and again dikar
 pulled the stick again the little house
 wasnt there any more all that was
 there was a few tumbled stones and a
 big hole in the wall

    all right boys dikar yelled and he
 was still so deaf that he couldnt hear
 himself yell all right gun crews to
 your places quick aim down that road
 to newfound gap then quietly as if he
 were falling asleep he leaned sidewise

 salute uncle zack today he marches in the proud company of his
 memories for yesterday is not dead

by john russell

author of bombs over cairo  no medals tonight etc

the whole mack family party was
packing up for the grand days
picnic three cars full of them-
a joyous hurroosh of children and
grand-children and their uncles and
their cousins and their aunts

  they were a hardy lot the macks ahd
there were lots of them and this would
be a special celebration because the
bachelor brother elmer who was a big
business man in the city and hadnt at-
tended for many years he had driven
down to make the reunion complete

 which marks this indeed a glorious
fourth in our history as pa so aptly
put it but pa had been rehearsing bits
of his oration all morning to the asters
and the poppies and the geranium-beds
and now when he addressed the honey-
suckle vine over the porch with a grand-
iose flourish everybody joined in the
general laugh-which seemed to echo
gently in a quiet chuckling from the very
vine itself

 now pa said mama mack you
keep that speech off your mind till you
have to make it then itll come out all
fresh like

  d you think so asked pa rubbing
his bristly gray poll he was a nice little


man with a nice round tummy and he
was going to be second speaker of the
day at the big meadow grand-stand
where the sons of veterans and their
famous band were taking charge this
year he never had spoken before and
he was somewhat dazed by the coming
ordeal maybe if i could try it over for
elmer-

  no sir said mama mack firmly no
more tryin till the time you go off and
help the children with the lunch bas-
kets

 cm on gramp yelled his eldest
grandson benny a grinning imp of
eleven very trim he looked in his small
blue cap and uniform white belt and
real bayonet benny was one of half a
dozen in his scout troop who were go-
ing to march as a civil war color guard
in the afternoon parade

  cm on now he ordered you know
what you promised gramp

  what did i promise asked pa wari-
ly

 benny was firm

  you said you could carry three water-
melons all at wunst les see you do it
whereupon the whole gang of kids hur-
ried pa away to the kitchen quarters

elmer stood smiling after them affec-
tionately its good to be back he
murmured breathing the well-remem-
bered summer-scented air of peace and
plenty and contentment that cradled the
ancient farmhouse his birthplace and
his boyhood home

  the old village road was paved now
and somewhat unfamiliar with its row
of neat new cottages along the block
youve done pretty well here george
he told his elder brother didnt have
to wait for prosperity around the corner
eh youve got the corner yourself
yes said george complacently
from his lean indolent height he had
always been able to look down by about
six inches on the chunky energetic
elmer that was his advantage and he
did not mean the other to start any big
business ways over him

  yes weve held the old property
okay never sold anything you know
and the rents are good best thing
about it is how we been able to hold
everybody together everybody but
you you ol rouster and its sure fine
to have you with us today
everybody the word lingered in
elmers ear why he exclaimed sud-
denly why wheres great-uncle
zack

  uncle zack hes right here of
course aint you visited with him yet
sitting yonder in the porch where he
always sits well well-step right up
and see him

drummer

boy

the car was slipping toward the cliff edge
and uncle zack could do nothing
elmer stepped up and saw him and
there surely was an old man to see
gaunt but unbowed in his spruce grand
army serge with his shock of pure-
white hair and his spot of pure-white
beard he sat there in his rocking-chair
and when he smiled it was like a glint
of sun on a granite cliff

  elmer took the gnarly big-boned fist
in his own with real feeling how are
y uncle zack he asked

  how ya capn piped uncle zack
prompt as an automaton hows all the
company all present and accounted for
sir correct

  he-he remembers i was a captain
said elmer rather simple about it

  not you not your war returned
george thats what he says to every-
body its just about all he does say
george explained

but elmer was upset rather until he
peered down into the eyes of the vet-
eran they were the clear good-natured
eyes of all the macks-only a trifle vague
unnoticing not quite focused

  how long has he been like this
ever since that auto accident you
know seven eight years ago i wrote
you all about it

  yes-but i havent seen him in eight
years said elmer whats doc eyloff
say 

   oh hes sound as a nut said george
and the word sounding somehow not
quite right added hastily i mean hes
physically fit for his age only he got
pretty badly shook-up y know kind
of like he got jammed out of gear y
know

   i know said elmer with a gathering
intentness what do you do for him

  well nothing much theres nothing
to do hes no trouble to us not a
bit

  why i should just say hes not
chimed mama mack who had come bus-
tling up in time to overhear hes just
an old dear hes just my old precious
around the house-aint you uncle
zack she bent to kiss the aged man

  whatever you say capn all pres-
ent for duty mam he chirped cheer-
fully enough

  thats okay but dont he ever have
any enjoyment dont he ever get to do
anything for himself persiste elmer

  guess not what would he do he
used to potter around the garden but
after he came back from the hospital
seemed he never thought of it again nor
nothing else you remember how he
used to crave his tbacco never seems
to miss it now

and he dont notice anything par-
ticular-any special friend or such
we kinda thought-little benny
whenever he played his drum it looked
like it stirred him up some so then

we had to send benny out in the back
lot for his practicing

  well the poor old boy blurted el-
mer well hes certainly going to en-
joy his picnic along with me today

they stared at him ma and george
elmer we never take uncle zack
along not anywhere he knows nothing
about cars-it might scare him after that
smashup of his hell be all comfy here at
home maggie can always keep an eye on
him you see and ever since the hospi-
tal-

  i know interrupted elmer curtly
ive been in the hospital myself   
why whats the matter with you peo-
ple he broke out good gosh don t
you realize that this day was made for
uncle zack it was made by men like
uncle zack for men like uncle zack it
belongs to him why didnt he fight
on this very battlefield-just where were
going today    how old is he ei-
ther demanded

  uncle- zack must be-eighty-six
eight

  eighty-eight right he was a drum-
mer boy youngest in the union army
he was the drummer boy of big mead-
ow he helped to save the guns in the
second days fighting its in the books
even good gosh and you want to keep
him home on the fourth of july
elmer was a bit stormy by now and
elmers bursts of eloquence had always
power to move mama mack far more
than anything of pas elmer you-
you dont think weve been unkind to
uncle zack do you she faltered

  no mother of course now dont
you worry he reassured her ill take
charge of this ill manage everything
just you run along and see that pa don t
drop those watermelons

  that sent ma scurrying obediently with
a corner of apron to her eyes

when the two brothers were alone
together i dont just get what
youre aiming at elmersaid george

   what im aiming at is this said el-
mer here its the third generation after
the civil war here are you and all your
folks living on uncle zacks land which
he won for freedom it is his land you
know and you treat him like a vegetable
in his own garden

   i dont like you to say so the court
decided after his accident said he was
incapable even doc eyloff thats treat-
ed him all these years-son of his old
regimental surgeon-doc testified he was
finished couldnt recognize anybody no
more doc signed the papers for a ward-
ship and so did you elmer you
signed yourself

  i did yes i signed for you to take
care of him but i never signed him
dead did i why jiminently his father

lived to be over a hundred all im
thinking hes entitled to at least one
good break

  george flushed darkly sure you aint
thinking of your share of his estate
when he is dead

  it was the old issue that had stirred
up every quarrel between them since
they were boys and it had always roused
the ruthless streak in elmer  thatll do
george he warned in his parade rasp
im taking uncle zack with me today if
i have to carry him off by hand

  the responsibility too asked
george

  you betcha said elmer he ended
the dispute as he always had managed
to do by having his own way which
as usual quite restored his natural good-
temper

  uncle zack a-re you ready atten-
shun he boomed exaggerating like a
play-actor

  it was not play to uncle zack he stood
up straight as an unfolded joint-rule
all ready capn present and account-
ed for aye aye sir he saluted he
gave the old civil war salute-up out
down-with a snap that delighted el-

elmer took charge of the entire cara-
van first he installed uncle zack in
his own big city car and packed him
around with macks and lunch-baskets
then likewise with the other cars piling
them up like commissary lorries for an
army on march-with plenty of room for
benny with his drum and pa with his
melons	-

  proudly elmer drove at the head of
his little procession and he was special-
ly proud that he could steer the route to
the old battlefield in spite of unlearned
twists and turnings and a jam of traffic
he brought them out through an almost
deserted lane to the steep edge of devils
glen and a strip of shaded lawn

  they had a perfect view down over
the historic ground where thousands of
men had locked in deadly combat ex-
actly seventy-seven years ago this day
below to their right lay the peaceful
valley animate with the bands and flags
massing around the speakers stands and
with the gay holiday crowds strolling
to visit the monuments

  elmer got the cars neatly parked at
the dead end of the lane he decanted
all able-bodied helpers onto the sward
he dismissed pa and benny straightway
-the one to his big meadow grandstand
the other to his scout troop rendezvous
at little meadow nearer by pa was
rather fretful that no member of the
family would be coming along to hear his
famous speech but ma was wiser it
would only make you nervous dear and
besides youll enjoy telling us so much
what a wonderful hit you made

 
calmer decided it would be better to
keep uncle zack high-throned in the
auto seat swell sight from up here isnt
it uncle zack how do you like being
back here again-on the very spot he
asked curiously

  the veteran nodded but made no an-
swer he looked down over the scene
of that great event in which he had
shared so far in the past over the
throngs bright-dotted with summer
frocks and assorted uniforms he heard
the drifting murmur and mirth of many
voices the discordant thumpings of mar-
tial units the crepitation of fire-crack-
ers as crisp as mimic musketry with
now and then the bark of a toy can-
non

  whatever memories whatever renewal
of humor or irony or sadness might have
echoed deep within his consciousness he
showed no sign in his placid eyes and
elmer was disappointed rather he could
not help thinking how much more dra-
matic he could have made this moment
if he had the full ordering of it

  it is for us the living rather to be
dedicated here to the unfinished work
which they who fought here have thus
far so nobly advanced    

  it was the blatting of a loud-speaker
giving out some radio reading of the
immortal address elmer noted its
source as a little refreshment booth
away at the further end of the lane

  oh damn he muttered if i didnt
go and forget to stop for ice and sody
pop    george he bawled front
and center we gotta buy the drinks
come on now-double quick obedient-
ly george trotted off with him toward
the refreshment shed

  they had covered perhaps half the
distance maybe sixty yards when the
thing happened the appalling awful
thing the result of another oversight
on the part of elmer his car his big
car parked back there began to move

  stealthily slowly it began to slip on
its brake and creep on the slope of the
dead end nobody noticed it at first
nobody was near enough until some
fellow in a neighboring picnic group let
out a yell hey lookit that car stop
it

rfhe yell brought elmer and george

  spinning around in their tracks the
car was moving-not actually released
but continuing to move inch by inch in-
exorably toward the verge of the few
persons who had begun to run toward
the car not one could reach it in time

  nobody could possibly save it except
uncle zack himself if he had only known
how but elmer and george were both
aware-and gripped by the terror of it
-that uncle zack knew nothing what-
ever of motorcars

  no uncle zack knew nothing about

cars yet he must have known some-
thing about gadgets vehicles contrap-
tions on wheels because they saw him
give a sudden convulsive start and
scramble clear overside and then in-
stead of staying clear he threw himself
directly in front of that crawling resist-
less mass and try to check it

  they had to watch that powerless to
do a single thing

  it was like the vision of a fabled
agony-of sisyphus or laocoon the fig-
ure of that ancient man worn gnarled
far stricken in years but holding back
against defeat and death just under
him lay the pit of devils glen a sheer
depth of broken boulders he cared
nothing for it but absurdly hopelessly
he fought and now he gave his old
battle-cry like a cracked brass but still
ringing out as it must have done in-
domitable

  the guns he whooped come on
men-all you sons get in here and help
all hands all hands save the guns
dagnab ye save yr blasted guns
perhaps he delayed the catastrophe by
a split second perhaps not at any rate
the front wheels of the car lost sup-
port let down with a crash just as the
yelling neighbor get there hopped on
the runningboard and pulled and locked
the emergency just too late for un-
cle zack had pitched over

elmer retained sense enough to snatch
george into a side-path without wast-
ing time in useless peering over the
brink this way no good there got to
find him below

  desperately they pelted down the
winding way that threaded through rocks
and shrubbery of the glen then george
could run better than stout elmer and
he had breath for a bitter reproach re-
sponsibility he flung over his shoulder
management youre the great manag-
er

  elmer stumbled and fell up against a
tree and clung the breath wheezed in
his lungs his limbs his heart had gone
weak fainting all his mastery his as-
surance his pride had ebbed out of him
he gasped george wait-minute all
in george im a fool-damn fool my
fault but not altogether my fault d
you think

  it was a pitiful appeal and it struck
through every latent hostility back to
the true warmth and understanding be-
tween these two

  no of course not said george
quickly it happened thats all im just
as much to blame i guess you were
right-us neglecting the old boy like we
did come on

  they were both shaken wait an-
other minute breathed elmer if hes
dead george-if uncle zack is dead-
listen ill take no penny from his es-

tate never wanted it you believe me
george he begged

   thats all right me neither elmer
said george it goes to benny fourth
generation aint it

  and curiously though perhaps not so
curiously the two brothers exchanged a
hand-grip that made them both wince

  come on said george curtly we
got to find uncle zack

hthey found him oh they found uncle
zack right enough as they staggered
out into the open meadow right un-
derneath the devils glen here came
marching a musical contingent from the
battlefield

  a boy scout troop with half a dozen
at their head dressed in the semblance
of civil war uniforms blue caps and
blue suits complete with real bayonets
swinging here they came thumping and
fifing

  when johnny comes marching home
       again

  hurrah hurrah

  when johnny comes marching home
       again

  hurrah hurrah

   all little tads they were of the newest
generation all except one one grand
tall gaunt tremendous figure of an old
man rather dusty rather battered but
there he marched between the flag and
the fife and he was beating on a drum

  the procession broke up around elmer
and george who stood bewildered and
pa arrived even more bewildered and
doc eyloff the scout master not at all
bewildered but quietly watching and
little benny shrilling out the news
gramp-gramp lookit its uncle-
its uncle-its great-great-uncle zack
he come bustin frm the bushes just now
here and he borried my drum and
cripes if he cant just beat hell out of a
drum

  both the brothers were plucking at
doc eyloft is he all right is he all
right doc

  all right repeated the doc you
two guys had better get ready to chuck
up your wardship hes got back in gear
thats all hes himself

  youre a hardy lot you macks he
added guess the country wont have
to worry much as long as we got folks
like his folks left around look at the
eyes of him will you

  the eyes of grand-uncle zack were
clear and keen as he came casually up
to them

  hello george hello elmer he
nodded say anybody got a chaw of
tbacca round here

      which marks this indeed stut-
tered pa a glorious fourth in our his-
tory

                                                                                de luxe

cass iired toward the turmoil of stampeded
cattle and gunfire

cass gentry coming to triangle town
with his partner swifty ogden is ex-
pecting trouble for trouble is his business
a professional gun-hand gentry has been
summoned to triangle but he has no knowl-
edge of the mystery and disaster ahead of
him triangles sinister puzzle centers around
the death of
matt mchale owner of the rocker-m
ranch who was shot down and robbed a
year ago since his death the rocker-m
herd has been severely raided by rustlers
and nesters have over-run the range taking
advantage of the new homestead law the
inheritance of
mary ellen mchale the old ranchers
daughter had dwindled almost to nothing
and her efforts to plumb the mystery of her
fathers death have been unsuccessful de-
serted by her legal counselor and fiance
smooth young martin burdette mary has
found refuge in the home of one of her few
remaining friends

dr george farabaugh whose wife ada is
a crippled and embittered woman but the
doctor can do little for mary ellen in part
he agrees with bearpaw the grizzled veteran
of the rocker-m that the only way to clear
the tangled web is to start some shooting
old bearpaw is the one who summoned cass
gentry and swiftly to triangle

ollie shand cattle-thief is the man
most generally suspected of matt mc-
hales murder for mchale and his men strung
up shands rustler father yet ollie shand
saves the lives of gentry and ogden when

they ride into an ambush by kettledrum
river shand kills
tex cordill formerly the ramrod on the
rocker-m who has been sent out to elim-
inate these two strangers he has been sent
by wash parsons the mayor of triangle and
a man with plenty to hide but parsons ally
in skullduggery

deputy vic barth is furious at this error
in strategy and he rides after cordill-to
reach kettledrum river shortly after the kill-
ing of the ambusher unseen gentry ogden
and shand watch the deputy take a fat roll
of bills from the body and then ride away

it is with this information that cass gen-
try confronts ben quigg the weasel-like
sheriff of triangle the next day to show
that he means business cass thoroughly
thrashes the dutchman quiggs strongarm
man when that worthy starts to give gentry
a going-over at the sheriffs order cass gen-
trys next stop in his investigation of trian-
gles mystery is the bank-to see
frank irish this small shrewd man can-
not explain why matt mchales estate turned
out to be so poverty-stricken he had thought
the rancher a wealthy man mchale he says
saw that the range was doomed because of
the homesteaders and had considered an offer
for the rocker-m but he refused to sell when
he suspected that his old rival

  by jack byrne

abel bannistek was behind the deal long
an enemy of mchales bannister might have
had a hand in the murder but frank irish
thinks not he tells cass gentry to take it
slow and careful in his probing theres sense
in that cass agrees but he is determined to
set off a little quiet dynamite 

chapter xi

dark and lonely mountain

the business blocks were well lined
now with wagons and buggies from
the out-country foot traffic flowed
both sides of wampum street a work
team pulled out from the freight depot
hauling a mixed load and cass noted
heavy spools of wire piled over with bulg-
ing grain sacks bar-wire and crop-seed
-trouble twins in any rangeland

he strode briskly outside the mercan-
tile store a young man was handing a girl
into her carriage an older man lean in
rusty black his lank hair stringing like
a preachers was directing the disposal of
bundles that a laden youngster carried
this would be eli lombard owner of the
mercantile and cass was pleased that
chance had included the merchant in the
little public scene he planned to stage

mornin mr burdette cass called
he touched his hat most politely to the

this story began in the argosy for february 


girl in the carriage seat my name is
gentry and id like to talk to you a
minute

  drive on fanny eli lombard cried
get on home girl

  martin burdette had turned quickly
jerking his foot from the side iron and
facing cass with stiffened jaw a welt
along his cheek was the mark of his en-
counter at dan venables

  i was talking to a lady he said see
me at my office if youve any business to
transact i dont make a habit gentry
of conducting my affairs on the public
highways

  i beg the ladys pardon cass said
but im crowded for time a little theres
just one-two questions i got to ask about
the rocker ranch id be much obliged
if youd set me right on em

  get along fanny lombard cried
shrilly you martin-dont let im coax
you into trouble thats what hes aimin
for

  the girl refused to rouse her team she
held the reins lax staring at cass with a
sort of fascination the bundle boy looked
on with round eyes his mouth hinged
open martin burdette stubbornly stood
his ground

  see me at my office he repeated i
refuse to discuss the subject here if you
think your reputation can bully me-
you start any hell-raisin here gen-
try eli lombard said sharply and ill
make it my business to see you pay for it
theres still some people in town who re-
spect the decencies and we wont stand
for rowdies of your stripe common kill-
ers pushing into our affairs

  its you who begun the hollerin cass
said if theres any ruckus come up it
wont be one i started his eyes glinted
it might be easier all around if burdette
would tell what i want to know i take
it hes got nothin he wants to hide
nothin at all the lawyer said quick-
ly every paper in the mchale case has
been bundled up in my office take em
and welcome submit the case to any
attorney you can find and i will defy him
to show a single flaw in the handling

t never accused you of a thing cass
 drawled i chiefly wanted to know
who it was that throwed the rocker into
the courts who brought the suit against
the property

  there are three actions burdette
snapped the exchange bank has a claim
for a ten-thousand-dollar note of hand
the midwest cattle company holds a lien
in respect of advances on beef shipments
that were undelivered

  various smaller claims for equipment
and supplies have been bulked in a single
item the order of injunction was jointly
obtained in order to conserve the existing
assets because of the circumstances uil-
der mchales will it was necessary to ap-
point an administrator-

  whoa cass said lets stick to a
trail i can follow how much does the
rocker owe

  forty thousand would cover it includ-
ing costs certain proceeds of the liquida-
tion including sums obtained from the
livestock sale reduce this figure some-
what the court is holding these funds in
escrow-

  cass shook his head how much is the
rocker worth as things stand enough
to cover the debts against it

  the lawyer shrugged i hoped to be
able-

  poppycock eli lombard exclaimed
a things worth its market value what
it might have brought a year ago butters
no parsnips today i was fool enough to
take over the midwest claims at sixty
cents on the dollar and right now i figure



im well stuck it aint worth anything

  what good is land with a locust swarm
of rustlers squatters hired killers in-
festin it its your breed gentry that
runs a country to the dogs therell be no
honest values here no decent living until
we get our laws enforced

  its about time gentry martin bur-
dette interrupted lifting his voice to reach
the audience of six or eight who had
halted nearby that people realized the
difficulties in organizing simple justice
here the loud-mouth talkers whove
criticized my handling of the rocker
affairs would sing a different tune if they
stopped to consider what ive been up
against i defy a single one of them-
you makin a stump speech cass
drawled theres no need to apologize to
me

  im not apologizing im stating facts
theyve established state courts and al-
lotted no funds to set them up we have
county judges with no place to function
no authority to back their decrees we
take our cases to plateau city or into
federal jurisdiction and crowded dockets
shunt us aside postpone our pleas is it
any wonder that lawlessness is rampant
cass saw the purpose behind the law-
yers words martin burdette had been
quick to declaim his justification in pub-
lic he spoke with impressive sincerity
and cass realized the disadvantages he
would face in a continuing debate

  i just wanted the straight of things
he said thanks very much im a law-
abidin man myself and i never taken a
case to old judge colt unless it came to
last resource his eyes traveled slowly
from burdette to eli lombard like it
seems to be here in triangle

  he touched his hat to the girl in the
carriage moving on

swifty and bearpaw were at the bar
when he entered the wheel of for-
tune he nodded at them then stood with
hands thumbed at his belt to peer around
the shaded interior

  he was well aware that his presence
was noted the scattering of drinkers and
loiterers gave him the same attention that
had followed his passage along the street
even such an eminent citizen as wattle-
jowled wash parsons turned around gaze
toward him a startled look that was
hastily averted as cass came striding

  hop randolph was the man cass want-
ed to see the slight-figured gambler sat
at an isolated table a bottle and glass at
his elbow and a solitaire layout spread
before him he did not disturb his con-
centration on the cards as cass ap-
proached and not until cass halted did he
lift his gaze

  my names gentry cass said i
looked you up-

  i know who you are and why youre
here the gambler said what can i do
for you

  i heard you had trouble with matt
mchale cass said matching his voice
to the others cool tone they tell me you
had reason to want him killed and that
you never accounted for where you might
been on the evenin he was murdered
thats what i wanted to ask about

  i see randolph nodded and what
did you aim to do gentry in case i said
that was my own affair and you could go
to hell

  i hadnt made up my mind cass re-
plied i expected to handle you a little
different from the others

  a flicker moved the watchful eyes hop
randolph put his hands together inter-
lacing the fingers that was smart he
drawled sit down gentry if youve a
mind to i reckoned youd seek me out
as soon as i heard how you handled ben

quigg its a neat little scheme youre
cookin up

  what schemes that

  your notion of stirrin mchales old
troubles and enemies and hamessin em
onto yourself youve made no bones of
your purpose so far as i can see
could you point a better way cass
asked

  not offhand said the gambler if you
want to take that long a risk its all right
with me it even might work out gentry
if you was up against a lesser proposition

  if you want my opinion though the
trails too cold and the fox is too sly and
the woods are too thick youll find your-
self outslicked and outgunned all along
the line mister

  so another man hinted said cass
was there anybody or anything you
meant in particular

randolph shook his head theres
one opinion in town that holds that
mchale was killed for personal reasons
by somebody like ollie shand or me a
few of us figger though that his murder
and the wipe-out of the rocker was en-y
gineered for bigger reasons and was
planned by a clever far-lookin combine
dont ask me who or how or why for ive
got no real notion

  then it wasnt you that killed im
cass asked

  no it wasnt me i had my flare-up
with the peg-legged old devil and i did
talk pretty tall at the time i never really
blamed im though when i come to think
of it i had no decent right-

  his lips twisted i got no proof where
i was the night he was shot the truth is
a thing i wouldnt believe if another man
told i aint proud of it gentry and i
dont quite savvy why i choose to speak
it to you but here she is-

  i rode out to squawmans knob that
afternoon he said huskily six miles
she lies wild and lone with a little look-
out clearing at the crest there i carried
along a friend the best friend i got-the
good old friend that gurgles in the bottle
it didnt take long to empty my friend in-
side me

  i got blind drunk he said i rolled
in the grass and laughed out loud i made
a speech to a stump sayin what id never
speak in front of people i had me one
hell of a time for a little while i was as
good a man as i used to be before that
bronc fell on my leg i was the man i
should have been as good as anybody
instead of a damned cheap-

  his hand swept out furiously scattering
a storm of cards

  you neednt go on said cass gentry
grim-jawed i know what it is i climbed
the same mountain

  he tugged the brim of his hat turning
his hand rubbed the edge of his jaw
swiped across his mouth as he angled
toward swifty and bearpaw

  ready to eat he asked ive tossed
enough rocks for one day i reckon ill
take a smart mans advice and ride from
town until the pools had a chance to set-
tle

  where bearpaw asked

  i cant quite say cass told him the
two next things that need stirrin up are
abel bannisters snaketrack crowd and
the homestead outfits north in the valleys
ill flip a coin between em

chapter xii

the hooraw boys

he was still undecided however when
he turned his roan horse into wam-
pum street a little later it didnt matter
much in which direction he rode the im-
portant point was that triangle town
should see him heading forth on some
mysterious errand with a bedroll strapped
behind him and a rifle in his saddle-boot

  he sat straight pacing the roan by the
pressure of his knees scanning the street
with restless scrutiny his right hand
rested upon his thigh convenient to the
butt of his colt he wanted the watchers
to read his challenge plainly he wanted
his unknown foes among them to know
he was ready for any game they chose

  the back-country wagons had already
thinned out but the saddle horses at the
racks had increased in number the
saloons were beginning to hum with the
payday trade and sundown would find
this section of town all primed to cavort
and holler	 

  at the intersection of council street he
checked the roan three range-garbed
horsemen cantered past one of them
flinging an empty bottle that skittered the
dust a group on the opposite corner eyed
him with the same guarded interest that
had trailed his passage along the block
cass glanced down the aisle of trees
vaguely frowning then shrugged as he
kneed around

  now where in the world did he get the
notion to ride past the doctors house

  he had to admit that mary ellen mc-
hale had been in his thoughts by think-
ing of her by pretending a kinship to her
problems he had injected a new quality
into the situations he faced

  there wasnt any point though in look-
ing for her now despite the notes some
jughead had sent shed be safe enough
here in town especially with bearpaw
posted to keep an eye on her after night-
fall supposing he did meet her what
would he have to say

  no the thin to do was to ride up the
main drag again as if he might have his
eye peeled for some certain hombre he
would toss one more pebble before he
headed out if triangle town was led to
believe that he knew more than he did-
well that might rouse em to action

  the sooner the quicker he muttered
leaning his weight in signal to the roan

  and that was the way it happened swift
and unexpected the scene was set at
the corner of division street brief min-
utes later and half a hundred scattered
witnesses saw cass gentry ride into it to
climax the conflicts of the day

he was ten yards from the comer
when a northbound carriage turned
left in front of him he recognized the
team of bays and the feathered elegance
of madame mustache he heard a shout
saw the carriage swerve and halt just
beyond the crossways a man laughed
loudly a harsh voice called some remark
and figures along the walk turned to ob-
serve the happenings

  the incident was not exactly-unusual
such horseplay was common enough on
pay-night in places like triangle town
the three punchers who had passed cass
previously flinging their bottle aside had
been approaching the mouth of division
street as the carriage turned into it they
greeted the driver with shrill yelps rein-
ing their horses to force the bays to the
curb

  when cass rode up the argument was
getting noisy one of the riders was hold-
ing the head of the off bay and the other
pair were hoorawing the driver

  the nearest rider heavy-built and
hawk-nosed was doffing his hat grin-
ning widely

  mebbe you dont recall us he said
without our silk hats and walkin canes
howcome were barred at yore house
they closed the doors so fast on us we
couldnt even leave our callin cards

  f top it boys the woman said let
go that horse you ought to be ashamed
of yourselves carrying on in the street
ive told you already-

  therell be ten more along in another
hour the second horseman said you
cant treat us thisaway we named your
place for our headquarters

  the woman lifted the carriage whip
from its socket but i told you stellas
sick the doctor said id better close un-
til hes sure what ails her you can hunt
your fun elsewhere

  the hawk-nosed man chuckled crowd-
ing his horse closer we got money he
announced well pay the damage of that
roughhouse last time-

  cass saw the brand on the rump of his
mount-the wavy line of abel bannis-
ters snaketrack iron-and his decision
was instantly made here was circum-
stance playing into his hand and his lips
were grinning as he pushed the roan
forward

  turn loose of that horse he called
sharply stand back there you and let
this lady pass

his bold approach brought abrupt si-
lence instinctively the forward man
had dropped his hand from the head of
the carriage horse the other pair turned
in their saddles to face the challenge

  who says so barked the hawk-nosed
man what gives you leave to prod in
here stranger who in hell db you claim
to be

  gentrys the name cass said i work
for the rocker ranch whats left of it and
i dont appreciate the smell of any three
polecats who push their fun on a lone
woman you scared to tackle somethin
more your caliber

  with his first words he realized that he
was not dealing with drunken men he
saw their faces harden as he spoke walk-
ing the roan into them the hawk-nosed
man let his clenched fist relax posing his
spread fingers above his holstered re-
volver

  cass knew they wouldnt back down
they were hesitating briefly uncertain
how to move and this was the slight ad-
vantage he had to whittle down the triple
odds cass gentry knew exactly what he
must do to hold the jump on them

  and he did it he carried the fight
striking hard and sudden

  the bite of his spur on the roans flank
lunged the animal in a cat-hop straight
toward the hawk-nosed man the leader
of the three and the most dangerous
hawk-nose was pawing for his gun when
the roan rammed his mount backward
and he tried frantically to dodge the
slashing blow that cass was launching
he lurched sidewise in the saddle and
cass gun barrel slapped above his ear
he was spilled beneath the hoofs of his
rearing snorting pony

  the second man said later that he never
even saw the move with which cass gen-
try slapped his gun out the whole thing
happened too fast for him there was the
jump of gentrys horse that unseated
blackie and before a man could collect
his senses his own pony was jammed back
against the madames carriage and gen-
trys fist had hit out a lick that made the
whole street flutter it didnt help much
either when the madame laid her whip
across his ponys rump and then slashed
her own team so hard that they liked to
run poor bud plumb under

  she hadnt wasted any time

  the spectators who came hurrying from
wampum street saw the happenings just
as disjointedly one man had been
downed by the time the late-comers
surged within sight this fellows boot
had caught in his stirrup and his crab-

stepping horse was anchored by the
weight of him

  cass gentry was punching a second
snaketrack rider and the third man was
trying to steer his pinto-faced black into
the ruction this third one had his gun
out but his hands were too full of horse
to make any use of it

  then miz rambo went into action a
swish of her whip lunged the horse out
from under the man cass gentry was
fighting a second swish set fire to her
hard-held bays and she reined the team
toward the last of the snaketrack trio in
a charge that he narrowly avoided

  he kicked loose of his stirrups hopping
down to the solid roadway as the carriage
careened beyond he was turning to face
a dusty confusion his gun lifted to seek
out the stranger who had climbed them
so quick and complete and then an ex-
plosion kicked up yellow dirt at his feet

  drop it brother cass gentry shout-
ed drop it-or ill lift the next one
higher

  the snaketrack puncher let his revol-
ver fall through a dusky golden haze he
sajy the looming figure on horseback and
the steady jutting arm that trained a
heavy colt to cover him

 you tell abel bannister gentry
called out in a voice that the street could
hear that i aim to look him up as soon
as i can manage i want to know why he
hires such as tex cordill on his payroll
hell explain to me you tell him how-
come the skunktrack loses so little stock
to the rustlers

chapter xiii

wake up to a nightmare

ass rode westward from town as he
- had planned he followed the wagon
road to the foothill breaks then turned
north across rolling prairies in his pocket
was a rough map that bearpaw had
painstakingly sketched and explained and
cass scouted the landmarks that would
point him into the six valleys

  the wind was freshening and the sun
deepened in color as it settled toward
the blue-hazed mountain peaks a low-
hanging drift of sullen clouds held the
threat of showers later cass made no
special effort to conceal himself holding
his mount at a steady gait through lonely
country

  he had no notion of any real purpose
that this jaunt might serve all indica-
tions were that the heart of the mystery
the actual danger was somewhere in the
town he had quitted yet judgment told
him that the wisest course was to let that
danger grow let triangle town stew in
its juices while he took a look-see at what
had been the rocker layout

  three men had warned him that mc-
hales murder was a deeper concern than
personal spite ollie shand frank irish
hop randolph an ill-assorted trio-yet
each had voiced the same suspicions tex
cordills unlucky attempt at bushwhack-
ing was the factor which inclined cass to
agree with them

  it seemed obvious that cordill had
played the renegade working hand-in-
glove with the men who looted the rock-
er but was the ambush his own idea-a
panicky effort to hide his own tracks-or
had he followed orders those yellow-
back bijls in his pocket-would they tally
with the crisp new twenties robbed from
matt mchale if so how and where had
cordill come into them

  the logical man to answer these quer-
ies was the hard-faced fellow who had
followed cordill to the ambush who had
searched a dead body with such eager
purpose-the sheriffs deputy vic barth


  and yet in the circumstances cass was
just as well satisfied that barth had tailed
from town his single glimpse of the dep-
utys lean dark features had been enough
to mark the man as tough and capable
a showdown with him cass had the feel-
ing would end in kill or be killed and
barth was more valuable on the hoof
than in a coffin

the roan carried cass into a rock-
walled gully and through the notch he
could see the timbered slopes of squaw-
mans knob marking six slow miles he
had covered in an hours journey he
still had more than another hour of full
daylight however and there would be a
half-moon later if the storm should blow
away he expected to camp the night in
the near vicinity of the valleys

  he was still in no great hurry but he
shook up the roan a little as he neared
the gulleys end they rounded a laurel
clump where the rutted trail resumed and
suddenly cass yanked the bit pulling in
toward a thicket of concealment

  his position gave an extended view of
the traveled track that hairpinned along
the base of the table hill a few hundred
yards beyond near a place where a dry
wash slashed the wooded flank of the
knob a horseman came in sight

  cass climbed from the saddle his fin-
gers clamped the nose of the roan as he
peered from his shallow covert the
young un had reported that vic barth
rode a white-stockinged chestnut from
town and this was explanation of the
sudden halt the horse below tallied with
that description

  but the rider wasnt barth as cass soon
saw the binoculars from the saddlebag
proved him a stranger he slouched in
his saddle long and lean and a speckled
face was enlarged in the eye glass sights
as cass worked the adjustment the
blotches might have been freckles or
pockmarks a stringy mustache above
buck teeth gave him a fair resemblance
to a gopher the distinguishing item of
his slovenly dress was a tall-crowned
black hat with a rattlesnake band a glint
of the fading sun touched a fire-spark to
the silvered stud that joined the hatband

  cass lowered the binoculars and a
frown creased his brows now where had
he seen such an ugly face before who
was it this brown-ticked gopher reminded
him of he watched the horseman turn
into the mouth of the wash

  in less than five minutes he reappeared
having gained a companion in the mean-
time they rode off in opposite directions
the chestnut cantering north and the sec-
ond rider setting out toward cass gen-
trys hideout

  for the sake of curiosity and common
prudence cass sought a deeper conceal-
ment he managed to find a lookout that
gave him sight of the road and his lips
formed a soundless whistle as he identi-
fied the bulky rider who had met with
buck-tooth in such remote and hasty
rendezvous

  what mysterious urgency had saddled
this sweaty dusty journey upon such an
eminent citizen as mr wash parsons the
mayor of triangle town

cass pondered that question as he rode
bearpaw had spoken the verdict
wash parsons-he dont amount to
much and cass had accepted the judg-
ment upon first sight of the wattled jowls
the shifty eyes the paunchy awkwardness
of the man that estimate might be
wrong of course it would do no harm
to check up on brother parsons at the
next opportunity

  though he attached no importance to
the incident he was careful to give the



buck-toothed stranger a respectable start
before trailing in the same direction he
traveled slowly his watchfulness increas-
ing as dusk came on and nightfall caught
him near the banks of a narrow shallow
stream that might be copper creek or
foxfire run depending on which way he
read bearpaws map-making

  either one it made no difference he
was still a short ride from the one-time
rocker layout but that could wait for
morning

  he had marked a spot to spread his
bedroll and before he broke out his cold
grub he arranged his tarp as a shelter
against the rain that might come later
the storm was still hovering up there
clouding the roof but a slackening wind
hinted it might roll on the darkness fell
thick and black fencing a silent empti-
ness close about him and he stretched
out at ease with his good-night cigarette

  it had been a good day cass gentry
thought

  he had hit a few licks he had earned
his pay colonel tom raynor had got his
moneys worth staring into the blank
darkness though into the sleepy void
where only hazy images moved he ad-
mitted that this wasnt quite his mean-
ing it was something else-a sort of feel-
ing he had-which made today different
from other days

  there was nothing new in the situa-
tion it was the same old business of these
past few years-cass gentry trouble-
shooting risking his scalp at so much per
day to pull other mens irons from the
fire

  and yet he had felt an ease today and
she was responsible for it-mary ellen
he could picture her as she stood that
morning leaning at the doctors gate with
the dawns brightness upon her he could
see blue mystery in her eyes and he re-
membered the touch of her hand upon his
own the gentleness   

he slept he slept deeply dream-
lessly and he had no clear impression
of the source of the vague disturbance
that wakened him he opened his eyes
to the same utter darkness feeling a
windswept sprinkle of rain upon his face

  it might have been an hour later-or
six hours for all he knew the storm was
spraying a thin drizzle and he thought it
might have been a rumble of distant
thunder that roused him

  his hand had fallen instinctively to his
gun-butt and he tilted the weapon as he
sat up listening the roan moved with
brushy sound that was suddenly lost in
a sharper deeper more resounding noise
it was man-made thunder cass heard
and the echoing boom of it came from
hear at hand

  gun-blasts through the night harsh
voices shouting tumult that the wind car-
ried close the air had a heavier pun-
gence too that cass scented as he rose
along with the rain it bore a waft of dis-
tant fire the bite of smoke

  there was an interval of sleep-drugged
confusion in which it seemed to cass that
sudden noises hemmed him in on every
side the wind swirled the sounds the
night magnified them and they came
crowding on from near and far from
every scattered direction

  he had scant time to straighten them
out for the rushing storm of them rolled
toward him quickly through the fringe
of trees he glimpsed a glow that lightened
the black sky toward the south

  the heaviest gunfire came from this di-
rection a firecracker fusillade of pistols
that was punctuated by the harsh-toned
slam of rifles slower paced a sporadic
shooting whanged from the roadway east
and there was a thrash of nearer move-

ment a lift of voices a rumble-pound
that was hard to locate

  such were his hasty impressions

  the roan was fighting his night rope
and cass was moving toward the animal
when the full hullabaloo of excitement
came along the rocky bed of the shallow
creek in the black storm shadows he
could see no more than a charging flood
of shapes hulking ghostlike coming on at
splashing speed it was chiefly instinct
that identified them as spooked cattle
twenty or more in the bunch running on
the prod

  cass had pitched his cold camp on the
shelving bank of the stream the water-
course ran through a ravine that stretched
some twenty feet across and was probably
dry except in the rainy season the
stampede came on so fast that the leaders
were plunging past ten feet below before
cass could find the roans tie-rope the
horse danced and lunged snorting loudly
and cass spoke a steadying command

  his voice could not have been heard in
the welter of other sounds but almost in-
stantly it was answered with a flash of
flame from the gulley the slam of a re-
volver shot

  as cass figured out later that shot had
no intention of finding him one of the
men who were driving that pell-mell
bunch of horns and splashing hoofs had
probably risked a bullets blast in order
to keep the critters on the jump a little
longer it was just poor luck all around
that the dark rider happened to choose
that certain moment for cutting loose with
his hardware

  put that was second guess at the time
it happened cass naturally supposed that
someone had spotted him as a target and
he was quick to reply to the shot in kind
he was turning instantly firing toward
the confusion of sounds and shadows be-
low knowing that no honest man would
be moving cattle in such a fashion the
hasty shots that pounded back at him
were further proof of that if proof was
needed

  he shot again aiming toward the mid-
dle flash of the three explosions from the
ravine the riders were beyond him
now spurring fast on the tails of their
crazy drive and he fired a third time
after them a haphazard bullet to speed
them along

  in the rain-sprayed gloom there was no
chance for accurate shooting and he held
his fire thereafter he crouched at the lip
of the bank until the sounds of stampede
had dwindled aware that the other dis-
tant noises had abruptly faded as well
he could still see the glow against the
southern sky less than a mile away he
judged but the drumming warfare had
petered out

  he stood erect turning his head to peer
and listen and the coughing grunt of the
roan was his first warning that the horse
had been hit the aqimal was down
sprawled on its flank and the legs
thrashed in the last convulsive throes as
cass jumped toward the huddled shape
one of those three wild bullets from
below had found a broader target than
cass gentry

  cass locked his teeth together and a
senseless surge of anger jerked him half
a stride toward the twisting tunnel of
darkness that had swallowed the three
stampeders marooned by night in a
strange country where queer business
prowled afoot and astride it was a crazy
finish to a totally crazy proceeding

  fire in the sky gun-fights near and
far and wild-shooting night riders chas-
ing the tag of a herd hell-bent through
the ragged roughs what kind of sense
could a man puzzle out of such a night-
mare
chapter xiv

the rattlesnake band

cass swabbed the smear of rain from
his face with a well-dampened sleeve
and returned to the shelter of the tarp to
think it over there were several possi-
bilities he could surmise but he quickly
concluded that what had happened was
not so important as what might still hap-
pen

   this little stretch of country wouldnt
be exactly healthy for strangers prowling
the night if he was any judge for the
next little while these nearby folks would
probably be inclined to shoot first and ask
questions later cass realized too that
he wouldnt find it easy to account to sus-
picious men for his presence in the
vicinity

   his wisest move he decided was to get
himself gone from this neck of the woods
before sun-up

  he waited an hour or so smoking oc-
casionally and keeping his ears cocked
for anything that might be happening
around he heard one passing hail of
voices from the south and later a troop-
ing clop of hoofs went along the main
road the fire-glow had faded from the
sky by the time he thought it safe to
travel

  the roan would be found and most like-
ly identified but that would be a later
concern he descended the bank of the
creek aiming to cache his saddle and
bedroll at a little distance and curiosity
prompted him to scout the spot where he
had blasted down those first two bullets
he was pretty sure he had thrown a pair
of misses but it did no harm to take a
look

  as it happened it did some good his
sight was accustomed to the gloom by
now and he caught the glint of silver like
a round eye staring as he moved along
the opposite bank it was a polished stud
he saw bending closer he picked up a
black hat-a hat with a snakeskin band
and with a bullet-gouge slanted through
the upper crown of it

  he slipped the snakeskin band in his
pocket remembering   

  the buck-toothed man

   the image of that gopher-face recalled
the hazy resemblance that cass couldnt
quite put his finger on there was some-
thing about that speckled countenance
which escaped his memory but the more
important angle was the man who had
met mr buck-tooth so briefly and mys-
teriously at squawmans knob that after-
noon how did fat wash parsons tie in
wth these dark-riding stampeders

  cass hid his roll and saddle and the
carbine too he draped the saddlebags
over his shoulder and skirted the road
for a slow mile or two walking north
the drizzle kept slacking then starting up
again and cass began to cuss his clothes
were soaked a sore spot was wearing on
his heel and he had just about decided
to stop at the first place he came to-
suspicious or not-when he made out a
bobbing light that approached

  cass stepped back to watch it come
it was a plodding buggy curtained against
the rain and cass moved forward again
lifting one arm in signal he called out a
hail and the driver pulled up beside him

   can you give a man a lift to the near-
est shelter cass said

  the side-curtain was unfastened a
head poked out and in the shine of the
riding lamp cass saw familiar bearded
features

is that you gentry dr farabaugh
exclaimed what in the devils name are
you doing afoot on such a night in this
forsaken country

 there were explanations as they drove
 along a natural caution made cass
 withhold any mention of wash parsons
 nor did he speak of the snake-banded hat
 the doctor listened intently to the outline
 of the other events cass could feel tight-
 ening muscles in the arm that touched his
 own and farabaughs voice was harsh
 with anger

   stirring trouble he said raiding
 and shooting damn their souls last night
 it was the anchor and they come right
 back for a crack at the lig next door
 no wonder men are talking of pulling
 stakes out of such a crazy country

   if you ask my opinion cass said its
 a little too crazy a clever thief like they
 claim ollie shand to be would know
 enough to spread his operations what
 good is it to cut out a bunch of stock and
 start em on the jump if the ranch hands
 are close on your tail its the damned-
 est kind of rustlin i ever heard of

   i suppose it is the doctor said
 thoughtfully the more i see of this
 so-called human race-yes and myself
 included-the more i think were all born
 with one sort of insanity or another

   he laughed briefly im dog-tired
 which is why i talk this way it was one
 of those fellows at burnt mills knife
 wounds-i couldnt pull him through he
 was no more than twenty-five a magnifi-
 cent specimen and the woman hed fought
 for-queenie they called her-came to
 hold his dying hand

   if that poor young fool could have had
 his choice then i kept wondering would
 he have traded one day of the fifty years
 he might have lived for a hundred such
 women as queenie

   the buggy swayed the mucked road
 while cass thought that over most like-
 ly yes he said presently hed have
 traded a hundred years if he wanted her
 bad enough theres some things that
 cant be figgered out by common sense
 men just aint built that way

   the doctors head turned toward him
 cass heard the whisper of a deep breath
 then a chuckle

   i see were another pair said fara-
 baugh who share the same insanity i
 guess id better stop at the dot to see if
 my services are needed theyll take my
 guarantee for you i imagine if you want
 to pass the night and lend you a horse
 in the morning

   well- cass hesitated what time is
 it anyhow

   his own impressions counted the hour
 as late the doctors watch however still
 lacked minutes of midnight

   some of the men at the mills the doc-
 tor said were telling around that you
 raised considerable excitement this after-
 noon one fellow who rode from town
 reported that abel bannister was hunting
 you along wampum street with blood in
 his eye you seem to be getting results
 gentry but i hope youve considered the
 dangers of pushing things too fast

   your little banker mentioned that
 cass said the point is that i want em
 roused the handiest thing thats hap-
 pened so far was that ambush tex cordill
 laid out for me and swifty a little more
 of the same and mebbe we can start to
 cull out the sheep from the billygoats
 but ollie shand might not happen
 along the next time the next bushwhack
 bullet might not miss that wasnt exact-
 ly what i meant though i was thinking
 of mary ellen if anything should happen
 to her- wait a minute is someone
 swinging a light along the road

 a yellow lantern moved in the dark-
 ness ahead he always lighted his
 buggy the doctor explained to identify
 himself on his dark journeys there was

 never any telling around what turn of the
 trail the need for him might be waiting

   he pulled up beside a slicker-coated
 horseman who greeted him by name it
 was no emergency summons the man
 was a hand from the lig one of an angry
 cordon scattered through the vicinity

   doggondest business i ever heard of
 he said they come down bold as brass
 on thirty-forty head of market stock wed
 gathered in the home pasture the night
 and the rain was with em of course and
 they fired some winter sheds and feed
 ricks over towards the timberline to draw
 us off

   before we was half-started though
 theyd begun to move the beef three-
 four of em was stationed to hold us off
 and we had a lively time there poppin
 back and forth whilst the rest of the crew
 headed the bunch up foxfire run they
 never had a chance to get away though
 they gave er up in lessn half a mue
 scatterin

   anybody hurt the doctor asked
 ony the boss he worked his temper
 up so high it blew his hat off man was
 he on fire he was primed to storm dev-
 ils notch all by his lonesome if that
 would put ollie shands neck into his
 hands he rode for town a while ago to
 see what hell he can prod out of abe
 bannister and his vigilantes

   how could you tell it was ollies
 crowd

   they headed out straight west when
 we took after em who else would it be
 whod brazen a job like that exceptin
 ollie 

   the doctor looked at cass you want
 to stop

   i seem tove changed my mind cass
 said ill sit where i am into town if
 you dont mind company

   if youll take the reins and let me
 catch a nap the doctor told him youll
 be more than welcome

   when they were moving again cass re-
 turned to the previous conversation you
 mentioned mary ellen what was you
 drivin at

   i was thinking she might be safer out
 of town those troubles youre bringing
 back to life might lash at her you know
 that cant be risked gentry shes-well

 i refuseto chance it

   you mean that note she got

 the doctor made a nervous growling
 sound the notes-yes and other things

 i can see now that i was selfish perhaps
 in urging her to stay she has done so
 much for mrs farabaugh-well i find
 myself in a peculiar position i could
 hardly suggest that she go elsewhere for
 a while but i thought that you might
 persuade her-

   he moved his hands in sweeping ges-
 ture damn it i dont know what to say

 i dont know whats to be done gentry
 the buggy poked on cass stared
 through rain-splashed isinglass into a
 dim world pressed thi and close he
 could see no more than the shape of the
 horse and the outline of the road the
 single sound he heard was the plock of
 hoofs monotonous

 how long they rode in silence he did
 not know his thoughts were vague aim-
 less and he did not realize where they
 were trending until he heard the sound
 of his own dull voice

 you think shes still in love with this
 martin burdette

 the words had been spoken uncon-
 sciously and he glanced in swift embar-
 rassment toward his tall companion the
 doctors head lolled on his shoulder his
 weariness must have wooed -sleep instant-
 ly for he gave no answer

 cass licked his dry lips in the back of
 his mind was a bothersome little detail

x 
 hed have to discuss with swifty ollie
 shand might not happen along the next
 time so the doc had spoken in re-
 counting the tale of the kettledrum attack
 even to bearpaw cass had been careful
 to eliminate any reference to the yellow-
 haired man where then had the doctor
 gained his information

chapter xv

 hate or trust

 the rain had spluttered out and the
 night was clearing when they came
 to triangle town at the upper end of
 wampum street the lights glowed in a
 yellow row and the sounds of pay-night
 the music and merriment increased as
 the buggy rolled on the doctor massaged
 his eyes with the heels of his hands

   youll do me a favor he said if
 youll put this horse in my stable i was
 called to burnt mills unexpectedly and
 theres a sick girl at mrs rambos i
 should see again im afraid its pneu-
 monia if theres a downstairs light in the
 house you might leave word that ill be
 along shortly

   cass said hed be glad to he had done
 considerable thinking on the last shank
 of the ride and had come to see that tri-
 angle town was where he belonged right
 now any action that developed would
 probably start from here there was the
 business of wash parsons to be looked
 into for one thing and it might he a ripe
 time too to hear what abel bannister
 had to declare

   looking for cass gentry was he with
 blood in his eye well cass had a little
 of the same in his own hed had his
 horse shot from under him you could
 almost say and he was wet and cramped
 and bedraggled and footsore hed never
 be better primed for a skirmish

   council street was dark and he saw
 no light in the doctors house when he
 turned into the side passage along the
 fence however he noticed glowing win-
 dows at the rear a light still burned in
 the kitchen though he could mark no
 movement there as the buggy squeaked
 past

   there was a good-sized stable beyond
 cass found a lantern on a shelf and its
 rays revealed an extra buggy as well as
 two stalled horses he drew some water
 and his lips framed a whistle as he set to
 work he owed a debt to the mud-
 splashed animal in the traces he consid-
 ered and this was one way of paying it

he had the horse rubbed dry when
he heard the outer scrape of footsteps
he stepped out of the circle of light in-
stantly wary but some foreshadowed in-
stinct told him who it was even before
he saw her at the entrance

 mary ellen halted oh- she said i
 thought it was-

   she looked at him queerly and for a
 few seconds cass gentry couldnt find a
 word to say he stood like a gawk watch-
 ing the way she held herself light and
 shapely and the slant of her head and
 the half-smile that slowly came

   why bearpaw said youd be gone for
 a day or so i heard the buggy pass and
 i wanted to tell dr farabaugh- she
 brushed at her skirt i was sitting up-
 stairs in the dark and i thought hed want
 to know that martin burdette sent the-
 the bundle over a boy delivered it
 sometimes i have a cup of coffee with the
 doctor if im still awake when he comes
 in

   he picked me up on the road cass
 said i kind of lost my horse in an acci-
 dent i was-uh-well i went-

  never mind she said you have
 your plans and i dont intend to inter-
 fere you still havent anything definite
 have you

   not exactly no we got some leads
 that may work out though

   maggie says the whole towns talking
 about the way you lit into everybody
 there were so many times i wanted to
 kick ben quigg out of his chair that 
 made bearpaw tell that story twice he
 was prowling outside-said hed been or-
 dered to keep an eye on me do you think
 thats necessary

  well- cass shrugged theres no
 harm in it

  she had come across toward him a
 narrow bench was backed against a beam-
 support and she sat with pink-puffed
 slippers touching the lighted circle that
 the lantern painted upon the floor

   sit down a minute she said and she
 looked at him with wise eyes i want
 you to know-

   cass sat

   i guess you have reason to call me
 afraid she said i was afraid-dread-
 fully these troubles had gone on so long
 they had piled on so thickly that i-oh
 i dont know how to say it it was the
 fact that i didnt know what to fear that
 made me afraid

   sure cass said like a noise in the
 dark youre scared until you know what
 made it

   thats it-thats what i meant and
 then besides i had no one to depend on
 there was no one -she compressed her
 lips- i could count on for sure

   one said this and one said that until
 i wasnt even sure of myself sometimes
 but all thats over now im not afraid
 any more please believe me ive been
 very very sure of myself-

   she met his gaze steadily since this
   morning

  was that what had happened to him
  cass wondered was self-assurance the

 new ease which rode him lightly through
 the day

  he gave up that thought for mary
 ellen was talking again

   ive found someone i can trust cass
 gentry she said ive put my troubles
 in your hands and i-well maybe ive
 put myself in them ive borrowed your
 confidence your strength-

   her lips were trembling there was a
 wet shine in her eyes as she turned her
 head away

 the best cass had to offer was a stiff
 grin long ago he had toughened his
 hide against soft emotions in the world
 he had made for himself each man devel-
 oped a shell for the rest of that world to
 see he had a swift sense of guilt of
 shame that was partly due to seeing her
 so and partly to the response in him that
 needed such a heavy hand to curb

   i certainly appreciate- he said halt-
 ingly ill do the best i can-

   its hard to explain she went on soft-
 ly her face still averted its something
 i saw in you from the first moment
 youre like the man i loved the most and
 hated the most-my father

   i fought against him i opposed the
 things he stood for just as i opposed you
 yesterday while he lived though i nev-
 er had to doubt my protection my safety
 sure sure cass said hastily i kind
 of been thinkin about that this letter
 somebody sent and with troubk apt to
 crop out any day it might be best if youd-
 travel out somewheres until we know
 how we stand if your friends could
 count you safe it would relieve their re-
 sponsibility

   what friends

   well bearpaw-the folks in town you
 know-

   she faced him my friends- she said
 softly ive had to learn a new way of
 counting my friends cass gentry im
 not afraid i tell you are you running
 off to find a hideaway

   cass shrugged he turned his frowning
 glance from the lanterns glow fumbling
 for answer and the movement he saw in
 the darkness beyond the stable door was
 no more than a flutter a shifting shadow
 among the shadows a ghost-face blob of
 gray it was wind it was mist it was
 nothing-

  he smashed at mary ellen with the
 wide sweep of his arm with a backhand
 jerk that struck the base of her throat and
 toppled her from the teetering bench in
 the same abrupt move he was thrusting
 his own body backward grasping his hol-
 stered pistol as he fell

   he thought he could feel the burn of
 the bullet across his cheek in the instant
 of the guns explosion from the outer
 darkness

murder goes to sea

the dramatic story of a navy hospital ship
on which death was a stowaway

by allan r bosworth
beginning in argosy soon


 i got no sword

there was a boy one time and his
name was cuffee at first he was
cuffee stevens because then he be-
longed to mr lucius stevens of kent
island in the chesapeake bay

 mr lucius stevens was a right good
man to belong to never putting out a
task that was too hard and making sure
that his slaves didnt eat terrapin more
than twice a week even if the law said
a man could feed his slaves terrapin
three times a week but no more

  thats why a lot of folks couldnt agree
with cuffee when he begged lieutenant
richard kennemont to buy him from
mr lucius stevens because lieutenant
kennemont didnt have the hogs or the
house or the harvest that mr stevens
had

  but cuffee he always was sot in his
ways and when he saw lieutenant ken-
nemont in jiis uniform riding his high-
stepping black horse with the white
blaze over its eyes he said to himself
i got to belong to him and he begged
so hard both mr lucius stevens and
lieutenant kennemont that finally the
lieutenant he bought cuffee

 most times lieutenant richard ken-
nemont was riding around the country
on his high-stepping black horse afri-
qye with his boot white with dust and
his teeth like ivory in his dark face when
he smiled at folks as he rode past touch-

cuffee was a black boy and he
had his mind sot on being war-
folks he went at it so hard
you couldnt tell whether he was
a traitor or a hero

ing the peak of his hat with one finger
like a salute

  folks said lieutenant kennemont
would never have a shilling while there
was a king to beat a knave in a pack of
cards but he was a smiling man and
everybody loved him and after lieu-
tenant kennemont bought cuffee from
mr lucius stevens cuffee always rode
behind his new master on a mule that
pointed the path with its ears with every
step it took and cuffee got downright
proud

  i guess lieutenant kennemont got
fonder of cuffee than he was of anything
except his high-stepping horse afrique
and mistress mary dodson who was the
daughter of the biggest military man on
the whole eastern shore of maryland in
them days that was in 

  mistress mary dodsons father he was
captain william dodson and he was
short and fat with a red face and a set

of false teeth that somebody in baltimore
had made for him but they never fit
just right

  but captain dodson was a brave man
and the most military man i ever see
he might remind you of a little red
rooster but there come a time later
when he showed how brave he was
against mr admiral cockburns men
him and lieutenant richard kennemont
and cuffee

i remember captain dodson strutting
up and down in front of the dragoons
and he was hollering

  men the enemy is at our gates he
yelled the despicable cockbum-
that was mr admiral cockburn the
englishman that everybody hated be-
cause he burned and stole-is moving
up the bay with eight sail three brigs
and five armed barges

 then the dragoons mumbled and
shifted their feet like they were anxious
to get jt thgjftfitish them dragoons

  lieutenant kennemont the captain
said will review the company captain
smith and i are going to retire to plan
our defenses

  well i knew what plans they were go-
ing to fix up because i was mr mitchell
taylors man and mr taylor owned the
ordinary right off the square and cap-
tain dodson and captain smith they


were both gentlemen that liked a drink
and anyways the british were down be-
low hoopers island and they wouldnt
be at saint michaels for another couple
of days

 but lieutenant kennemont-lord
how he worried he wanted the dragoons
and the light infantry from miles river
and the sharpshooters from royal oak
to dig ditches and put logs down and
haul cannons and things like that for
fear the british would catch them with
their buttons undone but the dragoons
they was mostly quality and they didnt
want tobe working like field hands

  i remember this one day when i was
watching the dragoons drill in the
square out of step and laughing and
talking and lieutenant kennemont seri-
ous with a thin mouth up ahead on that
high-stepping black horse

  cuffee was over to one side out of the
way of the white folks on his mule and
watching lieutenant kennemont but i
was watching mistress mary dodson and
i could tell that as far as she was con-
cerned there wasnt anybody else in the
square but the lieutenant

  later i saw cuffee and i told him 
said

  pretty soon the lieutenant will be
getting married the way mistress mary
dodson looked at him and then youll
have to work like the rest of us instead
of riding around on a mule pulling faces
at us that has to walk

  cuffee shook his head and looked like
id said there wasnt no lord god he
couldnt think of his master married
cuffee always thought that lieutenant
kennemont belonged to him and the
high-stepping black afrique

  were war folks he told me we
got to whup the british before we do
anything else

  yuh i said to him white folks
ive known dont let war or nothing else
stand in the way once they look at each
other like mistress mary dodson looked
at lieutenant kennemont

  just then mister taylor my master
fetched me a clip on the ear for talking
about quality and for not doing some
task i forgot to do so i left cuffee and
went about my work but i could see
that what i said worried that boy he
was a slow-thinking man but once he
got something in his head nobody could
get it out without they used a bung-
starter

thats howcome cuffee got in
trouble somehow he got it into his
head that if mistress mary dodson mar-
ried his lieutenant kennemont the lieu-
tenant would quit fighting the war and
if the lieutenant wasnt war folks cuffee
would have to handle a plow or tend the
front door he worried so much he for-
got who he was and he spoke up like he
shouldnt have

  he told lieutenant kennemont that
he cuffee didnt want the lieutenant to
marry mistress mary dodson

  now the lieutenant was a smiling man
that killed the rockfish he caught when
he was fishing right off instead of let-
ting them gasp themselves to death in
the bottom of the boat but he couldnt
let cuffee say that

  he looked at cuffee with his eyes get-
ting bigger and bigger and then he haul-
ed off with his riding whip and he crop-
ped cuffee across the face with it you
got to remember that in them days a
white gentleman didnt even speak the
name of a lady without she or one of
her kinfolks was there and for a boy to
talk up like that was downright dis-
graceful

  so a gentleman like lieutenant rich-



ard kennemont he really had to crop
cuffee for that even if he was sorry for
it the minute after the whip laid a red
streak across cuffees chocolate face
but the lieutenant couldnt tell cuffee
he was sorry because that wouldnt be
right either so instead he turned and
walked out of the room

  now there are children and there are
dogs and there are horses that wont
take a whip and there are slaves too
that wont they dont cry or bite or
kick but theyd be better off if they did

  a whip stings and you can holler and
carry on and yell the sting right out of
your skin but if you grab your lip with
your teeth and swallow the yell the
hollering stays inside you always some-
where back of your ears youve seen
a horse drop its head and shiver when
somebody crops it too hard and youve
said to yourself thats going to be a
bad horse some day lieutenant ken-
nemont he knew horses and he should
have looked back at cuffee and maybe
things wouldnt have happened like they
did if he had

  cuffee stood there looking after the
man he thought was the nearest thing
to god almighty the man that had just
cropped him across the face he was a
slow-thinking boy and he couldnt think
things out very good he only knew
that he was full of sorrow and mistress
mary dodson had something to do with
it so he decided that mistress mary
dodson was no friend of his and that
was bad bad

cuffee was sot in his ways he sot
his mind on getting bought by lieu-
tenant kennemont and he did it he sot
his mind on brass buttons for his coat
and he got them only lieutenant ken-
nemont made him take them off because
nobody but quality was supposed to
wear brass buttons

  cuffee sot his mind on the thought
that he had to keep mistress mary dod-
son from marrying his lieutenant ken-
nemont and there wasnt going to be any
jump too high for him to take to do that

  cuffee figured out that if mr admiral
cockburn and his britishers came to
saint michaels then lieutenant kenne-
mont would be so busy whupping the
british that he wouldnt have time to pay
suit to mistress mary dodson and he
would forget he was in love with her
and he would forget that his boy cuffee
ever spoke out of turn he would be so
busy riding around on his high-stepping
black with cuffee on his mule behind
him now you know that dont make
sense but it made sense to cuffee and
thats why he ran away

  yes sir ran away from his master
lieutenant kennemont on the mule the
lieutenant buyed for him knowing he
was likely to be a notch-eared man the
rest of his life even a smiling man like
the lieutenant would be bound to notch
cuffees ears because that was the law
like shooting a sheep-killing dog and
paying taxes

  lieutenant kennemont he was good
and mad when he come around to mr
taylors ordinary one morning and i
heard him talking to mr taylor

  ive lost my boy the lieutenant said
and his face was red he was so mad he
ran away some time during the night
ive seen him talking a lot with your
boy sol and maybe sol knows where
he headed to

  so mr taylor summoned me into the
room and i told lieutenant kennemont
i didnt know where cuffee had gone
honest i didnt but i did say i saw cuf-
fee riding south on his mule soon after
daybreak just after i got up and started

my early tasks and that was true i
saw cuffee but cuffee he didnt see me

  that fool boy the lieutenant said
dont even know how to run away
right setting off on his mule in the day-
light if he was smart hed go at night
and travel on foot

 mr taylor he spoke up slow and
thoughtful

  youd better get that boy lieuten-
ant he said if the britishers happen
to grab him he could tell them a lot
about that ten-gun battery off deep
water point

  the lieutenant he looked madder but
then he laughed

  that boy he said hates britishers
worse than i do he wouldnt tell them
anything

  and then he jumped on his high-step-
ping black and set out after cuffee but
he never found him that day he didnt
because that was the day the britishers
started raiding the islands just south of
saint michaels and the lieutenant was
too busy to hunt long for cuffee

mr admiral cockburn must have got
tired of salt pork and fish for his
dinner table because he sent his men out
to get some fresh meat and they got it
them britishers by stealing it from the
plantations they raided

  now in those days there were federal-
ists and democrats and republicans in
the assembly at annapolis where they
made the law the federalists were all
against the war but the republicans and
democrats were all for whupping the
british

 and itwas a funny thing but the
sailors and marines from mr admiral
cockburns fleet picked on plantations
owned by federalist gentlemen more
than they did on the places owned by
republican and democrat gentlemen
that was because the federalists they
were the rich folks and ive heard mr
taylor say the federalists didnt want
the war because it was bad for their
business

  so long was their dirty gold safe
mr taylor used to say and they would
not care if we went back to being a
crown colony

 well the federalist gentlemen
changed their mind quick enough when
the british snuck up on their islands and
stole and burned and sometimes spoiled
things they didnt want out of down-
right meanness then you should hear
the federalists holler for a bigger mili-
tia and more cannons and even warships

 even the dragoons forgot to strut
around and talk big after those first
raids they got busy and they finished
fort stoakes in a hurry with two six-
pound cannon that mr jacob gibson
had just given them

 while the lieutenant was riding
around gathering up men that day of
the raids cuffee was with the british
yes sir that boy had got himself cap-
tured scarcely three hours after he left
saint michaels at dawn riding on his
mule

  he run smack into a patrol of british
marines raiding a place about ten miles
south of saint michaels and they grab-
bed him quick because cuffee was a big
boy and the british needed strong men
to do the hard tasks

cuffee didnt mind being captured
not at first it was what he wanted
to tell the truth because he had his plan
he thought was going to make lieuten-
ant richard kennemont forget he was
in love with mistress mary dodson he
was going to inform to the british and
tell them there wasnt any ten-gun bat-
tery near deep water point like the
british thought there was

  now this was bad but cuffee didnt
mean it as bad as it sounds here cuffee
knew that there wasnt a british fleet
that could whup lieutenant kennemont
and what he wanted was for the british
to attack saint michaels so the lieuten-
ant wouldnt have any time to pay suit
to mistress mary dodson

  when the british raiders grabbed cuf-
fee he told them he wanted to go with
them because he had something to tell
their mr admiral cockburn

  what do you want to talk to the ad-
miral for boy they asked him cuffee
grinned and shuffled his feet

  i know about the guns at saint
michaels he told them and i figure if
i tell mr admiral cockburn what 
know hell see that i goes free

  yes they told him lying to cuffee
and he knew it the admiral will set you
free all right hell likely buy you a big
house in london with a red coach with
gilt

   thats fine said cuffee acting like
he was believing everything they were
saying id sure like a red coach with
gilt

   the sailors and marines they laughed
taking cuffee for a weak-minded boy-
and he was a slow-thinking boy at that
-and they put him in a boat and rowed
him out to the brig saint domingo that
was mr admiral cockburns flagship
besides the saint domingo there was
the brig contest and the brig marlbor-
ough and six or seven barges that i
dont know the names of

  cuffee told me later the ships were
the biggest things he ever saw rising up
out of the water like mountains when
the boat got close to them with guns
sticking out like a hedgehogs spines and
officers in elegant uniforms with white
lace and gold-hilted swords and the
boatswains whistle piping thin as a
railbirds cry most of the time

  well cuffee never did get to see mr
admiral cockburn but he saw the cap-
tain of the brig saint domingo and that
was pretty good for a runaway slave
the captain he was a tall man with a
long nose cuffee told me and he had a
mean mouth like a turtles but stand-
ing beside the captain was a young man
that cuffee liked right away because he
was a smiling man like lieutenant ken-
nemont and about the same age as the
lieutenant

  what do you want to tell the admir-
al the mean-looking captain asked
cuffee youd better tell me before i
put a cat to you that will make you
talk

  cuffee looked at his feet a while and
then he told the captain

  i aimed to tell mr admiral cockburn
what i got to tell i dont know as i can
rightly tell you sir

  then the young man spoke up im
the admirals nephew he told cuffee
you can tell me and ill tell the admir-
al

well cuffee thought about that a
while and lie decided that would be
all right that it would fit in with his
plan and he liked the young gentle-
man with the smile

  its about saint michaels he said
they aint got any ten-gun battery like
you think they got i belong to lieuten-
ant richard kennemont and i know
what i saw those things that look like
cannons from a ways off aint but wood
logs i helped plant those logs and i
know they cant shoot any more that a
stick of wood can shoot

  the young man mr admiral cock-

burns nephew looked at the captain of
the saint domingo with his eyebrows up
and he whistled sort of low but the tur-
tle-mouthed gentleman he didnt believe
cuffee

  its a damn yankee trick the cap-
tain said those rebels have sent this
boy here in the hopes of getting us to
attempt a landing at the town with a
small force

  cuffee shook his head at that no
sir he said lieutenant kennemont
dont know where i am even i ran
away because he whupped me

  well they busied cuffee with ques-
tions and he told them what he knew
telling the truth all the time because he
knew his lieutenant kennemont would
whup the british easy even without
cannons you see cuffee didnt know
about mr jacob gibson giving the dra-
goons those two six-pounders

  the admirals nephew he believed
cuffee but the captain of the saint dom-
ingo didnt and the two british gentle-
men got in an argument until the young
gentleman slainmed out of the room and
said he was going to see his uncle

  they kept cuffee for three days and
they busied him with questions every
day trying to catch him in a lie that
would show this up for a trick but they
couldnt and then one day the young
gentleman came into the captains room
waving a paper

  i got it he laughed i got uncles
order to lead a force on saint michaels
youll move your men into a ten-gun
battery the captain said like he was
tasting a green apple because you be-
lieve a runaway slave and then the
blame will be on my head when you
dont return

  the young gentleman laughed in that
free and easy way of his

  im taking my dancing pumps he
told the captain im going back to
england next week and ill have a dance
with some lovely yankee in saint
michaels tomorrow night to celebrate
my victory and my leave-taking

  cuffee was there grinning and feeling
good because this was what he wanted
he could fair see his lieutenant kenne-
mont whupping the british now with
him right there beside the lieutenant
he turned to the captain of the saint
domingo and he said

  can i go free now sir i was pro-
mised i would go free

  he wanted to get back to lieutenant
kennemont you understand so he could
tell his master the british were coming
finally and they could begin to fight the
war but the captain he scowled and
shook his head

  youll be in the first boat that goes
under those guns you say arent there
the captain told cuffee and i hope the
first charge of grape puts holes in your
black hide

well that wasnt the way cuffee had
planned it not because he was
afraid of the ten-gun battery because he
knew the cannons were wood logs but
he wanted te get back to lieutenant
kennemont right away so he could ex-
plain everything and get forgiven for
running away he tried to argue with
the captain but all he got for his trouble
were ten licks with the cat for talking
out of turn

  those licks hurt and cuffee ached that
night when they made him get in the
first boat full of sailors and marines that
were going to attack saint michaels the
three brigs had moved up the bay that
day and they were standing offshore out
of sight of saint michaels but inside easy
rowing distance from fort stoakes

  that was august   about four
oclock in the morning with a wet drizzle
falling and the night as black as the in-
side of a pocket cuffee he handled an
oar like they told him to but he had
trouble in his heart if he didnt get
away pretty quick he was going to be on
the wrong side when lieutenant kenne-
mont whupped the british

  the british gentleman in the stern of
cuffees boat mr admiral cockburns
nephew was all right and cuffee was
sorry he was going to get whupped and
wouldnt be able to use the dancing
pumps he was carrying with him but
he wasnt lieutenant kennemont there
was nobody like the lieutenant to cuf-
fee

  those british boats rowed right under
the wood guns at deep water point and
the outpost there was sound asleep like
always and he didnt give the alarm
they kept getting closer and closer to
fort stoakes using muffled oars and no-
body talking above a whisper and cuf-
fee kept getting more worried and more
worried finally it got so bad he could
not stand it any longer and he just drop-
ped his oar and went over the side of
the boat

  well the british couldnt shoot at cuf-
fee for fear of giving the alarm but they
couldnt afford to have cuffee telling the
dragoons that they were coming they
rowed aroundj searching cuffee but that
boy could swim under water better than
anybody i ever saw he went down and
stayed down and swam pretty near to
shore without once showing his head
and when he hit the shore he started to
run

he had to make a circle because if he
went running up to the front of the
fort hed get shot like as not making a
circle to get behind the fort was the long
way around but cuffee kept running
never minding the briars or the swamp
holes he fell into or anything he run
himself clear out of breath and then he
lay on the ground for a couple of min-
utes and he began running again

  his breath was coming like an old
dogs on a hot day when he finally got
to the fort but he had enough wind left
to start yelling for lieutenant richard
kennemont the lieutenant he tumbled
out of his blankets mighty quick when
he heard cuffees shout he reached for
cuffee and grabbed him he was mad
clear through

  you stole a mule nd you ran away
he said im going to notch you deep
and then im going to sell you clear down
to louisiana for tha salt mines
lieutenant kennemont sir cuffee
panted the british are coming they
are almost here now i came as fast as i
could but they must be right outside the
fprt sir

  british asked the lieutenant how
do you know where the british are

  i been a prisoner cuffee said nd
i was on the brig saint domingo and
theres a young gentleman with dancing
pumps you got to whup and one hun-
dred two hundred sailors and marines
they quieted their oars and they talked
low and they aim to surprise us war
folks

  well lieutenant kennemont he didnt
wait to question cuffee any more but he
gave the alarm and the drums gave a
long roll and captain dodson he came
running with his false teeth all which
way in his mouth but before the dra-
goons got fair waked up the british
come over the front of the fort yelling
and hollering and making a terrible
noise for a man thats hardly waked up

brazil and that outfit is german controlled

on the laughing lady the sailing ship he
outfitted for the search red has taken a group
of mates who are a delight to his naturally gay
heart

old hugo lunquist friend of admiral
stackleys and owner of the great tropical
fleet

connie his beautiful young niece

mark hallam handsome young industrialist
who has found a new zest for living in this
search though in love with connie he has
refrained from telling her about it because
he believes that red has first choice

at vanity point in the indies they stop
in madam tulons place and question sea-
faring men known to red burke pederson
velasquez-and get a cue to the location of
the treasure they seek but before they can
leave a new and sinister element enters the
picture

tanya padilla who has struck oil at vanity
point stops at madam tulons for supplies
for her yacht the sphinx and announces that
she is leaving

recognizing this shimmering blue-eyed
woman of the argentine as a vision he saw
once on the bund in shanghai-and whom he
has sought ever since-flannagan is at once
fascinated curious-and suspicious with mark
hallam he visits tanyas yacht at night fouls

the engine with sand and carries two german
seamen away to pedersons boat the dancer

for red flanagan is convinced that he and
his party must reach the lost freighters before
tanya gets there that her presence on the spot
will mean peril for those on the laughing
lady

and when they reach their goal-two hun-
dred miles of water between the american
naval bases of antigua and santa lucia-it
looks as if they have won the race red dives
and comes up to report that he has found the
wreck of an old wooden galleon

then mark dives staying down longer than
is wise he finds the two lost freighters but
the discovery almost costs him his life com-
ing back to the surface much too rapidly he
lands in the midst of an engagement with
tanya and her crew who have reached the
spot in a ship stolen from velasquez

tanya rams her ship into the laughing
ladys side red ashes the two boats together
and the fight is on still weighted down with
his diving suit mark fights with the only
weapon he has the knife at his side

and he acquits himself well-until a wave
of sickening blackness overcomes him   

chapter xx

            stars tonight

paxn woke him it was a live thing
now it held his arm like the jaws
of some monstrous beast it was
gnawing at his legs too

mark opened his eyes and the haze
was gone he was ill but he could see

the decks were cleared of the fighters
there were no shouts two men rigged

a diving stage to a boom fall others
were working about a pump

mark tried to sit up and found he was 
bundled in blankets they were under
him and over him and wrapped tightly
about him one touched his chin it was
hot

he coughed brandy fumes caught in
his throat his legs were driving him
mad

stay as you are mate said flana-
gans voice

mark turned his head what hap-
pened

youve picked up a touch of the
bends the staggers as well said red

 twas a cruel thing to haul you out of
fifty pounds with no time for decompres-
sion but i had no choice

the fight

over and done we own the wan-
derer

the laughing lady

gone to join her sisters below

mark saw connie coming along the
deck her arms were heavy with blan-
kets she walked to the hatch where
mark was stretched smiled and piled the
additional covers about him

just out of the oven she said ill
heat some more and bring them along in
a moment

red shook his head enough connie
youll smother the man before the stage
is rigged hell do as he is till i get
him below

below said mark and the word
sent streaks of pain through his body

aye back under pressure again



this story began in the argosy for february 
mark tis the only cure for the bends
  my legs-hurt

  i know said red the willies are
bom of the devil

  the-willies

   tis what we old-timers call the
bends youre one of us now mark re-
member the name he nodded his head
slowly aye a deep-sea man who has
worked the indies a man who can step
to the dance of the bends youll brag of
that some day

  why whispered mark

  red chuckled because it is a rare
group youve joined men who dive in
old equipment and take their chances
with staggers and chokes and paralysis
as well west indiamen and men of the
gulf and south sea pearlers too their
schooners are wood and built to hold
shell no room for decompression cham-
bers

  he took a flask from his hip and tilted
it against marks lips

  along the gulf and in other ports
where the deep-sea workers meet there
comes a night when the schooners put
out for shell and sponge and treasure
and just before the -lines are cast off
youll find men grouped in a waterfront
tavern

  divers they are who have gathered
together to step the dance of the bends
tis a private affair no women are there

  and no man may dance to the music
that night unless he has felt the bite of
the air and the pain thats built from
pressure

red glanced at the men who worked
at the stage and motioned to them
for speed then he looked at connie and
dropped a slow lid as if to tell her she
must help with a well-placed word or
two

  id like to see that dance she said
quietly her hands drew the blankets
about marks throat it-it must be a
strange sight

  a brave sight connie said red
tis danced by men with courage to
burn and they mock the thing that
twists their joints and dare it to strike
them down

  he turned to look at mark and a grin
touched his mouth and speaking of
courage you might like to know that
connie the darling saved you from tak-
ing the point of a marlin spike in your
back as nice a shot as ever ive seen it
was she caught the beggar just-

  red stop it said connie

  as i was saying red continued
when the bends dropped you during
the fight connie did a lovely job with
her rifle the rest of us were too busy
to stop but we hurried the work as best
we could and cleaned the decks com-
pletely

  old hugos bad hurt hes in his bunk
but as happy as ever a man could be
weve lost two men and good ones
mark but weve more than evened the
score

  the rest of the crew who stole this
ship are safely locked in the brig they
were men of the sphinx turned pirate
no less they took the wanderer from
velasquez when he came to answer their
call for help

  and dont forget tanya said connie
sharply why on earth she isnt in the
brig is more than i can figure

  ah now laughed red  twould not
be seemly to do such a thing a rare
devil she is ill admit but me lady has
courage aplenty

  he winked at mark and nodded his
head like a lion no less she stood at
the wheel and laughed in me face when
i told her the party was over

  not until shed tried to kill you
added connie she fired a half dozen
shots at your head and only the luck of
an irishman kept you alive

  and why not cried red did you
expect her to toss me posies

a call came from the men on deck
and red started to unwind the blan-
kets the canvas had been cut away and
mark found he was wearing three heavy
suits of long underwear a seaman
brought a divers dress and red bent
to lift marks legs

   twill hurt like the devil but theres
no other way and its lucky we are to
find these rigs on the wanderer if ve-
lasquez were broke hed have pawned
them

  he motioned to connie lift his
shoulders girl and shut your ears if he
curses you out the willies are enough
to drive a man mad

  connie crouched behind mark on the
hatch and did as she was told he tried
not to groan but it didnt work the pain
was creeping toward his groin and
bringing his breath in gasps

  others came to the hatch and one
brought a helmet no ear-phones this
time the bronze bowl went over his
head and red looked in through the for-
ward light

  the sound of the air was loud in his
ears and he opened his moijth to gulp
they carried him quickly across the
deck placed him on the stage and made
him fast

  it seemed an dge until mark saw an-
other helmet above his red lifted an
arm and the stage went up cleared the
rail and started down

  the touch of the water sent another
spasm through marks body he tried
not to scream but couldnt help it the
noise of his voice spun about his head

  then another sound came into the hel-
met a thin sound metallic and cold
it was the click of reds helmet against
his own a voice followed it and the
voice was equally cold and thin for a
moment mark thought hed lost his
senses

  tis i said red with our helmets
together we can talk quite nicely how
are you feeling mate

  bad said mark it was all he could
manage

  mind your ears and keep them open
call if they should get blocked ill take
care of your valve

  mark looked up at the green world
above him he could feel the water mov-
ing past as the stage went steadily
down at times red asked a question
and mark answered with a single word
or a grunt

  the trip was long and the pressure
mounted mark fought to keep his mind
alert in spite of the fire in his limbs
then the stage stopped and he turned his
head

  he was back again in an ocean garden
surrounded by tendrils of fern the touch
of the stage had disturbed the sand but
soon it settled and the water grew clear
mark heard the click of reds helmet

  try to straighten one arm but do it
gently said flanagan ill take your
hand and help

  mark felt reds fingers touch his he
moved an arm slowly the muscles were
taut but answered the effort the pain
had dropped to an ache

red caught the elbow between his
hands rubbed it gently and moved
the joint a moment later the work was
repeated on each of marks legs it was
slow business but mark felt as if he had
been bom anew when the pain dropped

away from his body and left him free

  hows that asked red does it
help at all

  plenty said mark i feel as if id
been beaten with a club but thats a
pleasure after the other

  it is flanagan agreed and when
youre asked what the willies are like
just do as the rest of us divers do turn
your head and shake it slowly dont
search for words to describe it mate
they havent been invented

  i agree with you red but how long
must we stay here

  a few moments  then we go up to
sixty feet

 couldnt we have a look at the
freighters now

  are you mad if you tried to stand
youd fall on your face stay where you
are and let the freighters wait ill have
a peek at them later

  what do you expect to find

  oh nothing said red and thats
exactly what i expect to hear from
tanya shes an unhung devil that one
you dont say that as if you meant it
but i do tis that which makes me
love her and speaking of devils mate
you should have seen your connie work
that rifle when you went down

  my connie said mark

  aye-your connie she loves you
lad or im mad as a monkey

  its a good thing she cant hear you
said mark he tried to laugh and did
fairly well

  isnt it though answered red and
what would you be thinking of her is
it liking or loving may i ask

  mark didnt answer for a time he
turned his head in the helmet to look off
across the garden of fern and colored
plants a round-mouthed fish came to
nibble a frond then flicked its tail and
headed for mark its eyes looked in
through the heavy glass and the round
mouth wabbled foolishly

  mark laughed in spite of his aches
what sort of an answer is that
asked red he moved his helmet to
look in at mark and his eyes were round
as those of the fish i asked if you loved
connie lunquist

of course i do answered mark
then why dont you tell her so
because im not good at making pret-
ty speeches if i tried to tell her the
blue of her eyes was sweeter by far than
the shade of the heavens id probably
stutter and stumble all over the place
no doubt youre right agreed red
but suppose you could then what
would you say if she asked you about
her hair

  id say it is beautiful

  no more thatf that

  i cant match words with you red
but if i had to describe connies hair id
say it had stolen the rich red color that
is found in molten gold and it isnt the
color alone that counts its the softness
of each strand

  wonderfully soft red i felt it against
my cheek this morning when she talked
through the phone to you

  reds chuckle was low nicely done
mate now wait until we go up a bit
then tell me of her hands

almost as he spoke the stage lifted
and the movement eddied the water
the ferns nodded slowly and a proces-
sion of fishes darted off into the depths
of the surrounding green

  a minute passed and then another
the stage drew to a stop and mark made
a final adjustment of his valve his arm
was still stiff but he could move it with
an effort and red had made no attempt
to help
   again there came the click of the hel-
 mets

   you were about to tell me of con-
 nies hands said the big man are
 they soft and smooth to the touch

   i wouldnt call them soft said mark
 slowly smooth-yes theyre all of that
 but each is firm as twisted hemp and
 equally pliant as well good hands red
 capable hands

   its part of a dream thats hard to
 recall but i seem to remember the touch
 of her fingers against my face as i
 stretched on the wanderers deck

   do vou now

    yes

   did she speak to you

    i think she did

   and what did she say

   oh its probably a wish instead of a
 memory said mark but i-thought
 she called me darling

   and if it were true

    then i havent made this trip in vain
 red all of these aches and all of these
 pains are a little price to pay id double
 a lot and add ten percent to hear her say
 it again

   will you stop talking figures when
 you speak of love cried red now tell
 me of her lips

    i wish that i could but i cant said
 mark not in the way id like to at
 least theyre as far away as the laugh-
 ing lady and equally hard to reach
 are they now said red and he
 chuckled then youve little cause for
 worry the laughing ladys very close
 to the man with the courage to reach
 her ten fathoms down and a bit to the
 south she waits for judgment day

   but i warn you mark the red-headed
 girl will never wait that long best lose
 no time when we go aboard tell her the
 things youve told me and well see what
 your lady answers

   im afraid its no use red shed
 laugh and id run away

 there was silence then and time
 limped past soon mark was able to
 stand red helped him erect and he
 grabbed the lines that met above the
 stage he moved his legs and doubled
 his arms in spite of the aching muscles

   slowly the stage was lifted in steps
 and always red warned against chill
 he must bend and flex and bend again
 he must fill his lungs till they hurt

   and at long length the surface was
 reached and the boom swung them over
 the side

   a seaman stood by to remove the hel-
 met another stripped off the suit a
 third brought blankets and bundled him
 tightly while olsen the cook poured
 steaming coffee mark gulped it down in
 spite of the burn then glanced toward
 the rail

   connie was there at her side was
 the box that held the telephone she
 was coiling the wires and stowing them
 snugly

   at last she put down the head-set
 she stood erect and rubbed her ears
 while she looked at mark and smiled

  red had come to sit on the hatch and
 drink his cup of black coffee his eyes
 looked over the rim at mark then turned
 to look at connie she wrinkled the end
 of her shapely nose and showed him the
 tip of her tongue red spluttered and
 choked and dropped the cup mark
 pounded him on the back

   ah me cried red ive burned me
 throat but thats better than burning
 ones ears i wonder how i ever forgot
 that connie could hear your voice in the
 phone with your helmet to mine
 connie-heard-

   she did if she listened said flana-

 

 gan and by the color of her cheeks
 id say that she liked it

  he looked at the sky and rubbed his
hands therell be stars tonight and a
quarter moon and a silent ship in a
tropic bay a lazy man might go to his
bunk but id call him a fool if he did

chapter xxi

cold steel rules

the afternoon had almost gone before
mark was able to stand alone red
had insisted he strip to the waist and
stretch at length under the tropic sun
to open wide the pores in his skin

  for a time mark dozed then an itch
set in that made him squirm and scratch
red joined him on the hatch watched
him wriggle and nodded approvingly

  a good sign he said the itch is
a welcome nuisance to divers tis better
to scratch than ache

  whats it from

  the air tiny bits of pressure working
clear when that happens you need have
no fear of the bends he rubbed his
hands together and glanced at the sun

  ah me time to go down and visit
the freighters to see if me hunch is
right what will you bet me theyre emp-
ty mate

  empty

  aye-emptys the word

  did tanya tell you

  not a word said red me lady is
taking her beauty nap and has locked
the door to me cabin shell join us at
supper she says and not a moment
sooner a willful person that one

  he walked to the rail and called to the
crew mark watched him dress and climb
to the stage five minutes later he was
on his way down and the tell-tale bub-
bles broke the surface

  mark leaned back on the hatch and
folded his arms to rest his head upon
them he closed his eyes and tried to
doze but his mind refused to let him
sleep

  those freighters-why did red think
they were einpty and if they were
what had happened to their cargoes
mark played with the questions and got
nowhere he drew a deep breath and
sighed

  then he breathed again more slowly
this time a deep and heavy odor of
tropic flowers had come to his nostrils-
from the island perhaps eut that seemed
odd the breeze set in from the sea

  mark tried again breathing slowly and
deep the perfume was stronger now
a strange scent heady and filled with a
nostalgic charm mark liked it he tilted
his nose and sniffed

  there was a laugh at his elbow-one
he remembered mark opened his eyes
and turned his head tanya was seated
on the hatch and she was looking at him

  the laugh still fingered the corners of
her lips beautiful lips that were slightly
fuller than connies a trifle too full
mark decided and tanyas smile was so
very wise

  did  wake you she asked quietly
  no

  she offered a cigarette and mark re-
fused tanya made a mouth angry
with me

  im sure i dont know said mark
lets call it puzzled instead youre a
strange woman tanya

 and youre a strange man she
shrugged and touched a match to her
cigarette your friends in the dufresne
industries would have been surprised to
see you a few hours ago frankly i was
surprised myself you handled that knife
as if you enjoyed it

  perhaps i did said mark he sat
erect but would you mind telling me
how you happen to know anything about
the dufresne industries

  oh i have no intention of telling you
that said tanya quickly besides it is
very uninteresting

  not to me

  but it is to me so we will not talk
about it

  would you rather talk of the men
who were killed today or about hugo
lunquist two of his ribs were broken
when you rammed the laughing lady
tanyas eyebrows lifted did you ex-
pect me to let you cripple the sphinx
and get away with it

  is that the reason you followed
  one of the reasons

  what are the others

  they too are uninteresting she
looked from the corners of her eyes and
puffed a ring of smoke at mark so-
we will not talk about them either
red flanagan may want you to talk
about them

  and if he does

  youll talk i promise you that

tanya studied the ash that grew on
her cigarette he is a hard man this
flanagan he should never have been
allowed to reach vanity point

  oh definitely said mark he waved
a casual hand as he mimicked the shad-
ow of accent that distinguished tanyas
speech a few incidental murders-a
mere trifle to a lady who works sodil-
igently to earn her pay

  he faced tanya and his voice grew an
edge ive heard red flanagan tell of
you heard him sing your name as if it
were a song heard him match the flame
of your eyes with the gleam of a rich
red ruby to hear him tell it the lord
made you and then destroyed the
mould

  marks laugh was short well perhaps
he was right without knowing it theres
hardly room in the world for two of
your kind

  my kind

  yes-a woman born in a land that is
free who sells her beauty and sells her
brain to a ruthless tribe of savage beasts
whose only thought is to chain the world
to an age of slavery

a german agent-hired for pay a
woman born in the argentine how do
you face the eyes that look back at you
when you dress your hair in a mirror
are you quite finished

  i could keep on for an hour said
mark sharply his anger had grown as
he talked

  suppose i told you i was born in
granada-that my people were people of
spain

  what difference

tanyas voice was cold a great dif-
ference my smug american we of
spain were living in peace and we asked
nothing of the world but out of the
north came the russians with their story
of brotherhood because we were free
we let them talk we let them gather
and build their webs like poisonous
black widow spiders

  and as they built they multiplied
soon they made our laws

  then another group came out of the
east italians who called themselves
fascists they promised to drive the
communists out and goaded us on to
civil war then came the nazis to help
us fight

  her laugh was brittle as breaking
glass yes-they helped they tested
their war machine over the bodies of our
sons bombed our homes and destroyed
our cathedrals but it was all in the
name of justice and truth the commu-
nist devils would destroy the world the
fascists alone could stop them

  go on said mark quietly im lis-
tening

 tanya shrugged you know the rest
how england and france and the rest of
the world stood by and said how
dreadful yes it was dreadful but they
didnt care so long as the fascist and
nazi tore at the throat of the communist
russian if spain must die then let it
die the cause will justify the end

 she held the cigarette between her
thumb and forefinger then flipped it
over the rail they didnt know the
hour would come when russian and
german would drop their masks and
stand as two blood-brothers -but tanya
padilla knew it

 and so now you help them destroy
the rest of the world said mark

  why not cried tanya i hate them
all-german english russian french
let them die as spain died let them
tear their throats apart trying to kill
each other

  and my country too

 tanya stood up your country will
live mark today it is weak jttst as you
were weak that night in madam tulons
place but that will change

  she looked off over the blue water of
the caribbean sometimes i think god
loves america it must be so hes put
the feel of cold steel into the hands of
her sons hes taught them how to use
it and today mark cold steel rules
this world of ours

 she walked to the rail and mark got
to his feet he crossed the deck and
stood beside her to watch the wavering
stream of bubbles that told where red
was walking    

chapter xxii

lost cargoes

the wanderers cabin was a comfort-
able place built somewhat like that
of the laughing lady there were the
broad table and heavy chairs and carved
oak beams in the overhead

 velasquez liked wine and the locker
was filled but olsen the cook com-
plained of the stores

  there were tins of oil and strings of
garlic and peppers enough to stock a
grocery but olseh swore no tow-headed
cook could contrive a supper fit to eat
with what he had found in the galley

  but he did his best with what he had
and supper was served at six red had
been up an hour or more but he made no
comment on what he had found instead
he dressed carefully in one of velasquez
linen suits and took his place at the head
of the table

 tanya faced him and mark sat at his
right connie sat next to mark leaving
the port side of the table clear for a
view of the adjoining cabin

  old hugo was here propped up in his
bunk insisting he could eat a steer

  there was little talk during the meal
and a tenseness grew in the cabin con-
nie was much too polite when she spoke
with tanya mark noticed this but red
seemed preoccupied with his own
thoughts

 when the coffee was served he emp-
tied his cup called for a second and
twisted it slowly between his wide fin-
gers

  the freighters are yours hugo he
said at length theyre as sound as the
day they left the dock but their seacocks
have been opened

  what about the cargo asked the old

ship owner he was peering at them

  gone said red the hulls are as
empty as a paupers pocket it seems
that someone was badly in need of ce-
ment and steel and mining machinery
i wonder just who it would be

  connies smile was sugary sweet per-
haps tanya could tell us she gets
around quite a bit-in spite of her age
red chuckled mind your manners
connie tanya is company and we
mustnt be rude to our guests still it
would save a bit of time ill admit if
she would tell us the answer

  yes it might help tanya agreed
she smiled at connie but dont scold
connie because of her manners red
shes a sweet child and rather good-
looking

  how nice of you snapped connie
ah me said flanagan when two
red-headed girls sit down to table tis
well to count the knives but time flies
as well as words and weve little enough
to spare

  he turned to tanya and his grin was
wide now suppose you tell us who got
the cargoes that used to be in the
freighters

 are you sure that i know she
asked

  very sure

  and do you expect me to tell you
red lifted a hand and scratched his
head ruefully a fine thing he said
this is supposed to be an inquisition
but me lady is asking all the questions
tanya laughed at least my questions
make sense

  dont mine

  of course not you know i wont tell
you anything

  connies voice had a sing-song lilt
oh yes you will

  tanya glanced at her in amusement
what makes you so sure

connie put one finger to her cheek
thoughtfully its a long story but
ill make it as short as possible you
see i found a waffle-iron in the galley
miss padilla a large round waffle-iron

  and it reminded me of a broadway
show i saw a few years ago i cant re-
member the name of it but it seems the
plot had something to do with a missing
heiress a dozen girls tried to claim the
fortune but none of them succeeded be-
cause the real missing heiress could easi-
ly be identified

  mark had seen the show he pushed
back his coffee cup and rested one elbow
on the table then he rested his chin
against the palm of his hand and tried
to smother his laughter

  tanyas eyebrows had lifted and she
was looking at connie curiously so was
red flanagan

 old hugo knew his broadway and the
ship owner shook an angry finger at his
niece connie ignored him

  do you get the point miss padilla
asked connie demurely

  im afraid i dont answered tanya
what connection is there between a
missing heiress and a waffle-iron

  a very close one said connie you
see-when she was just a tiny girl the
heiress had wandered into the kitchen
she was climbing to the jam closet when
her foot slipped and she fell right square
on the hot waffle-iron

  connie cried red are you mean-
ing to insinuate that-

  insinuate hell snapped connie
why not apply a hot iron where itll do
the most good she jumped to her feet
and pointed a finger at tanya

  if that red-head thinks shes tough
ill show her what the word really
means coming around here smashing

into peoples schooners shooting at peo-
ple sinking freighters-

  easy cried red he grabbed con-
nies arm easy girl

  let me alone connie yelled ive
been working up to this for hours sup-
pose we hadnt hauled mark aboard in
time suppose the bends had killed
him suppose-

  she jerked her arm free and now
you sit here and play footy-footy under
the table with that woman-

she reached for a cup and red wrap-
ped his huge arms about her for a
moment he held her tightly while con-
nies heels stamped against the deck and
reds feet alternately mark wanted to
laugh but didnt dare

  and then as he thought of what con-
nie had said mark lost all desire to
laugh tanya was smiling as she sat
quietly at the table watching red

  at length connie realized the useless-
ness of her struggle she stopped as
quickly as she had started red drop-
ped his arms and sat down

  ah me he said sure theres no-
thing like a brisk walk around the park
to settle your dinner	m

  he turned quickly to connie and so
you wont be starting another brawl be-
fore ive finished me coffee ill tell you
now that i need no words of tanyas to
let me know whats become of the
freighters cargoes

  then why didnt you say so con-
nie demanded

  it might be that i had no chance
said flanagan cautiously however the
answer is plain as the hair on your head
and thats most certainly red
auburn

  red said flanagan and dont be
reaching for that cup

  my hair is auburn said connie she
turned to mark isnt my hair auburn
mark lifted both hands definitely
connie made a snoot at red and the
big man glanced quickly at mark trai-
tor he said from the corner of his
mouth then turned to connie again

   if youll step to that locker just back
of your shoulder youll find a pair of
dividers and a set of charts give me the
chart that shows the indies and in turn
ill show you whats become of the car-
goes

chapter xxiii

no coral beach

connie waited until olsen had clear-
ed the table and lighted the bronze
ships lamp that hung above it she
spread the chart of the indies before red
and rested one elbow on his shoulder

  mark leaned forward to see the chart
and noticed tanya was doing the same

  red put one point of the dividers on
the eastern mouth of the panama canal
and swung the other point in an arc that
touched antigua santa lucia and trini-
dad

   youll notice he said that each of
these three bases which weve acquired
from the british is about twelve hundred
miles from the panama canal jamaica
is closer less than half that distance

  but jamaica is full in the crossroads
of a dozen freighter routes-a busy
place indeed although an excellent base
for the protection of the canal

  add nassau and bermuda to the
north and georgetown to the south and
we find the canal ringed by a chain of
steel

  he put down the dividers and looked
wisely at mark then lifted one eyebrow
slightly now if you were a german


which god forbid and your job were to
destroy the canal just how would you
go about doing it

  mark shook his head slowly off-
hand id say those new bases would
block any attempt weve started con-
struction of yards and stationed units of
our fleet on some of them

  then theres the air force-bombers
and fighters ready to go aloft at a mom-
ents notice no hostile aircraft carriers
could get through that ring and if they
launched their planes from beyond it
our fighters could beat them to the
punch

  quite true said red but suppose
you too had a base in the indies sup-
pose you had a hundred planes safely
tucked away on an island less than
twelve hundred miles from the panama
canal

  thats impossible cried mark

  it is now said red he chuckled
well maybe so mate-but suppose you
were offered the choice of the islands to
build such a base as a german which
would you pick

  mark glanced at the chart id take
an island here in the group between
antigua and trinidad lets see-domi-
nica might be a good one

  why

  well its only eighty miles from
santa lucia and about an equal distance
from antigua while some of my planes
were attacking the panama canal others
could take care of those two bases nicely
trinidad and georgetown would be an
hours flying time away and my planes
could take a crack at jamaica on their
return from the canal

  mark rubbed a quick hand over his
chin as he studied the chart and mapped
his imaginary campaign

  it would be a surprise attack of
course a night attack the first bomb
that landed on the canal would be the
declaration of war

  and what would the canal defenses
be doing asked red

vtothing said mark oh theyd
 hear the planes but that would
mean nothing to an army at peace be-
sides our own planes are practicing
night flights from the new bases con-
stantlythe setup is perfect the pana-
ma canal would be destroyed before the
army knew we were at war

  and what of your own planes
thell with them said mark the
canal and the destruction of those bases
is worth a few hundred planes to any
country

  red flanagan smiled but that island
youve picked belongs to the british i
doubt theyd be sleeping while you built
your base

  mark smiled too i agree with you
but you asked which island id pick
dominica seems perfect except as you
say it is owned by the british

  look north thirty miles and what do
you see asked red

  again mark studied the chart marie
galante and the islands about guadelope
-and this one where were anchored
now

  all owned by the french said red
quietly

  mark lifted his eyes to look at flana-
gan you think-

  that the germans are building a base
nearby finished red i do mate and
theyre using the steel and cement and
mining machinery that were in hugos
freighters

  the stuff was ordered by the caceres
mining outfit to fill specifications drawn
up for a plane base a hidden base cut
into the side of a hill



  in europe theyre known as nests
and hornets nests they are a deep shaft
to the hanger and machine shops below
and a catapult at the waters edge to
launch the planes in a hurry germany
has dozens of them so has england
the technique is hardly new

  but it takes men to build such a
nest

  it does agreed red they can be
landed from submarines but its a dif-
ficult job to feed them

  he turned and grinned at tanya  tis
for that reason me lady has come to the
indies-she and her beautiful yacht
food for the workmen and coarse food
at that some she bought at martinique
some more at kingston or puerto rico

  but vanity point was a handy spot
and she brought her pitcher to the well
once too often

  mark looked at tanya is this true

tanyas smile was one of amusement
it might be rather difficult to
prove she turned to flanagan you
should have been a detective red you
make absurdities sound so real

  dont i now said red

  of course there is the matter of wa-
ter said tanya casually a gang of
men large enough to build such a base
as you describe would keep the sphinx
rather busy

  it would red agreed and for that
reason i expected to find none of your
friends when i searched this island be-
fore breakfast tis a dry place unless
there is rain and when that comes the
trees devour it

  he reached forward and jabbed a wide
finger at the chart but this neighbor-
ing island has a fresh-water stream and
the shore lifts high from a shallow hay-
a lovely place for a nest of planes so
lovely that ive decided to visit it direct-
ly

  he pushed the chart across the table
and got slowly to his feet hugo had been
listening from the nearby cabin and now
the old ship owner laughed

  nicely done red he said too bad
the wanderer has no radio admiral
stackley would be glad to hear that
story

  hell hear it soon enough ill pass it
along when we get to vanity point he
walked into hugos cabin and seated
himself near the bunk and how goes
the ribs mate feeling better

  never mind the ribs said hugo
slowly a half dozen lines grew deep
in his forehead that base red-do you
know what it means if we find it

  i do said red it means ill be
through with this whole silly business
he grinned and put a wide hand over
his chin it means ill pick up a deep-
water schooner such as this wanderer
here ill stock it well with provisions
and beer then off ill go across the paci-
fic to a spot where the black pearls grow

  a wonderful place hugo a coral
beach and waving palms and a warm
breeze to ruffle your hair there ill
stretch at me ease as nice as you please
and ill dream of me red-headed girl
while your country fights a war

  my country fights a war

  hugo shrugged and winced at the
movement a german base in the
indies would be an act of war red if
the story got out wed have no choice but
to fight

  i hadnt thought of that said flana-
gan slowly still tis not a bad idea
either we must tangle with the devils
eventually

  perhaps not said the ship owner
and god forbid that you or i should
be the one to light the fire

  time is a precious thing mate just
now our country needs every moment
ships are building and guns and planes
men must be trained to fight

  and who knows but what the day
may come when the very sight of our
armed might will hold our foes in
check

  i doubt it said red

  i doubt it too but its not for us to
decide aboard the wanderer send your
mesage to admiral stackley but be care-
ful how you phrase it

  have you any suggestions

  hugo paused then he nodded his old
gray head you might suggest weve
found a spot that would serve as an ex-
cellent practice range to test our navys
guns admiral stackley will understand
give him the bearings and close your
key the rest lies with god and the men
in washington

  i will said red as he walked to the
door provided my guess is right

 chapter xxiv

           double warning

the quarter moon was riding a cloud
close down to the eastern horizon
when mark left the cabin to go on deck

  red was at the wheel when he saw
mark he called and pointed over the
wanderers crumpled bowsprit

  mark followed the direction of reds
hand and saw a small island set alone on
the dark sea the schooner eased off a
point and the island moved into the
moonstreak

  three lanquid palms topped a pro-
montory that was black against the
moons silver below was the surf a
curling line of phosphorous that rippled
against the base of the rock

  tanya island called red do you
like the name mate

  its rather appropriate said mark

he walked to the wheel and leaned
against the binnacle what happens to
tanya if your guess is good

  which tanya-the island or me red-
headed girl

  the girl said mark does she go
back to the states to stand trial

  trial for what

  i dont know the legal term said 
mark but as an enemy of the united
states shes due for a long stay in some
federal prison

  ah me said flanagan softly en-
emy she is i grant you and as danger-
ous as she is beautiful but it troubles
me heart to think of tanya in prison
like a bird of paradise cooped in a cage
and an ugly cage at that

  her eyes would grow dim and her
cheeks would grow pale and before
many days shed pine away completely
she wasnt meant for gray stones and
iron bars mate

  would you set her free to start her
work all over again

  red chuckled shed be quick to do
that would tanya still-

  he eased the wheel a spoke and looked
up at the spread of the mainsl ah
well theres time enough to worry of
that when we drop the hook at the edge
of the bay the water is shallow further
in so well spend the night outside come
dawn well look at the island

  if this is really the base said mark
how do you suppose the freighters were
unloaded

  a barge or two would do the trick
tis a simple matter to sink them

  mark nodded that would do it still

i cant understand why the freighters
were sunk in that cove rather than-
well right here for instance
pv yp-
   smoothand

richin

 for taste

 this drink
  is sure

 h a pip-

 w-msto

 ed turned and pointed over the
av quarter toward the island the wan-
derer had just left theres a series of
shoals between the two he said and
the water is clear as crystal a plane
overhead can read the bottom as if it
were a chart

  but the ground drops down to twenty
fathom when it leaves the lip of yonder
island sure you know that yourself
you were down to see and while you
were there you found a hulk of some
ancient sailing vessel

  others are lost in that tangle of weed
and no plane will ever see them or the
freighters tis a natural basin formed
by the tides that flow through the lee-
ward islands

  a graveyard no less for sunken
ships theres a dozen like it in the car-
ibbean

but i dont recall any strong tide
you went down at the ebb said red
you should have tried in the late after-
noon sure it bounced me about like a
toy

  he was looking forward as he spoke
and mark turned to see tanya coming
toward them she was walking slowly
and she stopped by the rail to glance at
the water that washed the ships side

  mark looked at red then looked at the
moon and his smile was wise as he step-
ped away from the binnacle

  you told me thered be a moon to-
night he said loudly there may not
be many as nice as this before we get
back to the states now if my hair were
red and if my name were flanagan id
practice what i preached

  he walked forward and red looked
after him with eyes that were wide with
surprise tanya had heard him and she
laughed as he passed then turned and
went to the wheel she stood next to
red and lowered her head to read the
compass card

wytou seem to know these waters
a well she said quietly ive heard
they are very shallow for navigation
very said red it must have been
quite a trick to get the freighters in and
out again

  i wouldnt know about that

wouldnt you now

 no

  tis quite a trick to get the sphinx in
 and out too he said gravely would
 you be knowing about that me lady
 of course not

 ah me said flanagan she lies so
 sweetly this red-headed girl its a posi-
 tive joy to hear her faith i wonder
 what shell say when the wanderer
 reaches the bay and i find her friends at
 work on the air base

 youre very sure of yourself arent
 you

 very

 tanya smiled perhaps thats why
 you keep alive when i heard youd
 started up the yangtse kiang with that
 gunboat i never expected to see red
 flanagan again but-you made it

 so you knew of that eh

 yes

 and tipped a word to the japs no
 doubt

 tanya rested a small hand on his
 shoulder we happened to be on the
 same side that time i was drawing my
 pay from chiang kai-shek

 so was i

how much

 devil if i know laughed red i
 never had time to collect it

 tanya laughed too-a silvery laugh
 that matched the sweetness of the ships
 bell she let her head touch reds
 shoulder and one finger moved over the
 round of the wheel

do you remember the lakes near
yunnanfu and the river that winds
through the mountains

 i do-and well

 sometimes said tanya i wonder if
 there is another place in all the world so
 beautiful as that just above the river
 on a narrow ledge stands a gray stone
 buddhist temple

 over the ages the vines have grown
 thick and they cover the walls like a
 green dyed mantel that breathes with
 the touch of the wind

 each evening a priest in his woolen
 robe sounds a single note on a deep-
 voiced horn then a gong of bronze is
 struck three times and other priests

 come down the road that leads to the
 temple gate

  i mind them well said flanagan
 men who worship a kindly god who
 taught it is wrong to injure or kill even
 the lowly beasts kill not for pleasure
 and kill not for food is the law of the
 great gautama he they call buddha

   a sweet law this and one that might
 well heal the wounds of a sorry world
 theres a crystal spring beyond the
 temple tanya continued it empties
 into a peaceful lake where a house sits
 near the shore a pretty house of color-
 ed tile with gardens of fruit trees all
 around it

   she paused and lifted her head to look
 at red there was a time when i
 dreamed of peace so i bought that home
 from the man who owned it its mine
 red-my home but ill never see it
 again

  why not

  youll know in a moment she an-
 swered but before you do ill make a
 deal ill trade you that home to have as
 your own

   in return for what

   tanya lifted her lips and parted them
 slightly its yours red for a single
 kiss

 tthe wheel went free as red gathered
 her into his arms he dropped his
 head and his lips met tanyas for a
 moment he held her so

   then he lifted his head and looked at
 the stars ah me he whispered
  twas a costly buy she asked for me
 lips but forgot to say me heart would go
 along with them

   he lowered his eyes and looked down
 into tanyas youve sold me a house i
 could never use unless you were there to
 share it

   that cant be red

 i and cant it now said flanagan
 then take back your home and the
 price is the same and this is to seal the
 bargain

  once more his great arms tightened
 about her shoulders and he found her
 lips with his own again the mainsl

the readers viewpoint

one of our correspondents remarks on
the number of argosy writers who
have lately appeared inthe slicks it is
an interesting point and someone with
more time than we have might very well
make a years survey of the better-
known slick magazines to discover just
how many argosy names turned up in
that field our guess is that the results
would be surprising

 but we have never been disturbed by
the fact that many of our writers find
their way into the pages of our elegant
and highly advertised contemporaries
indeed we are always delighted to learn
of it for it increases the reputation of the
writer and it certainly does not harm
argosy perhaps the magazine might suf-
fer if these men deserted us as soon as
they found new markets but they dont
do that their names continue to decorate
argosys contents page

  so we remain as we are unclassifiable
and proud of it argosy cannot be set
down as a slick or a pulp or a what-
have-you it is itself and good writers
find it a good place to exhibit their wares
that is as it should be

  here is the letter that started us think-
ing along these lines

p r tilley

   i read the slick magazines quite
 often but they have never made me
 give up argosy while their stories
 may be a little better written than
 yours-and generally they are not
 even that-they always seem thin to
 me and very much the same after
 a heavy dose of young love it is
 good to get back to argosy

    it has interested me to notice how
  many argosy writers turn up in the
  slicks richard sale for instance
  with his serial in the post it was a
  good story but no better than a lot of
  his in argosy allan r bosworth
  borden chase hugh pentecost dale
  clark paul ernst jim kjelgaard
  william chamberlain max brand
  donald barr chidsey and samuel
  taylor are all names that i have no-
  ticed in the slicks taylor by the
  way has not appeared in argosy for
  a long time

    i am glad to see that men like bor-
  den chase and richard sale have not
  given up argosy entirely there is
  more fame and money to be won in
  the slicks i suppose but these men 
  must realize that argosy is not so
  conventionalized at any rate it is
  true argosy stories are not just
  repetitions that is why i have read
  the magazine for a good many years
  and will continue to do so as long as
  you maintian the same standards
  please do not fail us

  baltimore md

the reader below holds louis c gold-
smith in high regard and we are
heartily in agreement occasionally
however he is baffled by mr goldsmiths
learned discussions of the science of fly-
ing they are awesome we admit our
policy is simply to accept them at face
value mr goldsmith is a flyer and we


wouldnt for the world get into an argu-
ment with him about the behavior f a
tachometer

  kendall c davidson

    i have just finished louis c gold-
  smiths fools fly high and i want
  to say that it is one of the finest
  stories i ever read mr goldsmith
  is more or less a newcomer to argosy
  and he certainly has clicked

    as a matter of fact im not really
  an air-story fan i read them in
  argosy because i read the magazine
  from cover to cover for that reason
  i read the goldsmith novelets that
  preceded the serial and it is easy to
  see how he has developed in this last
  year or so take one of his early
  stories and compare it with fools
  fly high right away you notice
  the difference

    its the characters that make the
  difference fools fly high is not
  just a pulp air story because it has
  got real people in it-interesting
  people particularly that villain of
  his nagel a lot of times the villains
  arent interesting at all theyre just
  tough rats but nagel is an unusual
  guy and i feel as if i knew him

    one thing though about mr gold-
  smith when he starts describing just
  how the hero flies his plane half the
  time i dont know what he is talking
  about i suppose the technical stuff
  is necessary and i suppose a lot of
  people like it but i get through it as
  fast as i can or else i would end up
  with a headache people are more
  interesting to me than mechanical
  gadgets on a dashboard

   anyhow i take my hat off to mr
 goldsmith

  buffalo n y

 now a note from an admirer of robert
griffith he wants a serial you hear
mr griffith

john dotelo

   every few months you publish a
 prize-fighting story by robert grif-
 fith the last one was called omit
 flowers kindly and it was swell
 like all the rest of his now what i
 want to know is if he can write such
 good stories why cant he write a
 serial for argosy how about it

   you havent had a prize-fighting
 serial in a long time ill bet there are
 plenty of readers besides myself who
 like a good boxing story and it is
 about time you did something for us

  i think it would be a fine idea if you
  told griffith to write one with plenty
  of action and humor in it

    glad to see you had another c s
  forester story it was all right but
  of course id rather read his serials
  they were the best stories in argosy
  since i have been reading the mag-
  azine

  bridgeport conn

it is very pleasant to hear from a reader
down in south america this gentle-
man left us for quite a while but hes

back now and rapidly adjusting himself
to changes made while he was away

rafael herran

after a lapse of twenty-five years

  i	am again receiving your very ex-
  cellent publication but i have no-
  ticed many changes in the olden
  times it used to be a monthly publi-
  cation now it appears every week

   none of the old writers appear
 nowadays where are my old friends
 are they too old to write now
 where is that prince of writers al-
 bert payson terhune and seward
 w hopkins edgar franklin marie
 b schrader and so many others

    the present writers are a little dif-
  ferent and i am not well acquainted
  with them so far but i hope to be-
  come good friends with them now
  the argosy is a real fiction mag-
  azine this style is rather new to
  me and i am beginning to like it
  medellin colombia south america

mr herran asks about his old
friends well edgar franklin died
several years ago and we have had no
word from marie b schrader and sew-
ard w hopkins in a long time as for
albert payson terhune mr herrans
particular favorite he seldom does
magazine fiction these days

  the next letter is in praise of robert
carse

w wallitt

     i enjoyed carses stepsons of
  france tremendously

   that boy can certainly write i
 particularly like his way of describ-
 ing delboits impressions as he
 crawled through the grass page 

   when a man can write incidental
 description as well as exciting action
    well hes got my mark of merit
  the stars are mr wallitts-
 ed 

lets have a long serial by carse  

 i	still remember with pleasure his
 story about haiti

  new york

i got no sword

continued from page 

  so the dragoons ran every one of them
except captain dodson and lieutenant
richard kennemont and cuffee those
dragoons lit out from the fort and into
a cornfield leaving their muskets and
their blankets and everything behind
them

  captain dodson he was swearing and
cussing and lieutenant kennemont was
fair crying he was so mad cuffee stood
there with his mouth flapping open be-
cause he had thought the dragoons
would get right up and whup the british
instead of running away

then the lieutenant he ran for one
of the six-pound cannons that were
in the fort and captain dodson and cuf-
fee took out after him the three of-
them the two gentlemen and cuffee
swiveled that cannon around and point-
ed it right smack at the britishers that
were coming over the front of the fort

  cuffee he touched off that gun him-
self when lieutenant kennemont told
him to and that gun threw grape and
cannister and a twenty-seven-pound
lump of scrap iron tied up with rope
right into the middle of those britishers

  it was awful because those britishers
were almost up to the gun with the
young smiling gentleman mr admiral
cockburns nephew in the lead waving
his gold-hilted sword the grape and
cannister and the scrap iron didnt leave
hardly anything of those first britishers

 that was the only shot fired in the
battle of saint michaels the britishers
they drew off to their boats because they
thought there really was a ten-gun bat-
tery and besides the young gentleman
that had been commanding them wasnt
there to tell them what to do

  they got back in their boats and row-
ed back to the brigs and captain dod-
son and lieutenant kennemont and cuf-
fee hit out for royal oak seeing it was
no use for them to stay in the fort alone
without the dragoons coming back

  the british brigs they moved up and
fired a lot of cannon balls into saint
michaels but they didnt do much hurt
except knock some shingles off mr
taylors ordinary then the brigs moved
down to royal oak but lieutenant ken-
nemont he tricked them there he had
his men hang lanterns in the tree-tops
and the british they thought they were
lighted windows and they shot high in
all the fog and drizzle and the cannon
balls are still up in those tree-trunks to
prove it

  cuffee he was a hero and got his name
put in the democrat he never did tell
lieutenant richard kennemont that it
was on account of what he told the cap-
tain of the brig saint domingo and mr
admiral cockburns nephew that the
british attacked saint michaels and were
beat off with one gun

  besides cuffee knew by then that his
plan wasnt any good because lieuten-
ant kennemont and mistress mary dod-
son were married right after the battle
of saint michaels but the lieutenant
stayed in the war right up to the end
he got cuffee another mule and that
boy was always downright proud

  but he always felt sorry for the young
english gentleman mr admiral cock-
burns nephew they found his dancing
pumps on the beach outside fort
stoakes a couple of days later with the
salt air tarnishing the silver buckles

 farewell to the indies

continued from page 

luffed and the wheel spun while the
willful schooner walked jpto the wind

 a moment passed and red dropped his
arms he grinned at tanya grabbed the
spokes and swung the wanderer back on
her course

 tanyas hand closed over his your
course is wrong red she said quietly
come about and run due north

  but the islands the other way
  dont go any closer

 why not

  theres a three-inch gun on the top
of that cliff i know i saw them put it
there

  reds lips went round and he whistled
softly but his hands were firm on the
wheel is that why you sold me your
home lady

  yes

  and the germans are using the
island

  they are said tanya and now
that you know put about and sail to
vanity point theres a radio there you
can call your friends to come and shell
the island	

  and what of you

tanyas shoulders lifted a narrow
cell for a number of years where i
can sit and dream of red flanagan
youd do that

  she nodded i love you red-its
simple as that and i want you to live
in that house near the temple i know
each room each bench in the gardens
ill see you there as you walk through
my dreams that much at least will be
real

  and the rest

  ill manage the rest when i make my
dreams each night well meet on the
temple road and after the priests have
gone to their prayers well walk together
through the gardens later well sit on
the terrace for tea until the wind gets
cool then well go into this house of
yours and-

  she stopped and looked up at him
the rest of the dream belongs to me
red flanagan

  they call me a dreamer too lady
shall i finish the story for you

  tanya shook her head weve talked
long enough too long bring the wan-
derer about or youll have her within
range of that gun

  she looked up at him waiting for the
wheel to turn reds hands held it steady
tanyas eyes grew worried

  come about red youve found the
island this is it dont you believe me
devil a bit i do he laughed your
words are sweet and i love the sound of
them tanya but believe them id as
soon believe red flanagan

  but why would i lie about this
merely to keep in practice perhaps
he said or then it might be that youd
enjoy watching the look on me face
when id sent the navy on a wild goose
chase to shell an island that was owned
by the gulls

   twould be a cut trick tanya and
all the while your german friends would
be building their base on some other
island and perhaps getting ready- to use
it

  you think id do that

  i know you would

  tanya laughed you know me too
well im afraid but stop being stubborn
and use your mind youre still out of
range of that three-inch gun so drop the
hook and wait until morning as soon as
its light ill prove what i say is the
truth

  how

  a pair of glasses will do the trick
through them youll see the changes
that have been made in the face of the
cliff theyre cleverly camouflaged but
youve seen the island often enough to
spot them

  red spun the wheel and called for the
crew he brought the wanderer sharp
about and ordered the anchor down

  mark came on deck to help with the
work and connie followed to question
flanagan she looked at tanya and
tilted her nose then seated herself on a
hatch

  the sails came down and the lines
were snugged and within twenty min-
utes the schooner was tidy

  four-hour watches till morning said
red ill stand the first and you take
the next mark come dawn and well
know the answer
