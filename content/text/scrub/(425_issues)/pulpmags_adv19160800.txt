we boast a bit

one of the best-known educators in new york
i who has read adventure since its first
number met us editorial us in a subway
station last week and said  read all the all-
fiction magazines that and fishing are my two recreations
adventure has always been good but i have been
looking for an opportunity to tell you that the last six
numbers have been the best all-fiction magazines that i
have ever read

   we admitted it

   and havent lots of people been finding it out

   we cheerfully told him that our circulation was forty
per cent larger now than a year ago and that it had been
jumping ahead every month for the past six months in
fact we had every reason to expect that it would double
itself in a year

   then why dont you shout it in the magazine said
he so that all your old friends may rejoice with you

    you will find in this conversation which is accurately reported
the boast that we threatened to make on this page we are delighted
to be able to make it as it refers to circulation figures which are
sometimes open to suspicion we are hoping that you will receive it
not as a boast but as a cheerful bit of office gossip passed along to you

reathless waiting - for
what blind terror-of what
thing the waiting intermin-
ably prolonged because the man
did not know what was the thing he must
expect terror more hideous than mere fear
because it was the unknown which menaced

  in all of the universe there was now only
this one thing which mattered all else was
forgotten and what was it to the man
the desert in which he lay helpless and
hopeless had ceased to exist he no longer
saw the hot sky the molten sun the limit-
less stretch of sand cactus and blistering
rock he saw only the eyes which watched
him

  they seemed staring at him terribly two
eyes which were steady unwinking immea-
surable inscrutable twin pools of ink at
one instant they became to his fevered
fancy the fierce eyes of a savage desert
born and bred observing his death with a
curiosity at once unmoved and strangely
childlike then he thought that he saw
the eyes expand dilate grow enormous
the eyes of some misshapen monster thing

into whose lair he was the first man since
the first dawn to penetrate northrups
reeling brain groped insanely for the visuali-
zation of the great body to which the eyes
must belong and which he could not see

  then with unconsciousness seeking to
cast its black mantle over the man who
struggled against it the eyes seemed sud-
denly to change again to grow smaller
smaller rounder until they were the evil
eyes of the deserts chief curse sika-tcua
the yellow rattlesnake he found himself
groping wondering dully if there were truth
in the old tale if a snake might charm a
man and draw him closer and ever closer
to the quick forked tongue he set his two
hands out in front of his pain-twisted body
sinking them in the blistering sand seeking to
stop the impulse which had crept upon him

  he knew that the gray wolf at times came
down from the ridges that the panther fol-
lowed the track of the mule-deer here that
the gaunt mean-spirited coyote was not
averse to sitting patiently and watching
the slow death of one of his superior ani-
mals waiting his tortured thoughts of a

adventure

coyote were no less terrible than the others
now

  all day long the steep rays of the desert
sun had smitten at him pitilessly all day
the red-black lava rocks among which he
lay had burnt his body all day the flying
sand carried upon the hot blast of wind had
seared and scorched his bloodshot eyeballs
it had been in the first white dawn that he
had fallen encompassed through the hesi-
tant hours by the material threats of the
desert he had not once groaned it was
northrups way to suffer in silence

  but now the unknown had swept the last
vestiges of reality aside it had the seeming
of creeping close about him from all quar-
ters of a veritable mundane hell half-
crazed with pain in the semi-consciousness
which he was always fighting for it was as
if he had passed out of the old life already
and into a fierce land of sorcery of only
one thing could he be certain now-the pair
of steady black eyes watching him through
a fissure in the rocks above

  had it been an hour since he had called
out or had many circling eons reeled
drunkenly over him since his voice disturb-
ing the vast silence had choked back into
his throat he did not know

  he knew that he had called out thinking
that these were the eyes of a man a human
being like himself that he had begged for
help he knew that there had come no
answer that the eyes had watched him
with the same steady curiosity he knew
that he had shouted and that long ago he
had grown still

  once he had painfully dragged from its
holster the automatic which had not been
shaken loose in his fall when with a blind
anger upon him he had lifted it a little the
two eyes were gone when it had fallen
from his weak grasp the two eyes were back
there watching him with the same cursed
steadiness

  in a moment of half delirium the quick
suspicion had come to him that it was
strang strang who had deserted him in his
helplessness robbing him of the scant sup-
ply of water to drive on madly seeking to
gain the next water-hole but no strang
wouldnt be tarrying here watching him
die strang wouldnt even be so much as
thinking of him strang was taking his own
chance his one chance and pushing on
desperately

  northrup had lived through the day

praying dumbly for the coming coolness of
the night now the night was coming and
he was afraid of it

  he twisted his head a little to look at the
sun he was less sure that the sun was
setting than that this was the last time he
would ever look upon it in the west a
riot of color the sun was sinking through a
mist which seemed to rise from a sea of
blood night was at hand and with the
sign of its coming the sense was strong upon
him of the unknown terror-infested creep-
ing closer about him

  strang might have waited he thought

  his swollen lips and dry aching throat
were long ago past utterance but he was
not past saying within himself

  i wont die until i know to what-

thing those eyes belong there was much
stubbornness in sax northrup

it was not meant that he should
die yet and so he did not die it
was meant that he should see strang
again that he should stumble upon a cen-
tury-long hidden secret of the desert so
he lived on where another man would have
died

  the silver desert moon was two hours
high in the purple sky when he realized
that he had lost consciousness and found it
again before he thought of that he
thought of the eyes which had so long
watched him before he saw the moon he
saw them they were over him now just
over him less than a yard away

  he stared upward through the night light
curiously there was sufficient light for
him to see clearly but his brain cleared
slowly

  in seeking to guess the riddle of the two
eyes to conjure up the thing to which they
belonged he had never thought of a wo-
man and yet a woman it was bending
over him though his mind took long in clear-
ing enough for him to be sure of that

  she was old unthinkably old unbeliev-
ably ugly she might have been the bar-
ren deity of a barren land she might have
been a skeleton with the skin upon the
fleshless skull tanned by sun and wind
through hundreds of years until it was
leather squatting motionless over him she
did not seem to be a living breathing being
until he saw the eyes the same steady un-
winking black pools of ink with the glint of
the moon in them
y ahoya



  the moment was uncanny the moon-
light dragged weird figures from the desert
floor charging them with ghostly unreality
the thing squatting above him might have
been a sister thing to the fantastic shapes
the moon made everywhere about her

  northrup shivered his reason making
its way back through the darkness of his
stupor had not fully reinstated itself he
knew that here in this strange land of arid-
ity there could be no such thing as decom-
position when death came it struck its
blow cleanly unattended by decay air
sun wind when they had their way undis-
puted made of the dead such a thing as
that which bent over him if no prowling
beast came to rend apart then the body
would last throughout generations perhaps
centuries

  fear comes in many guises but never
with so cold a clutch as when whispering
of the supernatural at the shock from the
pictures whipped up before him by his own
imaginings northrup again lost conscious-
ness

  later-he did not know how much later
-it seemed quite natural for him to feel
that some one was moving about him he
realized dimly that it couldnt be strang
for strang had gone on he knew that it
must be the thousand-year-old woman who
had come out of the nowhere riding on a
moon-ray perhaps who when she was done
pottering around him would go back the
way she had come he didnt try to turn
his head to watch her because he knew that
he hadnt the strength left in him

  she had slipped something soft under his
shoulders had even managed to turn his
great body a little making it lie a fraction
less painfully and she had brought him
water that was a joke on strang he
had gone on furiously lugging three or four
warm cupfuls in his canteen thinking that
there was no other drop to be had until one
had crossed many miles of desert

  there came intervals during which
northrup was oblivious to everything about
him brief spaces of time when he awoke to
both realization and curiosity but for the
most part he existed in a condition which
was a sort of dim border-line between con-
sciousness and stupor he accepted the
present as matter of fact forgot the past
and did not seek to speculate upon the fu-
ture

  for days he lay upon the talus upon the

first of whose ragged boulders he had fallen
from the cliffs of porphyry above the old
woman moving with the feebleness and the
slowness of a winter sunbeam forced her
shaking hands to construct a shelter over
the spot where he lay

  a ragged home-made cotton blanket
stretched above him from rock to rock a
robe of rabbit-skins made at once cover and
bed she brought him water in a rude olla
of sun-baked clay administered gruelly
messes made from com-meal attending him
after the first with a faithfulness like a shep-
herd dogs where she went for the water
what was the source of her food supply he
did not know

  the silence was seldom broken for
hours at a time she would squat near him
her blanket drawn about her shoulders over
her head her hands lost in its folds her
ancient face turned upon him in an expres-
sionless stare when there arose absolute
need for speech there was no difficulty in
understanding each other

  northrup through many years of going
up and down among people of her breed
had come to understand the tongue of the
indians of walpi oraibe taos when he
had called her so wuhti which is the
hopi for old woman or grandmother she
had understood she had named him ba-
liana white man and the ceremony of
introduction was complete

  for a long time northrup lying grim and
quiet thought that by struggling to keep
on living he was but postponing the hour
of his death a few hours among his lesser
injuries he thought that he could count the
fracture of his left arm he could only
speculate upon the extent of injury done
internally

  had he been in a hospital with capable
physician and nurses attending him there
might be a chance but here with the half-
cooked food a wild woman brought with
the nauseating decoctions which she ex-
tracted from he knew not what plants or
roots with a bed of lava rock his chance
seemed little enough he watched her mak-
ing his medicines heating the sticky liquid
over a greasewood fire then setting it aside
that she might sing over it and so make it
good medicine and imagined that the
mixture would be about as efficacious as her
singing the latter was horrible enough
but he got well

  and they grew to be companions of a


adventure

sort as perhaps nearly any two of gods
creatures would if set alone in the world
the fact that the old hag was living here
and absolutely alone that she seemed con-
tented to be here and looked for no other
company than her own until northrup had
come aroused curiosity after a little

  he soon found many questions to ask
and during the five months which passed
before he was a strong man again-and one
must be certain of his full strength before
he seeks to walk out into the desert with
the little water he can carry and the
knowledge that he must travel forty miles
to the first water-hole-he learned much
from so wuhti

ii

      had not so wuhti led him at last
to her abode northrup would never
have found it it was slow climb-
ing for them both the woman weighted
down by close to a century of years the
man still so weak that a little exertion set
him trembling throughout his wasted body

  the chosen chamber of so wuhti was
close up to the cliff-tops a roughly gouged-
out room in the rocks to be approached
only by a steep trail from below it was
constructed cunningly in a great fissure so
that while from it the old woman might
look out over the desert it would be a keen
eye down there to discover her

  upon the floor lay so wuhtis bed a
tumbled pile of cotton blankets of native
weave and a rabbit-skin robe in a smoke-
blackened corner were a few charred sticks
and bits of brush here and there were sun-
baked clay utensils for the most part black
and cracked a few strings of dried meat
a heap of shelled corn a pot of water a
prayer-stick against the wall by the bed
completed the equipment of the room

  from so wuhtis boudoir-northrup al-
ways called it that and so wuhti seemed
greatly pleased with the name-it was no
trick to come to the top of the cliffs by
means of the short ladder and here one
came upon that wonder of the desert of
which a thousand tongues have told since
first the old spanish conquistadores dipped
into it which countless artists have sought
to catch upon their brushes

  for a hundred miles in all directions the
eye passed over gray floor sweeping up into
loma and mesa the magic desert colorings

over it all deep blues and glittering bronzes
the snow white of drifted sands the gray-
green of cactus and brush the brick reds of
rocky precipices through the clear dry
air the eye sped instantly over waterless
distances where a man might find slow
death in crossing

  here just at the cliffs edge northrup
found again the half-expected the tumbled
ruins of an ancient watch-tower his mind
toyed with the pictures which his fancies
suggested

  the vision arose of a gaunt cat-quick sen-
tinel hawk-eyed skin beaten into glistening
copper from the sun keeping guard here
while his brothers slept in a younger cen-
tury starting up as many miles away
across the rolling floor of desert sand and
scrubby growth he caught a quick glimpse
of an invading enemy cupping his hands to
his mouth to send outward and downward
his warning shout kindling the ever-ready
pile of greasewood fagots to send out over
the land other messages of warning voice-
less lightning-winged and as if the old
time were not yet dead though the watch-
tower of stone was crumbling he saw a pile
of dry greasewood and a black smudge of
smoke against the side of the one upstand-
ing slab of stone

  he went back down to so wuhti won-
dering

   aslittle by little strength came back into
his emaciated body he grew impatient for
the time when he might dare to take up the
trail again but a month passed and he
knew that it would be as mad a thing to
try to move on as to climb to the cliff-tops
and leap downward

  there was water here so wuhti brought
it laboriously from a hidden spring far back
and deep down in the great fissure in the
rock wall if he turned back he knew
there was no more water within thirty miles
if he went on it was a gamble if he would
find water at the end of forty miles so he
waited for his strength to come back to
him

  slowly so slowly that perhaps she was
never aware of it so wuhtis silence slip-
ped from her she came in her loneliness
to feel a strange affection for the big-bodied
bahana with his white skin his yellow hair
and blue eyes

  she had never seen a man like him at
first she seemed a little in awe of him a lit-
tle afraid of him in those first weeks she
yahoya



would sit and watch him suspiciously her
lips locked her eyes bright with speculation

  but as the hopi legends have it woman
is the daughter of yahpa the mocking-
bird and so since her father is so great a
talker may not long remain silent the
legends of her forefathers were scripture to
so wuhti

  so it turned out that as they sat together
in the old womans boudoir or upon the
cliff-tops the slow hours passed to the
throaty monotone of so wuhtis talk while
northrup smoked her tobacco in his pipe
and listened it took him no great time to
recognize the fact that the old woman was
half crazed-a brooding solitary life and a
mind filled with superstitions having worked
their way with her

  in the main her conversation was an in-
genious fabric of lies told with rare sem-
blance of truth as if she were recounting
some minor happening of the day she told
of a visit she had had from haruing wuhti
chief deity of the hopi polytheism the
goddess coming up out of the sea had
come across the desert running swifter than
an antelope so beautiful was she that she
had hurt so wuhtis eyes with her beauty
aliksail listen bahana she is like a soft
white maiden haruing wuhti her hair yel-
low like the squash blossom yellower than
yours her eyes are like turquoises her
mouth as red as a sunset through the sand-
storm she came swiftly at so wuhtis
call through the night the goddess sat
there so wuhti here and they talked

  so wuhti shook her head mumbled grew
silent the bahana was not to hear the
things of which haruing wuhti and so
wuhti spoke in the night

  she explained her presence alone here
she told him of it twice once in answer to
his question once volunteering the infor-
mation had she gone into the matter a
third time northrup had no doubt that he
would then have had three instead of mere-
ly two distinct explanations to choose from

  in the first account northrup found many
traces of ancient indian religions so wuhti
spoke familiarly of the beginnings of the
world which while she admitted that it was
haruing wuhti and the sun who had done
the actual work she herself witnessed

  she called northrups attention to the
fact that the spot in which he and she were
was the top of the world hence it became
clear that it was very distantly remote from

the abiding-place of the chief goddess be-
ing so far away the goddess must have some
one in whom she could trust to see that
everything went right consequently so
wuhti a very great favorite with haruing
wuhti was stationed here when there
was need she built signal fires at the ruined
watch-tower and haruing saw and under-
stood the matter

   if northrup didnt take a great deal of
 stock in this explanation he had the other
 one further in the desert so far and across
 such a waterless tract that the white man
 could only send his hungry eyes traveling
 into it was a land where there were hidden
 cities the gods of the underworld had
 built these cities then they had given
 them to a people the people of so wuhti

   there were seven of these cities the sev-
 en cities of chebo northrup smiled as
 he saw a trace of the old legend told by the
 early spanish explorers of the seven cities
 of cibola they were very rich cities hav-
 ing much silver many turquoises and of
 late years much gold which they made into
 rings and bracelets the chiefs having cups
 and plates of gold

   in order that they might remain hidden
 from the greed of the white men and from
 the jealousy of other tribes they set senti-
 nels out through the desert a hundred
 miles away such a sentinel was so wuhti
 she had but to set fire to the fagots upon
 the cliffs and the chiefs of the hidden cities
 of chebo would understand

   northrup must understand that the gods
 and goddesses were very close to the people
 of so wuhti didnt haruing wuhti her-
 self come here to chat with so wuhti to eat
 piki with her it was so

   and by living here alone so wuhti was
doing a kindness at once to her people of
chebo and to her sovereign deity the
priest had told her as long as she lived
she would watch here when she was to
die she would build a big fire which would
carry the word across the desert so that
another might be sent to take her place
and then haruing wuhti would come for
her and throw her cloak about her and so
wuhti would be a young mana again living
always where the big river breaks through
the crust and goes into the underworld
where the gods live

   though the old womans rambling stories
 with their innumerable digressions and
 repetitions soon ceased to interest him


adventure

northrup did not fill his canteen and move
on when at last he felt that he was his old
strong self half-crazed old savage that
she was so wuhti was none the less hu-
man nor was there any denying his obli-
gation to her had it not been for her he
would be now only what the coyotes and
strong-beaked birds would have left of him
and now strong enough to attempt the
passage of the desert he could not fail to
see that so wuhti was coming quickly to
the end of her life and he could not bear
the thought of going on heartlessly leaving
her to die alone

she looked at him curiously many
times during those last few days to-
gether she too had seen her death
coming to her at last and looked at it with
steady curious eyes she was not afraid
she did not seem sorry to go she was cer-
tain that haruing wuhti was making her
future existences her own concern it was
all arranged

  she had never manifested a hint of emo-
tion of any kind since he had seen her beady
eyes peering at him through the crack in
the rocks and now he had been here upward
of six months he did not expect for a sign
of emotion now too long had she had the
opportunity of looking forward to the end
to be greatly perturbed by it now that it
was at hand

  it came with a little shock to him one
day that so wuhti was all human after
all out of a still silence by the ruined
tower she had moved to him quickly her
crooked claw of a hand suddenly fastening
about his forearm

  youre a good man bahana she said
her eyes unusually bright upon his many
days ago you were ready to go you wait
that so wuhti does not die alone like the
coyote askwalil i thank you haruing
wuhti will bring you many good things i
will tell her

  with all of her madness she was not with-
out wisdom she set her chamber in order
that night northrup had the suspicion that
in honor of the occasion she even went so
far as to bathe then when the first stars
were coming out she made a trembling way
to the cliff-tops northrup helping her up
the short ladder

  in the faint light here northrup saw how
she had arranged her hair and the thing
came to him with something of a shock

she had done it up into two whorls one at
each ear the imitation of the squash blos-
som which with the zuni people tells the
time when a maiden has ripened into the
first blush of womanhood so wuhti was
ready for the coming of haruing wuhti for
the time when again she would be beauti-
ful-a young mana

  when at last the great fire which at her
command he had kindled had burnt down
northrup went slowly back into the stone
chamber which had so long been so wuhtis
and which was never again to know her
presence as he looked at her blankets laid
in order folded by hands into which the
chill had already crept when he saw the
broken jugs and crocks set in their neat
row a sudden moisture came into his eyes
so wuhti had been good to him and she
was dead so wuhti was gone and he was
lonely

  in the coolness of the night having only
the stars to guide him his canteen freshly
filled he pushed on out into the desert

ill

only because of the great stub-
bornness which was a part of him
and because of the unswerving pur-
pose which had grown to be a part of that
stubbornness did sax northrup battle on
with the desert instead of turning back
now for fight was it to be at every step
with the ultimate outcome hidden upon the
knees of the barren gods of the southwest-
ern sahara

  already was he in a land into which men
do not come where perhaps before him ten
white men had not ventured since the time
of fray marcos close to four hundred years
ago here was a region from which a man
might bring back with him nothing but a
tale of suffering where often enough he
might find nothing but a horrible death
and yet northrup seeking that which he
sought with his eyes open went on

  but thinking that he knew the desert
he came to learn that he had never known
it alone in the silence he came to under-
stand a little the majesty and power of god

  day after day night after night he saw
these things made tangible in the sweep of
the sandy floor in the stern grandeur of the
uplifted walls of rock through the frag-
ment of eternal silence through which he
fought his way he felt these things he
yahoya



felt himself a small figure alone in a strange
hard world

  grandeur majesty sublimity-he knew
them to be of the desert but they were
not the essence of it its supreme quality
seen at all times and not to be mistaken
was its savage fierceness the desert is no
hypocrite its teeth are always bared poi-
soned teeth in a snarl at the intruder
threatening no less its own offspring it is
the land of the iron fang

  as he battled on always was he in the
heart of another battle which had outworn
the youth of time a struggle to the death
without quarter and oh the silence of it
here about him was no created thing which
the desert did not strive to kill here was
no living thing upon all the terrible surface
which did not strive to kill its brother crea-
tion

  life here had never gotten beyond its
primary elemental phase it was over and
over the frenzied seeking to inflict death
in order that the conqueror might live to
live in order to kill to deal death and to flee
from death

  the fierce brood of things struggling for
existence even from the very womb of their
terrible mother were without exception a
brood armored and armed the desert coy-
ote a murderer with a cowards heart and a
madmans cunning the wildcat a machine
for assassination the gray wolf so much
cold steel tireless swift merciless the spir-
it of slaughter cast into flesh and blood the
rattlesnake as deadly as death itself even
the harsh growth of vegetation bound to
earth by its iron roots so that it might not
spring to attack or flee from its enemy was
armed with its thousand knife-thorns to tear
at flesh and bite at bone

  everywhere northrup sensed the silent
unending struggle the preying of living
things upon one another the warring of the
land which bore them against them all
and he came to know what it meant for a
human being to enter this scene of natural
warfare

  like the man and wife in molieres com-
edy fighting like cat and dog but ready to
turn united against the interloper into their
domestic realm so these desert things seem-
ed to combine with horrible power against
the stranger in their realm the bahana who
had dared set foot upon the changing sands
the sun tortured him thirst came to mad-
den him spiked cacti tore at his bleeding

hands wind parched sand blinded him the
rattlesnake and the poisoned spiders threat-
ened when he slept or woke

  as the still hot days went on he came al-
most to believe himself in a veritable land
of sorcery of witchcraft of black magic
it became to him the demesne of the un-
earthly the home of illusion a region be-
witched and bewitching him who looked
upon it the one place in the world where
the supernatural was a part of nature

  he saw the sun changed into a monster
bloodstone the moon into a disk of white
silver the sober skies into a riot of colors
burning reds rich purples greens and golds
his eyes told him of a stretch of level lands
which were to be crossed in two hours and
he struggled across them for two days told
him of mountains five miles away which his
brain wise from past experience knew were
seventy miles from him

  he walked toward misty veils of pale
pink and deep rose they melted away from
him withdrawing showing him the barren
places which had been softened only in the
seeming he saw things which did not ex-
ist built out of nothingness as by the touch
of a magicians wand hovering in the air
what looked like a lake before him cool
waters stirring softly to a cool breeze was
nothingness a bit of trickery of the air
to see trees mountains where they were
not turned topsy-turvy became a common-
place

  there was one day when hoarding the
little water in his canteen hurrying on to
the vague promise of a water-hole he saw
quick clouds gathering in the sky black
with the rain in them caught in a driving
current high above the clouds passed over
him saturated struck by a cooler current
of air they burst open like huge water-bags
spilling the rain he saw it fall in a steep
slant it was raining up there in big drops
and yet no single drop of water came down
to him in the dry air through which it
plunged hissing downward it disappeared
drunk up by the air itself as a drop of mois-
ture is drunk up by a dry sand bank mere-
ly the natural thing here yet looking like
enchantment

  northrup was a man essentially given to
strong vigorous action rather than to fan-
ciful musings and yet here with aught of
action denied him beyond the monotonous
driving of one boot after the other into loose
sand or up lava-strewn slopes or about and


adventure

through clumps of desert vegetation for
weeks his mind was the home of strange
imaginings

  he found himself wondering at first light-
ly but at times with a soberness which
startled him when he recognized it if there
did exist supernatural forces of which man
had no understanding the thought came
to him that such a force had drawn him
sax northrup from the beaten thorough-
fares of white men into this empty land
what had brought him here while tie men
whom he had known of his class and type
were driving their motors over smooth
roads dining in comfortable cafes sleeping
upon soft beds and otherwise disporting
themselves as befitted the city-bred what
indeed but the wild tale of a dying indian
down in santa fe

  the thing which takes men by the hair
and drags them to the hidden corners of the
four quarters of the world is generally the
same thing in whatever garb it chooses to
wear-the lure of gold it had brought
him him and strang here

  through many a day there stood between
northrup and death a scrap of paper and a
hope that the paper did not lie in the
main it had told the truth thus far if
later on it lied to him why then hed do
what many another man has done on the
desert die for want of water

 he had the way before leaving any
water-hole upon which he had come of
taking the paper out of his pocket studying
it thoughtfully looking up from it across
the bleak stretches out toward a steep-
walled mesa or the clear-cut ridges of dis-
tant mountains and always his frowning
eyes camc back from the old story of sand
lava-rock gorge precipice and gray-green
desert growth to the bit of paper in his
hand

  already was it more precious to him than
the gold which he hoped it might lead him
to

  for if through some mischance i should
lose this he admitted to himself often
enough why then id be a dead man in
forty-eight maybe in twenty-four hours

a strange map this which
northrup carried rolled and thrust
into an empty rifle-cartridge for
safety that he had made it himself did
not in any way make it seem to him infal-
lible

  the indian dying in santa f had told
him the way to follow and northrup had
made the rough map from the indians
words and he had known from the time
that he made his first step upon the long
trail that trusting himself upon it having
only that to guide him deep into the secret
heart of the land of little water was as fool-
hardy a thing as he had ever done in all
the years of a foolhardy existence but
there had been the golden lure

  as he crouched by some lonely water-
hole trying to get his big body into a scant
patch of shade his eyes turned upon his
crude map northrups thoughts had grown
into the way of flying back to the manner
of this thing coming to him at all

  he had been in santa fe chafing under a
short enforced idleness restive eager for
whatever might come next on the cards
there he had found strang or to be exact
strang had found him northrup hadnt
particularly liked him from the beginning
but men of his class were few and hard to
find hereabouts and strang was not with-
out a certain insinuating way and a per-
severance almost as great as northrups
own

  besides strang in the beginning of the
matter had been in trouble and northrup
in his wide-handed generous way had be-
friended him the ridding oneself of a
person to whom one has done a kindness is
not without its difficulties

  at any rate northrup and strang had
been together watching a game of cards in
an adobe saloon when the indian had first
come into their stories the native a tall
gaunt sinewy fellow thrusting through a
knot of men at the door had come almost
at a run to where they were

  sax northrup he had asked swiftly

  even before northrup could answer there
came a little whirring sound and a small ar-
row tipped with a blue feather evidently
fired through the open window from with-
out drove deep into the indians side his
eyes turned toward the square of dark-
ness were horrible and northrup bend-
ing over him quickly had seen no pain
just wicked venemous hatred in them
the arrow was poisoned and the wounded
man knew it

  in a little room just off the saloon the
indian told his story to northrup and
strang to the latter because he asked to
stay since the indian made no objection
yahoya

 ii

t

because northrup had no reason for privacy
in the matter

  that night the indian died but first
he had told his story northrup looking
his incredulity saw a keenness of eagerness
in strangs eyes and in the end the indian
convinced them both

  look he had panted speaking as swift-
ly as he might in the hopi tongue there
is more-like this

  he had managed to squirm over on his
bed jerking weakly at something tied about
his body under his shirt it was strangs
eager hands which did the actual work
there was a little bag there made rudely
from a piece of buckskin and in the bag
were two gold nuggets and half a dozen
turquoises

  but why do you give this to me
northrup had demanded you came here
looking for me i dont know you

  i know you the indian had answered
where hard things get done i hear your
name where dangerous things are i hear
your name a man must be like you to go
there now listen get paper quick make
marks on it while i tell you

  and so northrup had made his map

  it is many miles more than two hun-
dred before you come to the beginning of
the trail the indian had said red rock
gully you know and badger gulch be-
yond and coyote gap on the other side
they are known to you

  yes northrup had answered

  then bahana listen listen with both
ears

  he made his description of the trail to
travel swiftly seeming to have each great
or minor direction in mind as if he had
carefully arranged every detail already
from coyote gap northrup was to go
straight toward the rising sun where it lift-
ed between the two peaks in the spanish
mountains the peaks known as los dos
hermanos there in the pass was water
it was not over ten miles from coyote gap

  then before going further the indian
had wriggled up his back against the wall
and had seized pencil and paper from north-
rup

  look he had said making a little
mark this is where the north star is
you can always find the place of the kwinae
wuhtaka-north old man-on the desert
day and night by the stars

  northrup nodded already he had be-

gun to feel something of the earnestness
which seemed to possess the indian and
which at the jump had gotten into strangs
blood the indian grunted his satisfaction

  now the hopi had said at the end
showing the same readiness which so wuhti
showed months later to meet the skeleton
old man half-way it is done you will go
for there is gold at the end of it all and
where there is gold if it is under hot rocks
a white man will go the other bahana
looking shrewdly into strangs brightening
eyes will go also you will make two
writings so that if the wind steals one you
will not die for water

  oh i suppose well go had been north-
rups answer but look here my friend-
i want to know whats back of this why
are you so infernally set upon anybody
using the stuff you cant use yourself

  the hopis last earthly grin was full of
malice

  it is because i hate tiyo had been
the full of his explanation

iv

the question who the devil is
tiyo had come quite naturally to
northrups lips when he had first
heard the name but now it had long ago
been crowded aside all but forgotten in
due time hed know or else hed never
know and in the meantime he had other
matters to ponder upon

  it had been at a spot some ten miles in a
general northeasterly direction from the
point indicated on his map by the words
canon-pines-mountain ridge that he
had had his mishap here strang had left
him here so wuhti had appeared before
him like a black witch to become his good
angel

  when he had pushed on again he had
found that day after day the country un-
folding before him became more menacing
he found no water of any description ex-
cepting at those spots where little crosses
upon his map indicated it he slept and
woke with the knowledge that should he
miss one of these holes should the indian
have lied to him should the drifting sands
have covered and blotted out a spring why
then the tale was told for sax northrup

  and there was another thing a thing
which multiplied a hundredfold the danger
which lay about him while the figures


adventure

upon his map told him definitely that it
was ten or twenty-five miles between water-
holes it was after all just guesswork-
guesswork first on the part of an indian
runner guesswork on his own part guess-
work where the penalty for a mistake might
well be death no as he went on there
was not much call to puzzle over the ques-
tion who is tiyo

  in a race across the desert with the
skeleton old man it is well to travel
light northrup remembered that bit of
advice from so wuhtis caves he had
brought water corn-meal a little dried
meat which she informed him was rabbit
meat but concerning which he had his
doubt at any rate it was meat

  when he came to a pool in a dry creek-
bed a spring great enough to give life to a
little splotch of green stuff under the cliffs
he rested sometimes a day or two if there
was a hard pull ahead of him here he
found animal life cotton-tails and jack-rab-
bits for the most part and a few birds
they were tame having no doubt never set
their bright round eyes upon a thing which
walked upright as he did and they were
curious

  what he needed northrup killed either
with his automatic or with stones the
meat had but to be tossed over the limb
of sage or mesquite for the sun to jerk it
for him

  but times came when his stomach was
empty and he went long without food when
there were no last precious drops in his
canteen and he began to fear that at last
his map was lying to him but always he
forged on never did the thought of turning
back come to him he knew that strang
had gone ahead strang for whom he had
felt a mild sort of contempt

  he passed successively the points he had
marked cave rocks where he spent two
days and a half in interested exploration of
the broken remnants of a civilization which
must have been many centuries old before
the spaniards came into the new world
big skeleton where as the hopi had fore-
told he came upon the sun-bleached bones
of what must at one time been a veritable
giant of a man now a pile of bones no long-
er of interest to preying animals where it
lay upon the top of an overhanging boulder
poison springs where there were more skele-
tons these of thirst-tormented unwary ani-
mals the sunken meadows which might

have been originally the home of all the
worlds butterflies and where many re-
mained great-winged incredibly swift that
they might live at all through the eternal
warfare which the bird - folk here waged
upon them where humming-birds bright-
ened the air and mocking-birds shook out
their cool clear notes against desert sun
and silence into the ancient realm of cliff-
dwellers where he saw countless orifices
punctured into the cliffs a hundred five
hundred feet above some spring where he
camped

  as the weeks wore on and he entered
more deeply into the heart of the unknown
northrup became possessed of a faith in
the undertaking which had not been with
him at the outset then he had thought
ill go and see now he felt ill go and
find

  the very fact that every day he had con-
stant proof of the hopis truthfulness began
to work its spell upon him why should
the end of the tale then prove fiction was
he hourly drawing nearer the desert trea-
sure-house

across bare blistering miles he
followed his trail that led him to
those deathless springs which in old
times had made these arid lands an open
thoroughfare to moccasined feet there
were times in those long silent days of utter
solitude when far to right or left he fan-
cied he saw along high cliffs the remains of
an old civilization man-made trails in the
rock rudely circular holes in the precipices
which well may have led into cool cham-
bered dwellings

  but it was risking too much to seek to in-
vestigate here where distances are deceptive
and water is not assured nor did he have
the inclination to linger his quest had
gotten into his blood

  the time came at last when standing
clear and distinct in the north he saw the
line of cliffs marking his journeys end he
traveled now at night since the moon was
at the full through the loose sand which
seemed one instant to give away as freely
as water only to grasp at his ankles and
hold him back the next he plowed on all
that night his face set toward the north
star in the moonlight the desert about
him was touched into a softness of beauty
which was no attribute of it in the harsh
light of day the distant mountains looked
yahoya



unreal mystically lovely the borders of
fairyland

  what sort of people were the men and
women who lived this knew no life but
this was northrups thought over and
over the warriors were they as hard as
the desert by day the maidens were they
as savage as their lovers or did the soft-
ness of desert moonlight the tenderness of
desert colorings seep into their souls

  toward dawn from a gently sloping
loma he saw the clump of trees mesquite
for the most part betokening the spot where
he was to water and rest from here when
the coolness of another dusk came he would
press -over the last lap of the quest

  that day he dozed restlessly dreaming
broken dreams from which he started up
repeatedly muttering the scenes through
which he had so long traveled had had their
deeper impressions upon him and suggested
wild thoughts which in sleep were uncheck-
ed the speculation of what might lay
ahead mingled with them

  he felt all night as if he were in the grip
of some power other than his own not to
be explained by materialistic mankind he
dreamed that the old peoples who had
striven with the desert for existence who
had mastered it and lived through it were
not dead that they still had their moun-
tain fastnesses that he moved among them
that strange adventures were his

  toward late afternoon too restlessly
eager for further rest he ate drank filled
his canteens and struck out for the moun-
tains and before he had gone a mile be-
fore the sun had wheeled down toward the
end of the hottest day he had yet experi-
enced a thing occurred which sent a thrill
through the mans physical being a fresh
shock of wonderment into his heart

  before him were the heat waves trembling
over a wide expanse of barren sand sand
for miles in each direction the white loose
sand which one finds in wind - tumbled
dunes like the white sand of the seashore
but waterless then slowly into the empti-
ness of burning air there grew a vision he
looked upon it at first with little interest
this sort of thing could hardly interest him
after all these years of life upon the fringe
of the desert he thought but ten steps
further he grew stock still his heart thump-
ing wildly the old sense of the supernatural
strong upon him

  he saw woven into the semblance of

reality from sunlight and air hanging in the
air close to the ground like some masters
painting suspended by invisible ropes a
scene of rare beauty of mad beauty for
this bleak stretch of scant vegetation it
was a garden a hundred feet across with
tall lush water-loving flowers such as he
had never seen before

  in the heart of the garden a pool of water
with shade-trees dropping leaves into it a
pool not of natures making but of mans
for surely its basin was white rock which
mans hand had carved and scooped out
surely there stood carven pillars and col-
umns of white stone about it the water
shone at him with a blue laughter the white
of the rock glistened like snow the grass
and plants flung emerald reflections at
themselves the blossoms everywhere were
purple and scarlet and deep rose

  clearer and clearer grew the desert vision
until northrup seeing a bright-colored par-
rot drop from a swaying branch like a float-
ing flower caught his breath in wonder-
ment

  my god cried northrup sharply
have i gone mad

  he knew the way in which the thirst-
torment ends in forgetfulness of what one
has suffered in delicious delirium in fancies
like this thing which his two eyes told him
was physical fabric

  his eyes had followed the gaudy flight of
the parrot and so they came to see what
he had not seen before to trick him into
thinking he saw what he would not believe
existed

  a hand had been thrown out-never mi-
rage like this if this in sober truth were not
magics masterpiece-a slow-moving grace-
ful hand a bare arm of rare perfection the
parrot had perched upon a finger seeming
to cock a suspicious jealous head toward
northrup so northrup had seen the hand
the arm the maiden herself

  she was lying upon her side an arm flung
out an arm under her head he saw the
loose hair about her face saw-or fancied
he saw for his senses were reeling-the face
itself the lips curving to languid laughter
saw the white robe girt about with a broad
band of blue saw the crimson flower set
close to the brown throat saw the little
bare feet from which the white moccasins
had fallen and then--

  then the air had wavered and shimmered
and clouded and cleared and sax northrup


adventure

found himself staring out across an empty
stretch of white sand drifted here and there
by the desert winds

v

tonight the wind rose with sun-
set sweeping across the desert in
strong gusts the white drifts of
sand were disposed anew in fresh designs
the sand carried in level strata cut at
northrups face and hands stinging him
unmercifully like fine particles of heated
glass

  within an hour the wind dropped the
sparse grass here and there was motionless
it was stifling hot for another hour then
came sudden cold through which northrup
made swifter progress at dawn he thought
that the mountains were not ten miles away
that he could come to them long before
noon

  but as the sun rose the wind came up
with it blowing again in mighty gusts then
settling into a steady storm from the north
every step of the way now northrup fought
hard the wind whipped the moisture out
of his body until his skin seemed to be on fire

  bend his head as he might the sand found
its way under his hat-brim cutting his face
driving through his shirt-collar slipping
everywhere into his clothing running into
his boots an hour after sun-up it was fear-
fully hot the sun was a small ball looking
very far away yet smoldering with an in-
tense red heat

  he hoarded his water but again and
again his dry throat drove him to lift his
canteen to his lips he sought to see the
mountains ahead of him and could not make
out the dimmest outline

  the flying sand would have hidden them
had they been less than a tenth of the ten
miles distant it had smothered the world
it was choking stifling him he tied a
handkerchief about his face and threw him-
self to the ground he could make no prog-
ress against that fierce raging storm from
the north he knew the folly of matching
his strength against it at this rate he
would have exhausted his force drunk his
water in an hour and then the piling drift-
ing flying sand would work its grim way
with him

 he began to think the storm would
never end the darkness into which mid-
day was plunged grew thicker the sun was

a terrible unearthly thing dim and red

  until far in the afternoon the sand-storm
swept upon him racing away into the south
with a sound of distant booming with the
whistle of dry sand upon dry wind little
by little it subsided the air thinned a vague
blur looking at the end of the world marked
the mountains

  northrup lifted his canteen he had only
a little water perhaps two cupfuls left he
drank sparingly and fearful lest the wind
might rise again blowing for many days as
he knew it did at times he forced his heavy
way northward

  he moved like a ghost through a mist of
sand all that day the wind came and went
in gusts dying down utterly toward sun-
set the air cleared then the mountains rose
steeper came marching to meet him he
drank the last drop of water and pushed on

  moonrise found him beaten and grimy
at the mouth of the great canon toward
which he had journeyed he hurried on
into the canon there were black shadows
everywhere about him but slowly as he
went on the shadows drew into themselves
as the moon climbed higher

  here on each side of him were the walls
of the canon lifted up in sheer cliffs al-
ready the cliffs were a hundred feet high
ahead he could see that they stood up into
the sky seven hundred a thousand feet
the canon where he stood was perhaps fifty
yards in width a little further on it widen-
ed out to three times fifty yards narrowing
again rapidly

  but now northrups eyes were concerned
not with the walls of rock but with the floor
of the canon he wanted water wanted it
badly all day he had been stinted for it
now he must have it and soon his throat
ached and burned his tongue felt thick and
stiff in his mouth his whole body cried to
him for water

  he believed that he had come to the right
canon it was as the hopi had described it
lying due north of the last water-hole with
the tallest peak towering above it if in
the sand-storm he had lost his bearings why
then so much the worse for a foolhardy ad-
venturer

for an hour he sought water and
imus found none his thirst was tor-
menting him driving him mad
the moonlight glistening from a white slab
of granite tricked him he hurried stumbling
yahoya



to it only to twist his lips into a silent curse
when he saw clearly

  he sucked at his canteen and in sudden
wrath threw it from him a moment of
terror came upon him in which he ran here
and there blindly he jerked himself to-
gether with anger at himself

  he went to the flat-topped boulder and
sat down he needed rest almost as badly
as he needed water and he must get him-
self in hand

  the orb of the moon silvered the cliffs
above him northrup sent his eyes quest-
ing everywhere even up the cliffs he saw
something move a wolf he supposed he
wasnt interested in wolves it was water he
wanted

  but his eyes remained a moment with
the sign of life hundreds of feet above him
the moving thing came out from a blotch
of shadow and stood upon the edge of the
cliff it was not a wolf it was a man or
else the trickery of the moon was building
another taunting vision for him

  the moving form coming to the very
edge stood still northrup saw the man
distinctly almost straight up above him
the face was in profile etched clear against
the sky it was the face of an indian hopi
perhaps but handsomer than the hopi
northrup had known the nose prominent
the features sharply cut and clear the in-
dian was naked save for the white loin-
cloth and the band about his head his
arms were flung out toward the moon as if
in supplication his body rigid a moment
his head lifted

  northrup sought to call out and a dry
whisper in his tortured throat fell hissingly
upon his own ears he sprang up striving
again to call but the form above him was
gone the man had drawn back from the
cliff-edge the moonlight silvered the rock
where he had been

  hastily northrup sought the way up
there knowing that he must come upon this
man before he was beyond call he might
have used his gun to attract attention-he
thought of that now-but already his feet
had found the first of the rude steps in the
cliff and he was climbing rapidly when he
came to the top then if the man were not
to be seen he would use the gun

  as northrups head rose slowly above the
edge of the cliff he stopped suddenly a lit-
tle gasp in his throat here was a great
shelf against the precipice the cliffs falling

abruptly to the desert below rising sheer
another five hundred feet back of the level
space the space itself some hundred feet
in length and half of that in width appeared
to him like some mighty stage set for one of
the deserts wild extravaganzas

  he saw not one man but fifty a hundred
he could not estimate how many all were
like the first gaunt-bodied clothed in the
loin-cloth of pure white their bodies glis-
tening in the moonlight like polished bronze
they were moving about in a slow stately
procession their arms lifted to the moon
their faces upturned their forms swaying
rhythmically as they circled about a form
standing above them upon a flat boulder
along the cliff wall upon the far side of the
level space northrup saw other forms these
in the shadow clothed in white robes
whether of native cotton or buckskin he
could not tell the forms of matrons and
maidens scores of them

  not a sound had come to him the feet
moving in the wide circle were bare feet
falling lightly upon a floor of rock he saw
lips opened moving in unison as if some
mighty chant were bursting from them
and yet no sound of singing came to him
it was as still here as it was out ten miles
across the sands

  the form standing upon the boulder
about which the others circled was that of
an old man northrup saw the hooked
beak of a nose like a hawks the hair falling
about the shoulders silver under the moon
the black eyes filled with a strange ecstasy
and then the black eyes saw him

  just northrups head coming up slowly
from the void below a great head of yel-
low disheveled hair a great yellow beard
unkempt and made over into gold by the
night light great blue eyes looking fierce as
a wolfs from the thirst upon him

  and yet the ceremonial dance if such it
were went on with no pause the old man
stood still his arms outflung his lips mov-
ing as the lips of the others moved he had
seen northrup he had seemed then to have
forgotten him

  northrup came slowly up to the ledge
his big body seeming unnaturally large when
at last he stood upon a level with the
others

  water he cried hoarsely i want
water

  he had spoken in english his voice cut
rudely into the silence those wrho had
i

adventure

not seen him before saw him now a hun-
dred looks turned upon him swift and
startled for a moment the swaying bodies
and moving lips grew as still as the rocks
then again the bodies swayed the lips
moved the silent circle continued as if he
had not broken into it

  water cried northrup again moving
toward them heavily like some great tawny-
maned lion wrath in his eyes and in half
a dozen tongues dialects of the southwest
he hurled the word at them

  water i want water

  a fierce anger surged into northrups
heart would these copper-bodied devils
of silence keep on with their mad dance
while sax northrup was dying of thirst

  he bore down upon them the voice in
his throat harsh and savage they gave
back before him moving but a little to the
side their bodies still swaying their lips
still moving but he saw that the scores of
eyes were turned upon him wonderingly

  so he came almost to the boulder upon
which the old man stood he saw that
this one was clad differently from the others
a long robe hanging from his shoulders girt-
ed about by a broad band of red a chain of
glass beads-or were they turquoises-
about the forehead holding the hair back
he had come almost to this man thinking
him to be the one in authority here when
he found another of the bronze bodies in his
path

  northrup plunged toward him but this
man did not move aside he was taller
than the others northrup noted gaunt-
bodied like them but with mighty sinews
standing out upon shoulders and arms and
thighs a man as tall as northrup

  northrup threw out his arm to thrust this
man aside his one thought to come to the
old man but his arm struck a body hard
like rock unyielding

 -you shouted northrup stand

aside i want water

  the mans body was swaying gently with
the other swaying bodies his lips moving
with the other moving lips his eyes fear-
less and stubborn and filled with threat
northrups two hands shot out gripping
the bare shoulders

  until now he had seen no sign of a weapon
among these people but suddenly a knife
had leaped out in this mans right hand the
moonlight running down the thin keen
blade and still no sound save northrups

heavy breathing and scuffling feet and an-
gry snarling voice

  northrups rage was like the rage of a
mad desert animal as the knife-blade
swept upward preparatory for the down-
ward blow northrup struck his big fist
hammered straight into the indians face
the knife clattered to the rocks the indian
staggering back

  in an instant northrup was upon him
had caught the lean body in his hungering
hands had dragged it to the cliffs edge had
lifted it high in air until the bronzed limbs
stood out against the sky

  then his savage blood-lust gone as swift-
ly as it had come he had cast the man
down upon the ledge at his feet turning
swiftly toward the other forms which had
ceased swaying at last and as he turned
he heard a burst of laughter the soft tin-
kling laughter of a woman out of silence
he had drawn this thing a womans laugh
bubbling over with mirth like the overflow
of a sparkling fountain and then he saw
her

  beyond the stone where the old man
stood was a narrow rift in the wall of rock
deep in the rift was a blazing fire throwing
into relief the form which had come out
from it the form of a girl her left arm
and shoulder bare and brown a single stone
or bead gleaming upon her forehead her
slender form clad in a long loose robe of
white her feet encased in moccasins of white
buckskin

  and her eyes under her dusky hair laugh-
ed fcer red lips laughed and as if an echo
of her laughter came the laughter of the
gaudy-plumaged parrot perched upon her
round wrist

  northrup stared at her in amazement
thinking himself staring at some soft maid-
en of the orient he forgot the others for-
got the man at his feet who had rolled over
his dark hand going swiftly to the knife
upon the rock he thought of it in time
because of what he saw in the girls eyes

  no sound after the laughter had died
away no single word but in her eyes was
a language which was not to be misunder-
stood there was anger there now a wrath
which blazed as brightly as northrups had
and there was a command her eyes pass-
ing beyond northrup were upon the man
with the knife

  she lifted her hand as if putting a cup of
water to her lips then she nodded briefly
yahoya

at the man who stood so close to northrup
with the knife shaking in his hand north-
rup turning saw again the picture of an-
ger there but an anger sullen and hesi-
tant

  he again looked to the girl her hand
pointing at this man made again the swift
gesture of lifted cup then swept in a wide
arc pointing into the rift in the rock walls
through which the fire gleamed

  northrup found himself watching as he
might have done were this in reality some
extravaganza and he in his seat in the audi-
ence he read the command in the girls
furious eyes the hesitation and sullen rage
in the mans the wonder in other eyes and
something that looked like fear a look of
baffled fury in the eyes of the old man in
the long robe and then he was following
the man with the knife passing through a
long lane of silent watchful figures going
after his guide through the narrow passage-
way into the cliffs

  for an instant as he was passing close to
where the girl stood at the mouth of the
cleft northrup paused his eyes turned curi-
ously upon her her eyes met his steadily
eyes whose color was elusive there in the
moonlight he could only tell that they
were big dark and lustrous

  a word of thanks upon his lips was check-
ed by what he read in her quick expression
the girls gaze had swept him from the top
of his tousled yellow hair to the sole of his
dusty boots her look meeting his again
was filled with admiration her thought
stood out plainly with no attempt at con-
cealment it was as if she had opened her
red mouth and said softly wonderingly

  you are the biggest man the most won-
derful the most handsome i have ever look-
ed upon

  northrups face reddened suddenly and
he went on merely bowing deeply as he
passed he saw the face of the man with
the knife this man too had read the girls
expression and his features were twisted
with malicious rage

vi

r northrup forcing himself to
drink slowly looked about him be-
tween sips of the cold water he
had followed his guide through the narrow
cleft by the fagot fire up a series of wind-
ing uneven steps in the rock and out upon

a second ledge some distance to the side of
the first and some fifty feet higher

  here in a niche in the rock was a clay
water-jug brimming above rose the cliffs
precipitately upon one side upon the other
they fell straight down to the more gentle
slope of the foothills there was-no sign of
habitation here nothing to bespeak human
occupation of these heights save the water-
jug and the indian who had brought him
here

  turning northrup looked back down the
rude stairs and through the cut in the rocks
upon the lower ledge the old man was
standing upon the boulder his arms lifted
his face upturned his lips moving about
him the bronze figures naked save for the
loin-cloths were passing noiselessly bodies
swaying rhythmically

  the girl with the parrot upon her wrist
a slender peeled willow-rod tipped with
feathers in her hand was watching them
her ups moved with the others her lithe
body swayed with theirs the feather-tipped
rod in her hand beat time to the voiceless
singing

  the man at northrups side had slipped
silently away his bare feet falling noise-
lessly upon the rock staircase swiftly he
went down dropping from sight reappear-
ing by the fire passing out upon the lower
ledge to take once more his place in the
circling about the old man

  was the desert in all truth a place be-
witched and were these voiceless beings
the band of sorcerers brewing black magic
to cast out through the moonlight and over
the world what strange race of tongue-
less people was this upon which he had
stumbled following the wild tale of a dying
indian down in santa fe and-suddenly
the question which had not presented itself
for many days came back to him now-who
was tiyo

  northrup shrugged his shoulders in an-
swer to his own questioning and again lifted
the water-jug to his lips drinking more
deeply now time would answer him and
in the meantime he was not going to die of
hunger and thirst he sat down upon the
verge of the higher ledge filled his pipe and
resting watched what went on below

  for the greater part of an hour the silent
circling continued then at no signal
which he could see it ceased suddenly
breaking off with abrupt finality

  the girl with the parrot walking slowly
i

adventure

between the two long lines of bronze figures
which had drawn up and grown motionless
for her passing went to the boulder where
the old man in the white robe stood as
he reached down she put her hand up tak-
ing one of his she carried it to her lips
the action filled with reverence the old
man stood above her like one great in power
undisputed in authority accepting homage
and reverence as his due the girls attitude
was one of rare humbleness and humility

  but in an instant the parts had changed
as she had dropped the withered hand the
old man had slipped down from his place
of eminence in a moment he had sunk to
his knees had lifted the blue embroidered
fringe of her robe had carried it to his lips
and the girls air had suddenly undergone a
change lightning swift her head was lift-
ed the round throat showing brown and
bare through the opening in her robe she
had gathered her small height so that she
looked tall her manner was subtly arro-
gant queenly proud as the kneeling fig-
ure looked up at her the reverence was in
his eyes the power and dignity in hers

  its the land of mad folks grunted
northrup

  a man knowing as much as northrup of
the indians of the southwest such as dwell
in oraibi walpi ancient taos throughout
the desert lands of new mexico arizona
utah knows with what tenacity they cling
to traditions which were old centuries be-
fore the armored spaniard came hi to the
new world he knew them for a deeply
religious people their beliefs stoutly main-
tained in the face of alien interference filled
with ceremony and symbolism he knew
that this thing which he was watching was
some rite deeply important to these people
and could only watch wondering vaguely
what it portended

  among savage people there is perhaps
even less difficulty in selecting at a glance
the higher-ups than among a people who
have gone further with civilization al-
ready northrup recognized the very ob-
vious fact that the persons to be reckoned
with here were the old man in the white
robe a priest without doubt the young
man with the knife and the girl and now
awakening a keener interest in him came
the knowledge that for the moment at
least it was the girl to whom all eyes were
turned with reverence and obedience

  she lifted the rod in her hand a baho or

prayer-stick no doubt and once more the
silent circle was described the old man
leading the young fellow with the wonder-
ful physique following the others taking
their places behind him and all of them
passing under the outstretched baho stoop-
ed swiftly to lift the hem of her garment to
their lips she looked over their bent heads
with bright eyes like a young queen just
come into her birthright

  in a little they had all passed by her and
in silent procession had come through the
defile in the rocks mounting the crooked
steps passing by northrup with sharp
black eyes turned upon him across the sec-
ond ledge and down at the far side seeming
to him to drop one by one into the void be-
low

  after them came the women matrons
first with their hair arranged in hopi fash-
ion done low at each side the maidens with
their hair massed into two great whorls
one at each ear flashing quick glances of
curiosity at him upon the lower ledge
now were five figures only the girl with the
parrot and the two maidens who stood a
little back of her one on each side the old
man and the man with whom northrup
had struggled

  now the girl was making swift gestures
which for a little perplexed the man who
watched her from above though her com-
panions seemed readily enough to grasp her
meaning across the few feet which separ-
ated them northrup could catch their ex-
pressions as clearly as if it had been the sun
instead of the round moon hanging above
them into the eyes of the old man and
the two attendant maidens came a quick
look of horror into the eyes of the other
man a look of black anger

  the girl seeing what northrup saw lift-
ed her head a little higher her eyes grown
brighter suddenly hard as rock the ges-
ture again and northrup knew that it had
something to do with him for the feather-
tipped willow-rod was pointed toward him
then out across the ledge where the others
had gone then to the young man before her

  the old man seemed upon the verge of
speaking but still with locked lips he
shook his head vigorously the girl whirl-
ed upon him her attitude filled with sover-
eign menace and he drew back swiftly as if
afraid of her the two maidens eyes wide
lips parted breathlessly stared in sheer
amazement at her
yahoya



  again the girl with the parrot had whirled
about her back upon the old man some-
thing of contempt in the action her eyes
blazing at the younger man the gesture
came swift and imperious the fellow who
had already felt northrups fist and whose
lips were swollen because he had grew sul-
len shaking his head with determined re-
fusal

  the girl took a swift step toward him
he held his ground obstinately suddenly
her face showing the fury upon her she had
lifted the prayer-stick as if she would strike
him with it the thing was a slender rod
which a man might break between thumb
and forefinger and yet it was the sacred
bahol

  northrup thought that he heard a gasp
he knew that what looked like shaking fear
had descended from the rod still held aloft
the old man and the young had stooped
lifting the hem of her garment and the girl
her lips curved into a victors smile turned
her back upon all of them and came through
the defile to the higher ledge and to north-
rups side she flashed him a smile which
filled with triumph was not without the
warmth of the admiration which had been
in her eyes when he had passed her then
she went across the ledge pausing at the
brink to look back

  the old man and the two maidens had
followed her the other man his face con-
vulsed his eyes like knives came to where
northrup was now standing for a mo-
ment the two men looking into each others
eyes had a glimpse of what might lie in the
future then again northrup was follow-
ing his guide

  the girl seeming satisfied went down
over the edge of the cliff northrup follow-
ing his guide found other steps there wind-
ing downward and turning about a great
knob of rock and then startled by that
which he might have expected he was look-
ing down into the garden with the white
rock basin the white stone columns the
pool of water and the green-leafed trees he
had seen in the mirage

  here was a third broad ledge the cliffs
at the back curving outward over it al-
most like a roof close under this over-
hanging precipice was a building rudely
square built of white stone and cement
with one wide door set between two pillars
of stone

  there were half a dozen square openings

in the wall their use as windows obvious
upon the flat roof were green things grow-
ing and the great blossoms looking either
white or black in the fainter light there a
temple northrup guessed he was to learn
differently soon

  at the side of the pool the girl with the
parrot had stopped the bird fluttering
from her wrist perched upon a limb which
bent and swayed with him the old man
and the younger one who had guided
northrup here made again the deep obei-
sance and passed on going to the far edge
of this ledge and passing down other steps
out of sight the two attendant maidens
their eyes still wide with surprise and won-
der waited a few steps from their mistress

  again a quick imperious gesture as she
turned upon them they moved back and
away going from her to the stone building
disappearing through the wide door the
girl who had remained turned slowly her
eyes upon northrup

  for a little she stood looking at him with
deep soberness her oval face like a little
childs in its unaffected interest and curios-
ity then suddenly-it seemed that she
did all things with rare swiftness excepting
when the mood or pose of languor was upon
her-a smile touched her lips into gentle
curves her face dimpled up at him from
low in her throat came a little burst of
laughter

  ishohil in your big hands did tiyo
look a little bug squirming for that ba-
hana i thank you askwalil

  tiyo grunted northrup so the
gentleman with the carving-knife is our old
friend tiyo eh

  the words coming with the little start
of surprise found utterance quite natural-
ly in english in the same tongue he added
you pretty thing i wonder if you
know you are the prettiest girl i ever saw
red black yellow or white

  she looked at him frankly puzzled shak-
ing her head slowly northrup laughed
speaking in the tongue his many months
with so wuhti had perfected he said
quickly

  i was just mentioning my delight at
meeting up with tiyo i have heard of
him

  she showed her pleasure at his speaking
words which she could understand by clap-
ping her hands but again very sober in
her regard of him lifting her face upward


adventure

until the wonder was he didnt kiss her
tempting mouth then and there she studied
him a moment and then declared as though
quite satisfied and convinced

  you are beautiful bahana you are
like sikangvvunuptu your eyes are like
the skies one sees from the mountain-tops
your hair is like gold more beautiful than
gold

  she came closer putting up her hand in
that swift way of hers until her fingers gent-
ly brushed the hair at his temple

  yes you are like the god of the yellow
dawn

  northrup whistled and then though
he felt like a fool for it he blushed he
felt his face getting red as red as fire the
girl seeing his embarrassment laughed
again her mirth rippling out through the
still night as pure and clean a thing as the
moonlight itself

  you little devil muttered the man

  she lifted her brows making again the
sign that she did not understand then for
an instant northrup lost sight of her in a
new vision which appeared abruptly he
had thought that tiyo and the old priest
had gone on down the rocks somewhere
evidently they had contented themselves by
merely going down over the edge and re-
maining there just out of sight

  for as if some one had pulled a string
and they both were puppets answering to
the jerk their two heads appeared again
the old mans face twisted evilly into a crim-
son rage tiyos eyes filled with horror and
an anger like the priests even the two
maidens who had disappeared through the
wide doorway were back at the entrance it
seemed to northrup that their dark faces
had grown ashy he was positive that
they had clutched at each other and that
they were trembling he turned question-
ing eyes back to the girl

  if before she had taken upon herself a
seeming of queenliness now she was like
an angry goddess a moment ago one
could not have looked into the limpid
laughing pools which were her eyes and
have imagined that they could change so
they blazed with an anger which was great-
er than tiyos and the priests they shone
with a menace which was hard enough to
inspire one with terror northrup saw that
while the two men held their places there
came quickly into their look a certain hint
of uneasiness the two maidens had fled

into the dark interior of the stone building

  why do you linger inaa wuhtaka
father old man she said with a tone
which knew the way to be at once cool
steady and deadly why tiyo do you
bring back into the presence of yahoya
your evil face unbidden do you wish
yahoyas blessing or her curse perhaps
the baho in her hand lifted a little a
very very little but the gesture was sig-
nificant both men started back as if they
had been struck across the faces then
only anger again to be read in the priests
countenance he began a series of frantic
signs which northrup looking on in won-
derment was at loss to read but which the
girl seemed to grasp readily

  inaa she said gently quite as a moth-
er might speak to a forward child although
his years must have numbered seventy at
the least while the maiden was at the first
blush of womanhood i understand what
your locked lips whisper your speech
comes from your heart and so it is kind
but you will remember inaa that though
a priest you are only a man whose path goes
the way soon of the skeleton house and
you will not forget inaa who is yahoya
go tiyo goes with you

  the thin old hands lifted in protest drop-
ped hopelessly with no word inaa and
tiyo with him went over the cliffs and out
of sight northrup filled more than ever
with curiosity turned to the girl

  he is like an old sheep is inaa she
smiled with pleasant disrespect for the
cloth all white wool and little brain
and tiyo-tiyo is his son

  and you said northrup wondering at
all he had seen you are-yahoya a
great lady-a princess

  her smile was as serene as the moonbeam
across the still pool as she answered him
stating quite simply as the most matter-of-
fact thing in the world

  i am yahoya-a goddess

vii

i - i see stammered northrup
when he could think of anything to
say i-i might have known it i
never saw a goddess before but-oh yes
youre a goddess all right

  yes said yahoya simply dimpling at
him quite like a maiden of flesh and blood
altogether adorable i am yahoya chief
y ahoya



goddess of the people of the hidden
spring sister of haruing wuhti daughter
of cotukvnangi god of thunder mother of
t-okila the night bride of pookhonghoya
god of war

  northrup bowed and remembered to take
off his hat from the comer of his eye he
looked at the goddess yahoya in stupefac-
tion was she poking fun at him or did
she believe all of that stuff

  the question need not go begging for an
answer her whole being breathed the cer-
tainty that she was what she had said she
was the attitude of inaa the priest and
his evil-eyed son tiyo backed up her belief
they were all so certain of the thing that
northrup a little dazed asked himself
well why not everything happens
here why not find oneself in the presence
of deity

  and he admitted that she looked the part
-all except being the mother of tokila the
night or of anything else

  it is the festival of silence the god-
dess was explaining to him in the same
quiet way at such time it is death to
make so much as a little sound with the
lips death to a mortal but i being an
immortal may do as i please you being
bidden by me may speak inaa and she
laughed again mirthfully as at a rare
thought inaa is afraid of the skeleton old
man but most of all is he afraid of me
yes said northrup gathering his wits
exactly

  she turned a little and led the way close
to the pool of water in the white basin
along its side and to what appeared to be
a huge panther-skin cast upon the ground
under a drooping tree here she seated
herself stretching out making herself com-
fortable lying as he knew she had been ly-
ing when the sorcery of the atmosphere had
shown her to him across the desert even
the parrot was upon a swaying branch
above her

  be seated bahana she said lightly
we shall talk my lips are tired with the
long silence

  northrups tired body was not averse to
accepting the invitation he sat just at
the fringe of the shadow of the tree a few
steps from her where he could see the play
of her features and already he began to
forget his weariness

  yesterday in the late afternoon he
said with the impulse upon him you were

lying here upon the panther-skin your
hair was loose all about your shoulders
your little moccasins had fallen off and you
did not notice you wore a flower at your
throat your bird was in the tree there
he dropped down and perched upon your
wrist

  yahoya without sitting up looked at
him a little startled hers now the time for
wonderment

  but you were not here to see bahana
i was out yonder he answered
 way out on the desert

  then she cried a little breathlessly
you too are a god not a bahana but a
deity you are perhaps him i said you
looked to be sikangwunuptu god of the
yellow dawn ishohil

  she had twisted over her graceful body
little less pantherine in its movements than
had been the body upon whose skin she
now lay and slipped to her feet standing
over him

  wondering what thing she was going to
do next northrup sat still watching her
she was making him a curtsey or an obei-
sance he wasnt quite sure which any-
way it was pretty and decidedly worth
watching he was already asking himself
why white girls didnt have half the charm
of this wild thing

  you are sikangwunuptu she was cry-
ing softly you a great god of the under-
world have come up to visit at the kiva of
yahoya chief goddess of the people of
the hidden spring you are more beauti-
ful than a man because you are more than
a man you have the strength of ten tiyos
because you are an immortal see i too
am immortali the goddess yahoya and
yet i even i kneel before sikangwunuptu
great god of the yellow dawn

  and true enough the impetuous creature
had sunk to her knees throwing out her
round brown arms as in supplication the
parrot perhaps bewildered at seeing his
mistress act so gave utterance to a nervous
squawk fluttered over her head availed
himself of a vicious snap at northrup and
went back to his tree to watch

  northrup in his wanderings up and down
the world had seen little of womankind
knew little of her and her ways in all es-
sentials he sat spellbound for an instant
hardly grasping yahoyas intent but in
another second when her two hands had
found his two and were lifting them to her


adventure

lips he realized that savage or goddess she
was getting into the way of making him
blush and that he didnt like it

  look here he said quickly my
names sax northrup if you want it and
im hungry

  yahoya laughed lightly northrup
wasnt sure that he knew what inspired her
laughter she seemed to be built of mirth
she was on her feet again in a flash drop-
ping him another of her quaint little bows
her dark eyes dancing then she had cup-
ped her two hands to her mouth and called
her two maidens came pattering in bare
feet across the stone courtyard

  nayangap mana tocha mana she
cried softly to them when hesitant and
wide-eyed they stood before their mistress
darting swift curious glances at northrup
you are in the presence of the gods

  as if this were a signal and they grasped
it instantly the two not uncomely maidens
plumped down upon their knees

  listen went on yahoya swiftly he
whom you see before you is one come up
from the underworld to have speech with
yahoya guard your eyes that they go
not blind with looking upon him it is
sikangwunuptu

  instantly four brown hands flew up to
hide four very bright and inquisitive eyes
northrup fancied while he was not certain
that the girl called nayangap was peeking
at him through her fingers

  he has come running across the desert
continued yahoya therefore is he hun-
gry he does not carry water with him as
men do therefore he thirsts hasten
before northrup missing the canteen
which had been with him so long came to
remember how in a fit of anger he had
thrown it away down in the canon nayan-
gap and tocha had flitted back across the
moonlit space like nimble little ghosts

  what makes you so certain demanded
northrup abruptly that you are a god-
dess

  yahoya again making herself comfort-
able upon her panther rug pondered the
matter a moment

  one just knows she explained the
coyote knows he is not a humming-bird
and the horn toad knows he is not an
eagle

  how does it happen then that you dwell
with mere mortals

  i tarry with them but a little while

she told him thoughtfully her eyes upon
the moon now my home is yonder

  in the moon i suppose he bantered
  yes she answered seriously

  but he argued scarcely knowing why
you were born here among these people
of them

  oh no she smiled brightly shaking
her head at him i was not born i have
lived always i just came

  then he demanded how in the-
how did you get here

  it was a night like this one many years
ago she explained the moon was big
like you see it now i floated down through
the night she laughed reminiscently
when i appeared coming out of nothing-
ness singing the sacred song before inaa
the old priest i think he was much afraid
but he knew that a goddess had come
there could be no doubt that she believed
this rigmarole nor did she seem to be
insane if one were taken when she was a
little girl taught from the beginning that
she was an immortal shed grow up into
such a young woman as yahoya was in
the old days when the divine right of kings
was undisputed the princesses must have
been no little like the yahoya type but
they were only mortals

  and of course inaa told everybody that
a goddess had come to town

  she nodded seeing no sacrilege in north-
rups way of speaking seeking beyond the
mystification of her explanation he
thought that he saw light priesthood often
enough is synonymous with trickery no
doubt some years ago old inaa had needed
or wanted to strengthen his prestige it
had been no doubt a comparatively simple
thing for him to procure a pretty little girl
from some distant tribe to bring her here
secretly and pass her off upon his credulous
people as a divinity it was not difficult to
see how hed strengthen his own hand in
the matter it at once amused northrup
and appealed to him as strangely pathetic
that the girl herself had come to believe as
the others believed

  i suppose he said completing in words
the thought which had suggested itself to
him that in due course of time inaa will
marry you off to tiyo his son

  that has been his wish she responded
and it was mine for in holy matters inaa
is very wise while in other things he is stu-
pid but when the man of wisdom came
yahoya



i saw it was not for me to marry tiyo but
him

  and who is the man of wisdom

  oh he is the one who teaches my peo-
ple wonderful things such things as men
know out in the world of the white man
and he tells yahoya wonderful tales of the
land where he will take her one day when
she marries him-of great wagons which
run uphill without horses of wires over
which people speak across many miles of
big waters with houses floating upon them
of beautiful women who wear beautiful gar-
ments

  northrup started a suspicion that at the
jump was almost a certainty upon him

  a tall man thin faced with drooping
eyes he asked very heavy eyebrows
coming together over his nose a way of
twisting his hands while he listened he
has been with you about half a year
yahoya gazed at him in rapt admira-
tion

  you know everything yellow beard
i know strang he grunted and i
think i know his ways so he is going to
marry you is he

  oh yes she dimpled at him that
will be nice wont it he is not pretty like
you yellow beard but then he is prettier
than tiyo and he is white

  on the outside growled northrup

but do you think it is wise for an-

  he had started to say an indian girl
and thought better of it he must try to
keep in mind that she was a goddess so
he finished-

  for one of your race to marry a white
man

  she stared at him wonderingly a moment
then broke again into laughter

  so then yellow beard does not know
everything after all his eyes can not see
through a piece of cotton cloth he thought
that yahoya was black like nayangap and
tocha look

the amazing maiden had suddenly
drawn open a little her robe at the
throat showing him the merest hint
of her round breast and northrup sat
astounded the sun and desert air had
worked their will with her flower-like face
and hands and arms making them brown
and dusky but her breast was as white
as milk

  you see she smiled quite naturally

goddesses are white like the women of the
bahana

  my god said northrup and then
trying to speak sternly although his voice
was a trifle uncertain cover yourself
child you oughtnt to do things like that
why she wanted to know am i
not pretty

  you are a madness-making little beauty
thats what you are he said in english
and besides you are an ingenuous little
savage

  his anger against strang had had many
months in which to cool and it was no hard
matter for northrups generous nature to
make allowances but suddenly the old
anger was flaring out hotter than ever it
was no hard matter to see the situation
through strangs eyes his big hands shut
slowly into hard fists

  do you love this man this strange ba-
hana he asked her

  yahoyas smiling lips had turned into a
pout her quick fingers were busy gather-
ing her gown close up about her brown
throat she had expected him to be pleased
with her and he had seemed angry with a
quick glance northrup saw what she was
doing glimpsed also a little gold chain
about her throat hidden in a moment by
her cotton garment

  goddesses do not love mere men she
told him loftily

  nayangap and tocha came then bearing
in their hands broad trays upon which were
many dishes and enough food for ten men
evidently they expected that the god si-
kangwunuptu had a stomach in proportion
to his might and dignity they set down
the trays half afraid of him and yet thrill-
ing a little with the thought of being so
close to him then at a curt nod from
their mistress they were gone

  tell me about strang northrup com-
manded after a sip of water and beginning
upon the piki does he love you

  oh yes yahoya answered a little stiff-
ly all men love me

  humph i dont

  you widening her eyes at him after a
fashion peculiarly her own but you are
not a man-youre just a god

  im no such thing he said emphatic-
ally im a man a white man i hope
and my name is sax northrup

  then she informed him demurely it
may chance that after all i shall not marry


adventure

the man of -wisdom for though you
growl like a bear you are so much prettier
i want to know all about strang said
northrup hurriedly hes been here over
half a year why does he stay on so long
she knew perfectly well how to droop her
eyelids how to flash a sidelong glance at
him how to do whatever she pleased with
her two dimples

  it may be that he has stayed because
yahoya lingers here

  he wasnt persuaded it might be but
it didnt sound like strang a little bit it
was more strangs way to get out of this
with both hands filled and to a place where
a man might throw his money after the
sort of things which are to be found in cities
of the white men

  also yahoya admitted it was the
word of inaa that the bahana should not
go forth to tell of the people of the hidden
spring he does not go out of sight of
tiyo or one of tiyos men

  he is a prisoner then

  he is held in high respect songs are
sung for him my people learn many things
from him but it is death for him if he
tries to go away

  then he asked her how does it hap-
pen that you count on having him show
you the wonderful things of his world when
you are married

  you ask many questions sax north-
rup she hesitated over the name casting
the two words into one and making quite a
mess of it but if you must know yahoya
and eddie have many words in private
eddie

  he tells me to call him that it is
nicer than strang and oh so much nicer
than saxnorthrup she achieved the last
with a little shudder and another of her sly
glances at him if i decide to love you i
shall call you eddie

  northrup passed from corn-meal soup to
melon from melon back to corn-meal soup
without ever realizing that his manner of
eating was fascinating yahoya if strang
had been here all this time and had had
words in private with this unsophisticated
little thing if in all that time he had not
taken the trouble to enlighten her upon her
possible past history what was the answer

  the man who would leave a partner to
die alone out in the desert robbing him of
his last drop of water was not the man to
be overscrupulous in his dealings with a

maid not with a maid like yahoya
northrup looked at her sharply seeking
the measure of her beauty she looked a
being created all of soft curves with ten-
der dimples set just where they would do
the most good or the most harm as the
case might be

  where is strang now tonight he
asked

there is sickness in the tribe down by
the corn meadows eddie has gone there to
drive out the sickness and make people well
whew so hes turned doctor has he
he is the man of wisdom he can do
all things he knows everything

  hes certainly got a strangle-hold on
the situation thought northrup

  out of a spell of moody abstraction he
was recalled to himself by the tinkle of ya-
hoyas laughter

  you make faces like this she informed
him wrinkling her forehead into a frown
and thrusting her lower jaw out at him it
must be that you and eddie are not good
friends

  i dont think that we are but look
here yahoya have you made up your mind
that you are going to marry him

  oh yes at the end of the festival of
silence

  what does inaa say of it and tiyo
inaa grows very cross and tiyo looks
at eddie like he could eat him up tiyo is
very sad that i dont wish to be his wife
you told me that before now the next
question is when does the festival of si-
lence end

  with the moonset then i will sing the
sacred song and after that my people may
unlock their lips

  and you marry strang at dawn

  yes saxnorthrup

  she looked at him teasingly as if her in-
stinct or intuition had told her that the
matter displeased him and as if it were all
a lark for her but she looked a little
troubled when he said shortly

  youre going to do nothing of the sort
not after i have a talk with your friend
eddie

viii

yahoya sat very still half in
moonlight half in shadow looking
steadily at northrup he return-
ing her gaze could see that in the depths of
her eyes there was a light as of an inner fire
yahoya



  i wonder she said softly are you si-
kangwunuptu god of the yellow dawn
or are you a mere man saxnorthrup

  it was not a question asked of him but
of herself and he made no answer he had
told her already now she was seeking to
decide for herself suddenly with that
swift gracefulness which was almost like a
liquid flowing she was upon her feet her
arms thrown out toward him as he rose
with her

  what are you she cried and there
was passionate earnestness throbbing
through her erect body thrilling through
her clear voice you come up like a god
-a white god of the underworld your
hair is like fine threads of gold your eyes
are like such turquoises as they do not find
any more in the world such turquoises as
haruing wuhti wears upon her throat and
arms when the sun god conies to see how
beautiful she is your skin where the sun
has not blackened it is white like goats
milk white and soft like yahoyas own
why do you come

  she broke off suddenly he could hear
her breathing then before he could an-
swer she had gone on impetuously drop-
ping her arms moving a little closer to him

  do you come seeking a maiden yellow
beard ishohil there is no mana here so
beautiful as i look do you come to
make my heart leap out of my side for you
it has leaped quick without waiting as
the white antelope leaps up when he sees
the wolf if you come seeking a maiden
then yellow beard here am i yahoya
maiden and goddess who will follow you
into the desert if you will or down into the
underworld

  she stood so close to him now that it was
almost as if he had obeyed the wild im-
pulse upon him and was holding her in his
arms for an instant he felt that one must
be more than man or less than man not to
yield to her

  but his arms lifting a little fell again to
his sides he had one code had sax north-
rup and many hard years of seeking to live
up to it had made him the man he was
accept the chances which the game of life
presents but play the game square if
ever there was call upon him for fair play
it was now

  yahoya he sought to speak sternly
but his voice was uncertain catching a lit-
tle in his throat there is moon-madness

upon you you dont know what it is you
are saying

  she looked at him with a curious smile
in which were oddly mingled wonder and
confidence

  must yahoya twist her lips into lies
when her lover comes she asked softly
must she hide her heart because it loves
you yellow beard

  you are talking nonsense he said
harshly you dont love me and theres
no reason why you should love doesnt
come this way in a hurry just because
you are used to indians about you and i

am the first white man-

  you forget eddie she dimpled at him
still confident and undisturbed by his words
i did not love eddie

  thank god for that but thats no rea-
son you should think you love me nor
any reason that i should love you

  she laughed at his earnestness

  your ups lie well for you saxnorthrup
but in your eyes i saw the truth before you
hid it when you lifted your arms a little

like this-

  already did northrup thinking of the
coming dawn foresee complication enough
without this feeling that he must settle
this matter while the strength of will was
with him he said in well simulated anger
yahoya listen to me i did not come
here seeking a maiden i came looking for
gold and turquoises i have need of them
not of a mana you do not love me and i
do not love you do you understand

  he marveled at the lightning - swift
changes which seemed so natural to this
girl in a flash the erect body had grown
rigid the laughing mouth hardened cruelly
the dark eyes were flashing at him as he
had seen them flash at old inaa in a mo-
ment of anger

  so she said and her voice was steady
and low but as hard as flint so you
come but to make mock of me is that it
i offer you my love and you push it aside
to seize upon gold and cold stones you
dare-you dare make light of yahoyas
love

  northrup watched her uncertain of the
answer to make

  if you are a god she said in the same
cold voice i too am a goddess then the
time will come when i shall learn how to
make you twist your great body in suffer-
ing if you are but a man--


adventure

  she stooped swiftly snatching up the
prayer-stick from the grass

  if you are but a man and she stretch-
ed it out over him i have but to touch
you with this and you wither and die
try it he said bluntly you might
kill a lizard with it nothing more

  a moment she seemed to hesitate in
deadly earnest filled with assurance that
her curse would annihilate him then she
dropped the baho to the grass again

  i think she said quietly that i shall
wait until the dawn that then i shall call
and tiyo and the others at my command
will hurl you out from the rocks and i
shall laugh at you while you die horribly
yellow beard

  ill plug a dozen of them full of holes
first grunted northrup a real anger be-
ginning to grow within him

  god knew he was but seeking to befriend
her and that she needed a man to lift a
curse from her and all that he was getting
by way of reward was a threat of death

  yahoya he said after the flash of an-
ger forcing himself to a sane line of thought
i want to tell you something will you
listen to me and try to understand

  now he was the one supplicating now
there was a note of eager pleading in his
voice and she was the one who could deny

  yahoya has wasted enough time amus-
ing herself with a new plaything she said
with her quaint little queenly air now
she must go and prepare for the bridal cere-
mony

  she took a step to pass him but north-
rup set himself stubbornly in her path

  stand aside she commanded him
or shall i call for tiyo and his men
what are you going to do he demand-
ed are you going on with this mad wed-
ding

  at the dawn she informed him coolly
yahoya will become the bride of the man
of wisdom after that she will do what
she likes it may be that she will have tiyo
throw eddie down the cliffs it may be that
she will become a bride again to tiyo it
may be that she will have tiyo throw yel-
low beard down to join the other bahana
whatever the goddess yahoya wishes done
that thing will be done and now will you
stand aside for me to pass

  no snapped northrup you are go-
ing to listen to me if i have to hold you
while you do it

  you would lay your hand on yahoya
the wonder at him stood high in her eyes
but back of it was a quick look of admira-
tion certainly this man dared much

  ill take you across my knee and spank
you in a minute he told her in mystifying
english

  are those magic words yellow beard
she asked quite seriously

  northrup grinned a little

  they are very magic words sometimes
he told her they have been known to
work wonders with little girls who didnt
mind properly i want to talk with you
about you yahoya before it is too late
perhaps it was his earnestness which held
her perhaps just the curiosity to know
what it was he had to say of her she
turned back again making herself comfort-
able upon her rug

  now and it was with a sigh of relief
that he began i want you to tell me again
of your coming here did inaa by any
chance save any of the garments which
you wore

  i came down from the emptiness of
night she told him my robe was built
of moonlight and mist

  its a wonder you didnt catch cold
he grinned at her and he thought that she
had to fight back an answering smile so
nothing that you wore has been saved
this only and her fingers at her throat
showed him a glimpse of the gold chain
this came with me from the moon and is
a magic thing

  he put out his hand eagerly for it it
might be that after all she had carried with
her through the years a locket which would
establish her identity-if he could ever get
her out of this

  let me look at it

  she shook her head

  it has never left my throat but the one
time for a goldsmith to lengthen it to
take it off would bring evil but since you
are curious saxnorthrup and since it may
happen that you will die in a few hours
you may come close and look

  northrup bent over her drawing the
chain out from under her robe from the
slender chain hung a little locket plain
gold he found the spring the locket flew
open within was the picture of a young
woman who in this light might have been
yahoya herself opposite the picture were
some two or three words engraved a full
yahoya



name he hoped but he could not make
them out

  well this was something if he ever got
out and got yahoya away with him hed
never rest until he could tell her who she
was

  about the time that you came here
he asked do you remember that the body
of a white man or woman was found any-
where in the desert where they had given
out starving dying of thirst or a rattle-
snake bite and quite near the spot where
you appeared before inaa

  no she answered obviously puzzled
why do you ask that yellow beard
this is the thing which i wanted to tell
you yahoya

  there he stopped hesitantly trying to
see just how to go about telling a goddess
that she was just a girl in spite of her many
years of belief to the contrary

  a good many years ago he began
slowly some people a man and a woman
and a little girl perhaps sought to cross
the desert god knows what drove them
or lured them we may never know that
yahoya or it may be that we shall find
out sometime at any rate just before
they came this far they died perhaps
their water gave out the man would try
to save his water for the woman she would
let her little girl drink and go thirsty her-
self so it might happen that both man
and woman would die and the little girl live
he paused again looking at her to see if
she began to understand she was looking
at him intently

  go on she commanded the little
girl what became of her

  they were white people yahoya the
little girl was too little to understand all
that had happened maybe her mother
dying or her father told her to go on to-
ward the cliffs where they had thought
they saw a man the man they saw was
inaa and the little white girl was-you
yahoya

  for a long time she sat still and silent
staring at him in sheer wonder yahoya
not a goddess yahoya a white girl the
daughter of a white man and woman who
had perished miserably on the desert

  northrup seeing the rise and fall of her
breast in the moonlight the look which
had crept into her wide eyes wondered
what tumult of thoughts had seethed into
her brain at his words it did not enter

his mind that she would not believe him

  but he had not counted sufficiently upon
what a dozen years of training had done for
her she had been very very little when
she had come to the people of the hidden
spring inaa had told her that she was a
goddess and had bade his people worship her

  she had heard over and over and over
the tale of her coming down through the
night from her distant home in the moon
the tale oft repeated had grown into fact
she did not remember her father and moth-
er dying of thirst she thought that she did
remember her floating down to earth among
the stars which worshiped her as she went
by she had been reared to a belief a re-
ligion which never a doubt had assailed a
confidence like hers was not to be shaken
by the words of the first man who said
you are no goddess but a mortal ba-
hana

  so you dare say to me yellow beard
that yahoya is no true goddess but an im-
postor is that it

  what i have to say is that old inaa is a

- scoundrel who has used you for his

own purposes muttered northrup you
are a girl just a girl and god knows there
is nothing more wonderful than that in the
world a girl to whom the going back to
the world of her kind will be nothing short
of dipping into fairyland

  yahoyas sudden laughter surprised him
fool she called him fool and liar
to think that i would believe such wild
tales it would be well if you remembered
that you are but a bahana saxnorthrup
while i am yahoya

  and he put out no hand now to stop her
as she went swiftly toward the stone edifice
under the overhanging cliffs

  heres a pretty game for a man to play
out he grunted when she was gone if
she were just plain girl things would be bad

enough but being a goddess to boot-

  here he broke off yahoya had left her
panther-skin behind her northrup rolled
up in it and went to sleep

ix

in spite of the fatigue resting
like a dead weight upon him north-
rup dozed more than slept that
night waking often his destiny had
brought to him a responsibility which he
accepted unqucstioningly


adventure

  the whole future life and happiness of
an extremely unsophisticated girl was upon
his shoulders and if he played the game fair
he had her hand as well as his own to play
these thoughts alone were sufficient to re-
strain him from yielding to heavy sleep
and allied with them was the feeling that
his new acquaintance tiyo might not be
averse to creeping up upon him and driving
a knife into him

  through the night he gained the impres-
sion that yahoya had not gone to bed
now and then a light moved across the
door of her stone habitation once or twice
he thought that he heard her voice giving
commands to her attendant maidens once
he was certain that it was her laugh as
carefree as if she had never known a shadow
of trouble or anxiety in her life that woke
him

  the moon had long passed the zenith
and from bright silver had turned to a milky
whiteness when he started up to a new
sound since coming to this strange place
he had heard no voice save his own and
yahoyas she herself had told him that no
one would dare speak until she had stood
out upon the cliffs edge and sung the sa-
cred song but now from the stone house
came not only her voice but the low rum-
ble of a mans utterance and the tone was
hard menacing oddly unpleasant

  northrup got to his feet stretching his
body to get the stiffness out of it he took
the gun out of its holster and examined it
to be sure that the clip was full that it
might be relied upon in case of need his
first thought was that the voice was
strangs

  it will be dawn in an hour he thought
i wonder what the new day is bringing for
all of us

  he went to the western edge of the cliffs
and looked down there was the head-
quarters of the tribe he could see ledges
and steps cut into the face of the precipice
could make out countless orifices rudely cir-
cular which no doubt led into intricate
passageways and numerous small chambers

  he noted swiftly that the stairways and
ledges seemed alive with figures of men
women and children and that in long
streams they were moving downward into
the canon below down there were many
other figures clustering in groups where
their fires burned northrup saw with a
frown what they were doing everywhere

were great jugs and from jug to jug the
men were passing drinking he saw that
many of them walked with the unsteady
step of drunkenness and all in silence-
silence absolute unbroken by so much as
a whisper silence hovering over a drunken
carousal

  when they start things going he mut-
tered where is it going to end

  yahoyas face the clear-eyed frank in-
genuous face of a girl who should be wear-
ing her first party gown flushed with the
triumph of her first season rose before him
if she had only realized the horror of the
position in which she stood it seemed to
northrup that the situation would have
been a shade less terrible but her calm
serenity in the face of all that encompassed
her her dimpling assurance that she was
the goddess yahoya only to be adored and
not to be harmed made him feel toward
her as he might have felt toward a child
cooing its happiness over a new discovery
as it crept toward a rattlesnake

  he shuddered at the thought and turn-
ing away from the silent orgy below went
with guarded steps toward the stone build-
ing

  the low rumble of the mans voice rasp-
ing impatiently now was not strangs voice
northrup realized that before he had gone
ten steps he moved on quietly coming to
the door

  he looked into the one large room which
constituted the greater part of the build-
ings interior saw that upon each side a
smaller door led into what was apparently
merely an anteroom of some sort saw ya-
hoya her two maidens and the man who
was speaking swiftly the man was inaa
the old priest his attitude was plainly one
of dominance and threat now yahoyas
eyes were filled with amazement north-
rup guessed quickly that never had a man
spoken to her like this before

  so intent were the four upon what inaa
was saying that none of them noted the
tall form in the shadow outside yahoya
was seated upon some sort of chair over
which a robe of white skins had been
thrown

  for a long moment northrups eyes clung
to her wonderingly until now he had not
been struck with the full measure of her
beauty now was there excuse enough for
superstitious minds to believe her what she
believed herself
y ahoya



   there were a score of little lamps in the
room set in niches or upon squared stones
the cotton wicks soaked in oil shedding a
bright soft light northrup saw that the
girls eyes were not black but a deep fath-
omless gray that her hair was not the night-
black hair of nayangap and tocha but a
rich sun-kissed brown

  the hair was arranged as the native
brides wear it in two great whorls one at
each ear held back from the forehead by a
broad band of gold above the brows a
great turquoise catching many lights from
the lamps shone from the middle of the
golden band

  the cotton gown of the early evening to-
gether with the broad blue sash had been
discarded for the bridal gown this was of
some stuff which could not be but which
looked the finest silk snow-white a cling-
ing garment which fitted the tender form
perfectly which left the arms bare which
showed a glimpse of the whiteness of the
young breast

  the band about her slim waist was a gir-
dle of gold beaten into little squares joined
cunningly each adorned with a pendent
turquoise her feet encased in snow-white
buckskin moccasins were crossed before
her upon the loose folds of the white robe

  nayangap and tocha stood one at each
side of their mistress their black eyes wide
and startled their lips parted a look of
fear upon each face inaas back was to-
ward northrup the old mans form was
tense his voice vibrant with the emotion
riding him

  it is death to break silence during the
festival of silence yahoya was saying
now quite calmly a little curl of contempt
touching her mouth you will go down to
the skeleton house inaa before the day is
born and dies again

   inaas grunt was eloquent of his defiance
will you not let the maidens go oh ya-
hoya he demanded in a tone which told
that the same demand before had met with
her refusal the thing which i have to
say for which i have dared break silence
before the time is not for them to hear
i have told you she answered him
steadily that it is my will that my maid-
ens stay with me surely with old age mad-
ness has come upon you you are great
among your people inaa but do you for-
get that you are only an old man soon to
die the skeleton old man has one hand

upon your beard now be careful what
you say how you speak to yahoya

  again inaas grunt making northrup
vaguely uneasy the old man was unmoved
by yahoyas words and his attitude was
plainly untinged by respect

  let the maids stay he said gruffly
it matters not if and as he turned a
little northrup could see the evil glance he
shot at them making them cringe back
from it if they speak later of what hap-
pens here tonight they will go at once and
for all time to a lover who has cold arms
and lies in darkness

  he paused a moment staring from under
his gathered brows at yahoya then he
spoke swiftly his voice lowered unspeak-
ably stern

   there is little time for what i have to
say must be finished before the first dawn
comes yahoya at dawn you will sing the
sacred song

  will the sun rise she mocked him
and afterward he retorted you will
wed

  do you think she answered her tone
filled with sarcasm that yahoya can find
a man among all these men who will wed
with so ugly a mana

  you think that you will put out your
hand and that the man of wisdom will
come you will wed him

   oho she laughed leaning a little for-
ward her mocking eyes upon the old
priests and are you jealous inaa with
madness has youth run back into your cold
blood making it hot again do you covet
yahoya

  and again she flung her laughter at him
playing with him finding vent for the an-
ger which he had whipped up in her inaa
lifted his hand as if to stop her and ya-
hoyas laughter taunted him until she had
done

   it is my desire he said angrily that
you wed one of my own people it is my
desire yahoya that you wed tiyo my
son it is also his desire and the words
coming coldly it is my command

slowly yahoyas face went
white she did not move but seem-
ed for a long moment a statue ready
to be wakened into life but as yet cold mar-
ble

  then the blood sprang back into her
cheeks racing hotly through her veins a


adventure

red tide of anger northrup drew a deep
breath and stared at her fascinated forget-
ful for the instant of inaa the girl stirred
a little where she sat then grew still only
her quick breathing and flashing eyes and
the color in her cheeks hinting at the tu-
mult in her breast

  the others are drinking in the canon
she said coolly have you too drunk deep-
ly inaa or are you eager to have the
vengeance of yahoya strike

  fool snarled inaa must i though
an old man be afraid of you a soft-bodied
girl for the thing i have to tell you ya-
hoya is that you are a girl and no goddess
just a girl as nayangap there and tocha
but with the white body of the ba-
hana

  northrup felt that he could have patted
the old villain on the back for that for if
anything were to be done for her the soon-
er yahoya got her ideas of her own divinity
out of her head the better

  a girl a girl with white skin but just a
girl he gibed mocking her as she had
mocked him a girl i put where she is a
girl i can pull down and give to the village
to play with when i wish would you like
oh dainty yahoya to have the hard hands
of many drunken men pull you this way
and that or would you like to obey the
command of inaa and wed tiyo-and so
remain to the people what inaa made you
a goddess you must decide swiftly for
the dawn is coming and does not wait ya-
hoya because a white maid bids it to

  nayangap and tocha gasped turning
their bewildered eyes from their mistress to
the old priest back to where yahoya sat
motionless

  slowly now yahoya stirred her gaze go-
ing to nayangap then to tocha

  you have heard inaa speak she said
very quietly you have seen one high in
the thoughts of the gods stricken with mad-
ness in a little those gods will gather him
to them nayangap and tocha you
will see his death has left the underworld
to bring him thither and harken well-
her voice rising a little-you maidens who
have heard must forget that you have
heard i have commanded i yahoya

  even yet she did not believe though
two men had told her first northrup who
claimed her one of his own blood next inaa
who told her of his own trickery yahoya
would not believe too deeply had the

training of a lifetime sunken into her mind
to be wiped out in an instant

  inaas rage curbed until now burst its
bonds with black distorted face with his
hands thrown out like claws of a beast he
leaped at her

  goddess are you yahoya he snarled
at her inaa will teach wisdom to a white-
bodied fool if you are goddess and no
maid then may you fling an old man away
with no effort

  northrup unprepared for the sudden at-
tack saw yahoya dragged from her seat
dragged down so that she was upon her
knees the priests hands at her throat ya-
hoya struggled but his strength in his rage
was ten times the strength of a girl and she
could not so much as cry out her two
maids stood transfixed with horror

  it was but an instant northrup gather-
ing his strength in a sudden flare of anger
scarcely less than the frenzy of inaa threw
himself upon the old man gripped his wrists
and ripped them away flinging inaa far
from him so that he staggered across the
room and struck the far wall

  you infernal cur cried the white man

  he turned away from the blinking evil
eyes to where yahoya white-faced and
panting was staring at them like one rudely
awaked from a nightmare

  why wont you believe he asked her
sharply it is almost the dawn your
whole life is in your hands now for a few
minutes why spoil it with an insane idea
cant you see that you are just a girl as he
says my god wont you see it

  in the girls eyes were so many emotions
striving for mastery over her that north-
rup could not guess what passed in her
mind she opened her lips but did not
speak he had felt a little spurt of anger
at her too that she let her stubbornness lie
in the way of her welfare now he felt only
a deep pity for her in a rude moment he
and inaa had tried to wrest from under her
feet the whole belief of her life small won-
der that she stared at them like that

  yahoya he went on gently cant you
understand it and cant you see that it
is a better thing to be a white girl after all
than a goddess of these cursed indians
why a world is open to you now that is as
wonderful as the world of the gods which
you have let yourself dream of it will be
like paradise for a girl at your age to come
into the twentieth century outside
yahoya

i

and- again under the emotion upon him
he broke into quick english-if youll just
buck up ill send you out of this mess if we
have to shoot our way out

  yahoya looking at him a moment curi-
ously turned and without a word went into
the anteroom at the left dropping a curtain
after her northrup swung about seeking
inaa the old man had slipped away

x

j go to your mistress northrup
j commanded the two trembling girls

      and remember goddess or maid
she is your mistress

 he went outside yahoya must have
time to think before he tried further to talk
with her and he himself wanted to think
inaa none too sweet-tempered an old ras-
cal at the best would be up to mischief now
his anger would include northrup as well as
yahoya it would be just as well to look
for nearly anything now

  but he had not looked for what had al-
ready begun his eyes seeking inaa had
gone naturally to the far edge of the cliff
where the steps of stone led down to the
canon where the tribe was drinking he
did not see inaa but saw a head rising as a
man climbed upward at first he had no
suspicion who the man was as strang had
gone from his mind and this was not the
strang he had known

  strangs breast showed as he came up
then from the base of the cliff what had
looked a shadow there resolved itself in-
to a mans form leaping out upon strang
the moonlight fell upon the fellow and
showed northrup tiyos dark face the
teeth showing the eyes gleaming murder-
ously the knife which already had threat-
ened northrup was flung up above strangs
head

  the two white men must have seen the
indian at the same moment simultane-
ously their quick cries shot through the still-
ness strang leaped up the last of the steps
throwing himself to the side as tiyo came
at him he had had but the instant to de-
cide and had decided upon taking the
chance here upon the level rather than seek-
ing to descend a hazardous way leaving his
enemy over him

  but tiyo had had time to plan for all
things as strang turned to the side the
indian sprang upon him northrup saw

the moonlight gleam on the uplifted blade
heard the little grunt with which tiyo
brought it down heard the thud of the im-
pact and for the second thought that all of
strangs accounts were squared

  then gripping his automatic having no
chance to shoot from here he ran to the
two forms which were rolling close to the
precipice as he leaped forward yahoya
having heard the cries came running by
her maidens to stand in the doorway watch-
ing them

  tiyos knife had drunk blood but not
from the body of the writhing man having
found a sheath only in the outflung fore-
arm now strang a tall man made into
iron from his months on the desert was
fighting as a maddened animal fights for its
life his hand had grown into a steel band
about tiyos wrist was forcing the knife
back from him and still like two great
fighting cats the two men now were almost
at the edge of nothingness

  the indian seeing a chance dropped his
knife so that it fell against the rock floor at
his left side as quick as lightning he had
swept it up again in his left hand had whip-
ped it up so that again it caught the moon-
light and then northrup throwing him-
self forward was in time his great fin-
gers shut about the indians left wrist grip-
ping it as strang gripped the other

  a moment of breathless struggle in which
the muscles of the three men stood out
mightily then the three bodies relaxed as
the knife came away in northrups hand
and strang and tiyo rolling over swiftly
got to their feet

  well done yellow beard

  yahoyas young voice came ringing to
them yahoya herself had come quickly to
northrups side looking up into his face
and again the man saw in the womans face
unhidden the admiration which looked out
at him frankly

  beyond the emotion which he had arous-
ed in her she seemed unmoved by what she
had seen she was laughing softly when
she said

  it is in yahoyas heart to make you love
her saxnorthrup

  strang whirled about suddenly until
now his watchful eyes had been for tiyo
alone the name even as yahoya pro-
nounced it brought him peering into north-
rups face

  northrup there was almost a gasp


adventure

of fear in the voice you-you didnt die
then

  i think not northrup assured him
coolly otherwise i should not have had
the privilege of saving you a throat-cut-
ting

  - him spat out strang his eyes

again going to the indian ill get him for
this

  tiyos face a moment ago a picture of
the hot rage and hatred within him now
showed nothing with an elaborate as-
sumption of nonchalance he lifted his shoul-
ders and turned to go down the steps
northrup watching him go noted that not
once had the man spoken that now his lips
were sealed the suspicion came to him
that tiyo like the rest of his simple people
had been tricked by the old priest into a
certainty that yahoya was a goddess and
did not dare speak until she singing the sa-
cred song had given the signal

  so you are alive demanded strang as
if he could not be convinced and you
have got here

  he was frowning his eyes deeply thought-
ful he seemed already to have forgotten
tiyo and that but for northrups coming
tiyos knife would have drunk more deep-
ly there was no gratitude in his sharp
glance but there was displeasure and sus-
picion as quick as a flash his eyes went
from northrup to yahoyas face where a
man must read what she did not seek to
hide

  curse it cried strang havent i got
enough on my hands already what the
devil do you want here

  northrup grunted his disgust of the
man

  in the first place he said coolly i
want a talk with you and i want it right
now before daybreak if youve got a
shred of decency in you if youve got a
drop of sporting blood which i dont be-
lieve you have i have a proposition to
make you

strang gripping his wounded
arm as he followed they went back
into yahoyas house for north-
rup wanted what privacy there was to be
had and he wanted what light he might
have upon strangs face

  yahoya unbidden but frankly interested
went with them as they began speaking
in a language which was unknown to her

she frowned a little and watched them the
more closely

  heres a girl whos in a nasty mess
northrup began abruptly shes white
and shes the plaything of a dirty old sav-
age weve got to get her out of this its
a sight more than a one - man job or i
wouldnt ask your help the mere fact
that there is no love between you and me
doesnt cut any figure in a case like this
will you tuck in and help me get her out
strangs head was down as he sought to
bind up his wound when he looked up it
was first at yahoya he studied her face
intently then turned to northrup then
of northrup he demanded sharply

  have you talked with her do you un-
derstand their lingo	

  yes

  what have you told her does she
know that the goddess stuff is all bunk

  i have told her but she doesnt believe
me inaa told her and she thought that he
was lying

  there was a gleam in strangs eye which
told northrup what he might expect even
before strangs voice demanded bluntly
well if she wants to believe it whats
the difference

  what difference cried northrup hot-
ly weve got to get her out i tell you
and it looks as if wed have to go on the
run unless she gets that fool notion out
of her head ive got my doubts if shell be
willing to go with us and leave what she
looks upon as her people

  strangs brows contracted into a quick
frown

  i know your sort pretty well sax north-
rup he said sharply youre the kind of
man who likes to run things pretty much

his own way and to - with the other

fellow here you butt in where ive been
six months and at the jump are telling me
what we are going to do hasnt it en-
tered your head that perhaps ive decided
for myself what i am going to do and
what this girl is going to do and by
heaven you can put it in your pipe and
smoke it right now that she is going to do
what i tell her to do

  northrup bit back the words which came
to his lips now was no time to quarrel
with strang and since no human being is
altogether vicious he still hoped to find a
hint of decency somewhere in strang
would you mind telling me what your
yahoya



plans are he asked quietly things are
going to happen pretty fast now you
know

  a little color came into strangs bronzed
cheeks a quick bright light like a flame into
his eyes

  so youll listen to reason will you he
demanded making the mistake of thinking
himself the bigger man at that moment
you can just bet things are going to hap-
pen in a hurry im going to get tiyos
tag to begin with the murderous young
hound and im going to put a crimp into
inaas game that will make him dizzy
and so that you wont make any mistakes
northrup ill tell you right now whos run-
nin the whole show here its ed strang
what ive got im going to hold on to what
i havent got-im going to get and im
going to keep it-just as long as i want
it

  his eyes went swiftly to the splendid
form of yahoya clung there a moment and
then defiantly came back to northrup

  you are just one man against a whole
tribe northrup reminded him keeping
the anger out of his voice though for an in-
stant his eyes were on fire with it has it
occurred to you that they will let you go
just as far as it pleases them and that
then they will know how to bring you up
with a rather ugly jerk

  strangs air while he was speaking had
subtly changed now if in truth he were
not the master of the situation he thought
that he was from confidence he went to
insolence

  ive been here six months youve been
here a few hours and so you advise and
warn he laughed impudently and if
you want to know i am not one man against
a tribe the tribe is split square in two and

by- im the man that split it inaa is

going down to make room for another man
whos hungering after his job tiyo is go-
ing the same way to make place for a sort
of tribal captain who belongs to me do
you begin to see sax northrup

  northrup saw knew that strang was tell-
ing him the truth and understood that in
sober truth strang might have made him-
self the power to reckon with here then
yahoya   

  it wont work he said quietly you
cant get away with it strang and you
ought to know it you might put it over
for a while but the bottom will drop out of

the whole thing sooner or later and i
think it will be sooner

  it will will it you wouldnt mind ex-
plaining how and why

  because where one white man has gone
another follows where two have been
many will come if i dont take this girl
out with me ill come back for her and i
wont come alone

  again strangs assurance rang in his
laugh

  has the thought occurred to you that
maybe you wont go out at all

  northrup stared at him incredulously
strang had risen or fallen to levels north-
rup had not thought open to him

  frankly it hadnt i generally go where
i want to go while we are threshing things
out you might tell me what you are driving
at

  im driving at this ive stumbled on
to something here which if i work it the
one right way will put me in a place where
i can make the astors and morgans shine
my shoes if i let you go your way out of
here to blab i stand to lose the whole
thing so you are not going to get out is
that plain enough

  youre taking over a pretty big con-
tract arent you asked northrup stead-
ily i dont see how youre going to pre-
vent me going out unless you get some of
your friends to stick a knife into me and
you wont do that

  how do you know i wont snapped
strang

  because you havent got the nerve re-
torted northrup i know your kind too
youd go off and leave a man to die alone
in the desert because youre an infernal
coward too much of a coward to kill a
man or to make somebody else do it
youre short on nerve strang

  strangs lips twitched a little but his
eyes held hard to northrups and the cool
dare in them after a brief hesitant mo-
ment he whirled about and went to the
door yahoya who had guessed what she
might of the conversation flashed a quick
glance at northrup and smiled

  almost immediately strang came back
he pointed outside northrup looking
saw six men one after the other come si-
lently up from the canon he noted that
all excepting one only were tall sinewy
young men of superb physiques and that
they were fully armed each carrying two


adventure

great-bladed knives at his belt and in his
hand a short thrusting-spear the one man
who had passed the prime of life looked a
patriarch hair and beard were snow
white he was great-framed and erect his
eyes flashed as if with youth

  inaas successor said strang taking on
again his marked manner of one supreme in
power and the first of the young men is
muyingwa who is hungering after tiyos
job they are friends of mine as you call
them northrup dont forget that and
there are more of them coming

  and i can drop the whole gang in their
tracks if need be before they can get within
knifing distance answered northrup un-
derstanding what lay back of strangs air
of authority

  and in the end get a two-edged knife
through you came the swift answer
you know that you wouldnt have a
chance in the world if you did getaway
for the minute what would you do run
out into the desert without taking time to
get a drink of water eh

  go ahead strang you havent entire-
ly outlined your plan

  so youre ready-to walk easy and talk
easier are you sneered strang

  still standing at the door he flung out his
hand a trifle theatrically the six men stop-
ped dead in their tracks he turned a smile
upon northrup

  you see now maybe youll listen i
havent got anything against you north-
rup and id let you go and be glad of it if
i could but i tell you i cant work this
game in a day its too big the stakes-i
tell you i can make the big men on wall
street look sick if i took a chance on you
and you squealed when you got out then
what i cant do it

  thats about enough sop to your con-
science cut in northrup what do you
think you are going to do with me

  im going to keep you here until i can
get out i need a man like you there are
mines here gold-mines-it makes me dizzy
to think about it-which these fool indians
have never worked beyond scratching the
top like a flock of clucking hens you are
going into the mines you are going to drive
the men i give you and drive them hard
you are going to clean up more money for
me than you ever saw and when i get
away and it goes with me then you can do
as you-please

  many thanks said northrup dryly
it doesnt sound good to me strang
before strang could answer the young
indian whom he had made known as muy-
ingwa came on leaving his fellows he
raised his hand in salute twice first to
strang second to yahoya

his eyes ran by them all flashed a greet-
ing which was filled with triumph at the
girl nayangap standing in the ante-
room door then his eyes upon strang he
lifted his hand and pointed toward the east
it was the first light of the dawn
northrup swung about toward yahoya
yahoya he said quickly you must
listen to me

  i listen yellow beard she said look-
ing at him curiously

  what do you want to talk to her about
demanded strang in sharp suspicion keep
your hands off sax northrup shes mine
and you will do well to keep it in mind
yours you contemptible coward
northrup flung at him his anger at last
snapping its leash you would trade on
her superstition and ignorance and then
throw her away when you got tired would
you now i am going to talk with her and
you are going outside while i do it

  am i jeered strang so youve got
a notion to the pretty innocent yourself
have you if you think ive kept my hands
off her this long just so you can have
her-

  northrup shut strangs mouth with a
blow which brought the blood and sent
strang reeling out through the door

  come in and ill kill you he said his
voice dropped low and grown husky i
mean that strang

  strang hesitated then went swiftly to
muyingwa and the others who had come
closer northrup paid no further attention
to him save always to keep him in sight

  yahoya he said as gently as he could
with the emotions riding him you must
believe me you are a girl a bahana like
me inaa has tricked you strang knows
it strang is a bad man in a good many
ways yahoya id rather see you marry
tiyo than him tiyo at least loves you i
think strang plans on getting rid of tiyo
and inaa on putting two other men in their
places-that old man out there and muy-
ingwa then strang will be chief man here
and he will do what he pleases with you
do you understand yahoya
yahoya



  i understand she said curiously that
you say i am no true goddess but a mere
girl like nayangap and tocha there but
white why do you lie to me yellow
beard

  lie to you he cried cant you see
its the truth cut your hand and it will
bleed put it in the fire and the fire will
burn it go without food and water and you
will die like the rest of us cant you see
youre just a god-blessed girl yahoya and
no goddess

  she shook her head the odd smile still in
her eyes

  the dawn is coming yellow beard she
said softly i must go the people wait
for yahoya

  but he cried after her you must not

marry strang-

  the goddess yahoya promised she told
him steadily a goddess must not lie

xi

not the most patient of men
northrup was tempted to express
himself in very strong words and to
inform miss yahoya that from now on she
could do as she pleased for all of him either
go to strang or the devil and be done with
it nor did the smile which she turned on
strang as she went by him soften north-
rups mood

  i have broken the sacred silence o ya-
hoya goddess strang was scarcely more
than whispering and yet northrups eager
ears caught the words clearly enough but
it was because harm was threatened you
and i feared for you am i forgiven
am i true goddess then eddie she
asked softly

  the white man in yonder says you are
not he answered quickly his eyes watch-
ful of her slightest change of expression
he is a liar inaa says you are not he is
a false priest bewitched they shall both
suffer for it yahoya tiyo denies your
godliness he too shall suffer shall they
not yahoya

  take them when you will she said
her eyes flaming and so she passed on

  northrup shrugged his shoulders he
told himself that he had done his best and
that he were a mad fool to attempt any-
thing further in the face of what confront-
ed him but since madness had the way of
galloping down his blood when crises came

he was by no means sure what the ending
might be he knew that he would watch
that if strang or his crowd sought to lay
hands on one sax northrup there was going
to be a fight worth a mans while

  as yahoya walking erect and swiftly
across the level space came to the cliffs
edge strang followed by the old patriarch-
al figure muyingwa and the other young
men went close behind her northrup
noted the glance which passed between
muyingwa and the girl nayangap a
glance easily understood since there was
not much difference between it and the
glance which might pass between two young
people in a box at the opera then north-
rup strode out after the others

  if there was to be a fight it was well to
plan a bit while there was time he forced
his mind to this now and away from ya-
hoya

  he saw that the indians heavily armed
as they were might be held off by a man
with an automatic and plenty of ammuni-
tion he saw that if strang carried a gun
it was hidden about his clothes he did
not believe that strang had any sort of fire-
arm upon him it would have been the
natural thing for the mans hand to have
gone its way to his hip when northrup had
struck him in the mouth and he had made
no such gesture there were a thousand
ways in which a man out on the desert for
months might have lost his weapon

  if im the only man here with a gun
pondered northrup theyll have their
work cut out for them if they start any-
thing

  he could withdraw toward the other
steps up which he had come from the first
canon in the narrow passageway he could
hold them back while he swept up the jug
of water after that what was to be would
be

  the dawn had come at last yahoya
standing upon the brink of the precipice
stood very still her head thrown back a
little her eyes upon the pale moon her
arms lifted northrup came closer to the
edge and looked down

  the dark forms there were quiet had
grown as motionless as yahoyas own the
whole tribe gathered there stood with lifted
arms with faces turned up now and then
when a form stirred northrup could see that
it was a stagger of drunkenness could guess
that the stuff which they had been drinking


adventure

was the terribly intoxicating juice of the
agave which fermented in rawhide bags
puts frenzy into men

  suddenly through the silence floated ya-
hoyas voice singing softly she was chant-
ing the sacred song the song which people
said she was singing when she appeared be-
fore inaa out of the night she gave the
words strange little twists of mispronuncia-
tion-but the words were english there
was no doubting that they were english or
rather that they had been english when
yahoyas baby voice had sung them for the
first time into inaas ears

  it struck northrup as an odd little thing
that this song alone should have remained
to the girl of the tongue which had been
her mothers this song which she could not
understand but whose sounds had been
kept fresh through frequent repetition

  and somehow the whole thing struck
him as more pitiful than amusing although
both elements mixed into it here was ya-
hoya who had called him liar for saying she
was no true goddess singing in all serious-
ness her sacred song down there far below
was a tribe of indians listening to her sa-
cred song with a sort of reverence and the
song itself was a nursery jingle

         buzzfuzz was a jolly fly

           very blithe and gay

         he began his lively dance
         with the break of day

        up and down the window-pane
          with a dainty tread

         sometimes on his tiptoes slides

sometimes on his head

  northrup caught a grin on strangs face
and could have kicked him for it in his
own eyes he felt a sting of salt mist he
no longer had a desire to laugh at yahoya
or at the face-lifted crowd below he no
longer felt resentment toward the girl he
did feel a quick impulse to sweep her up
into his arms to hold her tightly as one
might hold a very little motherless child
to carry her away from here and make life
over for her

       the song died away and the still-
ness of the festival of silence went
with it a thunder of voices crash-
ed through the night wild yells until now
pent up in riotous breasts broke out every-
where and though the voices seemed cry-
ing all things in the world from everywhere
rose the shout

  yahoya yahoya yahoya

  down yonder the forms were circling
drunkenly now-men women and children
stopping only that they might drink reel-
ing more and more shouting lifting their
voices in shrill finely drawn notes like the
yapping of a thousand coyotes

  but from the seething mess came out
several forms walking swiftly and straight
from here there was no need to look twice
to see that it was the old priest inaa who
led them close behind him came tiyo and
after him a score of young men all armed
as were the followers of strang they were
now coming up the steps northrup looked
quickly to see what strang was doing

  he had gathered about him the half-
dozen men who had come with him and was
giving sharp orders northrup marveled a
little to see them one after the other with-
draw until they had lost themselves in the
shadows under the overhanging cliffs

  if he means business wondered north-
rup why doesnt he make the fight as they
come up the cliffs the way tiyo went for
him or has his nerve left him after all
now standing upon the cliffs edge where
all above and below might see them were
three forms that of a white-clad maiden
her face radiant a strange brightness in her
eyes the form of strang close to her at her
left northrup upon her right a dozen steps
away then there was old inaa standing
between northrup and yahoya then tiyo
a little back his eyes like hard cold stones
upon strang the others who had followed
until now remained a score of steps from
the precipice where they were not to be
seen from below

  now the show-down grunted north-
rup to himself its strang against tiyo
who wins

  inaa slowly lifted his hand the shout-
ing ceased below again the leaping forms
grew still save for a little swaying it
seemed to northrup however that they
were vaguely restless eager for the happen-
ing of something at which he could only
guess was it merely the marriage cere-
mony or were there many men down
there waiting a signal to take sides some
with strang some with inaa and tiyo

  look people of the hidden spring
cried inaa suddenly his voice floating out
wildly his two arms wide-flung see how
inaa has kept you from under the heel of
the world of bahanas how many have
yahoya



come here in the memory of grown men
two-no more how many have gone
away again to tell of what they have seen
here none has not inaa guarded you
well look before the light comes see
where across the desert the eyes of inaa
are watching

  then northrup looking out the way the
old man pointed across the wide sweep of
desert to the south saw a great pillar of
flame standing red against the pale sky it
shot upward from the distant mountain-
peaks and he knew that at the least those
peaks were fifty miles away

  he looked to the eastward and saw again
a pillar of red fire lapping at the skies and
knew that it was little closer than the first
he looked to the west and saw the third
and suddenly as he remembered the old
indian woman who had kept him alive he
thought that there was less madness than
sanity in the things she had told him

  was she one of the outposts of this
strange people after all had her fires shot
their swift messages here that inaa might
know if all were well had the blaze his
own hands had kindled before her dying
eyes spoken to inaa too were there seven
citics of chebo as she had told was this
people but the first of them had the old
spanish adventurers but told the truth af-
ter all of the wonderful cities of cibola and
had they remained all these years hidden
from the white man he felt his blood tin-
gling through him

  he looked to the north here the cliffs
stood up so that one might not look far out
as in the other directions but here clear-
ly outlined against the sky was the form
of a man and the man was shouting his
voice coming down clearly

  in the north all is well father the fire
burns red

  again the people below shouted crying
  the red fires burn it is well

  and again they fell silent abruptly

  inaa has guarded his children well
went on the priest solemnly for fifty
years has he not been inguu and inaa
mother and father to you because the
gods were pleased did they not send one of
their kind the goddess yahoya to live
with you did they not send the bahana
whom you call the man of wisdom to cure
the sick and teach you how to make better
things from gold-beautiful things for you
to wear cups from which to drink and

has not inaa kept the bahana here so that
he might not go out to tell of what he has
seen and so bring the cursed white men
here as they have gone everywhere else
over the world

  a moment he was silent then his voice
lowered a little he continued

  inaa is old his years weigh him down
yahoya this night her heart opened to the
future has said that already is the skele-
ton house made ready for the coming of
inaa but he does not go and leave his
people without a thought for their welfare
he leaves behind him one to step into his
place the biggest man among you the
mightiest with his hands the swiftest run-
ner across the desert the most tireless
tiyo the head captain of your young men
a great shout swept up from below
tiyo tiyo tiyo

  and then as silence was settling a loud
voice boomed out

  tiyo for our head man yahoya for
our goddess tiyo and yahoya and
again many voices arose crying tiyo and
yahoya

  tiyo himself at a sharp glance from the
old man came forward another step swift-
ly standing very close to yahoya so close
that her gown brushed him the cheering
rose more windily from below strangs
eyes and tiyos met then to northrup it
was a sheer wonder that the two men could
hold themselves back from flying at each
others throats

  while they shouted down there inaa was
speaking swiftly with yahoya northrup
could not catch the words but words were
not needed now to tell what inaa was say-
ing he was commanding urging threat-
ening and when yahoya answered it
seemed that she had given him an answer
that pleased him

  listen my children cried inaa his
voice ringing with the triumph in it the
white goddess is pleased with you this
dawning her heart is yours it is not her
wish to journey back up through the skies
down which she came it is not her wish to
move on down into the uncterworld where
the abode of the gods is she will linger
here with you she will wed tiyo and you
shall be their children blessed of the gods
northrup could see that yahoya was
smiling she leaned out over the abyss un-
til he was afraid for her thinking that mad-
ness had come upon her and that she was


adventure

going to fall she lifted her hand and there
fell the great silence again seeming now
more breathless than ever and then when
everything was still when they waited and
wondered why she did not speak suddenly
she broke the silence and not with a
spoken word but with a clear burst of
laughter leaping out over them from her
red lips

  inaa frowned and plucked at his beard
tiyo shifted his feet looking uncertainly
from his father to yahoya strang stared
at her much as northrup was staring and
still until she had done yahoya gave free
vent to her tinkling laughter

   you have heard inaa she cried at last
her voice clear and steady confident and
imperious now hear yahoya do i look
to you like one afraid do i tremble as if
with fear does my body shake as mens
bodies do when they look on death and
yet have i been threatened tonight alik-
sai listen

  it is the dawning and yahoya the god-
dess has said that she would wed whom
would you have her take for husband my
people of the hidden spring shall it be
tiyo here he is hungry for me he is
shaking with the desire for me inaa bids
me marry him shall it be the man of wis-
dom he is covetous of beautiful things
and he wants yahoya his eyes burn me
with the greed in them shall i take him
for husband

  are you not my people o people of the
hidden spring shall not your wish enter
the heart of the white goddess cry out
in a loud voice and say whom shall yaho-
ya wed

  northrup moved closer without knowing
that he did so thrilled with the girls fear-
lessness he had heard her words to strang
he had seen her seem to agree with inaa
what was she going to do

  she herself had given the sign for divi-
sion in the shouting which answered her
there were many voices clamoring for tiyo
many for strang and as by magic the
throng about the fires was shaken into its
two factions women drawing back men
grouping here and yonder about their lead-
ers

  wait yahoyas clear young voice cut
through the din like a bell through a roll of
thunder wait and listen the man of
wisdom has said to me will you wed
me and yahoya the goddess promised

inaa has said to me will you wed tiyo
my son and yahoya told him i have
promised and a goddess may not break her
word what is the answer my people

  only a murmur crept up to her in an-
swer men looked at her wonderingly wait-
ing and listening as she had commanded
and again she laughed

   yahoya will tell you she cried lightly
her rising voice seeming to soar upward
upon wings of happiness yahoya the
goddess may not lie but what maiden
among you would not lie for her lover
yahoya who is no goddess but a white
maid will not wed with tiyo and she will
not wed with strang who is a coward she
chooses her own lover and if it be death-
why then she chooses death with him

   like a flash she had fled along the cliff-
edge sweeping by tiyo avoiding inaas
clutching fingers she had sped to north-
rups side and her arms flashed upward and
about his shoulders

  save me from them saxnorthrup she
whispered i am only a maid-and i am
afraid

  as northrup stared down at the face at
his breast he felt the wild flutter of her
heart against him and heard her whisper-
ing

  of you only am i not afraid-because i
love you saxnorthrup

xii

only a little while ago northrup
himself had said love does not
come like this in a hurry and
now he knew in a flash that then he had
known nothing of it that love comes as it
wills without mans bidding or consent
and madness though it might be it had
come to him

  as his arms shut about her hurting her
in that first embrace his heart was beating
as wildly as hers he wanted her she be-
longed to him and he was going to have
her

  he wanted to get her away from here and
to make her happy he wanted to show her
a world which would be like fairyland to
her he wanted to teach her his language
her own forgotten tongue he wanted to
mother her and father her and lover her
she was at once to him both an incompar-
able maiden and a little frightened hunted
wild thing
yahoya



  but while something deep within him
until now unawakened talked to his soul of
these things his eyes and brain were keenly
alive to what lay about him the thing
which he read in strangs eyes was little dif-
ferent from the thing he saw in the eyes of
tiyo and inaa amazement first then in-
credulity which was still half stupefaction
then baffled rage and open threat

  northrups thought just then was that it
was going to end with him and yahoya go-
ing over the cliff together and yet in
that first wild moment it was only elation
which beat through his heart she lifted
her head a little looking straight up into
his eyes and there before them all not to
be robbed of what life seemed to be bring-
ing them at its close he kissed her

  you love me saxnorthrup the girl
whispered

  i love you yahoya he told her

  it was inaa wjio took the first step for-
ward yahoya seeing him coming slipped
quickly from northrups arms she alone
had been in a position to plan for all things
since she alone knew what yahoya was go-
ing to do she cried out clearly sending
her voice downward calling

  will you hear yahoya speak my peo-
ple will you bid inaa stand back while
yahoya speaks

  there came quick answer to her many
voices shouting

  yahoya listen to yahoya

  down below the two distinct factions
now stood fully separated grouped upon
opposite sides of the fires clearly they
were nearly equal in numbers clearly then
half of the men down there hungered to see
inaa and tiyo fail in their wishes while the
other half clung to the old order and stood
ready to oppose strangs party in all
things

  there is our one chance muttered
northrup ready for whatever might hap-
pen and he waited anxiously for yahoya
to speak

  inaa too waited and tiyo and strang
each for the moment uncertain yahoya
with a swift glance at them turned again
toward the expectant tribe

 among you she cried are many
young men and maidens what man of
you will stand aside and see another take
his mana what maiden of you will let
inaa or another tell her which lover she
must love you can look into yahoyas

heart and into yellow beards heart and
understand

  but listen further many of you drawn
off there against the cliffs have your hearts
filled with hatred of inaa and tiyo over
there stand you others and your hearts are
filled with hatred of the man of wisdom
across the space between you your eyes run
like the eyes of wolves hungering

  the people of the hidden spring love
their cornfields and their homes and their
quiet lives of security and yet even now
they are about to spring upon one another
to send many souls down to the skeleton
house to tear themselves in two is it
wise or has magic fallen upon you mag-
ic from the man of wisdom or from inaa
himself

  if i wed tiyo there will be war if i
wed the man of wisdom there will be war
what say you my people if yahoya weds
neither of them but the man of her own
choice the great yellow beard then to-
night you will not spill your blood and your
brothers but instead you will drink deep
feast full and sleep in peace now you can
command inaa to wed me to yellow beard
and so those of you who hate tiyo can
laugh at him those of you who hate the
man of wisdom can laugh at him

  aliksail listen one way you shall
have yahoyas death and yellow beards
for they will go down over the cliffs to-
gether you will have inaas death and
tiyos and strangs and muyingwas and
the deaths of many young men the strong-
est in the tribe for they will fall another
way and you will have peace and tomor-
row you can have your election if you like
keeping inaa where he is or putting another
in his place what say you my people

  she drew back a little not so far as to be
lost from their sight just so that she could
stretch out her hand and slip it into north-
rups inaa began shouting tiyos voice
joined his angrily strang stepping for-
ward called with them and from below
out of a little silence came a great shout of
laughter

  let us drink brothers cried a loud
voice we were bewitched the maid is
right why should we fight when it is eas-
ier to drink and eat to dance and sleep
inaa had promised us a wedding let him
marry the maid to yellow beard

  now many shouted one thing many an-
other but again and again a grumble of
o

adventure

dissatisfaction was drowned in a shout of
laughter in the main the faction hating
tiyo was satisfied to see him thrust aside
for another those hating strang were sat-
isfied in his discomfiture

  the hopi are at heart peace-loving peo-
ple a dance and a feast appeal to them far
more than an orgy of blood here was at
once a compromise and a huge joke on their
head men and perhaps many lovers below
felt their rude sympathy for the lovers above

  tiyos twenty men drawing closer now
looked at one another a trifle uncertainly
they began speaking in low tones and
northrup heard one of them laugh the
half-dozen men strang had left in the shad-
ows had been joined secretly by several
others they too had drawn closer and were
speaking among themselves

  looking to them northrup saw a quick
figure flit out of yahoyas stone building
and run toward them it was the girl na-
yangap she went hastily to the side of
the young man muyingwa and began
speaking to him earnestly and muying-
wa nodding came on until he stood close
to yahoyas side strang stared at him
anxiously

  aliksai listen he cried loudly until
the din below grew still it is i muying-
wa who speak inaa has said that it is
tiyo who is the strongest of us the swift-
est runner he lies even now will i run
out across the desert with tiyo as many
miles as he will and come back ahead of
him the men who are my men know this
and have no love for liars so they would
not see yahoya wedded to one of them
but with yellow beard it is different let
inaa wed them and we shall throw down
our arms and feast then i will race with
tiyo and the man who is strongest and
swiftest will be your head captain then
you will vote for inaa or the other as your
head priest what say you is not yaho-
ya right what man of us loves tiyo or the
man of wisdom better than his own life

  while those bent upon strife murmured
everywhere those who had gone into the
division half-heartedly or not at all out-
numbered them many to one when after
that inaa sought to make himself heard no
one would listen when tiyo shouted his
words were lost to the ears of those stand-
ing close to him when strang shot out a
sharp word and an evil glance at muying-
wa it was met with a hard stare muying-

wa had gone back to his mana and the two
of them were standing like northrup and
yahoya hand in hand

  it was perhaps muyingwas offer to race
with tiyo as much as anything which set-
tled the matter there are no runners in
the world like the runners of the southwest-
ern desert they are men who can run an
unbelievable number of miles out across
blazing sands in the morning to dig in their
fields and run back the same evening with
them running is at once a necessary thing
a part of their religious training and a way
of settling just such debates as the one that
had arisen now

  they began sweeping up along the steep
steps now the men of the two factions min-
gling jostling one another each eager to be
the first to come to the top northrup
pressed yahoyas hand mightily

  you are a god-blessed wonder yaho-
ya he whispered we are going to pull
through

  you hurt my hand saxnorthrup she
smiled up at him but-do it again

soon they were in the center of a
great ring they with inaa strang
and tiyo men were laughing open-
ly everywhere and their eyes when they
had finished with yahoya and northrup
had already measured tiyo and were seek-
ing to measure muyingwa that they might
lay their wagers upon the endurance run

  a man is not head priest of such a peo-
ple as this for fifty years without learning
something there was not a cooler craftier
mind among them than inaas he knew
full well that in time of storm the reed that
bends is better off than the stubborn tree
he frowned warningly at tiyo then mak-
ing his face over into its habitual mask
turned to yahoya

  yahoya has been pleased he said
steadily to test her people she has de-
clared herself no true goddess but a mere
maid to see if in our hearts fear of the god-
dess were greater than love of yahoya
her will is the will of her people the dawn
has come and a wedding is promised let
yahoya and the great bahana come for-
ward

  northrup looking down quickly at ya-
hoya saw that her dimples had come back
that her eyes were shining softly that a
happy flush had run up into her cheeks
what wonderful thing was this had it
yahoya



been just a few hours since he had come
here dying of thirst or had it been years
was he sax northrup about to be joined
to this radiant girl in matrimony none the
less holy to him because of the heathen rites
with which it was to be celebrated or
was he dreaming the whole mad thing

  slowly his hand holding hers he and
yahoya stepped forward and then a sud-
den dread came upon him if it had come
to open fight it would have been one thing
a thing northrup knew but now that no
knife-blade caught the early light he knew
that none the less there were knives hun-
gering for him perhaps for yahoya he
felt that all about him was menace the
more terrible because it was glossed over
with smiles-a concealed masked danger

  but these things he promptly forgot
inaa fighting hard for the mastery of him-
self and getting it wonderfully gave the
people what they demanded a wedding
northrup looking down at yahoyas up-
turned face saw a great unfeigned gladness
there her lips moved silently with inaas
as if she knew each word of the ceremony
and were saying it within her heart

  northrup did not know if he were doing
a good or a bad thing in letting this go on
he only knew that he loved yahoya and
that she thought that she loved him and
there was no time for thought already he
heard inaas words saw yahoya forming
them silently

  the spider woman and the great earth
woman the goddess who weaves the colors
of sunrise and sunset the goddess to whom
belongs the world the god who makes
green things grow and the god of rain the
great gods and the small gods bless you
yahoya and yellow beard you are a mana
and his woman the womans house is
open to the man to none but him it is done  

  and between two long lines instantly
formed of shouting laughing men sax
northrup and his wife given to him by her
own will and by the head priest of the peo-
ple of the hidden spring passed into the
stone house

xiii

we are married saxnorthrup
is it not nice to be married to
yahoya

  she came into his arms like a bird to its
nest fluttering a little eager to be there

  you are my man she whispered and
i am your manai oh but i am proud of
you saxnorthrup there is no other man
like you in the world did i not see you lift
up tiyo and cast him down so that his
bones ached did i not see you strike
eddie mightily so that he reeled back
afraid i am glad you are no god but a
man saxnorthrup glad that i am no god-
dess but a maid to love as other maids love
-but harder

  outside the last of the procession had
passed by the shouting forms had gone
down the stairway men were forgetting
them in their eagerness for a test of strength
and speed between tiyo and muyingwa

  northrup drew the girl tenderly to him
a little sense of awe upon him now that they
were alone together a little sense of pity
for her a feeling that though inaa had
given her to him and the tribe had cheered
all was not well they were forgotten for
the moment but northrup had not
missed the look in strangs eyes in inaas
in tiyos as they had passed the open door
and gone on

  yahoya he said gently i love you
things have a way of happening which i
had not expected i didnt know just what
love was and now i know i didnt believe
in it overmuch i suppose and now i know
that there is nothing else in the world this
morning that counts if a man looks at you
i want to murder him i am going to try
to take you away with me yahoya where
you will see other men better men to look
upon than i am i am going to play square
if i can and if you find you dont love me
after all that you do love some other man

then-

  then saxnorthrup she asked softly
i think id kill the brute said northrup
savagely

  whereupon yahoya was vastly delighted
you do love me she told him sagely
for i feel like that and eagerly youll
take me into the world of the bahanas so
that i shall see the wagons running uphill
without horses and great houses that
float on the water and many many won-
derful things

  could he do these things could he one
day take yahoya to her first opera could
he take her to marvel at the great spectacu-
lar shows of the great cities could he be
the first to initiate her into a life which
would be a veritable wonderland to her


adventure

had his destiny saved this one glorious thing
for him to do would ever any one in all
the world have been so equipped as was
yahoya for enjoyment for marveling from
day to day from night to night

  he could imagine her little cry of ecstasy
when they drove down broadway the first
night when she saw the lights the many-
colored electric displays above to her it
would be magic the train upon which
they traveled the womens gowns the por-
ters in their uniforms books and pictures
and music dainty things to eat-why an
ice-cream would be a thing of wonder to
her could he sax northrup take this
maid by the hand and lead her out into the
new world

  he remembered strangs look tiyos and
inaas and his brows contracted yahoya
looked at him wonderingly

  what is it saxnorthrup she asked un-
certainly i have displeased you

  he laughed at her drew her even closer
to him kissing the alarmed look out of her
eyes

  i was just thinking my little wild girl
he told her gaily thinking makes a mans
face look like that i wont do it any more
so much loverwise then man-like he
began thinking seriously again here was
the situation

  he had come here led by the lure of gold
if he got out at all it seemed that he would
go as empty-pocketed as he had come he
thought disparagingly of the thousand dol-
lars he had outside in a bank he didnt
know much about the cost of womens gar-
ments but he had the hazy idea that the
sort of gown he wanted yahoya to wear
would cost the greater part of his thousand
and then how was he going to take her
everywhere in the world give her every-
thing she would be sure to want shed be
asking for a hundred things every minute
at first

  so much for the money end of it there
was still left the greater question-

  can we get out at all

  it was almost as if she had read some of
his thoughts she had slipped away from
him running to the door of one of the ante-
rooms holding aside the curtain there she
said happily

  this is yahoyas sleeping-room will
you see how pretty it is saxnorthrup and
the pretty things her people gave her as
gifts to the goddess

  he hesitated at the door a moment un-
certain if he should profane it with his pres-
ence it drew from him a little gasp of ad-
miration and amazement

  there was a couch made cozy with the
skins thrown over it a table cunningly
made of wood so precious here stood out
in the center of the little room a square of
snow-white buckskin thrown over it upon
the table was a vase with pale-blue flowers 
and the vase itself was of solid gold skil-
fully hammered

  upon the floor arranged about the walls
were countless cups and vases tiny jugs
belts forehead bands moccasin ornaments
jeweled bracelets-all of solid gold many
set with flawless turquoises

  all presents to yahoya she smiled at
him you see saxnorthrup yahoya was
a goddess and a great lady before she gave
herself away to you and presently after
tiyo and muyingwa race there will be more
presents for me the bride and for you
the bridegroom saxnorthrup

  she made herself comfortable upon one
end of her couch drew up her feet under her
gathered her knees into her arms and dim-
pled over them at northrup

  no wonder strang counts himself a mil-
lionaire thought northrup and small
chance that he will let us get away if he
knows the way to stop us

  and to yahoya he said slowly

  do you know-mrs sax northrup-
she laughed delightedly and blushed be-
comingly at the new name which she inter-
rupted him by saying over softly to herself
-you are a disgracefully rich young
woman

  oh she laughed this is nothing in
each of the seven cities yahoya has a

house-

  seven cities broke in northrup quick-
ly what seven cities yahoya

  she lifted her brows at him in surprise
you do not know then this is but one
of the seven cities of chebo the smallest
where yahoya has come but seldom for
the festival of silence the others have
many people and big houses in the cliffs
with wide stairways up and down and hun-
dreds of rooms and in each is a great
house with five six nine rooms all belong-
ing to yahoya here i bring but two maids
there i have many to dress my hair to
bathe me to do little things for me that i
do not wish to do there i have many golden
yahoya



things a table all of gold with many
turquoises a little bed with golden feet
white furs to walk on a chair to ride in
heavy with gold that strong men carry
you shall see saxnorthrup and you shall
know that yahoya does not come to her
lover with empty hands

  nayangap and tocha came in to serve
them a breakfast of milk and little corn-meal
cakes in yahoyas room and until they had
gone taking their trays away with them
northrup listened eagerly to what ya-
hoya had to tell him and in brief this is
what he learned

  the seven cities of chebo controlled a
district perhaps two hundred miles across
there were rich valleys hidden in the
mountains where they grew their melons
and corn and cotton there were mines
from which they took vast quantities of gold
and silver fashioning ornaments and table
sendee for the rich

  a young man was overlord of the seven
cities having been elected to hold office
for life he had turned his eyes upon
yahoya but since he had already two
wives the priests very powerful through-
out the district had forbidden him wed-
ding her

  in order that white men might not come
into a country which nature had so cun-
ningly hidden from them there were sta-
tioned out through the desert upon any of
the water-trails sentinels who signaled by
fire or smoke when a man came into sight
generally these were the older folk men
and women useless to the state for other
purposes who believed that thus they
would be pleasing their gods and who con-
sidered it a high honor to be chosen for so
responsible a task

  so if a white man had turned toward the
seven cities he might not come within
fifty miles of the nearest of them when he
was met by runners sent out to intercept
him a friendly greeting a sharp knife
from the back and one more name stricken
from the list of adventurers or if men
were needed in the mines a living death
besides the outposts there were lookouts
upon the cliff-tops alert keen-eyed men
who did not miss the slinking form of a
gray coyote upon the gray sands

  northrup thought swiftly of the sand-
storm of his lying so long blotted out from
sight against the drifting sand of how when
he had at last come on it was night and the

lookouts had perhaps come down to take
part in the festival of silence

  if you did not know of the seven cit-
ies yahoya asked him how is it that
you came journeying this way saxnorth-
rup

  he began telling her of the indian in
santa fe only to be interrupted by yahoya
saying quickly-

  you were with eddie then when the
runner died

  yes strang has told you about that
no she answered he always lied to
me not knowing that i knew he lied he
said that in his heart he dreamed a dream
of me and that that brought him across the
sands hurrying

  northrup grunted then moved to
curiosity he demanded-

  if strang didnt tell you of it how do
you know

  tiyo told me she answered puzzling
him still more

  tiyo who told tiyo

  he was there it was tiyo who shot
the poisoned arrow in at the window
tiyo went way down to santa fe killed
his man and came back here

  she nodded

  the other was chiwakala son of the
old man that strang would make head
priest in the place of inaa chiwakala was
a friend of kish-taka the hawk man who
is overlord of the seven cities and not with-
out power himself between him and tiyo
there has always been rivalry and hatred
kish-taka sought to make him head captain
of the youths of the hidden spring but
even kish-takas power was less in this
matter than inaas and so tiyo was
elected

  chiwakala was bad in his heart nuk-
pana people said he was a powaka who
casts evil and sickness into men it was
tiyos doing that chiwakala was con-
demned to spend all his life down in a mine
where bad men and women are put and
those that kish-taka or the priests do not
like then chiwakala who was a great
runner like tiyo and muyingwa fled hav-
ing in his heart to go out among the bahana
and because he hated tiyo and others to
send certain of the bahanas into our land
telling them of riches to be had

  chiwakala went swiftly but tiyo went
after him also swiftly chiwakala coming
first among the bahanas had told his story


adventure

and men laughed at him calling him liar
then in santa fe he was to tell a man who
is known among the bahanas as a hardy
adventurer there tiyo came up with him
and shooting quickly through the open
window a little blue-winged arrow with
poison tip killed him then tiyo came
back and even kish-taka who had be-
friended chiwakala said that he had been
nukpana and that tiyo had done well for
the people of the seven cities

  from santa fe northrup estimated
roughly that he had traversed some four
hundred miles in coming here a round
trip of eight hundred miles and yet ya-
hoya spoke of the matter lightly as if tiyo
had run but a little way

  how long was tiyo gone he asked cu-
riously

  from the moonrise when he departed
until the dawning when he dropped down
before me she answered twenty days had
passed

  twenty days gasped northrup

  oh she said quickly misunderstanding
his thought it was because he lost time in
seeking out chiwakala among the white
men tiyo would have come back sooner
but for that

  eight hundred miles in twenty days
and yahoya was apologizing for tiyos
slowness a clip of over forty miles a day
day in and day out over such country as
northrup knew stretched between these
people and santa fe it was incredible-
and yet it was the sober truth for here
are a people not like other men a people
with a strange seemingly tireless power and
swiftness that is the result of desert train-
ing inheritance evolution all aided by the
religious ceremonies calling for an abnor-
mally developed physique the desert had
made creatures like the coyote the snake
the jackrabbit that knew how to live a very
long time without water the desert had
made its own plant life to exist and flourish
where water was not the desert had made
its men

  even now that a great issue held in bal-
ance that issue was to be decided by such
a race as perhaps no white man had ever
seen tiyo and muyingwa down in the
canon were ready

  shall we go out upon the cliff edge and
watch them said northrup i think
that very much depends on this race-for
you and me yahoya

        xiv

tiyo and muyingwa showed an
equal eagerness to be off they
stood side by side stripped the sun
already beating hot upon their naked bod-
ies as he looked down northrup mar-
veled how the desert had made her children
into what they must be to wrest nourish-
ment and draw life from her barren breasts

  the men were alike as he looked upon
them from the back their shoulders were
not wide though they were tall men both
of them their bodies were slender almost
reed-like in smooth symmetry and pliant
toughness there was no hint of a useless
ounce of flesh nothing but hard muscle

  but while bigness of body was nowhere
evident in the torsos which were none the
less magnificent the hips were thicker than
the hips of white men the thighs bulged
out with endurance in every knotted sinew
the calves were the swelling powerful calves
of marathon men

  the desert indian in his heart is a born
gambler his love for hazard no whit less
than the mongolians already were the
onlookers caught in a fever of excitement
as they cried out for their favorites and eag-
erly sought takers for their wagers from
the voices coming up to him northrup knew
that one man was seeking to bet his whole
years yield of corn that tiyo would come
in the victor that another staked many
gold cups on muyingwa that even the
women were wagering personal ornaments

  where will they run he asked of ya-
hoya

  yonder she pointed to the foot of
that peak without water on the way
there grow red flowers that are found no-
where else the one who brings the first
flower back wins it is the custom

  northrup judged that to the base of the
cliff it was at the least fifteen miles a race
of thirty miles through the hot sun and
without water

  who will win

  she shook her head thoughtfully

  it lies with the gods saxnorthrup
there are in the world no two runners like
them since chiwakala is dead no man
could beat them-except you saxnorth-
rup she ended loyally

  good lord grunted northrup id
shrivel up in about ten minutes but he
spoke in english
yahoya



  inaa made his way through the throng
which drew back for him from a cup in
his hand he sprinkled water upon both men

  the gods watch you my sons he said
loudly run

  they broke away from the throng which
watched them silently and went down the
gentle slope from the canon mouth at a
trot their elbows rubbing northrup
noted how tiyo held his arms drawn up a
little so that the relaxed hands were close
to his stomach how muyingwa ran with his
arms at his sides the hands dangling

  and in their action he saw no other differ-
ence there was the same free stride the
same way of bending the body slightly for-
ward with the head held up a little the same
easy play of muscles and rhythmic swing

  if i had to bet on either of them was
his thought id toss a coin for it

  and then mindful of what the result of
the race might mean to yahoya and to him
he cried sharply

  go to it muyingwa im backing you
like two great gaunt greyhounds tiyo
and muyingwa were already slipping out
into the desert their bare feet seeming
scarcely to touch the loose sand each
had hit his stride and northrup saw that
now muyingwa was setting the pace forg-
ing a step ahead and that tiyo seemed
quite content to drop the step behind he
frowned as he asked of yahoya--

  which man has won the most races in
his life

 and she answered-

  tiyo

  steadily each keeping to his stride the
two passed out into the gray expanse muy-
ingwa increasing the distance lying between
him and his rival tiyo never seeming to
see muyingwa now more than ever be-
fore did the desert seem like a mighty
ocean with these men two bold swimmers
striking straight out into it and the thought
must arise in the mind of a white man who
watched them is their strength so mighty
a thing that it will not forsake them before
they can get back

  but they would be back soon enough and
then there would be a settling of scores

  northrup drew his eyes away from the
two forms growing smaller in the distance
beginning to blend into the monotone of
desert and stared down at the throng below
him he found strang in a center of a
group of silent attentive men beyond

him was inaa the priest also with his
group around him

  they are like a crowd of schoolboys
thought northrup ready to break off
in the middle of a fight to watch a race
ready to get into mischief again the next
minute

  yahoya he said gently do you know
what it will mean for us if tiyo wins this
race

  yes she spoke quite steadily slip-
ping her hand into his and smiling a little
but we are not afraid to die you and i
saxnorthrup

  so it would be death then

  for you she told him it would be a
laborers work down in the mines for me
it would mean bride to tiyo or my own
knife in my heart we would not wait
saxnorthrup you and i

  what would we do he asked curi-
ously wondering at the girls calmness

  when we saw tiyo running home before
muyingwa we would leap out to meet him
saxnorthrup hand in hand as lovers
should

  you love me like that yahoya

  she pressed his hand hard in her own
that is the only way yahoya knows how
to love my husband but i am praying to
haruing wuhti and kokang wuhti that it
may be muyingwa who races home first
in either case there is going to be trou-
ble he said thoughtfully those men
down there are not to be cheated of their
fight while they are watching the race
should we try to leave by the way which i
came

  where you go i go with you she an-
swered but if they wished they could
come up with us out in the desert and
there are no cliffs out there for us to leap
from saxnorthrup

men were already coming up from
the canon seeking the heights from
which they might watch the race
until tiyo and muyingwa were lost to even
their piercing eyes in a little the level
space would be crowded

  let us go back into the house yahoya
suggested northrup there we can be
alone for a little and there we can have
certain men come presently whom we shall
want to talk with

  before they could gain the wide doorway
northrup saw many hard frowning eyes


adventure

turned upon him and knew that a little
while ago these same eyes had looked on
laughingly at his wedding with yahoya
the indians had enjoyed the moment had
found perhaps a pleasure in piquing at
once strang and tiyo and inaa had yielded
to the impulse of the moment and yahoyas
influence over them but now stood out
their eternal hatred of a white man

  quickly the level space about the pool
and the spires of rock uplifted into the air
were covered with men seeking to find the
two little moving dots in the wide sweep of
sand early among them came the girl
nayangap with no glance at northrup
now stooping swiftly she caught up the
hem of yahoyas gown and lifted it to her
lips

  yahoya she said softly her voice
troubled as were her eyes goddess or maid
it is all the same to the heart of nayangap
in her heart nayangap loves you and wor-
ships

  you are a good girl said yahoya with
a little touch of her old air of a young queen
look i give you this

  she caught up one of the many jeweled
cups from the floor nayangap shook her
head saying quickly

  nayangap does not come for presents
she brings you word from muyingwa
northrup looked at the girl eagerly for
the first time now nayangap looked at
him and it was to him rather than to
yahoya that she spoke

  muyingwa will win the race because he
is the better man and because the gods love
him best then his followers-and they are
many-will name him head captain of the
young men in tiyos place then too
the good men who are fair in their hearts
will name him head captain because they
have said the man who wins will be their
chief but there are others and they are
many too who are nukpana they will
break their promises as if they were the
shells of humming-birds eggs then be-
cause muyingwa is no coward there may be
a great spilling of blood

  go on said northrup impatiently
seeing that the girl was stopping

  her eyes had been very hard now sud-
denly they grew soft and into her dusky
cheeks a tide of red surged up

  muyingwa loves power and gold she
cried passionately muyingwa loves to
strive with other men but most of all

muyingwa loves a mana and that mana is
nayangap his heart sings like a thrush
and makes music in nayangaps heart when
he comes to her

  nayangap loves gold too and she loves
power for muyingwa and pretty gowns for
herself but most of all she loves muying-
was self and after muyingwa she loves
yahoya this muyingwa knows his
heart is big he would give to his mana all
things so he has called me aside before the
race and told me what i must do for yaho-
yas sake

  if yahoya were in truth goddess cried
yahoya her eyes bright she would make
muyingwa this day overlord of all the
seven cities since she is but a maid like
you nayangap she prays to the gods for
him

  this is the word of muyingwa went on
nayangap swiftly there will be a great
struggle and many men will go down to
maski but muyingwa will win because he
will have the stronger party and because
the gods are with him he has no love for
the man of wisdom who has tricked him
saying that yahoya would be left free to do
what she wished

  muyingwa says that if the fight comes
yahoya is to stay in her kiva where harm
can not come to her and that her lover
yellow beard shall come out to stand at
muyingwas right hand and fight the fight
with him

  askwali i thank you said yahoya
gently you will bring us water and food
nayangap yellow beard shall rest here
and sleep so that when the time comes
he shall fight a mans fight that is
best

  nayangap withdrew upon her errand
going swiftly yahoya came to northrup
then putting up her arms looking up into
his face

  my man she said softly kiss me
and when he had kissed her i love you
i am proud of you you are such a man
as never before came into the world if you
fall to-day i shall run out and throw myself
upon your body and die with you if you
live i shall live always with you in paradise
kiss me again and now sleep saxnorth-
rup

  the wonder is that northrup did sleep
he awoke from a dream of sitting in a box
at the theater with yahoya watching her
while she watched the actors yahoya was
yahoya



bending over him her hand laid lightly
upon his shoulder

  the lookout has called out that he can
see them returning muyingwa and tiyo
she said gravely shall we go out and
watch them you and i

       xv

passing with yahoya through
the curtained doorway into the
larger room northrup saw that at
the wider entrance there were two young
men standing their backs turned toward him

  two of muyingwas men said yahoya
he sent them to stand guard here
northrup stopped to offer his hand to
each

  if there is a fight he said we fight
together that is good

  their eyes upon his were hard and ex-
pressionless

 we are muyingwas men said one
bluntly we obey our orders

 again there were many men upon the
ledge all looking out toward the desert
where their eyes had found the forms of the
racers before northrup and yahoya had
come to where they too could see strang
had moved out of a knot of men and had
come swiftly to meet them a good deal of
the bluster of a few hours ago had oozed
out of him he was looking anxious

  look here northrup he said hurriedly
it strikes me that theres going to be an
almighty row in no time you and i have
had our troubles and theres no denying it
but at a time like this i guess weve got to
remember were white men stacked up
against a bunch of damned indians you
chip in on my side and ill see you through
if we come out of this alive

  strang was armed like the indians now
northrup was certain that the man had
either lost his gun out in the desert or had
had it taken away from him here

  ill chip in on your side returned
northrup coldly not because i am fool
enough to believe a man like you strang
but just because i see my one chance with
your crowd

  he saw in strangs eyes a quick light of
eagerness then the light died down the
eyes grew anxious again plainly strang
was afraid he sought to speak further
but northrup and yahoya passed on
everywhere were black looks turned

upon them many men sneering openly at
yahoya who was no longer goddess but
mere maid many of them speaking of him
in ugly voices which they did not seek to
keep from his ears northrup looked at
yahoya swiftly it was if she had neither
seen nor heard

  but again men forgot them for the mo-
ment tiyo and muyingwa from being
mere slow drifting dots grew into two men
striving mightily from afar it was clear
that they had fought their way mile after
mile with skill and cunning and muscle
they were now two staggering dust-cov-
ered forms and no mau yet could tell which
was muyingwa which tiyo

  on they came plunging across the loose
sand which caught at the feet that no longer
might spurn it lightly their lean bodies
crouching their arms dangling their knees
rising and falling only because stubborn
wills drove them on they staggered nei-
ther man looking up their hearts near
bursting their dry dusty tongues lolling
their bodies rocking as in agony on
through a reeling world with only a scant
two or three yards between them

  and only silence greeting them as men
strove to see which of those dark tortured
forms grasping a wilted flower in a dangling
hand was tiyo which muyingwa

  then at last they had come so close to
the base of the cliffs that they were recog-
nizable human beings no longer merely ex-
hausted machines a great crowd rumbled
out to greet them then many voices shout-
ing together-

  tiyo

  for it was tiyo in the lead even north-
rup saw that now and realized swiftly that
tiyos winning would strengthen tiyos
hand so that there would be little hope for
muyingwa and those whom he stood ready
to befriend

  at the shout the two men jerked up their
heads their faces were twisted and hag-
gard their mouths dropped open their
eyes were wild telling mutely of the
anguish-racked bodies upon which so terri-
ble a tax had been levied

  then the heads dropped the gaunt forms
staggered on feet sinking deep into the
sand being caught there dragged out with
effort more and more obvious and still no
great distance between them and the end
of the long run tiyo held his place in the
lead

adventure

  now many voices called out muying-
wa muyingwa but they called half-
heartedly through the bedlam rose the
shrill cry of a woman a wail of grief nayan-
gap hurrying down the stairway to meet
her defeated lover carried to him a face
scarcely less tortured than his own ya-
hoya slipped her hand into northrups

  look she whispered if to-day you
fall my husband yahoya will fall with
you

  the sun flashed a moment upon the keen
blade she had slipped from her gown
then as quickly as it had come the knife
was gone and she was pressing his hand
hard

  on came tiyo staggering more drunk-
enly than ever fighting for every step on
came muyingwa just behind him head
down and dogged cheer after cheer broke
out to greet the victor cheer after cheer
drummed into the ears of the man who had
challenged and who was losing

  inaa his eyes seeming on fire was draw-
ing with a sacred baho a small circle at the
head of the slope already were tiyos
feet upon the harder ground already was he
plunging reeling up the first of the hundred
yards of incline he swung up one arm
with a visible effort showing the fingers
gripping the stem of the red flower inaas
voice until now stilled called out trium-
phantly

  on tiyo my son the victors circle
wherein is room for one man only awaits
you on tiyo

  then tiyo turned a little for the first
time and saw muyingwas bowed reeling
form behind him tiyos staring eyes and
panting mouth grew into a twisted smile
then tiyo did not turn again

  as they ran the two men stumbled now
their numb feet striking against the stones
in their path each seeming ever upon the
verge of falling if tiyo should indeed fall
-if muyingwa fell-then before either man
could get upon his feet the race would be
lost

  it seemed to northrup that muyingwa
was driving some last ounce of reserve
strength into his lagging limbs it seemed
while a man could not be certain that he
had shaved off a fraction of the half-dozen
feet stretching between him and tiyo but
if he had cut off an inch what of it there
were but seventy-five yards now and tiyo
was a mans height in advance

  northrup caught a glimpse of a face
thrust close up to his own strangs face
the blood had drawn out of it leaving a
strange pallor over the sunburned skin

  the - quitter groaned strang

he said he could beat tiyo

  you talk about a quitter snapped
northrup shut up

  it seemed now that nothing less than
miracle could save the day for muyingwa
unless tiyo should fall and why should
one fall rather than the other

  there was a flutter of white close by
inaas side nayangap stood there her
arms thrown out toward the men racing so
slowly up the broken slope

  muyingwa she called muyingwa
he did not lift his head as he struggled
on he gave no sign that he had heard and
yet in the silence which had fallen a silence
of breathless intense eagerness he could
not but have heard

  tiyo thundered inaa tiyo ti-yo
muyingwa cried nayangap mu-
yingwa

  the eyes of those who watched drawn
for an instant to the forms of the old man
and the young mana came back quickly to
the runners was it in the seeming only
or had muyingwa crept a little closer
with hard ground underfoot with nayan-
gaps voice ringing in his ears had he added
a little swiftness to his slow plodding had
he in fact held a little reserve force for the
final dash was tiyo already so close to
the victors circle and with his rival in his
rear already the victor

  it was ending as a distance run so rarely
ends with the end in doubt until the very
close of endeavor muyingwa was gaining
tiyo was driving his muscles harder and
harder at every lagging step to make them
bend to his will but they were only
twenty-five yards from the goal and tiyo
still led the way

  tiyo shouted inaa

  muyingwa cried the girl her voice
throbbing in its appeal

  then all were still their bodies tense
their breathing hushed their hearts beating
thickly northrups hand gripping yaho-
yas grew into a vise which at another
time would have hurt her cruelly yahoya
did not feel it

  there was no sound now save the rattle
of stones set rolling the thud thud thud of
bare bleeding feet dropping heavily the
yahoya



gasping breathing of tiyo and muyingwa
one might fancy that he heard the hammer-
ing of their hearts despair in one not un-
tinged with wild hope victory in the other
touched with dread for tiyo could hear
muyingwas whistling breath close upon
his right a step behind

  so they came to the worst of the broken
ground not a dozen yards from the circle
inaa had drawn here an exhausted man
might fall if he were not wary in each of
the bursting hearts was the same thought
if a man fall now he sees his rival win

  tiyo having everything to lose feeling
himself already crowned with green leaves
and yellow flowers swerved a step to the
left muyingwa feeling the game all but
lost already kept straight ahead his
thudding feet struck among the jagged
stones which cut at them and tore them
with cruel knife-edges muyingwa felt
nothing but flung himself forward stagger-
ing falling catching himself staggering on

  tiyo saw him from the corner of his eye
abreast now and gathering his last strength
reeled on gaining a little muyingwa saw a
white fluttering gown just there in front
of him saw tiyo at his side and made the
supreme call upon his quivering muscles
he struck a stone in his way pitching over
it close to falling for the hundredth time

 muyingwa hardly more than a
maids whisper but many men heard it
my man

  tiyo had run his race and was tottering
almost at the rim of the circle his dizzy eyes
could not see muyingwa was like a spent
ball plowing on with its own momentum
tiyos foot struck a little mound of loose
dirt and he fell as he went down he threw
out his hand and muyingwa striking it
fell with him both men down and the
goal just there where it seemed either man
might reach it

  then men shouted as they had not shout-
ed until now so that inaas voice and na-
yangaps were lost in the thunderous roar
the canon echoes went mad with the word
tiyo tiyo tiyo

  the canon walls themselves seemed to
have awakened moved at last from their
cold slumber and to be shouting mu-
yingwa northrup heard men yelling about
him and did not know that his own voice
was lending its volume to theirs

  would the men never get to their feet
did they not know what hung upon them

were they loitering now at the very end

 but they were up now they were
going on both of them it seemed as if
they were seeking to drive men mad lifting
their feet so slowly holding them so long
suspended in air taking such puny baby
steps ahead even their faces were drawn
into grotesque grins as if they were mocking
those who clamored for them jeering at the
world who was ahead now their elbows
struck

  but now men saw that at each slow step
it was tiyo who held longest balanced upon
his spreading toes it was tiyos leg which
held longest suspended in air

  muyingwa threw high up above his head
the hand gripping the broken flower sway-
ing terribly muyingwa set his foot over the
circle

  muyingwa stood first in the narrow circle
wherein there is room for only one man
then staring stupidly at nayangap he
half turned seeing through a blur another
man coming on falteringly then mu-
yingwa not hearing the roar of voices
dropped his arm stooped a little a little
more sought to lift his hand and could not
rocked blindly back and forth and then
strength and consciousness going out of
him fell heavily and as he fell tiyos
body pitched forward and fell across him

xvi

quick cried northrup sharply
into your house yahoya we
must be ready now for what comes

  drawing her after him he hurried through
the clamoring throng he realized that now
for a moment men would not be thinking of
him and yahoya now was the time for
him to get her where she would be safest
he would not have been afraid for yahoya
had it not been for the look he had seen in
inaas eyes so few hours ago the old mans
temper would have hardly been sweetened by
tiyos defeat nor his anger at yahoya
lessened

  the two men muyingwa had deputed to
stand guard at the kivas entrance had quite
naturally forsaken their posts but were
back now as yahoya and northrup went in

  that day northrup and yahoya sat long
alone together in her little room waiting
nor did time drag for them there was so
much in each heart which must be told to
the other


adventure

  as the man looked into the clear gray
eyes fearless and filled with the love she
had given him so generously he sought to
close his thoughts to what might lie in the
future for them both one of the rare mo-
ments of a mans life had come to him when
past and future are hazy and unimportant
when he lives richly and to the full in the
glowing present he no longer marveled
at the love which had come to them it
seemed as natural a thing as the sunshine
outside

  a third man joined the two at the door
spoke with them in quick sharp tones and
went away the two remained keeping their
silent watch calm seeming untouched by
thought of a near crisis tocha came and
brought food saying that nayangap was
with muyingwa and that both her lover
and tiyo were like men whose souls had
gone down to maski

  all forms had disappeared from the ledge
where the pool was yahoyas parrot
swayed upon his branch admired his gay
plumage in the waters clear mirror and
flew to the kiva seeking his mistress from
the canon where the men of the tribe were
assembled came a voice only now and then
at long intervals then at last came na-
yangap her eyes bright her face suffused
with happiness a strange elation in her man-
ner

  listen she cried to yahoya running
to her mistress in a moment you will
hear the shouting down there they pro-
claim muyingwa head captain in tiyos
place

  and tiyo demanded northrup ea-
gerly what does he say about it

  is not muyingwa the greater man the
better the girl flashed at him did not
muyingwa beat tiyo so that all men might
laugh

  northrup had not noted that tiyos de-
feat was so marked as that but he said
nothing yahoya smiled a little at her
maids loyal enthusiasm

  men who are wise and men who are
good ran on nayangap will draw to
muyingwas side calling him their chief
men whose hearts are black and who listen
to the words of inaa will stand with tiyo
then will muyingwa lead his men out and
strike down the men of tiyo

  before she had finished strang came hur-
riedly into the kiva brushing by her rudely

  both of them are on their feet again

he said quickly they have eaten and
drunk and though they have been already
through hell today both of them are as fit
right now as an ordinary man what are
the devils made of and trouble is coming
coming quick

  why then are you not with your men
cried yahoya swiftly it is you who have
stirred them up to this madness you with
your whisperings and now you come here
-you coward

  coward am i he snarled at her
what about the man you keep here with
you

  he broke off sharply from the canon
came the mighty shout muyingwa and
as had already so many times happened
an answering shout arose tiyo

  it had come until strength had crept
back into the two exhausted bodies of their
principals the tribe had waited now
moved everywhere by muyingwas ringing
words and inaas fierce fire had flashed out
of smoldering restlessness there came
other cries sharper cries the shriek of a
man with a knife driven into his body

  northrup gathering yahoya passion-
ately into his arms held her there a long
moment then he pushed by strang and
ran out to the edge of the cliffs

below the men of the tribe had
drawn into two compact masses
fronting each other ominously their
short stabbing spears lifted between them
lay a man writhing slowly growing still
northrups first thought was that it might
be muyingwa or tiyo but another glance
showed both of them in front of their fac-
tions

  suddenly muyingwa shouted out some-
thing and his men following him ran
toward the long stairway tiyo saw un-
derstood and shouting bore down upon
them northrup seeing that both factions
strove now for the higher ground ran to
the head of the stairway his automatic
gripped ready for use

  the fighting began at the foot of the
stairway already the two sides had mixed
for although muyingwas men came first
to the stair its narrow steepness held them
back a little northrup saw muyingwas
form surrounded by his men saw tiyo and
inaa and the great spare form of the man
strang had selected for head priest to re-
place inaa he saw the whole body of men
yahoya



bristling with short spears and great knives
the sun glittering upon them brightly
seething back and forth struggling for the
stair

  one by one muyingwas men in the fore
were passing up in the rear they were
striking now dealing death and often
enough being dragged down to the death

  and in the strange silence which fell over
them all the struggle down there looked
some weird play scarcely real it was hard
for him to convince himself that this was
not a mock battle that the distorted faces
the writhing of fallen bodies was not all
sham and skilful acting about them the
mountains were so serene above the skies
so deep a blue the whole atmosphere so
charged with quiet peacefulness high in
air a vulture hung on motionless wings
watching with sharp eyes

  but when men fell stricken by those great
knives and two-edged spears they did not
move from where they had fallen or at best
but dragged their wounded bodies a little
way to fall and lie still tiyos men pressed
forward muyingwas men held back and
many were swiftly mounting the stairs

  at that northrup wondered for cer-
tainly muyingwas force was larger than
the one that attacked him and as certainly
muyingwa was no coward but now he
drew his men back ever back until they
had gained the stairway while tiyos sinis-
ter crowd charged stubbornly

  now men were contending everywhere
upon the floor of the canon along the cliff
sides even at the top of the stairway close
to where northrup stood he saw them go
down under vicious thrusts saw two of
them their arms locked about each other
their skins red with many wounds reel out-
ward and drop fifty feet and as yet the
gun in his hand was cold for there was no
way for him to determine which man was
muyingwas man which tiyos and to
chance a shot at tiyo or at inaa in that
packed mass would be to waste lead or per-
haps to kill a friend of muyingwa

  now he saw something which he could
not understand he figured roughly that
the tribe numbered between two and three
hundred men muyingwa and the men
with him now pressing up the steep way
which led to the ledge were not over twenty-
five in number the party at tiyos heels
could have numbered only about that
and down in the canon the rest of the men

a great mass of them had drawn aside and
were merely watching

  at last muyingwa had come to the top
he stood there shouting out his short com-
mands then stepped back his men follow-
ing him leaving the way open for such men
as might wish to come up after them this
again seemed madness to northrup who
grumbling gave way with the others it
was muyingwas voice in his ear that ex-
plained

  let them come yellow beard we
shall fight them here in the open man to

man

  but the others down there demanded
northrup

  it is my fight and tiyos each of us
has chosen twenty-five of his young men
the rest watch and i have chosen the
man of wisdom and you to be of my num-
ber

  then cried northrup hotly why do
you wait for them to come up with you
you have the advantage now strike as
they climb up

  an odd smile touched muyingwas stern
lips

  it is in my heart to fight fair yellow
beard it is not muyingwas wish to be
named the fox men already speak of
him as the eagle chief let them come

 then demanded northrup why
didnt you fight your fight down there
you had the chance

  muyingwa shook his head

  i will tell you yellow beard but time
has passed for long words i am the better
man and tiyo knew that when he raced
with me but for trickery on his part i
should have come into the circle an hour be-
fore him look

  he threw up his arm and for the first
time northrup saw a long gash in the mans
side

  when we were far out where men could
not see us he said his face black with his
anger tiyo who was behind ran like a
madman that he might come up with me
i saved my strength thinking he had lost
his senses then when he was upon me i
saw that he had carried a knife with him
concealing it cunningly under his arm he
would have killed me then had i not been
the greater man even so-you saw it-
i won over him

  all of muyingwas men were upon the
ledge now at their head mans command


adventure

they had drawn back and were watching
those with tiyo come up

  i have sworn an oath to the great gods
muyingwa ended briefly i have prom-
ised them that if they let me triumph over
tiyo in the race i should kill tiyo with my
own hands in a way that all men might see

  up the stairway after the last of tiyos
men came surging many others who were
eager to stand back and see northrup
glancing about saw that many others were
climbing swiftly to the cliffs upon the oppo-
site side of the canon after that he had
little enough time or opportunity to see any-
thing but the steely menace before him

  tiyos men mistaken in the reason for
muyingwas retreat thinking that they had
to do with men whose hearts were already
failing them bore on at a run lifting their
voices in a hideous charging shout each
man carried his stabbing spear drawn a
little back at his hip so that when the mo-
ment came a quick thrust outward would
drive the keen edges through a mans body
it came to northrup even at the moment
before the running line struck that tiyos
was the better generalship that muying-
was men waiting must go down before
the force of the wild attack

  the spit of northrups gun was lost in the
storm of shouting but a man had thrown
wide his arms and had gone down in a heap
they were twenty feet away every running
leap cutting the distance down so that
northrup must fire as fast as he could to
empty the first clip and he realized and
his lips tightened grimly that he would
have no chance for a second and still
muyingwas men were standing erect wait-
ing

  but they were men trained under mu-
yingwas own eye cool to the last mindful of
orders suddenly came muyingwas shout
and suddenly the spears in his mens hands
were lifted lifted balanced high over-
head and when the eyes of the men charg-
ing them glared redly not three-spear
lengths away the short spears were hurled
outward

  then many of tiyos men went down on
both sides of tiyo himself who came on
untouched

  the two lines met tiyos men that were
left wielding their spears mightily muying-
was men driving home their broad-bladed
knives with little coughing grunts north-
rup did not know that his gun was empty

that he had cast it down that somewhere his
hands had closed about a fallen spear he
only knew that about him surged a mad
carnage that men were shouting cursing
shrieking that a man drove at him with up-
lifted spear only to graze his shoulder and
to stop dead in his tracks with northrups
spear driven fairly through his body

  tiyo and muyingwa had met at last
northrup saw that dimly as if through a
fog saw and forgot as again he was breast
to breast with a great-bodied man who was
red with blood and who held high above
his head a dripping knife

  the knife swept downward and northrup
felt it like a burning iron in his neck and
shoulder a wild rage came upon him a
burning hatred and from then on nothing
was clear to him no emotion rode him but
the one unleased primitive desire to kill
kill kill he struck out savagely and the
man who had cut at him went down and
did not move

  tiyo and muyingwa were still struggling
yonder two of tiyos men drove their spears
through one man so that the steel heads
struck together yonder strang his face
ashen hurled his spear at a man who rushed
down upon him and missing shrieked
wildly close to the edge of the precipice
three men drove two back fighting for every
step of the way

  then bigness of body and strength of
limb stood sax northrup in such stead as
never until now where the fray was thick-
est there was his great form his clothes
splotched red his eyes spitting blue fire his
hair and beard wet with blood when he
struck a man must give back when he
thrust a man must go down when a thirst-
ing blade drank of his own blood his roar
was like the cry of a wounded lion

  now it seemed that the struggle had
swept like great whirlpools about two cen-
ters tiyo and muyingwa had been swept
apart both wounded both standing grimly
up to their bloody work a surging knot of
men contended near the edge of the cliffs
close to yahoyas kiva muyingwa was in
the center of a ring of glittering blades seek-
ing him

  through this ring of men came northrup
like a mad bull breaking through a flimsy
fence two men went down before him
and but one rose again

  he stumbled over a prone man and did
not know that it was strangs body his foot
yahoya



had struck muyingwa was here one man
against a half dozen and it was unfair fight-
ing that was the one thing perfectly plain
to him

  but now no longer was muyingwa one
against six back to back stood northrup
and muyingwa the two biggest men upon
the ledge muyingwa striking swiftly sent
a shouting laugh out by way of greeting

  well done yellow beard he shouted
and shouting thrust well done broth-
er

  a man went reeling back from his thrust
another stepped into his place northrup
struck out and a man went down but
before he could jerk back his spear another
menacing figure had leaped upon him

  northrup saw and swung his body to the
right seeking to avoid the glittering death
leaping out at him again he felt a pain like
the searing of white-hot iron this time in
his shoulder and he went down upon one
knee his teeth set hard the thought upon
him that soon or late a man must die and it
was well to die like a man he had lived to
the uttermost his lips had touched the lips
of yahoya he would not cry out at taking
the bitter with the sweet

  but muyingwa hard pressed as he was
had seen and the knife he was wielding now
drove between northrup and instant death
buried to the hilt in the body of the man
over him northrup jerked himself to his
feet his groping hand sweeping up his fallen
spear blacker rage than ever before in his
heart that he had seemed a lesser man than
muyingwa and before his berserk rush
men fell back muttering

  there was a great shout from the men at
the cliffs edge northrup pursuing a man
who fled nimbly before him saw a dozen
forms racing to meet him and braced himself
against them but he saw that they di-
vided and swept about him that they must
be muyingwas men come at last to the aid
of their chief

  and then northrup felt suddenly weary
and crouched down close to the precipice
it seemed that it was all over men stood
about and did nothing northrup was
alive so he supposed that his side had won
in the bloody game of brutes it had all
begun so suddenly seeming merely a hid-
eous dream it was ending so absurdly
suddenly still like some frenzied night-
mare with the broken men lying about
him

  his eyes passed by the little knot of idle
men and he saw that it had not yet ended
muyingwa still lived tiyo lived and they
alone fought on northrup watched them
curiously

  they moved back and forth spear oppos-
ing spear the bright points leaping forward
jerking back thrusting skilfully guarding
jealously where death might pay forfeit for
the wink of an eyelid but it seemed to
northrup that always they drew a litde
near to him that it was muyingwa who was
forcing the fight that steadily but oh so
slowly he was driving tiyo back

  northrup ran his hand across his dimming
eyes and the hand came away wet there
was a cut across his forehead which puzzled
him he had felt no wound there

  some one came running to him he saw
that it was yahoya he marveled at the
look in her eyes she dropped down beside
him her arms about him

  watch them yahoya he said thickly
it is muyingwa against tiyo now

  yes they were drawing closer now
there could be no doubt of that both men
were wounded one could not guess how
badly but both fought savagely desper-
ately knowing that only in death for one if
not for both could the blood feud end

  its muyingwas fight said northrup
slowly cant you see it yahoya
yahoya saw nothing in all the world but
her lover crouching at her feet her lover
wounded in a dozen places she sought to
answer but he voice broke

  look at their eyes northrup insisted
you can guess the end in a mans eyes at
a time like this yahoya tiyo is just des-
perate seeking to postpone the end mu-
yingwa is filled with elation he has made a
promise to his gods cant you see the
difference

  yahoya sobbed and knelt drawing her
arms tighter about him on they came
tiyo lunging heavily but always on the
guard muyingwa lighter of foot his eyes
bright with hard laughter and steely with
hatred on until they were so close that
yahoya and northrup must move a little
to the side on until tiyo dared take no fur-
ther step backward for fear of a plunge to
death on the rocks below

  then muyingwa calling out loudly
struck such a blow as he had not yet struck
the haft of his spear broke against
tiyos right wrist and his shattered weapon


adventure

and tiyos fallen one struck the ground
together

  while men looked on their mouths agape
muyingwa sprang forward only his hands
lifted against the knife which tiyo had
whipped from his belt with his left hand
as tiyos hand went up muyingwas rose
with it as tiyos sought to drive down-
ward muyingwas fingers shut hard about
his wrist

  now they struggled man to man body
to body their muscles cracking the sweat
running from them like water red sweat
across deep cuts slowly tiyos hand came
down the pointed blade finding its sheath
only in the empty air down and down
though tiyo strove wildly to wrest it away
from the fingers which shut like iron talons
about his wrist and slowly muyingwa
forced tiyo back toward the cliffs edge

  i have sworn tiyo panted muyingwa
with my two hands to cast you straight
down into maski see how i keep my
promise

  men gasped out at what they saw the
skin upon muyingwas bowed back seemed
splitting asunder with the bunching of the
muscles under it the veins in his arms and
forehead threatened to burst but the
fierce flames in his eyes were undimmed by
thought of failing power

  for an instant the two struggling forms
grew still only the slow swelling of a muscle
the hard breathing telling that they lived
and strove but it seemed that strength
was flowing out of tiyo fresh strength
flowing into muyingwa

  slowly one man bent under the others
iron hands slowly tiyos body twisted
as muyingwas fingers commanded slowly
muyingwa forced him down to his knees

  then-there was no slowness now mu-
yingwas movement being like a flash of light
-tiyo was swept upward in the others
grasp as he had before been swung aloft in
northrups their shadows fell across
northrup looking up he saw tiyos
wildly beating arms above him

  an instant he thought they were both go-
ing together then he saw that with a last
mighty effort muyingwa had broken tiyos
clutch upon him and as a great roar rose
up from the hundreds who watched tiyo
was flung far out

  then northrup gave up to the sickness
upon him and was quite content to sink
back into yahoyas arms

        xvii

it was a good fight my brother
northrup lying upon the couch
in yahoyas little room yahoyas
hand held in his looked up to see the tall
gaunt form of muyingwa in the doorway

now went on muyingwa slowly am
i a great man among my people now am

i	head captain of the people of the hidden
spring there is no man among all in the
seven cities who will not have muyingwas
name upon his lips time may come-
wtho can look into the darkness of unborn
tomorrow-when muyingwa may step up
to be overlord of all the cities of chebo
and my brother there was a time when we
fought yonder when muyingwa was close
to his death and yellow beard came to
fight the fight with muyingwa forcing
through spearmen like a hungry wolf
through little rabbits askwalil you are
my brother yellow beard muyingwa
thirsting on the desert would share his last
cup of water with you

  as for that answered northrup we
are even you saved my life for me--
it was nothing cut in muyingwa i
struck down one man who threatened you
you hurled yourself upon many you
shall see that i am no man to forget we
wait here until your wounds are whole then
we move on to chebo there already has
inaa run to tell his lies but men shall know
them for lies i shall enter the city as a
great man nayangap shall go at my side
a great lady for great ladies to wait upon
and you at my right shall go not as the
other bahana who died like a coward but as
muyingwas brother as muyingwa rises
you shall rise yellow beard

  had one spoken thus to the old sax
northrup saying i will lead you to rich
cities unknown to white men where per-
haps there is wealth to be got and power
there would have been only eagerness in his
heart but now-he shook his head

  muyingwa he said slowly it seems to
me that it is only a little thing i have done
for you no greater than the thing you have
done for me so let us put it aside you are
a man as i am a man muyingwa and you
have called me brother we may speak
plainly with each other

  it is not in my heart to go with you to
chebo to become a great man under your
hand it is my wish to be what i have al-
yahoya



ways been a man free to follow what trail
he wishes the trail i must follow leads
away from you and back to the world of
the bahanas you must let us go yahoya
and me

  muyingwa stared at him frowning
northrup looking into the mans hard eyes
felt his heart sink yahoya pressed his
hand softly

  we shall be happy even here sax-
northrup she whispered

  muyingwa silently lifted his hand a
dozen of his men came into the main room
of the kiva

  tell yellow beard said muyingwa
to the man who stood at their head what
are the vows the soldier must take when he
is no longer a boy but a man when the
chief priest and the overlord of the seven
cities put spear and knife into his hands
the man looked at him curiously as he
answered

  the young soldier swears that in all
things he will obey blindly the command of
the captain above him that he will die be-
fore he break one of the five priestly orders
that torture will not drive him to forget
what is the chief cause of his people
tell him went on muyingwa what is
the oath a soldier must take when he be-
comes such as i a head man

  that he will in all things obey the com-
mand of the overlord that the five priestly
orders are supreme in his heart that though
the gods themselves commanded he would
not forget the chief cause of his people
tell him said muyingwa what is this
chief cause of our people

  it is this answered the man there
shall come among us no bahana to despoil
our empire if a bahana come he shall be
as a prisoner among us and above all
things no bahana shall go forth from us to
talk of what he has seen

  you hear yellow beard demanded
muyingwa his tone seeming suddenly to
have grown savage

  i hear answered northrup

  then cried muyingwa so that the
sound of his voice reverberated strangely in
the stone room hear what muyingwa says
to you before muyingwa there may be
great riches and honor or there may be
death today you saved muyingwas life
and he used great words of his gratitude to
you he called you brother now it is in
your heart to go back to your own people

what is my answer you are a man as i am
a man you love a maiden as i love a
maiden i have said brother to you
here is my word

  you are no liar as was the man of wis-
dom tell me that you will tell no living
man the way to come upon the people of the
seven cities and i will believe you i will
go with you you and yahoya across the
desert leaving inaa to spin what lies he
likes in the ear of the overlord i will
bring my men with us bearing in their
hands things of gold to make a great lord
of you in your own land and then i will
leave you and come back to what awaits me
in chebo when muyingwa says brother
it is with his heart

  northrup stepped forward swiftly his
breast swelling deeply to the emotion burst-
ing from his heart his eyes shining his
hand shutting hard hard upon the hand of
muyingwa

  what you ask i promise he said sim-
ply i give you my word-brother

  for a moment these two strong men who
in verity had come from the ends of the
earth stood hands locked looking deeply
into each others eyes and as the two
hands fell away through the stillness of the
room could be heard northrups sigh and
muyingwas as one

  it is better whispered little nayangap
to be a man than a god

  yahoya slipped swiftly to her feet came
to muyingwas side and lifted his hand to
her lips her eyes were bright and there
was the glitter of tears in them

  you are a man of a great heart she
cried softly for does not yahoya know
that in chebo you will have to stand trial
before the overlord for the thing which you
have done that inaa whose power is
great will cry loudly for your death that
only if muyingwas power has grown in the
night and he has the secret ear of kish-
taka will death be averted

  muyingwa is not without power was
the calm answer not without favor in the
eyes of kish-taka the overlord and
muyingwa is not a coward

there came a star-filled night
when muyingwas tall form leading
his men was turned away from them
as he slowly moved back into the desert
toward the hidden cities northrup and
yahoya standing side by side watched
adventure



him until at last the night swallowed him

  at the foot of a great mesquite were buried
in the sand the things which muyingwas
men had brought from the place of the
people of the hidden spring many things
of heavy gold to-morrow northrup would
come back here for them now they had
passed out of his thought

  for there is a thing greater than gold
he whispered as he opened his arms for her
and we have found it yahoya

 so as muyingwa turned back to seek
that which lay in the future for him sax
northrup and yahoya turned their eyes
toward the shadowy outlines of their own
dreamings

author of in the bank fog the education of billy stream etc

he halibut fishing-schooner leona
t himmelman of anchorville
nova scotia was jogging in a
dense fog a few miles to the
eastward of cape observation island of
anticosti the skipper johnny himmel-
man had been looking for the fish all
the way from west point and had an idea
that halibut might be struck in the deep
water on the north shore of the island

  the leona t himmelman was a ninety-
five-ton semi-knockabout schooner carry-
ing eight double-trawl dories and a crew of
nineteen men the skipper and a few
members of the crew hailed from lunen-
burg county which accounted for his
teutonic name

 captain johnny could speak german
and had a taste for certain german dishes
-sauerkraut being one of them though
german in origin and retaining many of

  the old german tastes and ideas captain
himmelman was a canadian first last and
all the time and his eldest son corporal
roy himmelman was even then in france
fighting the empires battle in the ranks of
the first canadian expeditionary force

  with her jumbo weathered up the main-
sheet started and the wheel down a spoke
or two the schooner swashed lazily over
the fog-shrouded sea marking time until
the morning when the dories would be
swung over and a set made for the val-
uable flat fish on deck the two fisher-
men on watch smoked and lolled against
the lee nest of dories they did not bother
sounding the mechanical fog-horn as traffic
on the north shore of anticosti was scarce
being but rarely navigated by any other
craft than fishing-vessels

  below in the cabin the skipper and some
other members of the crew read old halifax
some fishing



  papers and discussed the all-absorbing topic
of the war

  i callate dat feller of mine will be in
der trenches now remarked the skipper
puffing away at his pipe i got a card
from him marked somewhere in france 
he aint seen nawthin o them sub-
marines has he queried a fisherman
busy overhauling a skate of halibut gear

  said der transport was chased by one
o dem off der irish coast answered cap-
tain johnny but der navy boats chased
der submarine away

  aint they the divil now them sub-
marines said another they say they
kin travel acrost th western ocean an
back an stay fur days under water how
dye spose they kin cotch them beggars
shoot at der periscope i callate re-
plied the skipper or ram dem i callate
dats de only way mit dem

  its a wonder none o them comes acrost
to this here gulf an lays for th montreal
boats cornin out with th sojers aboard
ef they kin travel th distance they say
they kin why dont they

  theyd need more gasoline to take
them back said a fisherman looking up
from the newspaper he was reading they
kin only carry ile enough to bring them
out-

  an oilskinned figure appeared in the
gangway

  say skip fur th love o mike hev a
look up here theres a bloomin spar-
buoy or somethin headin agin th tide
offn th starbd beam come up quick

the skipper and a few of the men
jumped on deck and stared in the
direction indicated by the fisher-
mans mittened hand the fog was hang-
ing heavy over the smooth surface of the
sea and about a cables length away a small
gray-colored pole was traveling slowly in
a westerly direction

  its movin all right remarked one of

the fishermen looks like a spar-

  limb o a water-logged tree i callate
said some one sarcastically

  aye headin to windard agin th tide
countered another use th small amount
o brains god give ye

  its us thats movin-not it growled
the other a driftin spar-buoy or maybe
a halibuters watch-buoy on the end o ms
gear

  the object was vanishing from sight in
the mist when the skipper who had been
staring at it through his marine glasses
suddenly exclaimed

  bubbles a reglar wake an der bub-
bles by yiminy boys dats der peri-
scope of a blasted yerman submarine

  all hands were on deck now staring into
the fog and for a minute no one spoke a
german submarine in the gulf of st law-
rence it was incredible the simple-
minded canadian fishermen plying their
vocation on the waters off that deserted
anticosti shore could scarce believe that
one of the enemys deadly engines of war
would venture across the atlantic to these
peaceful waters so remote from the pre-
scribed area of submarine warfare

  whats her business here a husky
fisherman broke the silence

  layin for th montreal troopships i
callate

  sufferin judas growled a new bruns-
wick man i hev a brother in one o them
montreal kilty regiments leavin soon
whatll we do skip

  the smoke was coming from johnny
himmelmans pipe in a veritable cloud a
sure sign that he was thinking

  deres a telegraph at natashkwan an
dats bout fifty miles to de notheast
fox bays bout de same to der eastard
mit der engine goin we kin make eider o

dem in bout eight hours-

  heres a vessel cornin cried a man
standing forard

  a warship by jupiter shouted some
one shes chasin th submarine ill
bet

  the pulsating of engines throbbed across
the water and the fishermen peered into
the mist excitedly

  thar she is

  a shadowy hull loomed out of the pall
and masts and spars broke into hazy view
the sight of a bowsprit with a trio of furled
jibs lying upon it caused the skipper to
speak in surprise

  what der defil dat aint no warship
dats a tree-mast topsl schooner mit an

auxiliary engine-

  looks like a frenchman from sint-
malo whats one o them craft adoin
up here theyre grand bank craft-
by jupiter hell be into us hi-yi
sheer off you

  a bull-roared shout of warning came


adventure

from all hands on the leona hitntnelmans
decks as the skipper sprang for the wheel
and hove it up

  draw away der yumbo he bawled as
the other craft drove down on their port
bow

  the lookout on the other vessel must
have seen them a guttural shout came
from her forecastlehead their wheel was
put hard aport and the big schooner her
decks crowded with men and dories forged
past the canadian fishing-vessel but a
scant twelve feet between them

  sacre shouted a voice why t-

aint you soundin der horn - an-
glais

  what vessels dat roared himmelman
schooner yuno of fecamp cod-fishing
whos dat vessel

  leona t himmelman of anchorville
halibuting see any halibuters to de
eastard

  yaw came the voice out of the fog
as the larger vessel swept by

  two or tree schooners fishing off heath
point all revoir msieul

  captain himmelman stared abstractedly
into the wall of mist which swallowed up
the frenchman scratching his head won-
deringly he inquired of the gang loafing
around

  did any of you fellers read der name
of dat craft as he went past

  aye answered a fisherman juno
of fecamp was on her stern board didnt
ye hear him sing out her name i cd hear
him plain enough

  yah i heard him answered the skip-
per slowly but he said yuno instead
of yuno

  youre dutch skipper laughed the
other you mean he said yuno instead
of juno 

  aye yust so replied himmelman
im dutch and cant pronounce my yays
-i callate dat oder feller was dutch too
a frenchman aint a yaw-for-yes man
when dat feller first sighted us under his
bows he sung out hard aport in yerman
boys im a nova scotia dutchman but

i	kin spot an old-country deutscher ten
faddom away an ill bet a dollar to a
doughnut dat dat french fishin-craft aint
nawthin but a yerman supply-boat foller-
ing dat submarine

  fishermen of the deep-sea type are quick
thinkers and captain johnny himmelman

was as smart as any of them for a few
minutes he sat on the wheel-box shrouded
in a pall of tobacco smoke which rivaled
the fog for density and his methodical
german-canadian brain arrayed the sus-
picious facts and evolved a plan of action

  he had many things to consider first
of all he wanted to get his valuable infor-
mation to the dominion government
natashkwan on the north shore of the
gulf fifty miles northeast was a govern-
ment telegraph station fox bay on an-
ticosti island was a small lobster cannery
settlement with a private telephone-wire
to heath point signal-station at heath
point there was a powerful marconi ap-
paratus which could flash the news to the
mainland or a government patrol boat
fox bay was also some fifty miles to the
eastward along the anticosti shore

  hey ye go fellers he shouted at last
hook der staysl halyards on to dat power
dory and git her over put a ten-gallon
can o gasoline in and some water and grub
jack hanson an you tom peters git in
an make for fox bay see de boss at de
lobster factory dere an telephone to de
lighthouse at heath point tell dem dat
a yerman submarine and a supply-schooner
passed along de north shore of de anticoast
an git dem to send a man-o-war as quick
as possible away you go boys ill
stand to de westard an look for dem queer
craft

  within five minutes the power dory was
hoisted over and the two fishermen grabbed
their oilskins and jumped in a deft turn
of the fly-wheel and a so long fellers
and the little boat puttered into the fog on
her fifty-mile journey

  the skipper watched them vanish and
turned to the waiting gang

  now boys well tack ship an head to
de wcstard along shore maybe well
locate dem pirate yermans

              ii

when captain himmelman head-
ed the schooner in the direction the
submarine and her supposed con-
sort had taken he had absolutely no idea
of a plan of action neither he nor the
gang took into consideration the danger of
such a step or had any idea as to what they
would do should they discover the enemy
craft as a fisherman would say they

 hii
some fishing



barged along to find out things for them-
selves

  the wind was westerly and freshening
and with the four lowers the balloon jib
and the big fishermans staysail set they
swung close-hauled up the coast within a
mile or two of the fog-shrouded land
over the windlass lolled a group of men
smoking and conjecturing aft at the
wheel the skipper glanced alternately at
sails and compass and blew mighty clouds
of smoke the loafing trawlers refrained
from curious questions and left the skipper
to his thoughts

  keep a good lookout forard fellers
cautioned himmelman after a while
look an listen we dont want to pass
dem in de fog

  they held on through the mist and
passed cape observation by soundings
about five in the afternoon supper was
a hastily gobbled meal that evening as
most of the gang preferred to be on deck
keeping a lookout by the laughing com-
ments and remarks passed among the men
one would imagine they were out on a pic-
nic instead of looking for a german sub-
marine one significant aspect however
was the sight of four fishermen seated on
the house aft and busy oiling and cleaning
two double-barreled shot-guns a win-
chester thirty-thirty and an old snider
rifle of the make sold extensively in rural
localities for five dollars

  the god chance threw them across the
track of their quarry with a suddenness
which was almost startling the mist
lifted landward and disclosed the topsail
schooner and the under-water boat lying
side by side a cables length away on the
leona himmelmans port quarter

  thar she is roared a dozen voices at
once and as their excited shouts carried
across the water the topsail schooner
started her engine and sheered away from
the huge submersible

  stand by der sheets bawled himmel-
man excitedly swing her off

  the gang jumped to bitt and cleat vague-
ly wondering what the skipper intended to
do the wheel was being rolled up by the
great hands of himmelman and the able
schooner was paying off rapidly

  stand by for a yibe he almost howled

  what are ye goin to do skip cried
the crowd from their various stations
runnin for it

 run be-- answered the lunen-

burger his face ablaze with excitement
im agoin to ram dat dere submarine
let der sheets run and hang on when i hit
him for by yiminy well hit hard

 crash the booms came over and
fetched up on the patent jbers with the
shock incidental to jibing all standing in a
fresh breeze shouting and cursing men
caught the turns on the sheets and as the
schooner drove for the submarine with the
big mainboom over the port rail and the
foreboom over the starboard the men
cleaning the guns commenced slipping in
cartridges and banging away at the sub-
mersibles crew hastily scrambling into the
conning-tower amidships

  they had good reason to be afraid a
ninety-five-ton fishing-schooner with her
great sails bellying iron hard with a strong
breeze and a welter of white water roaring
up from under her bows is an awesome
sight

  the great spars towering aloft for one
hundred and twenty-five feet and clothed
with canvas from topmast truck to deck
constitutes a formidable driving-power to
a deep hull laden with forty-five tons of
ballast and fifty tons of ice salt and fish
the german raiders sensed it and no
sooner was the last man below and the
conning-tower hatch clamped than the
great war-fis i began to dive

  shes divin skip yelled tommy
morrissey from forward

  the rifles and shot-guns kept a continual
fusillade on the turret which was beginning
to disappear from sight into a swirl of
water the schooner drove ahead at a
twelve-knot clip a thing of life eager and
vengeful ready to smash her storming
stem on the fragile cylinder sinking into
the sea under her bows

  twenty feet the conning-tower had
vanished leaving only the periscope an air
pipe and two steel wireless masts above
water ten feet these also disappeared
and the fishermen on the leona himmel-
mans decks howled and squirmed with
disappointed rage the schooner stormed
over the great vortex of the submarines
displacement and the men swore shook
their clenched fists and yelled meaningless
expressions with the savagery of primeval
man cheated of his prey

 all but tommy morrissey tommy
kept his head like the long-sighted old
o

adventure

trawler that he was and as the schooner
surged for the vanished under-sea boat he
deftly cast the shank painter of the star-
board anchor adrift severed the ring stop-
per with a shack knife and leaped for the
butt of the bowsprit as the great seven-
hundred - pound anchor crashed for the
bottom with thirty fathom of chain cable
thundering through the hawse-pipe

  instinctively the gang ran aft or jumped
feet first down into the forecastle the
schooner fetched up in her headlong career
with a terrific jerk and with tremendous
cracks both masts snapped at the deck and
the spars hurtled down in a welter of twang-
ing wire stays and thunderously flapping
canvas

  himmelman crouching down by the
wheel caught sight of morrissey crawling
out from the protection of the bowsprit
butt and he raced forward leaping over
the wreckage with fists clenched 

  you infernal swab he yelled what
dit you mean by dat crazy trick

  morrissey glanced over the bows noted
something and closed with the infuriated
skipper

  with the old fishermans arms around
him himmelman struggled to plant a
blow ill murder you he screamed
you-

  easy skip go easy shouted the
other without relaxing his bears hug
cant you see you crazy dutchman
shes bein towed you fool shes bein
towed cant ye understand or will i
have to bash some sense inter yer thick
nut the anchors hooked inter that
gaudy submarine thats why i cast her
adrift

  the skipper jumped for the rail and
looked over a ripple played around the
leonas bows and the chain cable led out
straight ahead he stared at the con-
vincing sight for several seconds and turned
slowly to the triumphant morrissey

  waal by yiminy he ejaculated if
dat dont beat all my goin afishin shes
hooked for sure swamp me if dat aint
th queerest goldarned fish i ever hooked

in all my days-an mit de anchor for a

hook sink me

all hands speedily made their
way forward to satisfy themselves
that morrisseys claim was correct
and the increasing gurgle of the bow wave

and the chain cable straightening out ahead
soon convinced them

  by golly remarked the skipper
funny thing dat we should have had dat
range of chain over de windlass all ready
i was for anchoring tonight but when she
started breezing up i changed my mind
boys yed better clear away dis raffle
lash dem spars an well tow dem astern
cut de sails adrift and fetch dem aboard
yiminy shes smashed up dem rails and
stanchions in good shape git busy nowl
with feverish haste the men cut and
slashed the spars clear of the encumbering
rigging and sails and bending on warps
allowed the mainmast foremast and main-
boom to tow astern the lighter gaffs and
booms were kept on deck

  himmelman gazed over the taffrail with
a glance of approval

  dey will help to make us tow harder
ha ha

  the submarine was still submerged and
hauling the dismasted fishing - schooner
along at a speed of four or five knots the
topsail schooner had vanished into a wall
of fog which still hung over the water to
seaward

  that under-water craftll be for cornin
up an havin a look round soon remarked
a fisherman apprehensively what are
we agoin to do then

  what ef she does growled another
what kin she do she cant git adrift
from us that seven-hunder-pound an-
chorll hev bitten well inter some part o
her top deck them flukesll go through
thin steel easy and th way o this vessel
under sail ud make them bite for further
orders that anchors fast for keeps th
way she fetched up an jumped th spars

out ud tell ye that-

  aye that may be so but spose that
there submarine starts to dive deeper an
drag this here hooker under

  yes and ef she did wed moor her
for all time soons we filled an sunk we
cd batten down an we couldnt be sunk
sides that submarine aint strong enough
to drag this craft down

  spose she comes up alongside an tries
to board us what then

we got guns aint we they kin only
crawl out that connin-tower one at a time
an i callate we cd pick em off nicely
by jupiter broke in morrissey
they might try an loose a torpedo at us
some fishing



with thirty fathom of chain out it might
give him a chanst to swing around an give
us a shot that ud blow us to flinders
forard dere fellers an heave short
yelled the skipper instantly git twenty
faddom o dat cable aboard quick

  the crowd had the brakes shipped and
were windlassing in the links ere the words
were out of himmelmans mouth never
did men heave down on windlass bars with
such efforts as did the leonas gang the
most exacting yankee wind-jammer mate
could not have roused a homeward-bound-
ers mud-hook aboard in quicker time

  panting and sweating they clustered in
the waist and gazed at the bubbling wake
ahead the skipper had his pipe going
again and was busy thinking with the
wheel in his hands the submarine was
towing them to the eastward just the
direction that himmelman wanted

  shes a-comin up skip cried a man
pointing ahead to where the periscope was
emerging from the water

  himmelman laughed and gave the wheel
a savage wrench

  well steer wild he said easily and
give him some drag-yiminy

  a terrific explosion shook the vessel and
the fishermen were thrown to the deck
splinters of wood flew high into the air
followed by a tower of water which came
like a cloudburst from aloft and almost
swamped the dismasted leona the at-
mosphere reeked with the acrid fumes of a
high explosive

  holy mackerel cried the gang as they
scrambled to their feet almost deafened
and blinded by the shock were tor-
pedoed

  the water was sluicing off the schooners
smashed decks and the skipper looked
around

  de vessel aint hit he cried its
de spars towin astern-yudas hes shot
a torpedo out of his stern and it missed us
when i give her de wheel dat time haul
up on him fellers or by yupiter hell be
givin us anoder yump fellers yump
shoot away dat periscope somebody

  the crowd ran for the windlass brakes
and plied them desperately while dexter
anson plumped five thirty-thirty bullets
into the head of the periscope at such
close range the mirrors were effectually
smashed and the u-boat was rendered
helpless as an under-water menace

  slowly but surely with fifteen husky
men on the windlass brakes the chain came
in link by link until the fishermen could
discern the black bulk of the submarine in
the clear green water ahead its propellers
were churning up the water almost under
the bowsprit of the fishing-schooner

  they callate theyve blown us up
remarked morrissey sagely so with that
perryscope out o business theyll come
out for a look they kin see through them
glass ports in that there turret thar she
comes now-jest like a whale see ef ye
can put some shots through them glass
ports dexter

  the fisherman with the rifle took care-
ful aim and fired and the submarine dived
again

  i callate we got him jammed in a
clinch joyously ejaculated morrissey as
he watched the great steel hull subside
weve got that there fish poke-hooked
by godfrey he cant do nawthin no-
how but drag us to blaze-an-gone-out acrost
to dutchland

  thats just th divil of it remarked
the cook aint we got no way of stop-
pin him hes liable to tow us off some-
wheres an well miss th man-o-war that
th boys hev gone to fox bay to fctch
by golly but de cooks right- said
the skipper well have to stop dat

beggar somehow-

  you bet we will interrupted dexter
anson dolefully i aint got no more
cartridges left thars no more ammu-
nition but three number sixes for the shot-
guns and ef them germans take a notion
to come up and open fire on us were done
for

  the ingenious morrissey smashed his
great fist on the staysail box

  boys said he triumphantly ive an
idea that i callate will work ill git them
jibsheet chains and crawl out on th bow-
split you fellers heave ahead on that
windlass and ill drop them chains inter his
perpellers ef that dont fetch him up
im a dutchman myself

  quickly unshackling the sheets from the
jib morrissey made each of them fast to a
piece of line and crawled out on the bow-
sprit with dexter anson lugging the chains
along the foot-ropes while the rest of
the gang manned the windlass again mor-
rissey sat astride the bowsprit-end and
swung the chain as he would heave a lead


adventure

anson on the foot-ropes held the lines
already bent to the sheets

  watch there watch cried morrissey
carefully judging the distance from the spar
to the boiling froth a few feet ahead of him
heave

  the chain flew from his hands and shot
into the submarines wake

  nawthin doin bawled anson as he
felt the weight of the chain on his line
try again tommy boy

  he hove the chain up again and passed
it along to morrissey who made another
attempt

  must have guards over them wheels
growled he after four unsuccessful attempts
haul up on him a bit more boys an-
other fathom ahead and ill be able to drop
em right down on them screws ready
stand by dexter heave

  the fishermen clustered over the bows
gave vent to an excited shout of triumph
as the retaining line was whipped out of
ansons hands

  shes fouled roared morrissey
gimme that other chain for th port screw
heave

  the watchers held their breath and ex-
pelled it in a joyous howl as the line almost
wrenched anson from his perch

  shes snarled by the holy old sailor
he yelled as he clutched at the back-rope
to save himself from falling shes
stopped

  in the midst of their triumph the skip-
per gave vent to an excited ejaculation and
pointed to the sea-line astern in the glow
of the sunset the square sails of a sailing-
vessel were silhouetted some five miles
away

  dat topsl schooner he cried an
shes headin for us well have to beat it

  beat it questioned the gang

  yes beat it an - quick deres

bout tirty men aboard dat craft an dey
may have guns

  what about this here submarine will
we cut her adrift

  the skipper thought for a moment

  no well moor her knock out the
first shackle on that chain cable abaft the
windlass and bend de fishin hawser and de
port anchor to it when were ready well
let go and mister submarine will be moored
to tree hundred faddom of good eight-inch
manila hawser and an eight-hundred-pound
anchor hell hang to dis forty-faddom

water for all time even ef he clears dose
chains from his screws billy go down
aft and start de engine well have to git
out quick

the bleak shore of northern an-
ticosti was about two miles away
and the sun was setting it was
hazy to the eastward and nothing broke
the sea line but the somber shores of
the island and the rapidly approaching
schooner

  all ready forard shouted himmel-
man from the wheel

  all ready skipper

  den let her go

  the men had bent the chain of the an-
chor which was fast to the u-boat to the
cable of the bankers fishing-anchor and
with a heave of the fluke bar sent the big
mud-hook crashing to the bottom with the
great fishing hawser snaking out after it
the chain cable was clear of the windlass
and with engine going the dismasted fish-
ing-schooner backed away from the still
submerged submarine

  shes moored for fair now skip re-
marked a man lord harry but weve
had some fun this afternoon ha ha

  as they sheered off the rugged fisher-
men gave vent to expressions of relief

  some fishing they said gleefully
wont jack hanson an tom peters be
sore at missing this days sport

  as they drew away the submarine slow-
ly emerged to the surface a man crawled
out of her conning-tower followed by three
or four others a forward hatch also
opened and the submarines decks were
crowded with men who shouted and shook
their fists at the retreating fishing-schooner

  suddenly a disappearing gun elevated
itself from the submersibles decks two
men swung the muzzle around there was
a flash of fire in the twilight and a shell
struck the leona forward by the windlass
and exploded with a stunning detonation
luckily all hands were mustered aft and
flopped to the deck as soon as they saw the
gun

  bang another shell struck the stump
of the foremast and blew the forecastle
hatch into a mess of splintered and shred-
ded wood

  holy mackerel cried a man anxiously
theres agoin to be some killin yet
what are we agoin to do skip
some fishing



  kin we run for it inquired morrissey
looking at the skipper

  craslil a shell struck the rail amidships
and tore the gunwales off the dory on the
port nest

  lord harry skipper shouted the
crowd in a panic were agoin to git
killed

  himmelmans usually placid face was
white now he wasnt afraid but he was
mad-berserker mad rolling the wheel
over he swung the leona around on her
heel and headed for the submarine

  gedt down boys down on der deck
he shouted relapsing in his excitement into
broken english and german ill finish
dot feller by-

  plunkl a shot struck the water astern
of them as the schooner forged ahead at
eight knots under the drive of the powerful
auxiliary gasoline engine a continuous
fire of gun and rifle shots was coming from
the submarines crew now and the bullets
bit into the solid woodwork of the rails and
houses and scattered splinters over the
crouching fishermen the shells went
whistling over the vessel but in the gath-
ering darkness with the target rapidly
approaching and bows on the german
gunners were shooting wild

  a rifle bullet knocked the skippers cap
off and plowed a furrow across his scalp
the blood poured down his face and he
dropped down by the wheel

  head her for dat turret amidships he
growled dashing the blood out of his eyes
with his great fist

  morrissey and anson knelt by the wheel
and glanced over the bows to where the
submarine lay it was only fifty yards
away now and the fire was slacking off
the submarines crew were preparing for
an abandonment of their craft and were
buckling on life-belts ready for a swim to
the three-mast schooner which was rapidly
coming up

  stand by yelled some one

  the fishermen leaped to their feet with a
wild whoop and hurled belaying-pins coal
pieces of wood and other missiles at the
german sailors as with a staggering crash
the schooner rammed the u-boat amid-
ships

  the force of the blow rolled the great
cigar-shaped hull over a few of the ger-
mans were knocked into the sea others
hung to the hand-rails and opened fire with

automatic revolvers and two made a leap
for the schooners bobstays and scrambled
aboard only to be laid out by windlass
bars in the hands of the maddened fisher-
men

  with her engine still going ahead and
her bow rammed against the submarines
turret the leona held the underwater craft
over on her side some of the crew re-
mained hanging to the hand-rails firing
with revolvers at the black bulk of the
fishing-vessel but as it was dark the
shooting was largely pot-luck shots on
the leona the gang kept up a continuous
bombardment with whatever missiles they
could lay their hands on and dory water-
jars burst like shrapnel on the iron decks
of the u-boat

  more ammunition yelled morrissey
and the cook jumped below and threw his
pots and pans up through the splintered
forecastle hatch

  the top-sail schooner had come up with-
in a hundred yards by now and was launch-
ing her dories

  look skip cried dexter anson
theres eight dories full o men acomin
for us i callate youd better reverse that
engine an git out o this

  himmelman grasped the clutch and
hauled it over the motor which had
been going continuously gave a few ex-
plosions and stopped

  jump below billy and give her a
crank cried the skipper anxiously peer-
ing into the darkness

  the fisherman who had charge of the
engine jumped below and almost as quick-
ly appeared again

  the gasoline tanks punctured he
cried in alarm

  de- ye say yiminy were done

for git ready fellers to fight for yer
lives

  as he spoke billy the engineer ripped
out an oath and clapped his hand to his
left shoulder

  jumpin jupiter im hit

  from all around them in the darkness
came the flash and snap of rifle and revol-
ver fire

  the crouching fishermen on the leona
himmelmans shattered and splintered
decks knew that they need expect no
mercy from the enraged germans and
each grasped knife bar and ax and pre-
pared to sell his life dearly


adventure

 the operator at heath point
gfeo signal station laughed as he re-

    	ceived the telephone message from
fox bay

  what dye think of that he said to
the other two operators some crazy
fishermen have come into fox bay saying
they saw a german submarine up on the
north shore of the island seem quite
excited over it and want us to inform a
patrol boat or the government

  the others grinned

  wonder where they got the rum any-
way youd better flash it over to that de-
stroyer off here theres some troop-
ships coming down soon and wed better
send it even though its only a fishermans
yarn

  the operator on duty entered the wire-
less room and sat down to the key his
fingers pressed the dots and dashes de-
noting the call of the war-vessel some-
where out in the gulf

  the connection was made and the wire-
less man repeated his message adding-
guess its a joke

  the reply rather startled him

  no joke inform fame point and all
stations within your radius most im-
portant were off keep your wire clear
for the next twelve hours

  a long slate - colored destroyer slid
through the haze off east cape with smoke
belching from her three funnels the
commander on her bridge talked with his
senior lieutenant in excited tones

  they have done it after all he said
we knew they planned getting some of
their subs over here but they caught two
of them in the channel and we thought
theyd given up the attempt those fish-
ermen are in fox bay so well haul in and
pick them up

  as they approached the lobster factory
settlement the motor dory with jack
hanson and tom peters aboard rounded
up alongside the destroyer the dory was
hoisted aboard and the two fishermen
were escorted to the bridge

  the commander questioned them at once
you saw the periscope proceeding in a
westerly direction you also saw a three-
masted schooner presumably a french
fisherman following her umphl up off
cape observation you say all right
men if your information turns out to be
correct you will have done your country a

great service-a great service better go
below and have something to eat

  if ye dont mind sir wed rather stay
up here an watch th fun holy sailor
this craft kin travel some what kin she
make mister

  were running at thirty-two knots an
hour now replied the officer with a smile
we can make more-thirty-six fogs
lifting thank heaven

  at ten oclock it was dark and cape
observation was abeam the fishermen
lounged in the lee of the canvas dodger
while the spray swashed up from the racing
bows of the destroyer and the wind of their
passage roared overhead in the aerials of the
wireless

  a quartermaster scanning the horizon
ahead with binoculars reported

  something firing ahead sir can make
out gun flashes

  hands to stations ordered the com-
mander and the wondering trawlers noted
the activity which followed the order

  bluejackets scurried into the gun turret
forward and at the numerous quick-firers
along the rail the gun crews hauled the
canvas covers off and carried ammunition
boxes hanson and peters were anxious

  gun flashes ahead muttered the lat-
ter callate the boys are inter a scrap
with them fellers hope were in time to
prevent any killing scrapes

  it was black-dark now and the sky was
cloudy and devoid of stars the destroyer
was forging ahead through the gloom at a
tremendous speed her whole fabric trem-
bling to the drive of her powerful engines
the officers peered ahead through their
glasses

  searchlight ordered the commander
the dazzling glare cut into the darkness
like a huge sword sweep the horizon
the great beam of light wheeled and illu-
minated the deserted scrub-clad cliffs of the
anticosti shore two miles away and then
methodically described a searching arc
from port to starboard

  there they are

  the light settled on a strange tableau a
mile away on the starboard bow a fish-
ing-schooner her masts gone rolled in the
swell alongside the long black hulk of a
great submarine in close proximity was
a three-mast topsail schooner lying hove-
to and all around the three craft were
dories crowded with men when the light
some fishing



played on the scene all the dories with
one accord made for the topsail schooner

  starboard-two points the destroy-
ers commander fearing a torpedo from the
submarine swung his ship off suddenly
port-two points

  the destroyer made another wild swing
on her course

  fire a shot over that schooner

  a gun thundered below the bridge and
the destroyers whistle shrieked a warning
to halt

 all right never mind him we can
catch that fellow any time well come
alongside that submarine looks as if
there was something wrong with him by
jove hes making no move swing all
your guns on him and as soon as i give the
word pump shell into him as hard as you
can go

  by gorry mister ejaculated hanson
th leonas in a whale of a mess she
aint got a spar standin an her decks are
all smashed up jupiter thar aint no
sign o th gang

  fear for their safety gripped his heart
theyve bin wiped out growled peters
ominously god mister theyve bin
killed thar aint a man on her decks
were too late

  both fishermen feared the worst and a
slow rage consumed them peters grabbed
the commanders arm

  blow that schooner an submarine out
o water sir he cried hoarsely give
the order to yer men theyve wiped out
johnny himmelman and the gang

  the officer rang down for stop and
shook off the fishermans detaining hand

  wait a minute my man he said grim-
ly well investigate if anything has
happened to your friends theyll be
avenged two boats and a full boarding-
crew mr jones call them away and
overhaul that submarine and the fisherman
if he tries any monkey tricks sheer off and
ill sink him nothing to fear from that
schooner-she cant get away from us but
look out they dont open fire on you with
rifles or concealed guns call your men
away

  a boatswains whistle warbled out and
two boats splashed into the water with the
crews swarming down the falls fully armed
with cutlasses rifles and revolvers peters
and hanson ran down from the bridge and
leaped into the first boat the oars were

shipped and with the steady pull of a well-
trained man-o-wars crew the two boats
headed rapidly in the direction of the help-
less fishing-schooner

  peters and hanson were the first men
over the smashed rails

  lord harry cried peters shes all
smashed an ripped to blazes he ran to
the cabin gangway oh below any
one aboard hanson had run forard and
was hailing down the splintered forecastle

  godfrey jack theres nobody aboard
cried peters hoarsely theyve bin mur-
dered and hove overboard look at the
blood on the wheel-box look how th
decks hev bin shot up god-poor boys
poor boys

  they reported to the officer in the boat

  nobody aboard sir th boys hev
bin murdered an thrown over th side by
them murderin devils seventeen o them
sir as fine a gang as ever hauled a trawl
or stood a trick-

  jump in mlads and well overhaul
this submarine said the officer kindly
shes making no move and im thinking
shes disabled in some way well get her
crew and theyll pay the price never fear

  illuminated in the glare of the destroy-
ers searchlights the boats pulled for the
submarine which rested motionless on the
water with her conning-tower and decks
just awash a fishermans small trawl-
anchor bent to a stout line which led to the
leona was fluked in the handrail

  now lads board her shouted the
lieutenant as the boats ranged alongside
the great steel hull

  the bowmen hooked in with the boat-
hooks and the bare-footed bluejackets
with cutlasses and revolvers drawn
swarmed out on the submersibles decks
the conning-tower hatch was down and
the lieutenant banged on it with the butt
of his sword

  open up and surrender he roared

  the hatch opened slowly and a voice
answered

  all right mister der blasted hatch
was hard to open yiminy you was a
long time coming

  out of the hatch appeared a haggard
face with a blood-stained bandage around it

  johnny himmelman howled both the
fishermen at once

  the lieutenant and the bluejackets
stared in surprise as the two trawlers


adventure

grabbed the skipper and helped him down
on the submersibles decks

  how in th name o moses did you git
in there wheres th gang

  the gang were coming the whole seven-
teen of them came crawling out of the u-
boats conning-tower and the naval men
gaped at them open-mouthed

  where the dickens is the crew of this
craft stuttered the lieutenant of himmel-
man

  the skipper waved toward the topsail
schooner lying to the wind a cables length
away

  aboard her i callate or in der drink
maybe he answered nonchalantly to
peters and hanson he remarked boys
oh boys but youve missed all der fun
what a session weve had to be sure

  the officer looked over the assembly of
rugged fishermen-cut bleeding and bruised
he noted their daredevil faces and their
powerfully muscled arms

  by jove he murmured what devils
they are those bank fishermen what
boys theyd make for the navy eh
what

the war is still on and the censor-
ship is strict the fate of the sub-
marine the topsail schooner and
her crew are known only to the naval au-
thorities our story deals only with cap-
tain himmelman and the leona himmel-
mans gang

  captain johnny was speaking

  yes sir he was saying when we saw
de dories cornin for us from dat schooner
an bangin away at us mit rifles i says
well have to git out de leona had
drifted a few feet off from de submarine
so we hooked her mit a trawl-anchor and a
bit o line and den we hauled de leona up
on it

  de whole gang of us scrambled out on
der bowsplit and yumped aboard der
submarine and got into her and closed de
hatch yust as dey rushed us we were all

right den-yust as safe as a lobster in a can
and we stayed dere ontil de man-o-war
come up now mister i want to know
if der government is goin to pay for de
damage to my schooner

  the destroyers commander smiled and
stretched forth his hand

  captain himmelman he said with
admiration in his voice weve heard of
nervy deeds done in this great war but i
must say that there is little i have heard
that can beat the exploits of you and your
daring crew you recklessly braved death
a dozen times you have shown a truly
marvelous ingenuity in capturing this
submarine her crew and that treacherous
portuguese schooner you have also been
the means of averting a great peril to the
flotilla of transports coming down the gulf
this week

  i havent the least hesitation in stating
that when i have made my report to
the authorities you and your men will
be fully compensated and rewarded for
the work you have done and the dangers
you have faced allow me to shake hands
with you and your brave boys by god-
frey im proud to know you

  some months later captain himmelman
proudly exhibited a medal to the visiting
mayor of anchorville and members of the
town council

  yes sir me an tommy morrissey an
dexter anson got one of dem things mit a
letter from king george himself dey call
it de distinguished sendee order an i
callate ill hev it made into a brooch for de
ol woman de leona is bein refitted at

this season but weve got one thing to brag
about when it comes to fishin

  whats that captain

melman chuckled
hence paddy came or what his
past had been are matters of no
consequence it is enough that
the potter had fashioned him
crudely and then had cast him into the
stream to drift as he might and the god-
dess of chance in some caprice had kept
the frail jar floating holding its rim just a
little above the threatening surface

  so paddy circling about in the buffeting
eddies of human experience was carried to
san francisco in the days when thousands
of troops set forth in great white ships to
civilize the philippine islands there waif
and wanderer he followed the crowds earn-
ed a meal when he could and cheered on
occasions as lustily as many a happier
sportsman

  at last impelled by a lofty motive per-
haps but influenced most i fear by the
seductive odor of hot slum sniffed in the
tented camps-for his belt was very loose
-he stopped one day before a white-
haired sergeant who stood in an office-door-
way and pulled off his battered hat

  want to take on the sergeant asked

  wots that countered paddy warily

  want to enlist

  oh i was thinkin of ut confessed
the wanderer

  the trained old non-com looked sharply
into the large eyes before him and divined
among other things a cunning brain behind

  them as for paddy he read the sergeants
  mind and the sergeant knew it then both
  in perfect understanding grinned as two
  who had seen the world and the old man
  said-

    come in

     this is a part of the record signed by the
  major upstairs

    nativity american height  inches
  age  - weight  pounds occu-
  pation track-walker whereat the major
  had smiled and the sergeant had glared
  most soberly at the ceiling figure thin
  but muscular hair red eyes light blue
  complexion pale indelible marks ears very
  prominent face badly freckled

    my boy said the major when the ex-
  amination was over youre a bum and we
  dont want bums but you have a keen
  head and a good heart you dont know
  much but you can learn youve seen hard
  times but there is something around that
  big mouth of yours that tells me youd
  rather give away all you had than steal
  from others your eyes are wide awake and
  shrewd but youd rather be honest than
  crooked if you study hard and work hard
  you can go as high in the service as you like
  ill take you on hold up your right hand
  and that is how paddy at last began a
  definite career and a great adventure in
  the course of which he committed a mili-
  tary sin fought for his life with his wits
  


adventure

out-malayed the malay rendered his coun-
try a service and ruined the plans of scores
of others but emerged unscathed himself

all this occurred eight hundred
miles from manila far in the south
in the visayan town of sogod at
that time it was scarcely more than a large
church adjacent to a great convento or par-
ish house both built of soft white blocks
of coral rock and set in a wide green plaza
the dusky inhabitants who were short in
stature but big in treachery and the art of
deceit dwelt in a few narrow streets of
bamboo huts

  behind this low brown settlement green
hills lifted the many-fingered jungle high
against the sky and before it spread the
twinkling steaming sea white-hot in the
shadowless glare lapping lifelessly the nar-
row beach just beyond a fringe of coconut
trees all was very beautiful and very still
save for the occasional calling of women
the squeaking of a carabao cart or at night
the wild ululations of fishermen with red
flaring torches raised in their hands who
squatted monkey-like upon the upcurved
prows of their swiftly flitting dug-outs

  yet there was menace in the prospect
and death brooded in the quiet in the
convento were a company of american sol-
diers in the mountains a horde of outlaws
the outward fairness and tranquillity were
but a screen that hid a gulf of barbarism as
wide and deep as the shimmering sleepy
ocean

  as for the villagers they sent food and
taxes to the guerillas which entirely satis-
fied those christian murderers then told
the white men where the bandits were and
craftily led their hike astray but they
took care always that a few old weapons
were found or that a personal enemy of the
guide was captured to color the deception
and when the troops toiled back into the
dun palm-shaded village red-eyed mad-
dened with heat desperate with blacken-
ing thirst and the hopelessness of the chase
a rabble of anxiously solicitous natives
flanked them and welcomed them with
voluble commiseration

  how sad they exclaimed that the
brave soldados have labored so long in vain

  yet they thought is the loot of my broth-
er or my uncle or my cousin or my father
who is supposed to be dead or my wifes
sweetheart still where i can find it

  how unutterable that the unspeakables
in the mountains have again escaped

  yet they argued how fortunate it is for
us that these stupid pigs do not know that
the colonels or the generals are even now
at cards with the padre and perhaps will
dine today with the americanos themselves

  also the old men hobbled along wagging
their apish heads in seeming pity women
stood in the door-holes of the thatches si-
lent indifferent or glided slipperless across
the bamboo floors to peer like cows above
the sills of the window spaces and every-
where in the arms of the people or pressed
into gaps among them were star-eyed smil-
ing children suns of hope in a sullen uni-
verse of malice still pure as the fruit of the
trees they laughed with the careless joy
of babyhood their elders leered inanely
since they knew the value of a mask

  men can not stand this sort of existence
indefinitely at the end of a year the lack
of amusement the frightful monotony the
unrelenting climate and the extreme dis-
couragement that depressed the garrison
had driven many of them close to madness

  some bore on grimly waiting for that
vague day when they should be delivered
others sought refuge in vice and a few died

  the captain the lieutenant and the sur-
geon lived in a roomy shack across the plaza
life for them was even harder for anxiety
official responsibility and the burdens of
administration were added to their other
cares paddy was not the least of their
troubles but they were as lenient with
him as the necessities of discipline allowed
considering the circumstances under which
they lived

  there came a time however when lieu-
tenant bryant appeared for breakfast one
morning in a mood that said as plainly as
words that his patience was exhausted

  had to put private ruff in confinement
last night he explained howling drunk
again in spite of his promises

  ruff queried the captain

  hes that red-headed big-eared fly-
specked little devil with the innocent baby-
blue eyes the men call him paddy 
oh yes thats four times in a year
im afraid we shall have to put him before
a general court pretty soon unless the med-
ico can cure him how about it scotty
whats the psychology of it with a wink
at bryant

  the doctor a middle-aged contract
the one sheep that was lost



surgeon was in many respects an odd mix-
ture of the old world and the new his
real name was maclaren

  well he drawled as he slowly stirred
his coffee im no keeley-cure man and it
seems to me ive had the beggar on my
hands before from what i recollect i
think i dont want him again but as for
the analysis of his case im thinking its
very simple he spends his leisure in the
native shacks a-wandering from one to
tother according to fancy and when he
finds congenial surroundings-and he has
good taste in judging the looks of a brown
lass-he thrones himself on a rice-mat and
gets bacchantic

  mind ye im not condoning the offense
but it might be hes lonesome and he has
a deal of thirst and curiosity which hes
experimented with for a year till both are
torrid in intensitee incidentally he has
learned to talk visayan in all its classic
beauty howbeit he did acquire a degraded
dialect of his own language in the stews of

his native land consequently-

  hold on scotty hold on laughed
the captain thats enough what youre
driving at is that hes nothing but a com-
mon drunk but that he may be useful on
account of his knowledge of the local cus-
toms and this cog-and-ratchet language
hence mercy all right well let it go
at that but there are some other things
he will have to learn too

  that was all until the next day then
about noon a sentry tapped on the sala
door

  prisoner ruff sir wants to talk to the
captain

  what is it about

  dont know sir says its private
  hm send him in

  very humbly very respectfully came
paddy before his commander who looked at
him a moment silently but not unkindly
what is it ruff

  i want permission sir to go on the hike
tonight

  what do you know about a hike to-
night

  i only heard some talk about it
  youre a prisoner ruff

  yes sir

  what do you think i could do with you
on a hike do you think i could spare
any men to nurse you into staying sober
youre a shame to your company its bad

enough to have you in garrison where other
men have to do your work for you while
you lie drunk in the guard-house but on
a hike i cant do it ruff youd give out
youre no good

  thats just it sir replied the prisoner
after a pause i aint no good i never
was no good an its a cinch i aint doin
no good locked up in the mill

  thats the point ruff exactly

  ive told myself all youve just told me
sir an a whole lot more thats why i
wanted to see the captain sir i aint no
groveler nor lookin fer no bootlick but
ive cut it out sir i want to get out o
the mill i want to go on this hike sir
an i want to make good shelp me cap-
tain im goin to soldier an im goin to
do it right

  the doctor most gracious of men cleared
his throat suggestively almost pleadingly
and a twinkle lighted the captains eyes

  well ruff he said ive heard that
sort of talk a good many times before and
it usually only means a bad case of remorse
that passes off altogether too soon how-
ever ill give you one chance more but
only one thats all youll be released
later

  well scotty whats the psychology of
it now how long will he last

   bout two weeks mebbe its hard to
make a deceesion but the lee tie rascal
makes a strong appeal to the paternal in-
stinct

the bay was red and purple with
the glow of the setting sun and the
tiny islands far off on the horizon
rose above the sea line green and blue and
pink curling their edges up toward the
painted clouds when d company once
more marched quietly into the jungle pad-
dy was with them vowing to make good
but the moon sneered at him through the
rattling canes the huge palms whetted
their fronds derisively against one another
and the breezes laughed in the leaves
everything mocked him

  but he plodded cheerfully and optimistic-
ally on in his proper place and all went
well for three days then in the evening
he was tortured with a frightful thirst it
was not vino he wanted though it was
water

  they were bivouacked upon the summit
of a ridge their haversacks for pillows


adventure

banana-leaves for beds the moonlight for
cover and rustling fans to whisper dreams
the brain-fevering day had yielded to the
cool night and as the voices in the shadows
timidly ventured forth they slept

  only paddy and the guard were still
awake the one because none knew in what
form death might be crawling upon them
from the valley the other because his mouth
burned and his tongue was stiff from the
torment he suffered

  he scooped a hole to accommodate his
hip and so made his earthy bed more com-
fortable then he stuffed his hat beneath
the small of his back and thus eased and
shifted his aching body but no device he
could invent brought either rest or forget-
fulness

  later he prowled about among his fel-
lows and examined their canteens they
were empty by the embers of the cooks
fire was a huge can of boiled water but it
was still scalding hot it would not be cool
for many hours yet he filled his tin cup
from it and lay down again to wait until it
should be cold enough to drink then
somewhere in the darkness below a dog
howled though the tom-toms that had
warned the country of their approach were
long since hushed

  wots that he wondered some one
cornin

  the sentry paused in his monotonous
round listening and paddy remained mo-
tionless gazing steadily into the black void
beneath suddenly even that seemed to
fade as he looked into it he lost all sense
of everything thirst the dog danger and
the hardness of the ground became of no
moment he was asleep and dreamed that
he was immersed in a great lake clear and
comforting he drank until he could hold
no more but yet he was unsatisfied pres-
ently a monstrous beast came down to the
shore and wallowed then changed to a
spreading sheet of flame so that the whole
surface boiled he strangled for he had
drank the fire and it seethed in his throat

  he sat up choking and reached for his
cup either he or the man on post had
knocked it over while he slept

  ive simply got to have ut he groaned
or something

  the barking had stopped but a point of
light flickered far down the hillside he
had not noticed it before then it disap-
peared

  im goin after t shelp me i got to
do ut i cant stand ut no more

  he slid noiselessly into the underbrush
alert and with the utmost caution he
groped his way toward where the gleam had
been soon he came into a clearing and
there he discovered a well - made hut
through the raised flap that marked the
front he saw a young woman within seat-
ed upon her heels sorting metal buttons by
the aid of a feeble flame that danced in a
glass of coconut-oil

  without the least sign of surprise or any
other emotion she paused in her work and
stared at him appraisingly

  on watch concluded paddy an sort-
in out buttons fer makin the ends o tin-
can cartridges

   sus marie she exclaimed at last

  tubig he whispered

  the woman arose softly and brought him
a drink in a dripping coconut-shell from a
jar that stood near the window-gap he
called for more

  vino anisette she suggested cun-
ningly

  paddy was not insensible of a warning
that welled up within him but he was op-
timistic besides one glass wouldnt hurt
him he argued and he needed it or thought
he did which is the same thing to those
who wish it to be so he sinned again for
the last time

  it was late the next afternoon when he
awoke the woman was smoking a cigar
contentedly apparently unaware even of
his presence she was huddled upon the
floor fussing with a little fire in a box of
earth beside which was a pot of rice ready
for the cooking

  but there were now other visitors for
two barefooted slippered men crouched in
a corner whose enormous straw hats were
inscribed zona  in big red characters
on the shoulders of their loose white coats
were red straps burdened with tin insignia
and along the seams of their baggy trousers
red flannel stripes their buttons were
small and brassy each crudely embossed
with a single star

  two gu - gu generals noted paddy
stricken immovable

  little by little the memory of the night
before came out of the dark fog in the back
of his mind the details of the present be-
came vivid and real and he wondered what
time it was then he realized that if his
the one sheep that was lost



company were near these two rascals in the
corner would not be sitting there evident-
ly the captain had given up searching for
him or had gone in the wrong direction
which was more probable a shudder trick-
led down his spine like a drop of cold water

  i sure am up against it this time for
fair he sighed to himself

  the woman set the pot of rice upon the
fire and brought cigarettes for the gener-
als it was plain that they had not been
there long for as they smoked she de-
scribed the manner of paddys coming

  said one a surly ill-natured brute not
good to look upon-

  he is no doubt a mason and a heretic
the other raised his palms shook his
head and was grave

  what shall we do with him asked this
one with a deprecatory little smile

  the first shrugged indifferently

  we can not be bothered with prisoners
he declared tonelessly

  the second bowed submissively

  true he agreed but who knows
we may use him

then at least since he has awakened
i will secure him woman fetch me a cord
but paddy had no wish to be bound
theres only wan way out thought he
ill have t join em

  he arose leisurely feigning unconcern
then leaning back against the wall his
hands in his pockets and his sodden blue
eyes looking from one to the other he spoke
to them in their own tongue in all its
classic beauty augmented as it is with
borrowed spanish

  listen he bade them the woman
has told you i came alone of my own will
therefore i claim your confidence do i
not know the americanos are even now
searching for me they will not find me
they keep to the trails for they are stu-
pid i was here within call when they lay
on the crest above us yet they did not
overtake me do i not know you have
eyes in every bamboo that i could not go
along a dozen barras or cry for help and
live i could not leave if i would you
will not bind me and there is more i
have something to say to pachico

  exactly what he had to communicate was
not at all clear however even to himself

  the ill-tempered one seemed about to
speak but the mild one checked him with
a sign

  what is this you have to say to pa-
chico he asked

  there will be great honor for you both
if he knows surely it would be unfortun-
ate if one with a secret should be hindered
or fail to arrive pachico would hear of it
he would be offended i can not tell now 
over the face of the surly one spread a
look that none who knows the native can
mistake as the woman glided soundlessly
out he sprang to his feet cat-like his naked
bolo quivering in his grasp

  shall i let this spotted-faced white man
with hair like hemp and eyes like water
defy me

  the merciful one said gently-

  wait my friend till tomorrow
  now

  certainly he said but why are you
unwilling that he should speak only with
pachico is it because you would know his
business for yourself

  the rabid one settled upon his heels like
one who is felled his face inscrutable but
he of the deprecatory little smile seemed
not to notice

  paddy sat down cross-legged upon the
floor

  phew he breathed softly to himself
pretty close i wasnt lookin fer that
neither i see how ut is not extry good
friends got him that time softy did too
his brow was damp but he dared not
wipe it this was no time to show weak-
ness but he said no more for to take ad-
vantage of a point secured even to signify
perception of the fact might pique the pride
of even the mild one then he would sure-
ly die but his wits were busy exceeding-
ly busy and he wrenched them free from
the grip of the liquor to evolve some plan
for escape

  night was descending and soon the wo-
man returned puffing her vile weed she
cast but a glance at paddy and though it
may have surprised her to see him living
she did not show it she brought the sup-
per from the fire and the placid one invited
him to eat

  tomorrow he said you shall report
to pachico

  it is better tonight replied paddy not
too insistently since it might occur that i
should be bitten by a snake or die of air in
the heart while i sleep can you not ami-
go he addressed the sullen one despatch
me to pachico


adventure

  but the brute refused to be conciliated
  i can not

  good men of our superiority should
not be disturbed pardon you are right
but there are always the mere soldados
surely we can send a message

  he of the little smile was obviously in-
terested and studied the american intently
even admiringly paddy had guessed a situ-
ation between these two a possibility and
was striving for the facts

  i have no soldiers blurted the blood-
thirsty one a general caught unawares be-
cause he despised his enemy then he saw
the trap and grew turgid with rage

  the gentle one laughed a very little al-
most with contempt and shrugged his
shoulders but he eyed his companion like
a lynx not once relaxing his watchfulness
while he spoke to paddy

  you have great intelligence amigo he
said i will tell you something our
friend here is a famous general but he
does nothing for pachico and much for him-
self for that the chief will give him no
men

diablo exclaimed the other appalled
what importance if i tell this man de-
manded the calm one softly but tense on
guard as he pretended to misunderstand
since you kill him tomorrow

  he spoke again to paddy

  indeed a few of my friends desire that
he should soon succeed pachico

  over the pot of rice the hand of the other
hovered trembling the woman was light-
ing the wick in the glass of oil and as it
weakly came to life paddy shivered he
was chilled like one who waits a promised
specter or dreads momentarily its cold touch
in the darkness but he understood now
or at least appreciated the certainty of
what impended

  as if an intuition forced his speech like
pledging allegiance he asked-

  but you have many other friends
very many amigo the cool one an-
swered you are quick to understand

  the sullen one ate of the food in his palm
then stood he did not even reach for his
weapon for the tranquil one was clearly
ready he looked at the woman whose
back was toward him as she tinkered at the
fire at paddy oppressed like a watcher who
does not look up in the dark hour of an-
other and then at his wily tigerish foe
who judas-like had dipped with him into

the pot of rice and now attentively enjoyed
the agony of his prey at last he went
mutely to the door stared long into the
blackness and left them

  he at the rice arose and stepped to the
window upon the sill he set the feeble
flickering flame the woman had provided
and remained there a moment then he
returned with it a smile on his face and
something in his eyes that turned the heart
to stone

  for this i brought him here was all
he said

  paddy turned away that the creature
might not read his face

  holal americano there was mastery
now in the voice not craft and paddy rec-
ognized it

  tell me your business i myself am
pachico will you have proof

  it is enough then desperately but
with head erect he uttered whatever his
misery prompted

  i came here as i and the woman have
said of my own desire i have foresworn
the americanos four times have they put
me in their prison seven months have i
spent there

  the listeners accursed features reflected
no thought no emotion but his cunning
understanding would clutch the slightest
flaw and miss not a single word though it
spelt life or death for paddy ruff

  i must speak truth hummed in the
pleaders thoughts so he lied with the facts

  i have no love for their cells nor they
for me when i go back it must be with
your people or i shall not return i have a
scheme for effecting this and i will destroy
my enemies

  the other looked evilly upon him suspi-
ciously treacherously as was to be expected

  listen i know what has passed here
he who has gone out will not come back
the lamp in the window showed no more
than a candle among the trees but it shone
on a long journey you have many friends
they saw and read it for a signal since it
was for that you brought him here so will
it be with me too if i displease you is it
not so therefore i shall obey your com-
mands

  you have spoken of a way to go back
as one of us to the camp of the americanos
what is it

  wotll i say wotll i say implored
paddy of himself
the one sheep that was lost



  he lurched to his feet and walked slowly
to the water-jar as he drank he imagined
he could feel the others gaze upon him
up from his mud-stiffened canvas leggings
over khaki breeches and dark blue-flannel
shirt it burned till it scorched his pallid
face then an idea came not quite formed
indeed yet outlined clearly enough for the
present

  he turned back quickly to pachico and
smiled at him confidingly whenever he
smiled his red head seemed like a sun of
goodwill and his eyes like wells of trust

  i will show you how to take the rifles of
the americanos and all their stores the big
chests of salmon of meats of cartridges of
shoes of clothing and of money that are
piled high in their cuartel and you can not
fail

  the cupidity the lust of power and of
blood that burned in the monsters breast
flamed into his cheeks he let himself an-
ticipate for a moment what all this meant
to him as for the white stranger who had
too much intelligence he should certainly
make no trouble when he ceased to be use-
ful no chances must be taken with such
as he the little smile played significantly
upon his lips

  and you my friend he insinuated al-
most effectionately how shall i then hon-
or you

  but paddy had not sat upon the mats of
sogod so many times in vain

  it is true of course he said that i
have a motive and something to gain but
i want neither riches nor authority i ask
not even that you give me back my rifle or
that you promise me pay i shall be con-
tent if i am never more imprisoned i am
doing this for what they have done to me
it is for hate nothing more let us dismiss
the woman so that i may show you how it
can be done

  she was reclining upon the floor dozing
contentedly

  go you to dolores commanded pa-
chico tell my generals that i return to-
morrow say nothing of this man the
general miguel so you shall say is watch-
ing the expedition of the americanos you
comprehend

  senorl she mumbled and slipped away
into the gloom

  it is thus continued paddy we will
send a letter to their thick-headed captain
and proffer our surrender and that of all our

army we will write that upon a stated
day let us say the fourth from the letter
we shall be upon the plaza of malavista
there we will lay down our arms he will
come with his whole army surely all but a
few for he knows we are many so that
there may be a splendid ceremony but
we shall not be there

  he will march with a loud noise of can-
teen and bayonet by the easy trail for that
is the way they do we will go by the long
route to sogod and we must be there when
the enemy leave when we can no longer
hear the dogs bark at their coming then we
will run to the storehouse the guard must
flee or die there i will indicate what is
filled and what is empty where are the
cases of arms and where the money so that
we can quickly retreat to the mountains

  on the way we will destroy them from
the summits above the road in a place from
which there is no escape with their own ri-
fles i shall secure my vengeance and you
may give me what else you will i shall be
content and you shall be master

  but our troops have tried such strategy
before objected pachico and the ameri-
canos have always eluded us or done some
queer thing that none but pigs would think
of

   it is for this reason explained paddy
you do not know their ways nor their
manner of fighting for example has it
not happened when you have rushed upon
them with the bolo so quickly they could
not use their guns that they have thrown
these down and beaten your men with their
fists if you had known you could have
prevented this and killed them all when
often you destroyed but a few yet your
soldiers are brave as any in all the world

   let us take a short time and first teach
the army how those people fight and what
their tactics are also when we strike i
can tell you from the signs about the bar-
racks what is their design when they de-
part thus there will be no error since we
shall know as much as they and we can
not lose

  i will think of this pachico said
to-morrow i will hold a council let us
sleep

   a cigarette i beg of you

   you have it the general answered pro-
ducing a package hastily and graciously as
might an oriental prince for an honored
guest


adventure

upon the following morning they
set out to join the army this con-
sisted of seven generals subordinate
to pachico many colonels and a progress-
ively increasing number of lieutenant-colo-
nels majors captains and lieutenants in
all there were about two hundred but the
predominance of officers was of slight con-
sideration since there was little semblance
of organization rank merely determined
the share of pillage each received

  the day was well advanced when paddy
was led before the owners of this opera
boujje and they glared at him exultingly a
real american captive as they lolled be-
neath the coco-palms and idled the steam-
ing hours away with monte and cigarettes

  it was not proper that officers such as
they should sit with those of lower grade
for those were only fighters and generals
have greater things to do so farther back
in the shady grove the majors the captains
and the subalterns loafed and gambled like
their betters except that the stakes were
smaller while here and there was only a
soldado a link in the chain that signaled
news across the island by tom-tom fire and
sturdy runner or watched the trails from a
perch in the miry rice-fields or the top of a
swinging tree

  the generals scowled at paddy and then
since their lord was silent they turned again
to bet on the ace of baslos but when they
had tired of the game or the bankers had
won their all pachico called them to him
when the siesta hour had come and gone
and told them in flowery words the his-
tory and the offer of the intelligent ameri-
can

  what is the name of this foreigner
croaked an ancient whose lineaments were
seamed like a monkeys

  it is one not hard to pronounce replied
the chief it is paddy r-ruff

  are you that paddy another asked
who visits so much with our people of so-
god

  i am admitted he seating himself on
the grass among them

  it is as i thought he is that one of
whom the priest has spoken i myself
have often seen him in the iiendas drink-
ing

  and i also said the old man we
know of him favorably we have even
talked with him in sogod

  but another spoke more cautiously

  it is well planned conceded he but
how are we to know that the infidels will
leave the doors unlocked

  it is thus submitted paddy they
think the guard sufficient they have never
turned the locks for the doors are heavy
and hard to close yet if they do i know
where the keys are hung

  but they may not go out another ob-
jected

  that we can see from the heights but
they will for the captain will desire the
great glory of this surrender

  and our friend the americano what
does he desire one other asked shall
he have a command

  as the council wish replied paddy
raising his palms and shrugging but i
am content to be simply a drill-master or
better still our leaders minister of war
otherwise some captain might be jealous
that one so newly come should be so soon
promoted and an accident to me might
then deprive you of your victory

  he had no mind to follow a certain miguel
recently suspected of ambition yet he de-
sired to hold some sort of dignified position
that he might not be slain in mere contempt

  to have a minister of war was pleasing
to them for they had heard of such an offi-
cer who in spain was a grand man but
to none had it ever been related that he
held a post in battle nor was there any
precedent by which to establish his share
of spoils

  therefore until now no one had wished
a place among them so void of either glory
or remuneration even though it doubtless-
ly commanded high respect consequently
if the white man who craved no fame and
coveted no profit since the americanos are
all rich would be satisfied with a portfolio
it was excellent they agreed that the com-
mander should have him upon his staff
and pachico who had said no word
throughout the council approved since it
was in his thoughts to do this very thing

  then let us begin at once and if to-
morrow you will give me pens ink and
paper i will write a manual of drill for all
the captains whom i myself will instruct
in it

  a trifle dubiously they acquiesced and
from that time on the order of their days
was drill

  they raided helpless villages no more nor
burned nor looted only they still exacted
the one sheep that was lost



tribute of money provisions and cloth since
these were necessary they made their
quarters for greater comfort in a barrio of
dolores where paddy was given a shack to
himself as became a minister of war in
which were a bamboo bed a chair and a
small rectangular table

  they posted guards on the paths and the
hilltops and lookouts watched by day
and by night to see that nothing disturbed
the generals and especially the minister
of war he was assigned also a captain
for aide to fetch and to carry for it was
better they said that he a white man
should not be exposed too much to the sun
by day or the jungle mists at night

  he thanked them very heartily pretend-
ing not to understand and hour after hour
spread out a kind of school of the com-
pany on many sheets of paper

  but he trained them and wrote for them
during all those wearying sittings not to
make soldiers of the ruffians but to gain
time and to win their confidence the suc-
cess of the plan that had suggested itself so
hazily at first required not only the faith of
his captors but also the cooperation of his
countrymen for that reason he had pro-
posed the letter of surrender which he in-
tended should be solely a device to carry a
message of his own

  the great difficulty was to write one
communication within another in such a
way as to be detected by his captain but
not by the insurrectos

  as he labored at his little table over the
lessons for his masters this problem formed
his principle study he considered and re-
jected various schemes eventually he re-
membered that big bill schindel and
teaser ritter had plotted most reprehen-
sible things under the very noses of the po-
lice with the help of an invisible ink com-
pounded of onion-juice mixed with milk and
water the knowledge had nearly cost him
dear for he had carried some of the mis-
sives before the double nature of the cor-
respondence had been discovered he de-
cided that it would be easy to apprise the
captain of the two-fold structure of the let-
ter and concerned himself with securing
the ingredients

  to this end he shivered one day as he
stood on the parade with pachico watch-
ing the drill the fellow expressed an-
xiety

  it is nothing paddy explained casting

 a woful look at the skies as he hunched his
 shoulders and chattered his teeth the
 night-dews give me rigors at times which
 stay in my bones till the sun brings them
 out if only i had onions and the milk that
 is sold in cans i should never be troubled
 or so at least it was when i lay in the jail
 of sogod

    sus exclaimed pachico if that is
 all you shall have them i will ask the
 padre in sogod for onions which he can pro-
 cure from the heretics there for they are
 on excellent terms as you know and as
 for the milk in cans the spaniard here in
 dolores shall furnish all you require
 indeed these remarkable essentials to a
 cure were not long in arriving and though
 there is no explanation of the fact either
 empiric or rational yet it is undeniable that
 when they had been received paddy quaked
 no more he also took pains to write each
 day only as much as could be learned upon
 the next for he knew they would soon lose
 patience and he felt that a manuscript re-
 pudiated would confess the looseness of his
 hold upon them

    as a matter of fact in about three weeks
 the steps began to lag the hands to slouch
 and their enthusiasm to cool perceptibly
 paddy went at once to pachico whose zeal
 was waning like his mens

    i come to you he said as your minis-
 ter of war to announce that the army is
 prepared

    it is well approved the general more
 cordial than he had been for some time be-
 fore also i am sensible of much improve-
 ment in their art tonight i will consult
 the council

    paddy returned to his shack and stretch-
 ed himself upon the bamboo bed his aide
 sprawled upon a rice-mat under the win-
 dow-hole asleep

   but the unhappy prisoner took no heed
 of him the moment had come when he
 must make the last move between himself
 and his own kind it was only a little way
 but if he fell there would be none to raise
 him

    he was afraid so cunningly had he plot-
 ted so skilfully had he dissembled so severe
 had been the strain that the very prospect
 of fulfilment conjured up doubts and called
 forth terrors from his imagination reac-
 tion like this was inevitable in an uncer-

	tain way he knew it and that the mood
 would pass yet he had baited a trap with


adventure

a massacre to lure devils and wagered his
life on an untried gin

  but theyll kill me anyhow he rea-
soned in his own poor dialect an i got t
do ut its a chanst

  four-flushin i am he continued in si-
lent deliberation an if any one calls me
im gone cut off me hands an me feet
mebbe an bury me t the neck in a hill of
ants

the siesta hour was over his as-
sistant stirred then awoke and seat-
ed himself in the doorway smoking
looking out at nothing but paddy re-
mained where he was his hands behind his
ruddy unkempt head his ankles crossed in
an attitude of ease his blue eyes dim with
worry trying to predict and to provide
against such difficulties as he had not yet
foreseen in the meantime one by one the
minutes fluttered by and night slowly ad-
vanced upon them

  the rice-pots were steaming and the army
clustered round them while the yellows
the greens and the pinks of sunset dulled
to a copper glow he heard the evening
babble sometimes a deep-chested grunt or
a shrill falsetto argument that invariably
ended in a high-pitched even-toned long-
breathed ah-h-h that meant contempt
derision or a challenge as one chose there
were laughter and muttering

  the native went out for the eight-oclock
meal paddy forsook his couch with sweat-
ing palms and chill brow to explore the
gaps in the nipa walls for spying eyes
then with trembling fingers he lighted his
primitive lamp tiptoed softly with it to the
table and cast the die

  first he opened a can of milk and drank
nearly all of it then he crushed an onion
into the residue he added a dash of water
and strained the mixture as best he could
into a sea-shell which he used for a paper-
weight

  with this unusual fluid he indited a note
to his captain it was not very long and
covered less than one side of a sheet of pa-
per he made several copies and when
they were dry laid them all blank sides up
on top of the pile from which he had taken
them the words could not be seen at
least in the faint wavering light of his
room

  afterward he washed the shell but left
the empty tin and the refuse to testify that

he had eaten in case the observant warden
should manifest solicitous curiosity

  and now with good india ink of the
land he wrote an offer of capitulation on
the clean surface of the uppermost page in
very fair visayan free from hidden mean-
ing or doubt-inspiring mark

  he worked swiftly and when his inmate
returned appeared to be dozing again the
master had finished his sena the latter re-
ported and had summoned the seven to his
house the ministro was expected also
paddy arose and obeyed with a primal
prayer to an unknown god welling up in his
heart

  he saluted the seven gravely and sta-
tioned himself beside pachicos chair

  i return to you my general he said
with a profound bow what is left of my
writing materials for since the drill is fin-
ished i need them no more

  so naturally as to make it seem quite ac-
cidental he laid his papers upon a pile in
front of pachico he retained only the com-
pleted despatch

  gracias murmured the chief while
you were coming we discussed the campaign
once more have you perhaps something
further to recommend

  nothing we are ready i have also
prepared the letter to save your excellency
trouble as a ministro should if it is not
good there are the means before you to say
what you will

  read it

  paddy who had remained standing shift-
ed his weight to one foot and raised the
document in both hands while he read

to the commandante militar residing in sogod
very respected senor

   believing that the welfare of our beloved country
so demands and that peace under the powerful uni-
ted states is better than a hopeless warfare for our
independence we hereby propose freely though
with painful sorrow to surrender upon the plaza of
malavista on the afternoon of the fourth day that
follows the present

  most obediently we kiss your hands

  he passed it to pachico who scrutinized
it closely his eyes illumined as if to burn a
secret from the very pulp so too each of
the seven scanned it and a few glanced
casually at the other side

  is it sufficient inquired paddy or
shall another be written

  it will serve it is as well done as that
of capile who relinquished his command on
the one sheep that was lost



panay last year doubtless you saw it in
the prints

  i have read it

  let us sign this

  but wait objected one we know
surely that the americanos do not kill if
that can be avoided yet if we all sign
and the enterprise fails it may not after-
ward be convenient for us to visit sogod
and our families may be incommoded

  it is true agreed paddy

  now it was not open to argument that
any instructions he wished to give his cap-
tain would have to be in english and that
could be accomplished only in his signature
he had reviewed all possible obstacles to
this during his meditations he had con-
trived a method to meet every emergency
pertaining to it not until he was sure he
could warn his own officers had he conceded
his readiness for the undertaking he had
hoped for this particular protest and was
prepared to make it himself but it pleased
him more to have another interpose he
stooped to adjust a lacing upon his tattered
shoes to hide his satisfaction

  let pachico he resumed whose name
they already know alone ratify it for him-
self and his forces and that the act may be
official let it be attested by the minister of
war such is the mode of authorities
you americano carrambal no your
name will provoke distrust do you tell us
they will believe that you a deserter in time
of war would involuntarily give yourself up
to death

  the old man who hurled this bomb con-
sidered a moment and then as the minister
who had expected this was about to speak
a light seemed suddenly to break upon him

  pig he grunted there ismore in
this than we suspect either you and they
have planned this thing in a way we have
not perceived or you blunder it is not
that for you have great intelligence for
eso it is a hoax americano is it not so
for an instant paddy nearly staggered
the little smile hovered upon pachicos lips

  do you not understand he replied
that the americanos have stupid ideas
about such things for example among
your soldiers are a few who have been taken
by them and then released nor have i
heard that they have executed a deserter in
this war will they not suppose that i am
aware of their beliefs since i was once as
they are they will say he has induced

them to come in for he prefers our prison
to the high places of the philippines pun-
ishment in his own land to banishment for-
ever and he hopes by this to atone for
his crime so will they think and thus will
they say you are wrong as you will see if
you reflect upon it

  indeed said pachico he speaks in
good sense if our scouts at any point de-
tect a danger we can still retire even at the
very town  will yet try this but if there
is a mistake or aught we can not understand
the americano must die is it not just

  it was a strange word for this man to use
who had dipped into the rice-pot with a
comrade in order to destroy him but the
others answered simply-

   jus to

  then i will complete this and the
ministro shall witness it

  while the seven maintained a somber si-
lence pachico affixed his signature majes-
tically as an emperor then he deferred to
paddy who leaned over his shoulder and
wrote in an awkward scrawl

warmothcrside ruff

ministro de guerra

zona 

  paddy straightened up well content
but unexpectedly the familiar curve twisted
pachicos mouth and he extended the letter
again to the council

  carrajo sputtered one this is not
the name he gave us

  that was easy to speak this is not
even to be read

  nor is there a p for a beginning it is
some character that is neither visayan nor
spanish

  out of the mystery grew suspicion then
threats there is small room for duplicity
where even truth is doubted but paddy
made one more stand hoping to deceive
them only a little longer it was not intel-
lect that guided him now it was the instinct
of a man at bay

  basta he shouted stamping his foot as
if in anger why dispute the name i
gave you is but a nickname given me by
the infidels this is my own shall i not
use it in a message of dignity it is clear
that you have lost your confidence in me
be it so i am tired of trying to please you
i will have no more to do with it kill me
since that appears to be your wish let us
end it but blame yourselves alone if you


adventure

spend your lives in the poverty of the out-
side come decide

  he paused standing beside pachico one
hand gripping the table the fingers of the
other plucking absently behind him at a
seam in his clothing it was hard to die
when everything had promised to end so
well all he craved of heaven now as he
looked questioningly from one to the other
was that the end might be sudden and the
manner of it merciful

  but he had unconsciously appealed to
their greed when argument would not have
moved them pachico took a gamblers
chance

  let it be as he says he decreed since
we choose our own trail

  the malcontents assented distrustful
like their master but good gamesters also
as rogues should ever be

  thus it came to pass that a courier left
early in the morning for sogod they still
talked of the missing soldier there and
many a hunt had the captain led through
brush and cogon grass till famine and fever
beat him back again some affirmed that
the one they sought was an excellent rid-
dance but they all vowed nevertheless
whenever they trod the wilds to kill a hun-
dred for paddy if they found his bones

  he was a man of our company said
they worthless or not is no matter but
if he deserted god help him when we get
him

  it happened upon a night of rest that
the captain was puzzling over a rumor the
natives had spread which asserted in sub-
stance the design of the hillmen to yield
and while he was wondering if paddy were
with them and if so what he was doing
one of the guard presented himself

  theres a gu-gu here sir on some kind
of errand

  a mud-smeared bare-footed cutthroat
clad in airy clothing loosely woven of coarse
hemp his broad straw hat in his hand pat-
tered in and gave the captain a letter
hm cant read it

  visayan queried the lieutenant
uh-hu hello what dye think of
this its from ruff

  he entrusted it to bryant and summoned
the sentry

take that man to the company kitchen
give him a meal and hold him until further
orders tell the first-sergeant i want him
the sergeant came and with many a

frown and a ponderous pause translated the
momentous lines he was not the scholar
in this work that paddy was perhaps be-
cause he had learned in a slower school
but he did very well

  thats all sergeant the captain said
say nothing about this and caution the men
not to discuss that gu-gu around town
what do you make of it he asked when
they were alone

  looks fishy averred the lieutenant
that little red-head has taken up with
them apparently and i suppose hes try-
ing to get square by an ambush for the
hours hes done in the mill

  well that may be so of course the
captain admitted but i cant believe it
theres one thing ill bank on in ruffs
case theres no yellow streak in him
whatever else may be said of him how
about it scotty

  the doctor shook his head in perplexity
it may be as the captain says the
vagabonds forever blundering into trouble
but he always gets out with a whole slcin
whatever may happen to others hes one
of those seraphically serene individuals who
scatter misfortune around them in cherubic
innocence but usually die peacefully and
painlessly in their beds at a ripe old age
one must have a sense of humor to handle
him im thinking in this instance if hes
in sore straits again mind ye i dont state
it for a fact but it might be it is not his
own people that will pay the piper

  well mused the captain perhaps you
are right but if those chaps really mean
to quit theres no reason why they cant
just as well come here as for us to go to
malavista

  bryant nodded in approbation

  thats what i think if its business
theyll come

  ill try them on that basis at any rate
if your idea of an ambush is correct we can
avoid it in that way and in any case well
discover what truth there is in the proposi-
tion

  he sat down and began to compose an
answer in spanish presently he stopped

  i believe you are right bryant fur-
thermore ill bet that ruff never wrote it
he would have done it in english if he
and they were in collusion and had meant it
for what it purports to be if they were
sincere they would have had nothing to fear
from his using his own language its a
tlu- one sheep that was lost



subterfuge of some sort another thing
diil you notice the signature ruff is
there all right but the given name is a jum-

  let me see it again

  all three studied it carefully after a
while bryant smiled

  do you get this he separated the
words with pencil-marks

  no one spoke for a moment

  i see two possible combinations an-
nounced the captain but one is too cryptic
to have any significance i take it he is
telling us to apply heat to the back of this
thing

  i have heard of such tricks affirmed
the doctor it might not be foolish to try
it

  he did so at first nothing happened
then faintly but by degrees more plainly
there developed this appeal in sepia-colored
characters

capten sir

  i did not desert i will tell you how it was if i
ever get home plese go out on the malavista trail
just as it says only its a fake an wait dose i
told them you wud all go out an then we wud jump
the convenio plese rig a strong bar acrost the out-
side ov the main store-room doors an leve it all
open but no chow if you do this capten i will do
the rest an wen you see them go in comc quick if
you do not do this its me for the ant-hills capten
plese	very respectful

private ruff

  phew exhaled the captain in a whis-
per of awe and realization thats some
nerve

  aye commended the doctor adver-
sity sharpens the wits that her child neces-
sity may be satisfied tis some compen-
sation im thinking for one who is knocked
about the world that he becomes more
clever than the rest of us

  youll do it demanded bryant almost
defiantly hes got death before and be-
hind him captain

  ill follow him to the dot if i lose my
commission well start work tonight bry-
ant getting things quietly arranged in the
convenio suppose you look after that bear-
ing in mind the fact that they may finish
ruff and get away

  how about the town

  oh they know what pachico is figur-
ing on already you can bank on that
dont think therell be any of them around
they know him too well to go after any-
thing he wants to loot ill leave a volun-

teer guard for a blind with directions to
run when the gu-gus appear they can
stop the padre also if he comes prying
around

  mon declared the doctor in some agi-
tation i was never strong for the hero
work the sick must go too

  the messenger left that very evening and
reached pachicos camp early the next fore-
noon

  the heart of paddy sang when he heard
the answer read for his wise captain guaran-
teed pardons for all because of their volun-
tary renunciation of hostilities

  this settled all doubts among the seven
who beamed on paddy almost worshipfully

  notwithstanding lest some mischance
occur he begged more paper for writing or-
ders during the march and so obtained pos-
session of all that he had used

  at the proper time when the morning
breezes shook the dews from the palms a
full company of american soldiers evacuated
sogod and disappeared on the malavista
trail the town seemed to be deserted

  simultaneously the red head of paddy
ruff protruded through the thicket on the
hilltop opposite

  he has taken them all my general as i
predicted the dogs bark no more let
us hum

  swiftly they descended from the heights
a gleeful mob and ran down the empty
highway straight for the stone convenio

  the volunteer guard fired wildly at noth-
ing in particular and fled for their lives

  the stores americano howled pachico
in which of the vaults are the stores and
the money

  in there quick sobbed paddy who
halted at the great doors

  then into the deep high lower story
pushed and writhed and crowded the loot-
mad malays and when the last had wrig-
gled in paddy crashed the heavy barriers
together and dropped the long strong bar
into place

  all hell could not equal the screams of
the demons shut into those walls they
hacked at the massive entrance and pried
at the window-gratings but paddy ran
toward the jungle as man had seldom sped
before and far away or so at least it
seemed to him were coming his own good
people at double time and in perfect order

  ive made good captain he pleaded
and fell in a faint at their feet

c tuttle

author of magpies nightbear when oscar went wild etc

scientific prospectin has its
merits announced ike har-
per as he climbed out of the
gopher-hole and sat down be-
side me on a boulder and filled his pipe but
fool luck has uncovered more bonanzas than
science

  now there was ol jerry sullivans
burro went skatin down th hill off th
trail one day and slid th coverin off th
silver cross which made uh millionaire outa
jerry hen berry accidentally fired his six-
shooter into th ground oncet and uncov-
ered one of th richest gold veins in th state
yuh can talk science till yer tongue hangs
out but if yuh aint lucky yuh never hit it
rich do yuh happen to know uh elongated
person named magpie simpkins

  i replied that i had never had that plea-
sure

  pleasure he snorted no i reckon
nobody ever did let me tell yuh why

      magpie was uh scientific pros-
pector he could take uh piece uh
rock and tell yuh jist what it con-
tained and why it contained said constitu-
ents mineralogy was an open book to that
jasper and because of it he never made uh
strike

  but he didnt merely go in fer prospect-
in that person was loco on anything
except work i reckon he had tried nearly
everything first he went in fer hypnot-
ism not havin uh likely subject he tried
it on uh wildcat i reckon he forgot to tell
th cat what it meant he got loose from
th cat and th hypnotism thing at th same
time

  next he goes in for-wait uh bit im
gittin ahead of my yam you asked about
th de-funct copper king mine uh while
ago and as that is part of th story ill con-
nect it all up

  me and magpie has these two claims


psychology and copper



here on plenty stone creek which look
promisin and were figgerin that maybe
we can git some one to buy us out magpie
has been down to piperock after grub and
when he comes back hes got uh proposi-
tion

  i knowed all th time that we hadnt
ought to let uh third party into our outfit
but magpie argues that uh captalist like
this feller peters will help smooth our trail
uh heap and bein right on th ground he
can land us uh buyer

 peters was uh queer cuss he was
about knee-high to uh tall injun and
spent his spare time tryin to cultivate
hair on his face he wore uh little brown
derby hat and it had uh nervous way
uh wigglin around on top of his head
when he was talkin he didnt have no
chin to speak of-jist sort a slid away
from his lower lip he had money and
uh thirst fer th great west so he comes
to piperock and opens an office-mines
and real estate

  mebby hes kumtux to th real estate
but on mines he dont show uh trace he
has six little books on mineralogy which he
reads continually and when uh feller has to
consult uh book every time he sees uh piece
uh rock hes in th same class with th jasper
who opens th home doctor book every
time he feels off color-he shore finds
symptoms of everything

  me and magpie needs uh grub stake fer
our winter work if we dont sell out and
bein as peters is plumb wild to be uh mine
owner we lets him buy uh third interest in
our claims

 as magpie remarks-he comes uh
stranger and we takes him in

  i aint strong fer peters but after livin
with magpie all these years i dont shy at
any ordinary freak

  now magpie has been plumb rational
fer several months and im beginning to
think hes sort a outgrown his love fer
something new in th scientific line but im
wrong its only uh sort a not dead but
sleepin proposition cause oneday magpie
pilgrims in from piperock with uh pack-
load uh black-covered books

  i shore recognizes th symptoms and
goes up to tellurium woods cabin and
bunks with him that night tellurium is
workin uh copper prospect which he calls
th copper king and when i tells him why
im there he welcomes me openly-him

and magpie aint jist what youd call
friendly

  th next mornin i sneaks home cau-
tious like and when i comes in range i
knows that its workin magpie is oratin
out loud with nobody to listen except th
pack burros right there i quotes gen-
eral sherman but dont mention war a-tall
he quits cold when he sees me and fer th
next few days he surrounds himself with
cigarette butts and mystery

  about this time peters makes good
he aint never been up to see our property
-i reckon its cause we aint got no bawth-
room-but he gits his rope on one alfred
myron cowgill of boston massachusetts
and sends him up to look it over

  alfred knows all about mines-havin
been educated fer th ministry-and he
finds out that weve got th finest piece uh
property he ever seen copper pyrites
shore makes uh hit with people who dont
sabe free gold and after uh little pow-wow
we sells alfred our prospect hole and good-
will fer five thousand dollars cash

  alfred announces that hes got to go
back east fer uh while and he hires me and
magpie to sort a keep people from pesti-
catin around on his property and probably
runnin off with some of his nice yellow py-
rites were uh heap obliged to peters
cause this money will make possible uh prop-
osition weve argued uh heap uh times
old sourdough johnsons got uh claim about
three miles over th south fork which he
calls th daylight and me and magpie
have laid awake nights tryin to figger out
how to seperate him from his location

  johnson aint on th lead and never will
be where hes workin but one day were
cornin across th claim and find th real
lead sticks right out in th middle of th
claim and she shore is rich uh course
we dont tell anybody-not even peters
were folks that mind our own business
thataway

  but magpie is too much absorbed with
his books to even consider uh minin deal
he sits there half th night by th light of
uh candle and prospects them books he
wont eat a-tall jist sits there and peruses
them books with uh cease yer worldly
cares look on his face im uh heap curious
to know whats in em but wont show it
enough to pick one up i know ill find out
all about em jist as soon as magpie gits his
system full


adventure

somebody tells tellurium about
our sale and he comes down to
congratulate us hes plumb lame
with rheumatism and after th usual words
have been spoken he complains on his afflic-
tion uh heap

   what you needs tellurium remarks
magpie and im pleased to hear his voice
once more is uh touch of psychology

   aint i got enough snaps tellurium
rheumatics and plumbago and-shucks i
kaint stand much more

   mr woods yore powers uh perception
are limited to sourdough bread and low-
grade ore states magpie markin th place
in his book and reachin fer another yore
ideas of science dont go beyond throwin
uh diamond hitch and th correct way to
hold yer knife when yuh eats pie

   remember this- he shakes his finger
at tellurium and rolls uh smoke one-
handed-im not discoursin on diseases
im touchin on th grandest subject on
earth-science of th mind before which all
diseases vanish like iron pyrites in boilin
nitric you aint got nothin th matter
with yuh a-tall its jist uh lazy streak in
yore subconscious mind

   as i was sayin before this interrup-
tion remarks tellurium as i was sayin
ike th lord made uh big mistake yuh
shore got to agree with me that it was an
error on his part when he wished long ears
and uh brayin voice on uh perfectly inno-
cent jackass and let some people i know
resemble uh human bein

  tellurium is uh big hulk of uh man and
magpie aint what youd call uh runt so
after watchin it uh while i pries em apart
with uh pick-handle they arbitrates
whats left of th battle and smoke uh peace
pipe when tellurium hikes back up th
trail home i notices that his limp is plumb
gone

   thats psychology ike states magpie
he comes down uh cripple and we sends
him home whole great stuff ike now
jist let me read yuh one little chapter out

loud and ill bet-

  i didnt hear it cause im on my way
down to th pitch stump after kindlin-wood
one winter me and him was snowed in up
in th cceur dalenes and magpie finds uh
copy of th congressional record

  since then nobody can read out loud to
me

   laziness covers uh multitude uh sins

announces magpie while were eatin sup-
per that night tellurium states that hes
only drivin uh foot uh day now ike no
man can ever live long enough to develop
uh copper mine at that rate with th help
of psychology he can drift three feet uh day
in that formation

   well mebby i sort of agrees i dont
know th power of this element yuh claim
to have corraled but i do know tellurium
and im here to state that uh foot uh day is
hy-iu driftin fer him

  magpie peruses his book some plentiful
before he opens up again

  ike ill bet yuh uh hundred dollars that
i can have tellurium drivin three feet uh
day inside of uh week i aims to sort of
work on his imagination through th ele-
ments uh psychology enervate his sub-
conscious mind sabev

   i passes th sabe part i replies but
ill take that bet yuh might practise on
that he-burro now magpie hes been
standin there under that tree since noon
reckon hes sick or jist lost his appetite
 both i reckon replies magpie but
science of th mind wont help any in his
case cause hes done ate up yore sunday
overalls and two pair uh yore wool socks
th next day i goes down to granite to
have a talk with peters about this daylight
mine deal me and magpie had decided
not to tell peters how good it is cause uh
hombre like him is jist as apt to talk as not
we dont want ourselves to show in th deal
cause johnson might suspect our motives
uh feller like peters looks like uh sucker
and mebby johnson will make him uh good
price

  peters swells out his chest and his little
derby does uh tango on his head when i
puts it up to him he sure thinks hes an
expert i tells him that its uh likely lookin
prospect and to shoot th hull roll if he has
to

  him bein some elated i borrows uh
hundred from him and goes over to helena
for uh week leavin magpie to his books i
figgers that we can make uh large piece uh
money out of th daylight without much
development work and i sings uh care-free
song while i scatters that hundred amid th
bright lights

  when i gits back to piperock th first
person i sees is magpie and he welcomes
me heartily and also imparts th informa-
tion that im out uh hundred bucks cause
psychology and copper



telluriums doin better than three feet uh
day and his rheumatism is ancient history
of course bein uh direct descendant of one
uh missouris first settlers i declines to set-
tle without first-hand information

  we goes up to peterss office to find out
about th daylight deal but he aint in so
we goes over to dutch freds and plays
seven-up until supper-time along about
dark peters rides and yells to us that every-
thing is fine

  we goes up to his office later and hes
there with uh smile and uh glad hand he
looks almost too danged happy some way

   gentlemen sez he im sorry to have
kept yuh waitin so long but it was uh hard
trip- and as i was in th mountains several
days i was badly in need of my tub now
to business i-er-have uh smoke

  he shoves out uh box uh seegars and we
lights up

   my friends and partners its uh lucky
thing fer you both that youve got uh tech-
nical as well as uh practical mining man fer
uh partner in yore ventures-meanin my-
self to th untaught mind of th average
prospector that daylight claim might look
promisin but i saw its defects gentlemen
i saw its defects remember i took five
days in my examination and refused to
make him an offer

   but peters weve- began magpie

   beg pardon mr simpkins but id
like to finish as i said before i turned th
proposition down but before i returned i
had an inspiration i decided to investigate
other prospects in that particular district
now here is where you have me to thank
gentlemen yesterday afternoon i ran
across uh piece uh property that bids fair
to make us all rich it is located in th
vicinity of yore former property i believe
and is mighty rich in copper-mighty rich
speaking mildly i beg yore pardon mr
simpkins did you speak

   go ahead mumbles magpie and i
notices that hes got all of that seegar in his
mouth and seems to be slowly chokin
to death

   as i started to say resumed peters
i panned some of th drillins in this pros-
pect and what do you suppose i found gen-
tlemen native copper why in one pan
of that dust i got at least half an ounce
he paused to let this sink in it shore
listens good to me but magpie dont seem
elated none whatever

   the owner was wise to what he had
continued peters and when i offered him
five thousand for his claim he laughed at me
but i refused to give up the ship gentlemen
and after talkin to him nearly all day i
got him to sell us half interest for that price
 listen peters magpies adams
apple is doin uh war-dance up and down
his neck as he stands there weavin on his
heels and glarin down at peters whats
that prospectors name

   mr tellurium woods of course

tellurium is only-

   yeo-o-o-ow yells magpie kickin
over his chair and gallopin to th door and
we hears him jist hit twice on his way down

  me and peters sits there fer uh spell
lookin foolish-like at each other and not
knowin what to say

  finally i opines aloud that i believe
magpies been eatin loco salad and id
better close-herd him before he bites some-
body uh course peters politely offers his
valuable services but im able to decline
with thanks

knowin magpies failin in
times uh stress i ambles straight
fer th nearest hooch emporium i
proves my deductions there he is draped
over th bar lookin sad-like into uh glass
uh woblum-that bein th chippeway
appellation fer whisky

   magpie sez i puttin uh friendly
hand on his droopin shoulder and motion-
in to th barkeep that mines th same
why this cross between uh foot race and
uh piegan war dance

  he looks me over like uh man who is
seein his last white chip go into th rack
he lifts up his right hand straight over his
head like th peace signs yuh see in movin
pictures and says

   never again ike never again

  im agreeable i dont know what he
means but im pleased any time magpie
says never again i looks at th future with
more animation

   ike sez he mournful-like im sorry
it aint fair to you i reckon im one uh
them unfortunate persons who are born with
uh lot uh brains and no sense some way i
seems to ball up everything but ike i
asks yuh how did i know i cant see that

   ttn hilarious happy camp
rt- on the north side of chilkoot
pass inbound stampeders trav-
eling laden and outbound pack-
ers traveling light rested by night from the
toil of the trail foregathered in the saxon
saloon they relaxed their muscles their
throats and their poke-strings

  motley crowds haunted the bar on one
side of the huge canvas room surrounded
the gaming-tables on the other side clogged
the central space where within a circle of
chairs a red-hot stove throbbed like a giant

engine and overflowed upon the dancing-
floor at the rear

  a haze of smoke invested everything
blurring the oil-lamps swung from the ridge-
pole and softening the uncouth garments
and rough faces of the men

  in all quarters except in the immediate
vicinity of the tables where a businesslike
quiet reigned was laughter song and badi-
nage was clamor jest and camaraderie was
open hand open heart and a devil-take-to-
morrows - worry atmosphere old-timers
hailing from opposite ends of the earth
the hunt-pack



called one another friend and swapped harsh
experiences vile tobacco and colossal lies
while chechakos to whom these seared ad-
venturers were little less than gods worship-
ed meekly at their feet imbibing among
other things instruction in the ways and
wiles of the land

  and with the noise of the main room of
the saxon at its height into it swept like a
flood the babel of the dance-hall blended
music of violin and piano stopped two-
score couples circling the floor whirled about
and made a concentrated rush for refresh-
ments in a shrieking giggling shoving
mass they surged forth the women in satins
and pumps the men in moccasins and muk-
luks and fur or mackinaw coats shaking
the oil-lamps on the ridge-pole with their
raucous laughter swirling the haze of the
place into strange eddies with the violence
of their charge

  for this was a night of rejoicing this
was happy camp the titanic climb of
storm-harried chilkoot was past and the
trend of the gold-trail now led down the
mountain and onward by ice-bound lake
and river to desired dawson that many
who had started up the pass from dyea
had never crossed the summit had drowned
in dyea river broken their necks in the
canon got caught near the scales by shov-
ing glacier or thundering avalanche or fall-
en to frost and blizzard upon the palisades
was not a thing to be remembered at this
hour the rest were here the survivors
the fit the strong in whom life flowed fierce-
ly with its primordial pulse and they were
reveling in triumph and shouting toasts to
the trough roof when the door of the saxon
opened and the frost puffed in a fog-bank
into the superheated room

a out of the fog-bank stepped two
figures a man and a woman fresh
from the trail their parkas where
they clung tightly over their backs and
sagged on their hips were rimmed with
hoarfrost advertising body-sweat congealed
and about the close-drawn puckers of their
hoods icicles hung like tusks

  upon the two were the unmistakable signs
of the chilkoot climb new recruits to the
ranks of the strong they seemed and the
triumphant army in the saxon acclaimed
them with a thunderous cheer

  the man and the woman held their heads
over the heat the icy tusks thawed and

fell to sizzle and steam upon the glowing
stove-top the two shoved back the parka
hoods and nodded genially to their welcom-
ers

  but the moment the newcomers faces
were bared a thick-set man in moccasins
german socks and bearskin coat stagged
off at the hips rose up on the other side of
the stove and peered sharply through the
steam next an unspoken question in his
eyes he gazed significantly at his six com-
panions around the fire they likewise
scrutinized the late arrivals for a keen sec-
ond looked back at the thick-set man in
the stagged-off bearskin and nodded grim-
ly-

  whereupon the bearskin-clad one raised
an authoritative hand amid the bedlam of
the saxon

  at once the din lessened

  whats up bassett yelled an irre-
pressible member of the dance crowd rel-
atives of yours

  maybe they come through the chilkoot
by tunnel and aint had the third degree of
the pass hazarded another facetiously
toms going to find out

  but tom bassett had stepped swiftly
round the stove and laid a hand upon the
shoulder of the man in the parka

  what might your name be stranger
  karle lott

  lie number one its jose cantine
and whos the woman with you

  my wife he resentfully shook off
bassetts hand

  lie number two you hound its eric
sarks wife-vamoosed with in white pass
city months and months back aw hold
up bassett seized the hand that dived
under the parka and jerked it forth again
you dont go gunnin with me if you
was fair game id sure let you but you
aint my pardner sarks got a mortgage
on you and if i was over in his place es-
tablishin relay camps on another trail and
he was here in mine youd pay right now
im sufferin sorry he aint here but all the
same its a bloody short morator-ee-um
youre gittin cantine savvy thats
why im lettin you stay hull-skinned
well if youre lettin me stay whole-
skinned what you crossin me for then
fiercely demanded the man in the parka
anger darkening his already dark eyes tens-
ing sharper his already sharp features
mind i aint admittin im cantine either


adventure

but if i was cantine and you aint goin
to perforate cantine on sight what in
hades do you mean

  mean echoed bassett your gall is
sure chilled steel and case-hardened on top
do you think as me or any other white
mans goin to eat drink or sleep with or
breathe the same air as you you as broke
the bond of bread and blanket the north-
land law as no man ever breaks and lives
to boast of it days on end i seen you sit
at table with my pardner sark under his
own roof in white pass city nights on
end i seen you smoke by his fireside and
bed down in his blankets and with the
guile of your stinkin soul you was plannin
and executin his betrayal every blasted
minute of the time

  then agin do you think as any woman
in this camps goin to suffer the compan-
ionship of yon female you call your wife
whos ten times guiltiern you the girls
of happy camp is slightly frivolous and
not what youd term pernickety but they
draw the line at her and i tell you can-
tine i draw the line at you i wouldnt
deserve to be called sarks pardner if i
didnt i wouldnt deserve to be called a
white man if i didnt im strong for sani-
tation here the likes of you two is stench
and putrefaction in a healthy place savvy
what i mean you git to blazes outa hap-
py camp

  bassett released the others wrist as he
spoke and the man his lips drawn up in a
wolf-dogs snarl stepped back a yard

  ill be bludgeoned if we do he snapped
you aint proved anything yet anyway
there aint anything to prove

  tom bassett gazed at him with a wearied
air and resignedly waved a hand to his
companions

  who is he men he asked

  as one man six of them took pipes out of
their mouths lowered their feet from the
guard-rail of the stove and spat toward the
damper

  jose cantine they chorused
immediately their feet went up to the
guard-rail again and their pipes went back
to their mouths

  and about the woman bassett paused
and scanned the throng of dancers
wheres white-pass-city winnie he
asked aint she here tonight i thought
i seen her yeller dress somewhar oh shes
at the back eh well trot her forrard

  the throng shifted leaving an irregular
lane in its center

  through this lane a fresh-faced girl of
twenty-four or -five pushed from the rear
the rustle of her canary-satin dress and the
tap-tap of her dainty pumps falling with
strange distinctness across the silence of
the saxon

  winnie shake hands with an old friend
of yours yawned bassett

  white-pass-city winnie gave one swift
curious glance at the woman by the stove
and recoiled her nose in the air

 me shake with blera sark not
much and if id shamed as good a man
as eric sark for a cur like jose cantine
id spare my old friends the sight of my
face

  winnie arms folded so tight as to lock
her hands away from any possible contami-
nation flounced back into the front rank of
the dance-crowd and remained there stand-
ing on her dignity and her high heels

  for a little the other woman gazed fixed-
ly at her scorner then her flushed face
still handsome in spite of the marring fron-
tier life began to quiver and work her
hands clenched upon the breast of her
parka and tears splashed down and hissed
upon the stove

  you-you-vixen she choked

  for revelation as well as inexpressible
hurt was white-pass-city winnies opinion
of her social status

  yet her shame and her tears had no weak-
ening effect upon those about her bassett
was gazing significantly at cantine

  no good jose he shrugged seein
as im an all-fired welded and cemented
pardner of sarks i figgered you wouldnt
be anyways partial to my views i figgered
youd be hard-bent on disputin my identi-
fication if ever i spotted you so i aint
standin on my own identification im
standin on the identification of these here
six men as knowed you along the white
pass trail im standin on the identifica-
tion of white-pass-city winnie who was a
close friend of blera sarks whats more
ill bet a thousand ounces thar aint a per-
son present as doubts yon evidence if
thar is let him speak up for you

  bassetts challenging glance traveled
swiftly round the saxon the dancing-
floor was empty the bar deserted every
faro stud-poker draw-poker crap and rou-
lette table idle to a man the stakers had
the hunt-pack



left their stillest games to hear the contro-
versy in the middle of the room and to a
man they stood with tom bassett no one
spoke for cantine

  its settled decided bassett whirling
upon jose and lemme tell you youre
gittin outa happy camp pretty safe i
know manys the camp as would give you
twenty lashes for stealin a rind of bacon
and for stealin a mans wife and home and
hopes and honor-say cantine liquid hell-
fire aint a squirt on what theyd do to you
youre lucky to be goin so safe now git

  we wont defied jose recklessly
weve come twenty-odd miles climbed
nigh four thousand feet and its forty-one
below zero by the thermometer on the door
you cant turn us out on a night like this

  kint growled bassett with a quick
jerk he flipped his watch from his pocket
on to his open palm sixty seconds im
givin you he announced walk through
that door before then or git thrown through
arter

  the saxon was very still bristling like
a malemiut at bay jose cantine half-
crouched in front of bassett who intently
held the watch on him

  one two three four five-ten-fif-
teen- rasped bassetts deep voice mo-
notonously counting off the seconds

  cantines coal-black eyes shifted appeal-
ingly round the room but the crowd of
men gazed back at him stolidly

  twenty-thirty-forty-fifty-sixty

  bassett flipped his watch into his pocket
and jumped

  as he jumped cantines hand again dived
under his parka he had the colt out this
time before tom grasped his arm two
shots went wild through the stovepipe but
his wrist twisted with a violent wrench
cantine felt the weapon slipping from his
fingers felt himself lifted like a doll in bas-
setts powerful hands and bundled to the
door

  in the doorway bassett poised a second
suddenly he kicked cantine hurtled down
the slope like a football gaining momentum
every second and plunged into a snowdrift
one hundred yards below

 now missus-

  but the woman who had been blera sark
fled past bassett after jose

  mebbe you think youve run agin a
pretty hard snag in me bassett called
down the slope to them you havent

im a gentle ministerin velvet-fingered
angel of mercy to what youll strike before
you make dawson city

  he closed the saxon door against the
boring frost

  the air sure smells better he observed
sniffing with relief

  sure does nodded the old-timers by
the stove but what trails your pardner
plantin relay camps on

  the nordenskold trail answered bas-
sett thats the same trail yon two skunks
is takin on from whitehorse only they
dunno it yit but ladies and gentlemen
apologizing to the crowd im sure suffer-
in sorry to be the cause of the delay in
your fun dont let her delay any longer
go cavortin to it

  immediately clamor broke out again
  violin and piano struck up

  the click of the ivory roulette-ball and
the rattle of dealt cases arose from the ta-
bles

 happy camp was happy camp once
more and for it the incident was closed

kisss but not for cantine and the wo-
ssft man

 she helped the cursing jose to
pull himself out of the drift ancitogether
they floundered back to the beaten trail

  in the snow-walled defile they stood a
moment gazing upward at the glowing
lights of happy camp and the stark out-
line of chilcoot mountain etched against a
green night sky

  with a string of muffled imprecations
jose made a move as if to go back up the
slope but blera put her hands on his shoul-
ders and checked him

  dont jose dont she besought
theyll maim and manhandle you till
youre a proper cripple and the wordll
go round like a plague there isnt any
tent there for us tonight

  i aint seein any here either then
snarled jose you know how light we
come over the pass to make it in a day
grub enough for one stop and  blan-
kets

  well shivered blera petulantly
theres lots of fire isnt there whats the
use of lamenting in the frost

  happy camp marked the edge of timber-
line after the nakedness of the glacier-
scoured rocks and volcanic slag about crater
lake and the steeps above and into the


adventure

first scrubby pines cantine and the woman
turned

  here was a chaos of dead and splintered
trunks as thick as a mans arm and piling
these up they kindled a giant fire food
was larking yet they melted snow in a
drinking-cup that cantine carried in his
pocket and swallowed great drafts of hot
water

  blankets they were likewise powerless to
improvise they simply threw big heaps of
green spruce boughs beside the fire and ly-
ing upon them close to the coals basked
and drowsed warming back and breast al-
ternately in the terrific cold and alternately
rising to drag on fresh fuel

  above them in the january night the au-
rora flashed and dimmed and the sapphire
stars leaped with dire prophecy of still in-
tenser cold and the january day when it
came was as the night except that the stars
vanished and the aurora ceased to play
the jagged sunless world was frigid stiff
and white and the green night sky had
changed to muddy gray

  cantine and blera arose early drank
more hot water and plowed down the ice-
trail across deep lake and long lake an-
cient volcano pits that with crater linked
lake linderman to the mountains

  all about them the stampede was on the
move hurrying along the deep trench of
trampled snow which constituted the trail
the throng hauled loaded hand-sleds drove
dogs attached to loaded dog-sleds or went
by man-power under enormous packs ever
these packs were cast down without care at
the side of the trail while the owners back-
tripped for more till the side snows were
heaped with bags boxes and rope-lashed
bundles of all descriptions

  on the right of cantine and blera on
their left ahead of them behind them were
tons upon tons of provisions yet they dared
not put forth their hands to lift a morsel
well they knew the northland law con-
cerning wayside caches and well they knew
the punishment that fell upon him who
broke the law the bitter resentment they
nursed against bassett who had ejected
them from happy camp and against all the
rest who had consented to that ejection
blazed into a sort of savagery a hatred of
their own breed which mocked and tantal-
ized and ostracized them

  every man of that breed bound inward
had a vision before his eyes and a hope in

his heart each worked in a frenzy and
performed prodigies of toil for the attain-
ment of his vision and the realizing of his
high ambition but the jaded souls of can-
tine and blera did not respond to any such
spur

  from the start they had been under no
spell but the spell of shallow garish entice-
ments and the unlooked-for collision with
tom bassett and the specter of another day
had seared them into callousness without
lifting eyes to their companions of the trail
who passed met repassed and oftentimes
jostled them they plodded pariahs of their
race down the frozen surface of long lake

  near long lakes foot a string of seven
sleds drawn by swift dog-teams and going
light overtook them they drove down
upon the two without the customary warn-
ing hail

  cantine and the woman had barely time
to throw themselves prone into the side
snow before the lead-dog of the first team
ripping at them with vicious fangs flashed
past the other teams flashed after each
dog taking the chance to snap futilely at
their moccasined heels and the drivers with
raucous laughter flicking their whiplashes
like long black snakes into the drifts around
the heads of the fallen pair

  although no blow had been landed on
them the demonstration rankled in the
hearts of jose and blera blera knew that
had it not been for the fact that she was a
woman the blows would surely have been
sent home and perhaps the wolf - dogs
swerved from their course to rend them as
they ran more bitter still her anger flared
and jose himself quivered with passion as
he clambered out of the side snow back into
the trail and reviled the disappearing seven
he could not fully identify the befurred
and parka-clad drivers but he had a suspi-
cion that they were tom bassett and the
six men who had sat around the stove the
night before in the saxon saloon

  on down to lake linderman the end of
the twenty-eight-mile portage over chilcoot
from dyea beach he carried his suspicion
and there at linderman landing he found
his suspicions justified

  the shore of the lake was dotted with log-
cabins half-log and half-canvas cabins and
flimsy tents standing where the whipsaws
had swept the trees away on the edge of
the main trail just at the dip to the ice
bulked the linderman restaurant run by
the hunt-pack



flambald it flaunted a huge cotton sign
painted with pies and prices and advertised
a satiating meal for ten dollars in gold in-
stinctively cantine and blera increased
their pace as they made for it

  there was a crowd about the door can-
tine went to push through and suddenly re-
coiled tom bassett lounged on one end of
the log door-step with his back against the
log wall

  whats the matter cantine grinned
tom derisively aint you hungry
cantine put out a hand for his compan-
ion and gingerly his eyes watching bassett
for an untoward action moved over the
door-step he seemed astounded that he
got across untouched he looked back
over his shoulder uncertainly half paused
and went on again toward the tables bas-
sett had never moved a muscle only can-
tine could see the derisive profile of his nose
cheek and mouth as he leaned against the
outside wall and the sight awoke in jose
queer premonitions

  nevertheless he boldly handed blera into
a chair and waited for some one to take his
order no one came jose beckoned mad-
ly but the waiters were always busy they
nodded but they never came in the fury
of his hunger jose leaped up and rushed
over to the plank desk where flambald took
the money for the waiters checks

  look here he flared were famished
and your waiters are a lot of dummies
send some one round with grub
flambald a man of colossal and un -
healthy girth looked at him over the plank
desk

  you go to condemnation he bellowed
you arent eating here

 why what in-

  stop roared flambald this is my
house i feed who i like but you i dont
like savvy

  jose savvied

  flambalds hand was on a huge iron pa-
per-weight that held his bills upon the plank
desk and there was no arguing jose si-
lently beckoned blera and slunk out again

  on the door-step lounged bassett and
jose turned in the trail to curse him futile-
ly he knew better than to try any other
restaurant bassett had passed the word
his receptions would be all the same also
he knew better than to try force he had
had his lesson from that up by timberline
besides bleras hand was on his arm fear-

fully dragging him on down lindermans
frozen bosom

  thus began a grim game in which bas-
sett was persecution personified a nemesis
unshakable he passed them on lake lin-
derman welcomed them at bennett post
and once more showed them the tail of his
sled halfway down to west arm on ben-
nett lake

  that night they spent much like the pre-
ceding one feeding a gigantic fire drinking
inconceivable quantities of hot water and
gnawing mangy dried salmon purchased at
a stick indian teepee on lake bennetts
shore

  thenceforward bassetts hand as well as
the hand of every other man was against
them up the chain of lakes the white
breed of the land was a hunt-pack turned
upon them and though by virtue of stray
indian camps they survived through cari-
bou crossing tagish post and mcclintock
post to whitehorse bassett beat them in
the end

  for on the fifty-mile river beyond the
whitehorse camp his dog-sled passed them
once again and the next far post was sel-
kirk at the pellys mouth

  jose how many miles to selkirk asked
blera as they stared after the vanishing out-
fit

  moren two hundred and fifty an-
swered jose dejectedly bassetts got us
sure

  no he hasnt then bleras blue eyes
flashed in the frost and she shook her fur-
gantleted hand in bassetts wake hes
aiming to starve us out on the river-stretch
and make us quit it again but itll take a
sore sight more than him to do it

  how you meaning we cant make sel-
kirk on hot water and dog-feed

  i know that but theres the dalton
trail

  by thunder say i hadnt figured on
that track but itll do blera youre sure
a-a-a winner i know theres a stick
village at the mouth of the klokhok-old
tutchis village ive been in it often the
beggars is rich theyre lousy with dogs
and well dicker for some and go down the
middle fork of the nordenskold after
that dawsons dead easy with dogs and
in dawson well lie low till we get a chance
to square up with mister bassett come
on

  endowed with redoubled energy at his


adventure

bettered prospects jose turned and sped
of in a long lurching snowshoe stride for the
mouth of the takhini river which emptied
into the fifty-mile halfway between white-
horse and lake laberge

  they turned up the takhini sometimes
called the mendenhall since both these riv-
ers joined to form the larger stream which
emptied into the fifty-mile the menden-
hall draining taye lake lying to the west-
ward on the dalton trail and the takhini
flowing north by east from kusawa lake
between the yukon river and the deza-
deash country

  cantine and blera were traveling almost
due westward on their left to the south
lay haeckel hill on their right to the
north loomed the miners range and on the
far horizon beyond the valley of the tribu-
tary klokhok jutted higher nameless peaks
in interminable vastness the land spread
before them virgin ground oft from the
main-traveled trail to dawson city and the
stupendous extent of it was enough to strike
fear into the human heart

  but cantine had no fear in the lonely
expanse he knew the spot where was life and
warm teepees and food tutchi was a chief
and he kept his village in a fairly sanitary
condition a condition immeasurably supe-
rior to that of the squalid teepees to be found
along the yukon basin cantine had been
there and he knew and up the takhinis
smooth ice he pressed at a furious pace the
beast instinct of him yearning for food and
the human side of him yearning for a place
where he might without dread of contume-
ly take on again the status of the white

  joses sentiments were in a degree re-
flected in his companion she ran at his
heels with the swing of the northwoman
trained to the trails and she seemed to have
no difficulty in keeping his pace

bthe klokhok river they sought
flowed south along the base of the
miners range into the takhini all
afternoon they held on-for it and at night
swung suddenly to the right into its spruce-
fringed mouth yonder by the fringe of
spruce on the low bench-land was the site
of tutchis village but to cantines aston-
ished eyes there glowed no teepee fires be-
tween the black trunks

  blazes he exclaimed in alarm as he
surveyed the bare bench-land shes gone
blera and how in tarnations that it

wasnt just a camping-ground it was a
permanent village but maybe theyve
shifted up-stream or back in the range
lets see if theres a trail

  with a swift pang of fear and loneliness
caused by she knew not what blera me-
chanically followed cantine as he skimmed
up the snow-sheeted ice alongside the klok-
hoks left limit in that moment of non-
discovery of the village the inimical wild
crept close to her she saw it as a con-
crete force strong sure ruthless as the per-
secuting bassett or the avenging hand of
eric sark

  her fear grew upon her so that she drew
near to jose in his search her hand on his
elbow and skimmed with him stride by
stride her eyes were furtively turned to
the dark spruce forests crowding on either
side while the eyes of her companion scru-
tinized the snowy bank that was why
neither of them marked the scum ice fragile
mask of an unfrozen spring straight ahead

  they did not mark it but the moment it
rattled and shaled off against the frames of
their shoes their trained ears telegraphed
the danger instinctively both made a vio-
lent half-turn in mid-stride but the move-
ment was not enough to carry them clear
it served only to jerk them against each
other and together they sank to their
shoulders through the scum ice

  the klokhoks waters were as cold as the
vault of death

  for an instant the contact paralyzed the
two then their arms fell like flails upon
the rotten shell about them for yards
they broke their way to shore and pulled
themselves like leaden-footed divers up the
bank

  a clump of blasted spruce stood on the
shore and struggling against the clog of
their garments which were setting as hard
as armor they madly tore down armfuls of
the boughs

  jose the matches gasped blera drop-
ping on her knees beside the pile give
them to me ill light it you pile on more
dont stop piling

  jose snatched up the stiff crackling front
of his parka and dabbed his numbing fin-
gers into the pocket of his vest where he
kept his matches in a little bottle tightly
corked the best waterproof match-safe the
northman knows

  even as he jabbed his fingers in he ut-
tered a cry of pain and jerked them out again
the hunt-pack

i

  the ends showed all bloody and studded
with bits of broken glass

  pallor swept cantines swarthy face till
he looked like a statue in bronze as he stood
staring stupidly at his finger - ends and
watching the hot blood freeze

  jose jose

  bleras voice rang thin as a wail in the
frosty stillness

  she sprang to jose seized on the cloth of
his vest and pushed the pocket inside out
from the bottom so that the contents fell
into the palm of her left gantlet

  mingled with the broken glass of the bot-
tle was a muddled mass of splintered match-
stumps and sodden heads

  must have done it in the fall quavered
jose still staring stupidly i felt your
snowshoe take me hard in the ribs when
we went down

  but blera did not heed

  she was kneeling again by the pile of
spruce branches scratching match-head af-
ter match-head

  none of them would light despite her
frantic and repeated trials in despair she
threw the sodden mass into the unlit pile of
twigs and turned again to cantine

  your colt jose she appealed rising
stiffly your colt you can start it with
a shot

  my colt cantine looked bewildered
the frost seemed to be deadening his senses
already my colt blera oh yes bas-
sett took it way back at happy camp

  good god screamed blera remember-
ing

  she threw out her arms weakly trying to
fight up circulation and a second time the
ruthless spirit of the wild came very close

  to her terrified eyes it seemed to leap
out of the darkness of the spruce a mate-
rial presence and mock her with a shout
that reverberated across the fireless land

  it rushed upon her she could hear the
crunch-crunch of its footsteps in the crust
its grip fell upon her shoulder and she
shrieked insanely

  steady missus steady soothed a
mumbling half-articulate voice

  and not till the spoken words smote on
her consciousness could she realize that the
material presence was a humble man then
she gave a little moan of relief and put out
a hand for jose to share in her discovery

  in the arctic gloom they could not see
the mans face at all but they gathered that

he had been disturbed at supper by their
cries for he was capless and coatless also
he held in his hand a generous slab of pilot-
bread and this it was which cramming his
mouth rendered his speech so inarticulate
wildly leading the race the bread in his
left hand and bleras frozen gantlet in his
right he hurtled them over the snows be-
tween the spruce trees and banged them
into his cabin doorway

  at their advent five wolf-dogs leaped up
snarling from their rest beside the stove

  lie down gurgled cantines and
bleras rescuer

  he kicked the dogs soundly in the ribs
till they retreated into the huge empty
wood-box that stood behind the stove

  i dont like the brutes inside he mum-
bled still wrestling convulsively to get rid
of the gagging pilot-bread but its a case
of have to keep them inside or get them
eaten whole tutchis village is full of sav-
age semi-wolves and they run the river in
a hunt-pack every night

  tutchis village exclaimed cantine
his teeth clicking incessantly as he whacked
the ice from his garments wheres it
moved to it was hunting sign of it we
fell in

  moved five miles up the klokhok
spluttered the other setting the stove-door
ajar to obtain a floor-streamer of light in
the gloomy cabin but you better strip
quick use that back room there to change
youll find a dunnage-bag full of clothes-
some of them womans things-under the
bunk while you throw them on ill rus-
tle more wood to stoke up the stove i
used all i had in to cook supper and you
can light the candle on the shelf there to
see by i was just getting up to reach for
it when i heard your yells

  gulping down the last of his pilot-bread
the owner of the cabin was gone while he
spoke

  cantine reached up to the shelf took off
the tallow candle stuck in a wide-necked
pickle-bottle reached a box of matches from
the same shelf and lighted the wick

  from force of habit he fingered up a small
bunch of matches out of the box and went
to shove them into his vest pocket

  wait jose wait cautioned blera
theyll be as bad as the others if you put
them there put them in the dry clothes
and after this dont trust a bottle any more
get one of those rubber match-safes with
 

adventure

the screw top and now for the dry clothes
i feel as if i can work my arms and legs
once more

  taking the candle from jose she moved
across the cabin toward the door of the
back room the yellow light flooding the
main room showed it to be built of the cus-
tomary spruce logs chinked with moss and
plastered with mud

  the floor was of rough-hewn slabs of
slabs too but a little better smoothed was
the rude table upon which supper was
spread the table stood under the window
which instead of glass for a light boasted a
square of golden-brown moose-skin rubbed
so smooth as to be almost transparent

  upon the opposite wall was a bunk also
formed of slabs the yukon stove stood at
the end and it with the wood-box behind
completed the furnishings of the cabin

  out of the empty wood-box the huskies
raised their heads and growled so ominously
at bleras and joses movements that the
two ran the last few steps across the floor and
shut the door of the back room with a bang

  the back room was but a logged-in an-
nex to the main room and without window
or door a bunk constituted its only fur-
nishing and it appeared to be used as a
store-room for grub-bags and odds and
ends were piled neatly in its corners

  blera set the candle on a pile of sacks
and ferreted out the dunnage-bag from un-
der the bunk its lashings were loose and
she tumbled the contents out on the floor
where each could pick what was needed

  the rapid run from the river to the cabin
and the genial atmosphere of the cabin it-
self had somewhat warmed their blood as
well as partly thawed their mail-like gar-
ments hastily they ripped off the clammy
parkas mackinaws and woolens and began
the process of replacing them with dry ones

  for the most part blera dressed like jose
in arctic underwear flannel shirt german
socks and moccasins but when it came to
outer garments she searched in the heart of
the disorderly pile on the floor for the wo-
mans things the owner of the cabin had
mentioned

  finally she fished them out a buckskin
waist and a mackinaw skirt with a pro-
nounced plaid pattern

  the waist went on like any waist but at
sight of the skirt bleras breath whistled in
her throat her face convulsed in an ap-
palling discovery she held the plaid mack-

inaw close to the candle examining the
band and the vent at the back

  whats wrong with it asked cantine
looking up from his own dressing lousy
jose its the same heres the band
leather sewn on to keep the sheath-knife
from wearing it and the hooks and eyes of
copper wire on the vent jose its my skirt

and hes-

  sark roared jose

  terror transformed can tines features
he wildly scanned the walls of the back
room for window or door but as he remem-
bered now there was no window or door

  blera were trapped he faltered with
a great revelation were trapped and
bassetts done it this is the trail his part-
ner was putting relay camps on the nor-
denskold trail the road down the middle
fork runs right here why in hades didnt
we watch where we were going

  blera unanswering held the mackinaw
skirt spread out in her hands she was
trembling from head to foot and her eyes
stared wide under the surge of emotion
jumbled emotion fear remorse anxiety
longing despair

  bassetts done it repeated jose
curse his bloody heart he knew where his
partner was he knew if he closed the yu-
kon against us wed have to travel the nor-
denskold i wish to blue brimstoned blazes
id been quicker with my colt that night
up at-but what in thunders the use of
raving he stopped short in his furious
passion we got to do something we
got to do it mighty sudden blera what in
tarnation can we do without dogs arms or
grub

   i dont know what we can do answered
blera breathing as if she were sobbing but
we got to get out of here put on dry par-
kas and draw the hoods close and beat it
maybe we can get out before he comes in
if we dont tell him-tell-him we got to
keep right on tell him your brothers sick
up in the miners range heres a bullet
knocking around in the dunnage-bag put
it in your mouth and itll help change your
voice some and for gods sake lets keep
our parka hoods drawn tight

blera dropped the plaid mack-
inaw skirt and contorting feverish-
ly they both donned parkas and
pulled open the door

  but as they stepped out into the main
the hunt-pack



room of the cabin the door of it rattled was
kicked back and both his arms full sark
staggered in with the wood

   instantly as before the five huskies leap-
ed viciously across the floor at jose and
blera

  sark let fall his load caught up a single
billet and belabored the beasts over the
heads

  down skookum down culuk he
yelled get to blazes behind the stove
he overcame their stubborn resistance and
hammered them into submission now
stay behind it you savages

  he turned apologetically to his guests

  but hold on he exclaimed noting the
drawn parka hoods which allowed only
their eyes to be seen youre not for hit-
ting the trail again tonight eh

  we got to twanged jose the bullet in
his mouth altering his voice and causing
him to enunciate through his nose we
got to get along on the jump my broth-
ers sick up in the miners range up on the
headwaters of the klokhok we got to
keep going tonight for i sent him word id
reach him tomorrow

  thunder exclaimed sark thats dif-
ferent and im sorry but you eat before
you travel you and your missus need solid
grub and steaming drink after yon bath i
was just taking the last bite myself
theres lots of pilot-bread and moose meat
and hot coffee on the stove dig in

  sark waved a hand toward the laden table

  blera who although the parka hood con-
cealed every part of her face but her eyes
could not forbear averting her head turned
slightly and took a sidelong glance at eric
sark as she viewed the familiar figure so
clear in the candlelight big of limb and of
chest blue-eyed granite-featured with the
raven-black in his beard and hair she had
an almost unconquerable desire to cry out
or to run

  yet she did neither

  she remained stone-still till her eyes en-
countered those of cantine and strayed with
them to the food upon the table

  after their days of hunger it was a great
temptation and they fell flight delayed
and still trusting to the masks of their parka
hoods they stretched out ravenous hands
and munched fiercely upon the bread and
meat and gulped the steaming coffee

  jose removed the bullet from his mouth
while he ate but both he and blera were

careful to sit backing the tallow-candle
which sark placed upon its shelf again so
that their faces were cast in gloom

  sark to maintain the part of host picked
up the remainder of the slab of pilot-bread
he had carried when he rescued them and
poured himself another cup of coffee

  what might your name be stranger
he asked

  blera started the piece of moose-shoulder
she was munching slipping to the floor

  karle lott coughed jose through the
drink he snatched

  mines eric sark

  dreading another personal question ble-
ra bent low by the table-edge to pick up the
meat

  but skookum the most cunning as well
as the most evil of the wolf-dogs had seen
it fall and stolen from behind the stove he
leaped as blera reached for it and losing it
by the fraction of a second slashed with his
chisel-sharp fangs at her face

  the fangs fell short of the flesh but met
in the parka hood and tore it from her head

  unmasked the woman sprang away from
the brute with a violent scream

  blera sarks vicious voice thundered
in the cabin

  swift as his wolf-dog he sprang up

  for a moment he stared at her as across
a gulf his blue eyes blazing then the light-
ning-fire of his glance struck her companion

  you can drop your hood too cantine

  with the ultimatum sarks fingers slid
back and seized the rifle lying in his bunk
on the wall for he looked to see a weapon
flash in cantines hand and guessed that
one of them had traveled his last trail

  but blera was upon him on the instant
pressing down the gun

  you cant harm us eric you cant
harm us she declared hysterically you
cant touch us here people youve broken
bread with under your own roof you know
thats the northland law

  again sark stared at her as across a gulf
and dropped the rifle on the bunk

  youre right he admitted slowly nod-
ding his head as if she had expounded some
all-powerful decree though laws arent
worth a siwash curse to you two they are
to me youre safe-for the night be-
cause now i savvy that brother in the mi-
ners range was only lyin bluff

  but look here sark whined jose


adventure

  stop right up id sure palaver with a
murdering sundowner id sure palaver
with a cannibal hoonah but i wont
palaver with you im telling you youre
safe under this roof out from under it you
take your chance ill give you an hours
clear start in the morning and then by
thunder look out for me now jump into
that back room quick the both of you
jump in i say for fear i forget ive broken
bread under my own roof with you

  the intensity of sarks passion heaved
and tore at his mighty chest and vibrated
in his smashing voice

  they did not want him to forget they
had the temporary saving grace of the night
hours much might perhaps be accomplish-
ed in those hours and with that idea in
their degenerate minds cantine and the
woman slunk into the logged-in annex and
shut the door

  as if he were already slamming lead into
cantines body sark slammed stick after
stick into the stove

  then although it was still early in the
evening he blew out the candle and threw
himself upon his bunk lying on hip and el-
bow resting his head on his hand and star-
ing like a graven image at the flame-dance
on the darkened walls of the cabin

  blera peering through a chink in the
back-room door watched him thus hour by
hour it was a strange and weary vigil but
on after midnight his head slipped down
from his hand

  jose she breathed hes asleep
nows our chance but we have to have
the rifle to make our get-away good then
you can stand him off ill take the gun
im lighter than you and the slab floors
awful creaky

  cautiously she slipped out of the back
room and as cautiously inch by inch edged
across the main room toward sarks bunk

  her figure as she crept was now lost in
shadow now etched out faintly by the leap-
ing flamelight she moved apparently with-
out stepping with the peculiar gliding grace
that is the inheritance of north-born people

  the irregularities of the slab floor seemed
to lose stability to become fluid and flow
under her feet like waves in a rapid not
once did her moccasined toes strike knot or
seam not once did the limber slabs shriek
as they bowed and sprung not once did
the sleeping huskies stir from their dreams
by the stove she reached the bunk and

her mobile fingers closed on the weapon

  sark faced outward as he slept

  the rifle lay on the blankets between his
back and the wall free of his touch except
where his shoe-packed foot curled over the
heel of the stock

  blera had the rifle by the barrel and
slowly with a motion so gentle as to be
scarcely perceptible she began to twist loose
the butt

  she had nearly succeeded when she saw
the twitching of muscles round sarks
closed eyes

  swiftly she released the weapon and with
a lithe swing of her body stretched herself
along the outer edge of the bunk her arms
were about sarks neck and her voice was
whispering in his ear when he half awoke

  eric she whispered hurriedly hyster-
ically ive come back-stolen out of there
while he slept we got to go away-to-
gether he was never-

  but sark awakened fully

  you cursed vampire he gritted get
off get away from me i dont want the
touch of your hands arent you seeing
youre poison and pollution to me

  he half arose on one knee roughly thrust-
ing her from the bunk and even as he re-
pulsed her the touch of her arms brought
the thrill of another day a day when his
hours had been full of dream and desire of
marvel and of miracle when blera had been
a splendor and a vision to him and lain in
honor by his side

  for a reeling moment he saw not this
woman who was poison and pollution to
him his eyes were fixed seer-like upon
the panels of those vanished days upon
the words and smiles and deeds and de-
lights of another woman tapestried in gold-
en story upon the snow-white curtain of
the north days before he had come into
the companionship of tom bassett and dis-
covered the love that passeth the love of
woman

  and that short moment of sarks unwari-
ness was his undoing and bleras oppor-
tunity right before his unseeing eyes her
swift hands grasped the rifle and like an-
other delilah turned philistine against her
samson she crashed the butt across his tem-
ple

  sarks face turned blank he quivered a
little poised on one knee and collapsed in
the bunk

  jose quick
the hunt-pack



  but she did not need to cry cantine
had seen from the chink in the back-room
door and run as she struck

  blera you didnt-

  no no only stunned and hes stir-
ring already be sharp get the dog-har-
ness down you brutes

  the awakened dogs had sprung up snarl-
ing but blera had a formidable weapon in
the rifle and she bludgeoned them on the
heads with the butt jose too sprang for
the long-lashed dog-whip coiled on pegs on
the wall and flayed them into subjection
now the harness quick jose

  still using the butt of his whip to keep
the victory already gained cantine threw
the harness on the ugly beasts and haled
them out into the piercing cold blera toss-
ed down the sled up - ended by the door
rapidly they traced in the huskies whining
resentfully at being lashed and dragged from
the warmth of the cabin out into a tem-
perature of fifty-five below and cast them-
selves on the sled

  mush roared cantine bringing down
the whip

  under the dreaded lash the shivering
team dashed down the bank and headed up
the ice of the klokhok the steel-shod sled-
runners shrieked a shrill tune the ice
boomed to their flying passage

  high in the heavens overhead flashed the
brilliant stars and the mid-winter aurora
there was in the hearts of blera and jose
no remorse no regret not even pity there
was only devilish recklessness and the sheer
exultation of escape continually they
urged on the dogs to greater speed lashing
them till skookum the leader flung up his
nose as he galloped and howled a protest

  and challenging skookums howl from
around the abrupt bend they were taking at
express-train speed broke the tumultuous
cry of many wolf-dogs on the arctic night

  as if suddenly revealed by a lightning
flash jose and blera glimpsed them right

ahead the murderous hunt-pack from tut-
chis village sweeping the river-ice one hun-
dred strong with one lone cross-fox strain-
ing from their jaws an instant they
glimpsed them then in the belly of the bend
fox team sled and hunt-pack collided in a
heap

  cantine had loosened his grip on the sled
to grasp the rifle in defense and the smash-
ing impact catapulted him clear into the
heart of the horde

  one moment blera watched him sink in
a sea of bristling fur and slavering fangs be-
fore she beheld the same sea surging upon
her the sea which was the concrete force
of the inimical wild strong sure more ruth-
less even than the persecuting bassett or
the avenging hand of eric sark

two weeks later tom bassett re-
turning from dawson city up the
nordenskold river and swinging
through the night down the klokhok river
to his partners cabin on the nordenskold
trail drove over a rattling heap of debris
at the first bend above the klokhoks
mouth curiously he swerved his sled back
to investigate and one brief look before he
whipped on showed the remnants of a bro-
ken sled mingled with gnawed husky and
human bones glistening white under a rising
moon

  he whipped on fast and burst into the
cabin upon sark who with a bandage over
a deep cut on his temple was forking bacon
from a frying-pan on the stove on to a plate

  eric tom greeted with a tremor of re-
lief in his voice i struck somethin up-
river and i wasnt-well sure you know

  ive had visitors since you left replied
sark grimly

  eh bassett put out a sympathetic
hand but eric you didnt-

  no returned his partner gripping the
extended hand the hunt-pack saved me
the trouble sit in and have supper
foreword

outh of the clustering legean
isles half-way between greece
and the rich asiatic shore the
island of crete lies in the bosom
of the mediterranean egypt is far to the
southeast of it glorious in memories and
still the huge temples of the pharaohs lay
their mysterious enchantment on the minds
of men

  it was but yesterday that british genius
uncovered in the land of minos the fossil
bones of an empire mighty as that of the
osirian kings and richer than nile-girdled
thebes could boast unknown and un-
dreamed of till our own day the enormous
foundations of cretan knossos speak of a
civilization of centuries founded not on
legions and on conquest but on trade and
the might of invincible navies mycenas
was its colony troy its dependent

  over the broken relics of its majesty
tongues of fire have written a script which
we can read but imperfectly who burned
these royal cities these kingly treasure-
houses what daring conquerors crushed
the swarming fleets and descended with
tempestuous swiftness on the fair abodes
no man knows but this much is certain

  the destroyers were sea-farers with ships
  well-manned and numerous for no danger
  could threaten crete until the galleys which
  were her strength had been swept from the
  mediterranean

    far away in the north of europe mer-
  chants of another race brought rich cargoes
  into the ports of the north sea and the
  baltic and carried on their traffic overland
  through russia to greece and the eastern
  world centuries before the vikings made
  their fierce raids on the southern coasts
  they too were skilled mariners and terrible
  fighters masters of the sea

    in these daring seamen of southern scan-
  dinavia the authors have seen possible
  rivals and enemies of crete the fleets of
  minos could not have endured the competi-
  tion of other powerful traders and the
  northmen were ever ready to fight for the
  goodly markets of the world it might even
  be that these the forefathers of the men of
  wisby throndheim and bergen met and
  received rebuffs from the cretan lords of the
  mediterranean it may be that the stout
  ships of the north gathered swept down on
  the painted galleys of minos and emptied
  their raging swordsmen on the cretan coast
  
in the grip of the minotaur



  however this may be somehow at the
height of their beautiful cruel culture the
fair palaces of knossos and phasstos were
suddenly sacked and burned with them
the glory of the mediterranean departed
the strong hand of the minoan king re-
laxed the civilization of the south disinte-
grated and for ages to come darkness lay
over the lands until the light of corinth
sparta and athens dispelled its barbaric
gloom

  but still the memory of this marvelous
land haunted the mediterranean world

long after the grecian traveler herodotus
learned from egyptian priests of a myste-
rious kingdom in the sea founded by the
gods and destroyed by an unparalleled
catastrophe

  magnified by repetition during the cen-
turies the priestly tale told of a vast land
peopled by a race supemally wise and rich
beyond conception even to our own days
the legend has lingered and mens imagina-
tions still stir at the mention of the vanished
children of the gods in the land of lost
atlantis

chapter i

the gray wolf comes

round the sharp elbow of the little
bay shot a long gray hull urged by
the brisk wind in her swelling canvas and
the sturdy arms of forty rowers as the
wolfs head on her stem-post swung its
gaping blood-red jaws round in a half-
circle the single square sail spilled the wind
flapped idly and was quickly lowered and
stowed away for the keelless northern
galley of  b c could not tack

  the voice of the shore-watch rang out
sharply through his cupped hands in the
hybrid patois of the mediterranean traders

  who are ye who float hither with wolf-
painted sail and wolf on your prow whence
come ye is your errand peace or war
two tall figures rose from the ships belly
and mounted the little half-deck forward
where steadying himself against the
shrouds one roared reply

  we are northmen come from afar we
are no sea-thieves but honest traders
bringing amber from our own shores and tin
from the isle of mines to troy town-fair
he who stands by me is our master-rag-
narr son of sigmund king of the island
goths if we are welcome speak if not
we go hence as we came

  as the shoreward wind bore the words to
him the coast-guard raised a horn to his
lips and blew it twice out of the tower
behind him came a file of armed men who
ranged themselves in a close line along the
short beach but as the lashing oars
brought the galley closer in the shore-
watch cried

  ye are welcome and may the peace ye
bring be with you

  the rowers drew in their dripping blades
the heavy stone anchor rumbled over the
side and two boats were launched in quick
succession into the first clambered the
tall figures of captain and spokesman fol-
lowed by six rowers the second andlarger
boat was quickly filled with small bales
handed over the side their bulk wrapped in
stout woolen cloth bound with ropes of
bast

  when these were stowed the boat was
manned by eight sailors each detaching a
shield from the ships gunwale as he came
and slinging it over his left shoulder by a
leathern thong shoving off swiftly the
seamen propelled the boats shoreward till
they grounded and the two leaders leaped
down to the beach

  the spokesman was a vast hulk of a man
with a chest like a rampart long knotted
arms and fierce wise old eyes a bushy
red beard slightly tinged with gray hung
down in two forks over his breast

  he who was called ragnarr was a hand-
breadth taller but slenderer with the agile
grace of youth like all his race he was
fair and his blond hair streamed down over
his shoulders wide piercing eyes gazed
from a well-tanned face cheeks smooth
save for a white scar reaching from nose to
chin and only partly obscured by a long
yellow mustache a great sword hung in a
gold-mounted scabbard of leather at his
side and in his right hand he carried a long
bronze-headed spear all the strangers
wore plain bronze helmets coarse woolen
shirts and tunics and strips of the same
material wound about their lower legs down
to the soft-leather shoes

  but the shrewd-eyed coast-watch needed
no fine clothes to tell him who was in com-
mand and how to address him


adventure

  prince ragnarr he said in deferential
tones all who come here with peaceful
thoughts are welcome for our people are
eager for honest wares but none may
enter the grounds of the fair till he has left
his weapons either in his ship or at the
temple of the mother i tell you this now
that you may not unwittingly break the
laws of the land

  it is a good law answered ragnarr
 and one that i know of old for it is ob-
served at fair-times in our land also but
can our wares be boated up this river or must
my men carry them for they are heavy
he pointed to the wide scamander
which flowing down through the fertile
plain girding the new-built city of troy
entered the harbor not a hundred yards
from the wolf-ships mooring

  the current is strong but men like
yours should find it easy answered the
shore-watch looking up with admiration at
the towering northmen i am kamas
captain of the shore and i will go with you
myself our king will wish to see such
heroes for doubtless you have strange tales
to tell of the wide sea and of the far-away
land whence you come

  with an inclination of his head ragnarr
again entered his boat followed by valgard
and the trojan who delegated his charge
to a younger officer just before the skiff
was pushed off one of the northmen
stepped out quietly and walked along the
shore toward the ship holding something
under his mantle

  seated together in the boat the trojan
contrasted strangely enough with the blue-
eyed giants from the north he was short
dark and clean-shaven like almost all his
race wiry and athletic with broad shoul-
ders and a slender waist outlined by the
soft girt-in tunic his black hair curled
down below the edges of his red-plumed
helmet and his eyes were long prominent
and heavily lashed unlike ragnarr as he
was he was even more unlike the massive
and ruddy valgard whose face was as
fierce and keen as that of the war-god of
his race

they rowed on silently for a
space till their boat the foremost
of the two rounded a curve of the
river and the undergrowth which had lined
the bank was left behind then as if a
curtain had been thrust aside they saw a

fair green plain above which reddened
with the last rays of the setting sun the
great citadel of troy rose from the massive
walls that crowned and girdled its sus-
taining hill

  the northmen raised an astonished cry
ragnarr turning to the captain said in an
awe-struck voice

  cities have i seen and strongholds in
many lands but never did i see or hear men
tell of such an abode as this your king
must be greater than all other earthly
rulers for surely the home of the gods must
be like this city

  kamas smiled but made no answer
after his own first involuntary exclamation
valgard strove mightily to appear unim-
pressed he was older than ragnarrs
father and had not traveled for nothing

  now they came to a stone quay and
kamas bade them disembark

  your goods will be safe enough here he
said for none but the kings household
use this landing and it is well guarded

  he spoke truly no sooner had the first
sailors set foot on the stone steps than a file
of spearmen appeared and ordered them to
stand but at a sign from kamas their
officer bowed and led off his men as quickly
as they had come

  it was now dark and as they took the
paved road leading up from the water
lights flashed out in all parts of the city
outlined against the glow a huge wall
loomed like a cliff before them no cressets
flared on the parapet no lighted loopholes
starred the black bulk of tower and curtain
and bastion nor was there the slightest
sign of gate or gateway when the northmen
came unchallenged to the end of the paved
way only the solid wall

  then kamas turned to the left and led
them along the foot of the wall which
after a score of paces came to an end a
turn to the right four paces inward a turn
to the right again and the northmen found
themselves following their guide down an
alley barely wide enough for two armed
men or a loaded pack-horse with the wall on
either hand

  suddenly the darkness before them
changed to a yellow glare of torchlight out-
lining blackly the stout bars of a metal
grating barring the way at the same time
a stir and rustle above and to the right
drew ragnarrs dazzled eyes upward to the
platform of the outer wall there the glint
in the grip of the minotaur



of helmets and arrow-heads told how ready
were the trojan archery to riddle the un-
shielded sides of the northmen packed
helpless in the brightly lit alley below

  well trapped growled valgard appre-
ciatively as he tried to shift his broad
shield to his right arm without letting go
of his long spear

  but kamas spoke a word in the trojan
tongue the grating was swung wide by
unseen hands and they passed round the
angle of the inner wall and entered the city

  to the left a broad street opened out
before them to the right rose a tall white
temple

  here you must leave your weapons
said kamas for this is the temple of the
mother i myself shall see to it that your
arms are safe prince ragnarr and in
particular that mighty sword which must
be the gift of some god

  but ragnarr answered

  look more closely friend kamas and
you will see that my scabbard is empty
i do not doubt your good faith but that
sword is indeed the gift of a god who im-
posed on my race his descendants the
command that the blade should never
leave our kindred even for a moment
otherwise our house and people should
perish i left it behind therefore with my
foster-brother whom i ordered to quit the
last boat when you told us of your custom
as we pulled up-stream i saw my men row
out from the ship and take him back to it
carrying the sword with him

  it is wise to obey the commands of the
gods said kamas but you could have
trusted me my prince

  so saying he led on through a narrow
thoroughfare past the face of the temple
till they came to its entrance a broad
stairway led up to a brilliantly lighted en-
trance flanked by pikemen drawn up on
either side of the stairs and archers at the
top

  through this doorway they passed into
a broad court flagged with great close-
fitting slabs of polished stone iron rings
set into some of these hinted at trap-doors
leading to vaults below

  the temple lighted so well without was
dark within a solitary torch gleamed at
the very back of the single court which
formed the interior and shone full on the
face of a great statue of bronze repre-
senting a tall and majestic woman clad in

sweeping robes but bare-bosomed a
mitered crown adorned her head and her
eyes were two great amethysts

  kamas prostrated himself and the north-
men followed his example valgard mutter-
ing that it was well to placate the gods of a
country where one hoped to tarry safely
but that he called his own gods to witness
that it was no derogation of their majesty

  arising kamas pointed to the low and
broad stone altar before the goddess its
outlines barely visible in the gloom on
which lay many faintly glimmering objects

  these are the arms of the common mer-
chants he said but yours shall be
better cared for

  stooping he pressed one of the stones in
the side of the altar it turned on its cen-
ter revealing a cavernous opening

  i pray you let your men lay their
weapons here he said and ragnarr spoke
a few words of command in his native tongue

  readily the sailors complied after which
kamas led them out through the great en-
trance and down the road back of the city
wall to the broad street which led to the
citadel from the western gate this street
was full of trojans taking the air and wait-
ing till their houses heated like ovens by
the long days sun became cool enough to
sleep in here in the lower wards fish were
being roasted over street-corner fires and
sold by the skewerful while circles of
thirsty ones squatted round the tubs of
crude beer which they were sucking through
straws to avoid the loose barley floating on
the surface

  longingly looked the seamen at the food
and drink and exchanged appreciative
glances with the dark-eyed women who
mingled freely with the crowd but not a
man of ragnarrs crew lingered behind for
they knew their captain

  here said kamas stopping before a
large dwelling that seemed dark and empty
is a guest-house where your men must
remain till morning for at night no stran-
gers are permitted nearer the citadel

  the place was a low one-story stone
building with a deeply recessed doorway
kamas took a torch from a niche in the
recess lit it at the flare of the nearest door-
light unlocked the wooden door of the
guest-house with a bronze key and all
entered here was a single large room
with a door in the rear leading to an ante-
chamber

adventure

  kindling the torches stuck in brackets
about the walls kamas pointed to the
numerous stools and mats ranged about the
floor and then stepped to a sunken closet
in the wall holding his torch before it he
showed fruit bread and wine-jars to the
staring sailors then turned toward the
door

  if it please you my prince he said to
ragnarr it is time to wait on the king
here valgard interrupted

  i have traveled far and wide o kamas
he said in angry tones but never yet have
i the spokesman and kinsman of my
prince been forbidden to go where he goes
nor will i begin at my age to learn new
customs

  but ragnarr interposed

 strong men can break customs but
only the weak break discipline if you go
with me who will keep these and he
pointed at his men who were wrenching the
plugs from the wine-jars from drowning
their sea-thirst with half the ale in troy
you speak wisdom where kamas spake
folly answered valgard turning on his
heel

  take no notice of his bears manners
said ragnarr to the captain as they left
the house he growls at all times and is
silent only when he bites he loves me
well and would keep by me at all times
they continued their way in the same
direction following the street up a steep
slope cut at intervals by broad concentric
avenues dug out of the hill itself and faced
with polished stones the spaces between
these avenues formed terraces covered with
buildings the richer of stone the poorer of
sun-baked brick

  at every street corner the two encoun-
tered the same dense crowd of people come
out to enjoy the cool night-air after the
stifling day all who met the pair stared
open-mouthed at ragnarrs tall barbaric
figure

  all at once as they were elbowing their
way through the thronged intersection of
the street with one of the avenues an ap-
proaching voice cried out in a high-pitched
nasal chant the crowds divided to right
and left squeezing as close as they could to
the walls of the buildings on either side and
all tongues were silent even in the midst of
speech

  then was heard the sound of pattering
feet and round the curve of the avenue

came two half-naked runners carrying
wands of office they were followed by an
open litter borne by four brawny blacks
clad in leopard-skin kirtles

  like sheaves bending in the wind the
long dense lines of the multitude sank to
their knees in one motion the rustle of
their garments drowning out the foot-beat
of the runners kamas knelt with the rest
but ragnarr gazing at the litter in frank
curiosity suddenly saw a vision that caused
him to stand as still as the heart in his own
breast

  the light from the torch on the house-
corner behind him fell full on the face of
the occupant of the passing litter so that
it was outlined against the dark like a
cameo it was the face of a young girl her
profile clear well-shaped and of exquisite
beauty

  for a moment ragnarr stood immovable
his eyes fastened on that face till it grew
dim and faded out from the rays of light
then he became aware that all the people
had risen and kamas was plucking him by
the sleeve he turned to follow then
stopped again and asked his guide

  who is she who passed but now whose
beauty made all the people bow before her
is she a goddess

  kamas looked up at him curiously and
answered with a shade of amusement in his
voice

  it is ilia daughter of dardanus our
king and the people bowed before her
royalty

  ragnarr moved slowly forward his eyes
rapt his lips murmuring softly ilia
ilia

ilia

soft-footed attendants bore away
the empty dishes and returning filled
the slender cups with the amber wine of
sidon then the white-haired king his
shrewd old face alight with interest turned
to the grave-featured youth at his right
and said

  it is indeed a wondrous tale prince
ragnarr i have seen men of your race
who had come by the overland road show-
ing their wares at the market in mycenae
but their ships have never before ventured
the long voyage to our seas and you say
in the grip of the minotaur

ioi

that your people have many such ships
in our land o king answered the
northman every village furnishes a galley
every district a host to my fathers ven-
tures in peace and war we could muster
two hundred ships on our island and can
draw as many more at need from our allies
on the mainland

  the king pondered this statement a mo-
ment then turned again to his guest and
said with a courteous gesture we have
wearied you with our curiosity let us
go if you please to my apartments

  at once he rose and all at the table stood
up bowed their heads and remained stand-
ing till the king and the stranger he had
honored had passed from the columned
hall at the door the two sentries drew
aside and raised their shields in salute

  the king preceded ragnarr down a long
corridor to a curtained entrance through
which they passed together ragnarr then
found himself in a stately chamber paneled
and roofed with cedar the ceiling being
supported by graceful shafts of the same
wood seating himself on a richly carved
armchair of egyptian workmanship the
king waved his guest to a divan opposite
where the light of a perfumed torch fell
full on his face

  i have dangerous neighbors king
dardanus began picking his words slowly
certain matters make it inadvisable for
me to tell their names but they have been
troublesome ever since it seemed good to
me that our power should expand i built
new walls for my city and they bribed the
contractors to furnish poor stone i in-
creased the size of my armies and they-
well they interfered with my supply of
metal for the mines are in their hands
if i could find a strong determined man
with some force at his back it might be
profitable to him

  here he paused and looked at ragnarr
keenly the young man was listening
with grave interest but his features showed
nothing more

  the man for my purpose must be a
merchant with an eye for good weapons
continued dardanus speaking with slow
emphasis his ears must be open and
his lips shut he must sail to and fro be-
tween here and-certain ports with car-
goes of whatsoever i may specify and must
carry large sums in gold and silver to pay
for the things which i require naturally

he must be prepared both to resist pirates
and repel the curious

  still ragnarr made no sign and the king
spoke on

  the rewards would be far greater than
the income of the richest trader to com-
pensate for the lack of fame and safety in
the enterprise for of course my name and
that of my city could not be brought into
the matter

  as the-young man was still silent the
king cleared his throat and began again

  if you know such a man i should be
most grateful if you would bring him to me
especially if he were one of your race you
are silent and strong and such must my

servants be in the meantime-

  he broke off and stared at the curtain
ragnarrs eyes followed his gaze and saw a
dainty white hand on the fold next in-
stant the curtain was thrust aside and a
lithe supple form stood before them it
was a girl of some seventeen or eighteen
years her white garments clinging to her
shapely figure her black hair streaming
down about her hips

  her beautifully rounded arms were bare
to the elbow her complexion was much
lighter than that of most of her people
the features small and daintily molded
the chin rounded and dimpled but firm
and strong her great brown eyes were
fringed with sweeping lashes and the red
of her lips showed even in the half-light
as her glance fell on ragnarr she stopped
eyes opened in surprise and her face
flushed to the pink of a persian rose

  forgive me father she said in soft
sweet tones i believed you were alone
but she made no move to go and her
eyes were fixed on ragnarr who had risen
and stood riveted to the floor staring in
mute astonishment his breast heaved and
his face showed both admiration and won-
dering recognition the king made a
gesture of resignation

  remain my daughter he answered
this is my honored guest and i hope my
friend prince ragnarr heir to a great and
powerful kingdom in the distant north
lord ragnarr this heedless child is the
princess ilia whom the gods gave me last
of all my children it is a pretty lass but
somewhat wilful

  the princess advanced a step her hand
held out in greeting

  my fathers friends are ever welcome


adventure

to me she said ragnarr strode forward
his face red with embarrassment bent over
the small hand and kissed it but found no
words neither seemed able to look away
from the other the girl surveying his mighty
stature and clear handsome features the
mans worshiping gaze fixed on the beauty
of her face king dardanus took in the
situation with shrewd twinkling eyes

  ilia turned to the king still glancing
covertly at the northman from the corners
of her long-fringed eyes

  i shall wait on you in my mothers
chamber my father she said and with
one swift last look at the stalwart north-
man vanished behind the curtains

  ragnarr drew a long breath and swift
resolve was written on his face

  one who seeks such a man as your
majesty has described he said would
find a faithful servant in me

chapter iii

troy fair

oixes again my luck holds lads the

   dapper little gambler from mycena
deftly palming the dice substituted two
others which he shoved over to one of
his opponents these were raw-boned
sheepskin-clad lumbermen from the euxine
camps who had come to the troad with
timber floated down the straits as their
speech showed their race was closely akin
to that of ragnarr and his northmen

  one of the pair sullenly untwisted the
coil of silver from his upper arm and threw
it down in front of the mycenaean it
was clear that he had no more to lose as
he rose however the wine-shop door burst
open and in stalked a long line of his fel-
lows one after the other

  the foremost took in the situation at a
glance

  plucked bikki he roared out in a
voice already mellow sit down again
you oaf and play till you strip him of silver
earrings and shirt

  bikki spread out his hands indicating
the completeness of his defeat

  but we have more lad cried the new-
comer clinking a sack of silver counters
which unalloyed and unstamped formed
the ready money of the land he has
had all our skins from here to cyprus but
we have him now and he shall pay

  so saying he dumped the contents of
the sack out on to the floor in front of bikki
then stepped behind him and leaned against
the wall his fellows grouped themselves
around him and watched with intense
absorption

  counter after counter found its way into
the pouch of the clever sharper and anger
and discontent settled down on the lumber-
mens faces they were too wrapt up in
their own gloom to heed the lively passages
between the syrian with the gaudy head-
band and the one-eyed sicilian vender of
clay figures who were indulging in satirical
personal comments intended for the ears
of the blowzy barmaid she smiled at
each impartially then turned to wink at a
tall sailor who immediately ordered a
pitcher of the finest wine

  suddenly an inarticulate roar arose from
a near-by bench which encircled a large
beer-cask with its curving ends

  you have said enough you filthy naked
swine cried a mighty-shouldered north-
man thrusting one ham-like fist close to
the nose of a smiling egyptian you
have heaped on me ill names you have
called my people fleabitten barbarians and
i answered you with pleasant jests but
when you dare to revile my lord ragnarr
calling him timber for your beggarly pha-
raohs footstool you try a patient man too
far what deeds has this pharaoh done
that you rate him so highly

  you shall hear answered the egyptian
and drawing from its case a five-stringed
instrument of harp-like shape he placed
its side against his olive-colored body and
struck it resonantly

  hark to the deeds of the godlike amen-
othes he sang hark how he whelmed
the peoples in battle how he ate up the
children of the distant lands

  a wild stirring chant it was its minor
melody weaving in and out with varied
phrase the strophes interspersed with the
repeated refrain-

  he smiteth them with his crescent ax
his glittering moon-shaped ax

  with a swift blow the northman dashed
the instrument from the singers hands
the strings shattering with a vibrant wail

this is enough of axes he cried his
eyes shining with the light of battle be
silent and hear a man sing of a sword
swelling his deep chest he opened his
mouth and in a crashing voice that made
in the grip of the minotaur

the wine-cups rattle on their racks he sang
the war-song of his house

        the song of the sword

                tyr

         the swift surging death-flare

         the bright flame of battle

        the war-god hath forged it

        ages uncounted

         ere earth was shapen

        hammered and hardened it

         in its hot metal
         bound the strife-demon

         breathed his grim anger

         with cunning he shaped it

        with curses envenomed

         whoso shall wield it
         neer shall be conquered

         death shall go with him

         follow him drive him
         to riches and conquest

         to glory and ruin

          neer shall he fall

          till fate shall beguile him

        then the wild demon

         walled in its edges

         shall wrench from his hand-clasp
         and rend him asunder

                tyr

        the smith immortal
        the gray sword hath given
        in the fulness of time
        to his son the first tyrfing

         far oer all earth-realms
         his fame spread unbounded

         the sword in his strong hand
         swept all folk before him

         till heaped with honors

          in the height of his glory

        it wrenched from his hand
        and rent him asunder 

                tyr

         from father to son

         it hath passed as fate doomed it

          and shall till the anger
          of tyr be averted

         now a hero holds it
         hardiest of earth-folk

         brave in adventuring

         matchless in battle

          neer shall he falter

         nor fail of conquest

         while blade cleaves to handle

         while blood dyes the edges

         while gray sword slayeth

        and gray wolf devoureth

         his fame shall soar upward
         as soars the swift eagle

         and shelter the peoples
         neath the shade of his pinions

         this is the sword-song

         the song of our people

        the song of the gray sword

        the song he hath taught us-

                tyr

the harsh northern words meant noth-
ing to many of his listeners but a shout



went up from the lumbermen bikki his
throw made raised shining eyes to the
bard and followed the final words of the
song with a tyr that made the rafters
ring then looking down he echoed this
with a cry of anger and seizing the my-
cenaean by the hand pressed the knuckles
with his broad thumb till the gamblers
lips were compressed with pain his fingers
unclinched and a second pair of dice clat-
tered on to the table still holding his
mans hand in a grip like the pinch of a
half-split log bikki whipped out his knife
and cut through a die near the top reveal-
ing a little disk of lead

  a savage prolonged hiss shot from the
lumbermens lips and they crowded about
the two muttering ominously three vil-
lainous-looking fellows stole out of the
darkest corner drawing crooked knives
from their garments

  as the tavern-keeper rushed up and flung
his arms around bikkis neck the foremost
of the three slipped behind bikki with
ready blade but a red-haired lumberman
seized the ruffians arm and flung him to
the pavement in the confusion that fol-
lowed the gambler freed himself and crept
snake-like toward the door

  bikki wrenched himself free from the
encircling arms of the landlord and rushed
after the mycentean only to trip over a
stool and knock himself senseless against
the raised stone threshold across which
his adversary had just disappeared the
other lumbermen looked at each other in
bewildered amazement their slow-working
brains befuddled with wine and dazed by
the swiftness of events

  at that moment the excited bard still
tingling with the cadences of his barbaric
song flung back his head and chanted the
last strophe once more and the lumbermen
swayed their bodies in drunken abandon
to the rhythm as the word tyr burst
from the singers lips a frenzied light kin-
dled in their eyes with a loud shout of
tyr tyr kill kill they burst through
the tavern door and swept down the main
street of the fair-grounds leaving behind
them a broad trail of overturned booths
torn fabrics smashed pottery spilled sweet-
meats and rolling fruit

  before them bolted shopkeepers and
customers on panic-winged feet tearing
down the sail-cloths that sheltered the
booths from the sun pulling up the long


adventure

wooden tent-pins and aiming blows with
them at everything breakable human or
otherwise that came within arm-sweep
the frenzied lumberjacks cleared the street
soon not a single figure could be seen for
rods in front of them while behind them
stretched a broad avenue of desolation
roaring their fierce chant of tyr tyr
kill kill they bore down on the crowded
center of the fair-grounds

groans hisses and catcalls rose
from the tight-packed crowd in
front of the wooden scaffold the
discomfited jugglers hastily retired into the
cloth shelter at the back fearing more
tangible evidence of the disapproval of
their audience at last an articulate voice
rang out above the general tumult and the
entire multitude took up the cry in eager
insistent unison

  rala give us rala we want rala
rala rala

  for several minutes the clamor swelled
then came a gaping expectant silence
the curtain of the tent had stirred now
a wild prolonged cheer went up as the
lissom figure of a girl bounded to the very
edge of the platform and stood there bow-
ing and throwing kisses she was small
almost to tininess and her supple pliant
form was perfectly revealed by her pro-
fessional costume-a narrow cloth about
the loins and a tight cap enclosing the
hair

  when the tumult had died down an
assistant came out carrying a long sword
from his sleeve he drew a feather tossed
it into the air and held the blade beneath
it the plume floated down across the
edge and without a perceptible check con-
tinued its fluttering course in two pieces
then he raised the sword swung it round
his head twice and made a lightning-like
stroke at rala the crowd shuddered
but rala poised on tiptoe lightly turned
a complete back-somersault landing up-
right at the extreme back of the stage a
sigh of relief escaped from the audience
followed by a crash of applause

  now a second man emerged from the
tent his well-muscled body rippling with
every movement he advanced to the
front and stood still feet together and arms
out horizontally from his sides rala
with a single bound landed on his shoul-
ders stood there balancing a moment and

stooped till her hands rested in front of her
feet then slowly and carefully her head
resting on his she swung her feet backward
and upward till they pointed skyward
her arms moved down and out at her sides
paralleling those of her partner and her
legs bowed out from her jointed feet till
they formed an ellipse man and woman
together formed a complete and nearly
perfect crux ansata

  on her feet once more rala began an
intricate and dangerous sword-dance tread-
ing the measures with her hands her body
poised in the air above the dangerous
blades suddenly there was a craning of
necks cries of alarm were heard and the
crowd began to melt in a few minutes it
was quite dispersed men women and chil-
dren fleeing in a dozen directions

  her two assistants scrambled down to
investigate then ran away swiftly think-
ing only of themselves still rala danced
on absorbed in the joy of the skilled
artist she had not once looked at the au-
dience had interpreted their cries of alarm
as expressions of fear for the dangers of
her performance and was quite unaware
that she was alone one two more mo-
tions of the deft hands and she hurled her
body over the blades lighting squarely on
her feet in front of-emptiness

  there she stood arms wide for her bow
and noticed for the first time that her au-
dience had disappeared a cry of bitter
disappointment burst from her she stood
looking out over the desolate place with
eyes in which tears of anger and mortifica-
tion burned then and not till then her
ears caught the sound of many feet and of
rough threatening voices

  fear came into her eyes she leaped
down to the street and fell rose staggered
and fell again with a sob of agony as an
intolerable pain shot through her ankle
vainly she strove to rise the shouts of the
approaching mob ringing in her ears

  then they burst upon her a surging line
of sheepskin-clad giants armed with long
tent - pins the foremost lumberman
whooping with triumph stooped passed
an arm round her struggling body and
lifted her to his breast

  her lithe limbs writhed and the muscles
stood out on her well-trained arms like
lashing cords in vain the mighty clasp
of the savage that held her did not weaken
in desperation she sank her teeth into his
in the grip of the minotaur



bare neck with a harsh oath he dropped
her and clapped his hand to the wound

  as she fell another lunged at her and
swung her to him she struck him in the
face with her clinched fists then blackness
closed in upon her

ragnarr stood in front of his
booth the covering of which was the
wolf-painted sail of his galley on
either hand the wrappings of the now-
opened bales were stretched over oars to
make two more tents in one of which his
men displayed pieces of red white or golden
amber in the other ingots of pure tin

  the trojan officer of police beside him
had just said something highly amusing
at which the young northman threw back
his head with a shout of laughter sud-
denly he started and listened with straining
ears his hand clutching the officers arm

  it is trouble of some sort he said
there are many of them by the voices
you will need men at your back

  the officer whose city-bred ears were
less keen stood listening for a moment
then exclaimed-

  you are right i go

  and go he did at a swift pace

  out of the tent came the grim figure of
valgard

  well master he exclaimed the
wind brings the sound of battle and where
there is fighting the wolves must follow
here come sheep answered ragnarr
contemptuously as a knot of traders and
mountebanks came rushing round the cor-
ner their faces sallow with fright

  run for your lives gasped a fat tyrian
as he panted past ten shipfuls of euxine
pirates are harrying the fair

  i hear no clatter of sword on shield
said ragnarr calmly it is no battle but
a fair-time brawl still do you tyrleif
keep the men together and guard the booths
while valgard and i go to look at these
peace-breakers

  swiftly the two northmen strode to the
street-corner round which poured an ever-
thickening stream of fugitives who swerved
to right and left to let them pass they
turned the corner and saw dust rising and
tents going down some fifty paces up the
main street before the onrush of a mob of
skin-clad men waving long clubs

  wait master said valgard we
can not meet those lads unarmed

  see what that tall fellow is carrying
answered ragnarr hasten

  up the street he dashed and valgard
willy-nilly after him the advancing mob
saw two unarmed men speeding toward
them hesitated and stopped in surprise
ragnarr strode straight to the man who
carried rala seized him by the arm and
roughly commanded him to put her down
the lumberman stared at him stupidly for
a moment then realizing the import of his
words cursed him violently and tried to pass

  with one upward swing of his fist rag-
narr sent the giant spinning and wrenched
rala from his relaxing grasp swinging
her to his shoulder he started to give back
but with shouts of rage the mob pressed in
upon him shouting kill kill

  ragnarr had but one arm free to defend
himself and his burden and it would have
gone hard with him but for valgard to
right and left shot the veterans great knot-
ted fists and two men fell as if poleaxed

  seizing a stake from the hand of one of
them valgard placed himself beside his
master and struck out with fury his
terrific blows never missed and those in
front began to give way but the two
northmen were outflanked and a club
came down from the left striking for rag-
narrs head he threw up his free hand
to ward off the blow which fell on his heavy
spiral armlet shattering it to pieces but
it had checked the force of the blow or his
arm had been broken

  hitting his man under the chin with all
the strength of his arm ragnarr gave back
as fast as he could he stumbled turned
and felt his back fetch up against some-
thing solid it was the scaffolding of ralas
platform now he was safe on one side
at least

  valgard pressed close to him striking
rapidly and coolly some one in the rear
threw a stake which thudded against the
wood beside ragnarrs head

  they have us now said valgard
through his clinched teeth

  above the tumult sang a strident sound
half hum and half hiss and one of the lum-
bermen pitched forward arms outstretched
with an arrow between his shoulder-blades
the sound came again more loudly and
three others fell then with a shout a
detachment of the soldiery who policed the
fair charged in with drawn swords cries
of pain mingled with yells of fury
io

adventure

  the mob made a short stand then turned
and fled in panic but many were overtaken
in mid-flight by the swift arrows in five
minutes the place was clear save for the
dead and dying who were picked up and
carried off by the soldiers

  are you unhurt my lord asked the
officer-the same with whom ragnarr had
been talking when he first heard the uproar

  i am well but this maid seems some-
what injured answered ragnarr bending
solicitously over rala

  it is nothing but a contortionist said
the officer who makes sport for the rabble
on street-corners it is not possible that
my lord risked his life for such as she
sir replied ragnarr his cheeks flushed
with anger in my land a woman is a wo-
man and men are willing to die for her
whether she be a peasants girl or a kings
daughter you have done your work well
and i shall mention it to your royal master
now leave us for we have work to do

  he carried the girl to his booth laid her
under the shade of the sail and bathed her
temples and her swollen ankle with wine
her eyes opened she looked up at him
with tears streaming down her cheeks

  i had fainted she said but when i
awoke you were holding me in your arms
and fighting i heard what the soldier
said and it is true you should not have
risked your life for me but it was noble
and i thank you-i thank you

  hush child answered ragnarr you
are hurt and overwrought and must not
talk till you are stronger

  he drew his gray mantle over her for
the evening breeze had sprung up and it
was cold

  i have poor quarters to offer you but
here you must stay till your ankle is well
again and you can walk

  lord she replied with a sob you
have done me the first kindness i have ever
known and i shall never leave you while

chapter iv

the compact

 are you sure he is safe he was not
     hurt

  quite sure princess a little thing
she was and no great burden for him
and is she beautiful

  as women of her sort are beautiful
her face seemed a good one though she
was not clothed as a modest girl should be
the two women stood in the northeast
tower of the citadel overlooking the little
plain between the rolling simois and the
scamander the sun was not yet high
enough to drive them to seek shelter from
its heat and it was pleasant to look out
over the lovely valley and the low hills
beyond to where the straits broadened out
into the blue gean ilia stood silent for
a moment wrapped in anxious thought

  i must see him she said slowly has
he reported the matter to the king

  not yet answered the attendant
but i heard acharsis the captain of ar-
chers say that the northman had been
sent for and would come before noon to-
day

  then he should be here within two
hours the princess said meditatively
do you go and watch for him and send
him to me before he goes to the king

  the maid bowed and descended the
stone stairs

  ilia leaned against the parapet her chin
resting in her cupped hands she no longer
saw the turbulent little river girdling the
green bosom of the plain nor felt the sea-
wind that blew a loose strand of her dark
hair across her cheek she was thinking
of the stately northman whose stern fair
young face had mingled itself with her
waking thoughts and thrust itself into her
dreams from that first moment when she
had pushed aside the curtains of her fa-
thers chamber and seen him standing be-
fore her

  why did she think of him so much he
was a stranger of uncommon stature and
striking appearance a figure one could
hardly forget so soon but that was not
all when her waiting-maid told her of
the wild street-fight in which ragnarr had
stood in peril of ms life her heart had beat-
en tumultuously as if something deep
within her had been intimately bound up
with his safety

  but what was he to her why should
she care whether he lived or died one
life more or less mattered little in the cruel
world in which she moved in spite of
herself however she had been deeply dis-
turbed and when she heard how ragnarr
had carried that woman of the corner shows
in his arms her head on his shoulder and
in the grip of the minotaur



borne her to his own lodging a sharp pang
shot through her and the beautiful day lost
something of its brightness

  it was maddening merely to think that
she a princess of the blood of teucer
should resent a kindness shown by a wan-
dering stranger to a wretched little acrobat
was she bewitched had this northman
with his strange gods cast a spell over her

  so absorbed was she in her disturbed
fancies that she did not hear the soft scrape
of leather-shod feet on the stairs did not
feel the presence behind her a low grave
voice broke in upon her reverie-

  you sent for me lady

  she turned swiftly the color mounting
her cheeks to the very eyes yes it was
he she was conscious of a strange thrill
half gladness and half fear which she strove
in vain to suppress with an effort she
mastered herself

  yes she replied i have been told
that yesterday at the fair you did a deed of
which i would hear from your own lips
you braved peril of death for a woman
who was nothing to you such a sacrifice
for one dearly loved-that i can under-
stand but i know no man in troy who
would risk a finger for a street-girls life
her clear eyes searched his face

  it was little enough for a man to do
lady he replied for the moment shy and
embarrassed i have staked life and
limb often for fame even for riches and is
not a human life of much more worth than
these

  i have often thought so she answered
her admiration showing in spite of herself
but i have heard no other say it till now
you are indeed a stranger among us prince
ragnarr in this land into which you have
come every effort is strained to keep the
breath in ones own poor body and to win
favors from the great some time i should
like to know more of your land and of your
gods who give you such good and gentle
thoughts but tell me what you intend
to do with this girl since you can not keep
her in a company of men

  ragnarr frowned

  i do not know he said she is a
good child and puts herself out to be use-
ful but i confess that i am troubled con-
cerning her my men cast their eyes upon
her and i fear for her safety besides she
keeps about me whenever she can so that
i scarcely have a moment for myself if

she had any one to carefor her i would have
sent her to them before this but she is
friendless and moreover she refuses to
leave me

  ilia laughed musically a happy laugh
the sense of oppression rolled from her
if this girl were anything to the man who
had saved her life he could not have spoken
of her as he did nor thought of sending
her away she regarded him a moment
with softly sparkling eyes and then laid
her hand on his arm

  you can find a way out of your own
difficulty and serve me at the same time
she said gently i am in need of a com-
panion who will speak to me of real things
who will tell me how my people five-their
joys and sufferings their hopes and fears
none are permitted to tell such things to
me i hear only what is agreeable yet i
know there are those in the world who are
harassed for i have passed through the
city and seen faces on which sorrow had
set its seal this girl must have known
such things and she can help me to learn
the needs of the people give her to me
and i will see that she lacks nothing will
you do this for me

  lady answered ragnarr his voice
strangely stirred i will do this or any-
thing for you

  send her to me in two days then said
ilia for on the day after tomorrow one
of my waiting-women goes to her fathers
house now tell me you who are so brave
and yet so gentle what have you to do
with the dark plans of my father who
never gives his friendship save to those
whom he means to use i have not seen
you more than a few times but i know
that you are of a metal too fine for his
shaping

   he has confided but little in me as yet
but i gather that there are matters of
trading and fighting to be done and these
are my profession

  but are you satisfied to imperil your-
self and the men who trust you in an-
others quarrel he must have offered
you much gold

  you do me wrong lady answered
ragnarr vehemently i am a kings son
and take no service under any man for
gold my sword is my own and i do not
sell it

   ah she said with a little sigh of re-
lief then there is some weightier reason
io

adventure

  yes a reason that in my eyes outweighs
life itself gold and kingdoms

and you can not tell me what it is
again her white hand rested lightly on
his arm her lips smiled her unconscious-
ly intimate gently pleading manner over-
whelmed him

  not now lady not now he stam-
mered but by my gods i shall tell you
some time if i live

  she felt his arm tremble under her hand
and drew back in a soft palpitation of
ffight which she did not understand

  a dry chuckle sounded behind them
ragnarr turned around sharply his hand
instinctively at his empty scabbard then
the fire died out of his eyes and confusion
fell upon him ilias head was bowed her
cheeks scarlet

  well children wheezed old dardanus
your talk must have been interesting to
make you so blind and deaf i have been
standing here as long as a man might count
six score and i might have been a brick in
this wall for all the respect you paid me
but now run to your mother girl the
sun here is too hot for your dainty cheeks
though it can harm this weather-beaten
northman little

  with a dutiful bow not unmixed with
trepidation ilia swept down the stair her
fine head tilted a little proudly

  now my young friend said the old
king swiftly changing to a confidential
manner it is time is it not i told you
more of my purposes but first you have
entered my service of your own free will
and of your own free will you may draw
out again if the thought of danger disturbs
you aught

  my lord answered ragnarr haughtily
a hero is my father and my mother was
as familiar with the spear as with the dis-
taff i took my first pap on the point of-a
sword and drank my first wine out of a
skull if you desire to lose my services
speak of danger to me but once more
nay nay be not so hot with me
broke in the king if you love danger so
i can make her your constant companion
your bride but this is the whole matter
and you may take it or leave it as you
know troy depends for its very life on the
trade which is floated hither from all di-
rections from the northeast timber is
rafted down from the euxine slaves are
borne to us from the south amber from

your own land and tin from the isle of
mines in the northern seas while copper
is carried-when it comes at all-from the
island of crete

  now follow me closely crete is the
seat of a mighty empire which could crush
me as a cat crushes a bird i have a strong
city and brave men but of what avail is
courage without weapons i can not make
swords and spears without bronze i can
not make bronze without copper and tin
minos king of crete levies a crushing
tribute on me and if i withhold it he keeps
copper from me and forbids the myceneeans
to send me the tin which enters their waters
i have no ships of my own and minoss
countless sails dot the wide waters of the
mediterranean if after a time i am still
defiant he blockades my ports and shuts
out all things which come by sea then
my trade dies and my people grow poor

  if i had sufficient store of weapons for
a long war i could spit at him now you
are a daring seaman and have your own
ship i can not obtain the raw metal for
my needs but with your aid i can import
weapons ready-made from egypt whose
pharaoh controls the copper-mines of sinai
if i traded with him direct minos of crete
would know it and being mightier than i
could persuade egypt to refuse to trade
with me but you are unknown in these
southern lands i will send you with se-
cret letters to the pharaoh amenothes
and you shall contract to carry gold and
silver to him ostensibly for spice and ala-
baster and bring back swords spear-heads
and arrow-points of bronze

  and then interrupted ragnarr stirred
to enthusiasm we can store food and
water in the vaults of temples and palaces
shut ourselves within the walls and defy
this island tyrant

  not so rash not so rash admonished
dardanus a war is not won so we
might hold out a year perhaps but his
ships would shut us off from the world
destroy our trade cut off help from without
-even sail up the scamander and his
sea-thieves disembarking would pillage
our lands and reap our harvests the
bravest heart can not fight an empty stom-
ach and as long as minos held the sea
we could wage only a defensive war and
his gold would attract great hordes of mer-
cenaries from egypt mycenas and the
east no there is something more we
in the grip of the minotaur



must beat down his shield before we can
pierce his heart we must destroy his
fleet

   lie said this with a concentrated hatred
a fury which transformed his cunning old
face into a fiendish mask

  how can you do this with no ships
asked ragnarr doubtfully

  that is just the point my good youth
that is your second task first you set
our craftsmen to work till they have built
a small trading fleet then you bring in
many shiploads of arms from egypt till
we have enough then you shall go back
to your own people and induce them to
send great merchant-fleets to cripple this
cretan devils commerce then he will
swell with anger and think of war but
by that time what with the ships of your
people and those you shall teach us to build
we shall have a fleet which can break his
navies and scatter his people to the four
winds

  dardanus rubbed his withered old hands
and chuckled in gleeful anticipation but
ragnarr answered

  there is one thing more o king what
is my reward to be if i accomplish all this
for it will be a long hard task my men
are dear to me and their lives are worth
more than the gold and silver you spoke
of if my people are to be your cats paw

you must pay them but my reward-

  you shall be first in this kingdom
under myself answered dardanus you
shall have wealth untold and all your men
shall be enriched from the plunder of our
foes your name will be great and go
down to our childrens children as the
savior of their race

   it is not enough said ragnarr sternly
i do not fight for gold for i can win
enough in trade and as for fame i have
that in my own land already but you
have one thing which i value above gold
and jewels above fame and very life if
i sell you my sword you must give me this
anything noble northman anything
saving only my crown itself protested
the king with an understanding gleam in
his eye ask and you shall receive
then this shall be my reward if i can
win it said ragnarr if i can not i will
ask for nothing swear to me that if i can
win your daughters love she shall be mine
so soon as your enemy is humbled

  i swear it cricd dardanus raising

both hands heavenward in his ardor by
our holy goddess the mother i swear it

  then our bargain is made said rag-
narr and seized the kings hand in a joy-
ful grasp

  as he turned to descend the stair the
old man smiled knowingly to himself and
winked one cunning eye

chapter v

more than life itself

d ala knelt on the mat grinding wheat
in a stone mortar her lips were
pressed together ominously and her fine
eyes were dark with sullen anger

  i tell you i will not go my lord she
declared what have i to do with that
trojan lady with her well-bred ways and
her finery did she save me from those
filthy savages no who did you it
is clear then that since i owe my preserva-
tion to you and not to her i must belong
to you and to no one else i shall stay
with you till i die unless- and here her
rage threatened to drown itself in tears-
unless you turn me away

  ragnarr mutely implored the gods for
aid

  i do not turn you away child you
are a good girl and have served me well
but-

  oh fie master she cried springing to
her feet eyes flashing served you well
a good girl am i am i no more to you
than that your hound serves you well
and is a good dog but he gives you his soul
and gets in return-the bones from your
table the scraps you are done with your
worships caress when you are pleased with
him and-a kick when you weary of him
i am no dog but a woman with a heart
like yours a mind thoughts feelings to
wound eyes a tongue-

no one denies that groaned ragnarr

  and i tell you i am not to be driven
away like a worn-out dog you gave me
life and more than life and i shall stay
with you for something tells me that i
shall yet return the gift

  she looked up at him imploringly her
cheeks wet with big tears

  ragnarr shook his head perplexedly

  no child he said after a moment
i am not made of stone and i realize that
you are my faithful friend and servant
iio

adventure

but you can not remain here you are
among men who though they love me and
obey me are after all no better than most
men i fear much that they may do you
mischief besides it happens that you
can serve me best by serving the lady ilia
who also is my good friend

  here rala looked up a dangerous gleam
in her eyes

  she particularly asked me to send you
to her and i gave my promise would
you have me break my word

  the girls breast heaved stormily

  i am a trouble to you she cried
you hate me and would be rid of me
no do not deny it well i will please
you i am your slave the dirt under your
feet i will fetch valgard who is fond of
me if he bids me go i will obey he
will speak as he thinks not as some fair
woman asks him to speak

  she turned away and called valgards
name he came out from one of the tents
his massive figure filling the door his face
flushed and perspiring with the heat it
was true that the tempestuous little acro-
bat and he had become strongly attached to
each other both by the common bond of
their affection for ragnarr and by the strong
cord that unites the hearts of all true ad-
venturers

  valgard cried rala your master
wishes to turn me out the princess ilia
has conceived the whim of having a girl of
the people to serve her and cajoled the
simple man into promising to turn his poor
slave over to her what say you shall
i go or shall i defy him for his own good
and remain in spite of him

  valgard looked at her steadily but with
unwonted tenderness in his fierce old eyes

  see lass he began you and i have
one end in life one task to perform we
are our lords and our sole reason for con-
tinuing to be is to obey him if he walk
on us it is well if he fondle us well if
he bid us tear out our hearts and eat them
why that is what we are here for he did
not wait and debate when your life and
honor were at stake you call yourself
his then serve him as his spear serves
all is said

  the girl flung herself face down on the
floor sobbing piteously ragnarr stooped
to comfort her but valgard thrust him
back

  let be he whispered you can do

no good she will come out of it herself
in a moment she sat up humble and
submissive

  when shall i go master she asked
her voice trembling

  tomorrow at noon child you could
not be with me longer in any case for i sail
at dawn of the next day

  rala gave a cry her hand at her breast
valgard stared at him

  may we know where lord he asked
it is right that you two should know
first of all answered ragnarr for of all
that are with me there are none truer sit
close by me that other ears may not over-
hear i go to egypt to arrange for a
mighty undertaking

  so he told them all the story leaving
out only that which concerned his love for
ilia valgard took the affair quite as a
matter of course but ralas face and ges-
tures showed the liveliest terror and con-
cern

  have nothing to do with this king and
his quarrels she begged oh if you
had seen crete if you but knew king
minos you would not lift a finger against
him he is the descendant of the gods
and they fight on his side he always
conquers and his foes are taken and sacri-
ficed to the minotaur to that which no
man hath seen and lived to tell its shape
if you oppose minos you perish
ragnarrs jaw set and he squared his
shoulders

  now you have done it girl said val-
gard our master fears nothing except
fear he will go now you may be certain
listen my lord rala pleaded i
was born in sicily and was taken as a slave
by cretans when but a tiny child they
trained me in all athletic exercises for i
was the daughter of a chief and doomed
to be a sacrifice to the bull which they
worship there are three degrees of the
sacrifice the first when the harvest is good
and fortune favors them is the performance
of the sacred dance by captive youths and
maidens before all the people the second
when fortune frowns is the combat with a
savage bull which selected youths and
maidens must endure unarmed and the
third is that of which no man may speak
with authority captured warriors and
those selected by the oracle are offered up
to the minotaur and none know how they
die
in the grip of the minotaur

hi

  i myself endured the bull-fight and
survived and soon after escaped through
the great drains of the palace and swam
out to a passing ship that bore me to tiryns
where my training in the bull-ring earned
me a place in that strolling band of acro-
bats dispersed by the mob from whom
you saved me but for you the minotaur
waits

  i have sworn answered ragnarr and
strode out

  valgard rose to follow him but the girl
caught him by the sleeve

  you are my only friend she pleaded
i am nothing to him but i tell you
valgard i love him and if anything hap-
pens to hurt him i shall die find some
way for me to go with him i can not let
him go from me not knowing what may
befall death is better a thousand times
better than waiting in the agony of uncer-
tainty and hopeless hopeless longing

  valgard laid his hand tenderly on her
head

  brave little comrade he said i would
give my shield-hand to help you as tyr
did for the gods but our lord wills it
otherwise we are but tools in his hand
child can you not be a true tool

  she seized his knotty hand and kissed it

  i will be true comrade she answered
stoutly

the day drew toward its close
and the northmen made haste to
sell the rest of their wares before
they were obliged to depart valgard and
the seaman tyrleif stood behind the coun-
ter in the principal booth while beside
them hjalti the bard with nimble imagi-
nation appealed to the crowd of prospective
purchasers in lurid phrases having called
attention to the rare beauty of the amber
holding now a red piece now a golden one
up to the light to catch the fading beams
of the sun he began to descant on t eir
virtues as amulets swearing that they
would keep off the fever sunstroke palsy
and the falling sickness

  one figure stood on the very edge of the
gaping crowd that packed the street out-
side the shallow front of the booth a figure
that never moved but kept its eyes fixed on
the shadowy interior of the tent it was
a woman her features wrapped in a volu-
minous veil which swathed her to the knees
effectively disguising face and figure to

her the gesticulating bard addressed him-
self in particular declaring that the amber
nodule which he held in his hand was a sov-
ereign remedy for jealousy and barrenness

  suddenly a shadow fell across the coun-
ter and a hand struck the bit of amber
from his fingers immediately the crowd
made a rush for it trampling and jostling
each other in their eagerness

  liar thundered ragnarr at the trem-
bling hjalti how often have i told you
that honest wares need no lying tales to
cheapen them go to your tent and bide
till i-

  a muffled cry rang out and ragnarr
broke off looking up swiftly in the
scramble for the amber a tall phoenician
had trodden heavily on the foot of the veiled
lady who had fallen against the rude rail-
ing that protected the counter the veil
half fell from her face revealing the features
of the princess ilia

  ragnarr started violently then as she
righted her veil he sprang over the counter
and drew her round the angle of the booth
and in through the door

  what do you here lady he asked
anxiously

  follow me she answered softly this
is no place to talk

  calling to valgard to keep the crowd
back he opened the door-flap again and
they passed out swiftly one or two of
the more curious started to follow them
but valgards shout brought a number of
sturdy northmen who shoved these back
none too gently

  swiftly ilia led ragnarr through the
main thoroughfare and toward the little
grove on the bank of the scamander
there close by the water and shaded by a
clump of plane-trees stood a stone bench
on which they seated themselves the
westering sun dyed the river in crimson
stain and the clouds were fringed with
crimson and opal in the gathering dusk
a slender figure crept up behind them un-
observed

   they sat in silence for a while then she
spoke in slightly faltering tones

  my father has told me that you are
going to egypt she began i know
something of his purpose now for he is
jubilant in his new hopes and must un-
bosom himself to one whom he trusts
alas i feared he planned some dangerous
task for you


adventure

  why did you fear it lady he asked
unsteadily why should the peril of a
stranger give you concern

  she hesitated then spoke

  i suppose because you are unlike other
men you seem above the evil and the
intrigue in which we are forced to live and
your heart is too clean and gallant for a
king to sacrifice to his bloody purposes
she sighed very softly

  are they not necessary purposes he
demanded

  they must be or you would have naught
to do with them she answered you
would not do evil work i know

  how do you know that why do you
trust me so

  because my heart tells me that you
are good better than our men are and
truer

  you do not come to dissuade me then
no i come to bid you farewell to say
what i could not say tomorrow in the sight
of all men i came to tell you that i have
never known so kind and brave a spirit
we may never see each other again and
so i may say freely that you have brought
new faith new gladness into a heart op-
pressed with the sordid petty ambitions
of a selfish court my spirit is the better
for you ragnarr

  he could no longer restrain himself his
love for her burst the bonds of control
he rose to his feet before her

  as you say he began we may never
meet again the sea is full of evil men
and evil forces and it may be that i go to
the land beyond this life or the gods
may perhaps be kind and bring me back
again i too can say now what i dared
not say before i love you ilia love you
with all that is within me if i return
can you give your heart to me

  she rose and put both hands on his
shoulders

  there is no concealment between you
and me she answered i have loved
you these many days i think i began to
love you when first i saw you do you
remember you had just landed and
kamas led you through our streets my
litter was passing through the crowd all
others fell to their knees but you alone
remained standing i saw you towering
above them and your face was so good
so free from the servile littleness of our
men that i felt my heart warm to you even

then you saw me too and i knew that
you were not unmoved

  he gave a cry of joy and caught her to
him they clung together lip to lip and
heart to heart while the dark closed in
upon them and now the golden moon
came up and flooded the river with radiance
gently ilia drew his arms from around her
and pointed to the sky pulsing with the
beauty of the stars

  i must say farewell she said

  let us go my hearts beloved he
sighed if i stayed here alone with you
longer my own heart would fail me for the
morrow

  they stepped out from the shadow of the
plane-trees and the moonlight fell full on
them

  hark said ilia softly what is that

  it was only the river plashing on the
sand he answered his arm stealing about
her waist

  but he was wrong it was the sobbing
of a woman

chapter vi

 the masters of the mediterranean

tt was all-important for the success
of the old kings plans that ragnarr
should not seem to be more than a wealthy
merchant he had been graciously received
at the palace upon his arrival but that was
an honor accorded to all merchants of noble
blood now that he was about to depart
however any unwonted attention paid him
would attract the eyes of the multitude of
traders foreign representatives and spies
who crowded the fair and perhaps start a
rumor which crete might seize upon he
must go quietly and from the fair-grounds
like any ordinary merchant

  his men were to enter troy by the south-
west gate collect their weapons from the
temple of the mother and march out under
convoy to the street bordering the fair-
grounds and thence west to the scamander
where their boats would be waiting in
conformity with this scheme therefore
king dardanus had caused ragnarr to be
summoned secretly to him that very night
onlya few hours after he had parted from
ilia ragnarr took advantage of this sum-
mons to take rala to the palace with him
and found occasion to see her safely into
ilias hands
in the grip of the minotaur



  after a tender farewell to ilia he sought
the presence of the king having received
the letters for the pharaoh and a few final
instructions from dardanus ragnarr took
his leave reminding the king of his prom-
ise with his parting words

  next morning he began his preparations
for departure the sail-cloth covering was
stripped from the booth and loaded into the
larger of the two boats with valgard and
six oarsmen he rowed down to the ship
which the sailors as soon as the unloading
had been completed had pulled up stern-
foremost on the sandy shore of the bay for
a scraping and overhauling those left
with the ship about fifty men had camped
out on the beach and had been hospitably
cared for as guests of the coast-guard by
special order of the king

  as soon as they set eyes upon their
prince the sailors raised a mighty shout of
welcome rushed to meet him and crowded
round to shake his hand with that free
good-fellowship that characterized the rela-
tion of the northman to his lord

  after greetings were said ragnarr and
his men launched the ship they swarmed
first round the bow then the stern took
hold lifted mightily and thrust the wooden
rollers under all gathered round the stern
half on each side their thick shoulders
thrust against the planks and shoved with
main force the vessel heaved settled
then rushed down into the water

  now some waded out their hands on her
new-pitched sides and held her others
formed a chain from the shore and passed
along from man to man the sides of salt
meat bags of grain and crates of dried
fruit whch lay piled up on the beach hav-
ing been ferried down the river by the
kings orders for their voyage these were
stowed carefully in the shallow open hold
amidships between the inboard ends of the
rowers benches and on them cushioned
and held in place with reed mats which pro-
tected the provisions from rain and spray
were placed the clay jars of water and wine
their mouths sealed with clay paste and
stamped with the royal seal

  then by ragnarrs command all but
valgard himself and the crew of their boat
swarmed over the galleys sides half to
port and half to starboard to maintain her
balance the oars were brought out and
thrust into the rowlocks and the ship rowed
out to a safe depth and there anchored



  bidding the fifty bend on the sail and re-
main on board till he returned in mid-after-
noon when he proposed to sail ragnarr
and the others re-embarked in their boat
and rowed back to the fair-ground which
extended through the long narrow plain
south of the city westward to the scaman-
der

king dardanus sat in a gild-
ed chair on the northern wall of his
citadel whence he could look out
over the plain of troy and the rolling hills
beyond to the azure waters of the helles-
pont a gorgeously embroidered awning of
scarlet sheltered him from the almost verti-
cal rays of the noonday sun ilia sat beside
him while behind stood rala fanning her
new mistress with a long-handled fan of
peacocks feathers

  the old king basked happily in the warm
soothing air he was aglow with mental
and bodily comfort the day was glorious
the view before his satisfied eyes was ra-
diant with beauty this was his city with
its gigantic walls its temples and palaces
its bursting granaries and coffers full to
overflowing its men were his their hands
quick to seize sword or shield at his bid-
ding best of all he had found a mighty
friend and ally in this valiant northman
who would bring to him the trade of his
far-off land reopen to him the commerce
of the wide mediterranean and overwhelm
his cruel enemy and oppressor minos of
crete his cup was full and he felt a deep
sense of satisfaction in his fair daughter
whose white arms bound this brave deliverer
to him with the chains of love

  a white dot rose over the far edge of the
hellespont dardanus chuckled softly to
himself seeing in the tiny far-off sail a
symbol of the numberless fleets which
should come so soon to troy bearing the
riches of all the world he watched it grow
larger and larger till as the ship that bore
it tacked a puzzled frown began to drive
the smile from his lips

  the one white spot had suddenly be-
come three rala out of his sight behind
the chair quietly laid down the fan shield-
ed her eyes with her hands and watched
intently

  daughter the king asked in a tone of
fretful bewilderment can you make out
the sails on yonder ship my old eyes are
deceiving me i think
h

adventure

  she has three sails father ilia respond-
ed but i am not sure of their shape at
this distance

  if it please you my lord interrupted
rala her voice trembling with excited fear
it is one of the long ships of crete with its
three square sails and countless oars which
flash in the sunlight

  dardanus sprang to his feet his face livid
oh the cunning dogs he shrilled
could they not wait another day to
come now when the princes galley is still
bound in the port have they eyes and
ears in the very walls of my chamber to
learn my purposes as they leave my lips
he strode up and down gnawing his fin-
gers suddenly the light of resolution came
into his eyes he clapped his hands and a
soldier sprang round the corner of the wall
and stood before him raising his shielded
arm

  go to prince ragnarrs tent cried the
king imperiously tell him to close his
business as soon as he may hasten to his
ship and speed to his destination as fast as
sail and oars will bear him be swift

  the messenger bowed low and departed
ragnarr stood by his dismantled booth
superintending the labors of his men who
were busily packing away the small rem-
nant of their wares and the money they
had taken in strong boxes of cypress
these were to be stored in the palace dur-
ing ragnarrs absence small bags of stout
cloth tied tightly at the mouth bulged with
disks of silver and gold the knots which
secured them were sealed with balls of clay
marked with the royal superscription

  one crammed too full had burst and
valgard with two sturdy helpers was thrust-
ing back the boldest of the crowd it was
necessary to keep these folk in check for
among them were many stout rogues who
would dare much to snatch a handful of
the shining pieces every now and then
one more forward than the rest would drop
with a bloody crown under the blow of a
long tent-stake poles and pins were being
plucked up and the cloths which had been
spread over them were folded and bound
securely

  on the kings errand make way
cried a voice

  the crowd parted to right and left and
the messenger of dardanus his limbs streak-
ed with sweat and dust stood before rag-
narr

  the king greets you my lord he pant-
ed and bids you haste on your voyage
with all possible speed to your ship his
majesty hath spoken

  turning on his heel the messenger sped
back through the crowd which again parted
to both sides to let him pass

  ragnarr called on his men urging them
to their utmost-endeavors bales and sacks
were thrust hurriedly into the chests which
were bound with heavy ropes and laid in
order

  handle that painted jar with care you
lout or you taste my knuckles roared
valgard there is mead enough left in it
to wet our throats twice around before we
see the ship

  he turned swiftly and caught just above
the wrist a lean brown arm that had thrust
itself from the edge of the throng and
snatched up a tiny jeweled box ralas
parting gift to the old warrior a quick
movement of his fingers a shrill yell of pain
from the thief and the hand hung limp and
broken from the brown wrist

  then a babel of wondering cries burst
forth in a dozen different tongues shrill-
voiced egyptians clamored and pointed
sharp-featured men of sidon gesticulated
and chattered all the multitude gave tongue
at once their eyes and leveled arms direct-
ed toward the river

  up the channel of the wide scamander
came a ship such a ship as ragnarr had
never seen before half again as long as his
own gray wolf narrow was her beam and
high her sides even in the waist from which
the lines of her hull soared upward to the
forked stem - post and pennoned stern
black was her paint from stern to shoulder
but the prow was a bright vermilion very
many were the oars and smooth their
rhythm but the greatest marvel of all was
the three tall masts-yes three-that tow-
ered above her deck each was crossed by
a single yard carrying what looked like a
modern topgallant-sail for unlike the ships
of the northmen this craft had her canvas
hoisted so high that a tall man could pass
under it with shouldered lance even though
he stood on the raised fore-and-aft bridge

  greatly did ragnarr marvel to see men
swarm up the ladder-like shrouds of the
standing rigging lay out on the yards and
quickly furl the three sails as the ship drew
nigh to the landing place the oars gradu-
ally diminished their beat till the dripping
in the grip of the minotaur

blades were tossed and held while the two
broad steering-oars guided her in to the
landing by the dazzling glint of the sun
on her gilded masts and carven inlaid rail-
ings she was clearly the galley of some
wealthy prince some affluent sea-king of
the south

  the ship was made fast to the stone rings
in two of the granite posts of the fair-grounds
quay a cleated gangway was lowered and
two by two some thirty marines disem-
barked at the double and drew up on the
bank they were men of uncommonly
short stature broad - shouldered and
swarthy almost copper-colored with pinch-
ed-in waists confined in broad leathern belts
from these hung short broadswords in em-
bossed scabbards the hilts were of ivory
and the pommels of silver

  each man wore a conical helmet of pol-
ished bronze a gorgeously embroidered
waist-cloth above which shone the naked
coppery breast and leathern boots reach-
ing half-way up the leg some carried un-
bent bows in their hands and full quivers
suspended over their shoulders the rest bore
long spears with leaf-shaped heads of bronze

  down the gangway now strode two im-
pressive figures a young man and an old
the youth wore about his shoulders a rich
mantle of scarlet caught up with a golden
clasp the hilt of his short sword was of
pure gold with a gleaming jewel set in the
pommel his shapely head was uncovered
and his jet-black hair dangled about his
cheeks in three long curls

  his face was handsome and his eyes in-
solent a thin nose and two daintily curved
red lips proclaimed the aristocrat his com-
panion gray-haired and lantern-jawed was
evidently a naval officer of high rank his
helmet bore three red plumes and an onyx-
hilted dagger was fixed diagonally across
the front of his girdle at a curt command
from him the marines wheeled and marched
up into the fair-ground the two officers at
their head

  up the street swung the warlike band
shoulder to shoulder chests thrust out left
arms swinging slightly as the booted feet
came down in the crisp cadence of perfect
drill neither to right nor left they looked
but straight ahead with the eyes of men
who know themselves for masters in what-
ever company the crowd made way for
them as they came giving the cretans the
full width of the street

  ragnarr seethed with indignation what
were these swaggering fellows about to vio-
late the sanctity of the fair by carrying
weapons within its precincts how dared
they trample on a world - wide custom
known to all men and violated only by pi-
rates

  on the offenders marched till they came
to the corner of the scasan road where
their path was blocked by valgard tying
up one of the great bales an officer ran
forward and rudely tried to thrust the
northman out of the way valgards great
fist lashed out like the hoof of an angry
stallion and the cretan dropped stunned
and bleeding

  the young commander gave a sharp
order in his native tongue the column
jarred to a halt except for the first four
marines who sprang round their two leaders
and closed in on valgard with lowered pikes
with one bound ragnarr confronted them
spreading his arms between them and the
glaring old warrior

  by the hand of tyr he thundered
we are few and unarmed and ye be many
and well able to slay us with those weapons
which ye bear here unlawfully but by
the crown of my father if ye lay a hand on
any man of mine some of you shall lie cold
before this days work is done

  the crowd that had shrunk aside began
to return scowling at the audacity of the
armed cretans but none daring to raise
voice or hand against the intruders even
the half-company of trojan archers that
policed the fair and now stood close behind
the northmen hesitated to defend the sanc-
tity of the place and the sovereign rights of
troy against the insolence of the masters
of the sea

  remove those fellows cried the cretan
commander and the four marines who had
hesitated at the intrusion of the blue-eyed
giant again rushed at valgard

  but ragnarr seized the foremost by the
throat swung him off his feet and snatched
the short sword from the cretans scabbard
swinging the broad blade between valgard
and his foes the prince kept the three at
bay while his voice rang in the ears of the
multitude like a trumpet

  fellow-merchants he cried these
men have broken your law have trampled
on your sacred privileges bearing their
wicked weapons into this holy ground
they even dare to threaten your lives to


adventure

seize your fellows from your very midst and
ye stand idle if ye submit to this which
of you know that he may not be the next
victim of these pirates insolence and ye
soldiers of troy do ye hesitate to avenge
the affront to your king and your mighty
city shall it be said that he who has tasted
the salt of dardanus died defending your
laws while ye stood by unresisting if so
then be your land accursed and may its
people perish as cowards must beneath the
pitiless swords of murderers such as these
a murmur rose among the multitude
swelled louder and louder till it burst in a
yell of rage unarmed as they were the
more daring closed in upon the cretan
spearmen

  he is right shouted a trojan archer and
his comrades raised a shout of affirmation

  the two parties faced each other like
surly dogs the mob lashing itself into fury
the police gripping their sword-hilts and
scowling upon the invaders who remained
calmly waiting for their commander to give
the next order

  biting his lips the young cretan strode
out from beside his companion and con-
fronted ragnarr

  it had been well for you barbarian he
said contemptuously if you had never de-
fied the majesty of crete know that i
am ambrogeos first-born of minos the
great who is son of the bull and king of
kings yield now while you may and may-
hap you shall die by the sword but strike
another blow and you and all your wretched
company shall feed the minotaur

  ragnarr looked down upon him his blue
eyes blazing

  i yield to no pirate he answered grim-
ly nor do i boast but as to dying by
the sword we will sacrifice a cretan calf
to tyr before we board the ship of death
the two gazed at each other long and
unflinchingly till at last the black eyes fell
before the sword-like blue ambrogeos
clenched and unclenched his fingers his
breast swelled with rage and he turned
toward his men his ups parted for the fatal
command that should plunge them all into
bloody conflict but before he could utter
the words his lantern-jawed companion laid
a bony hand on the youths smooth shoul-
der and whispered in the cretan tongue
my lord these must be the men whom
we seek remember they must be taken
alive that the minotaur may have a full

meal they will not yield without a fight
but that old craven in the palace yonder
may easily be persuaded to hand them over
to us without the loss of a single cretan life
restrain yourself for the present and soon
they shall be ours

  ambrogeos nodded curtly and turned his
back on ragnarr in response to a gesture
of command two marines detached them-
selves from the ranks and ran swiftly back to
the ship the rest closed up the old admiral
barked out a sharp word of command and
the marines swung smartly to the left and
took up their march toward the sczean gate

  the mongrel crowd burst into hoots and
jeers with derisive signs and obscene ges-
tures of defiance the northmen gazed
after the departing cretans with stern hos-
tility and ragnarr scornfully throwing
down the captured sword turned again to
his task

  acharsis the captain of archers who had
stood by him so well in the street fight with
the wild lumbermen now left his grinning
bowmen and stepped up to ragnarr

  my lord he began you have won
your point and they will not disturb you on
the fair-grounds again but if i do not err
those two fellows who were sent to the gal-
ley yonder have carried the command that
you be seized and slain if you stir from the
sacred precincts here you are safe but
embark on the river as you now seem plan-
ning to do and you are lost

  friend answered ragnarr i have
here the sign and seal of your king giving
me safe conduct out of this land and au-
thority to transact certain business in his
name this is my guaranty and surely you
and all your fellow-soldiers will enforce your
monarchs word

  no my lord answered acharsis sadly
these pirates respect no king but their
own and i have no orders to plunge my
land into a war with minos

  then there is nothing but to remain
here till the cretans please to depart
nothing my lord answered acharsis
but i will see that you do not lack food
and drink until the king can act

the cretans marched in through
the sctean gate the guards by the
orders of the badly frightened dar
danus permitting the armed strangers t
enter unchallenged the old admiral pick
ed out the stately residence of a trojar

in the grip of the minotaur



noble and sent the swaggering little com-
pany in charge of a petty officer to com-
mandeer the place for quarters during their
stay in troy then he and the prince am-
brogeos mounted the stately street to the
citadel

  dardanus sat alone in the great throne-
room biting his nails and staring helplessly
at the heroic figures of his ancestors paint-
ed on the walls fear rage and cunning
played over his features in swift succession
it could be no common errand which had
brought the son of minos unheralded to
troy

 what if the cretan suspected his
schemes oh if he had but a few hours
more there must be some way some es-
cape from this unlucky situation he would
do anything give more tribute pay homage
no matter what to allay his enemys suspi-
cions till his plans could blossom and bear
fruit

  imperiously waving guards and ushers
aside ambrogeos of crete entered the broad
doorway followed by his admiral rhodon-
thos ignoring the courteous address of
welcome which dardanus had prepared and
now rose to deliver he strode to the very
dais his face was flushed with passion
and in a voice which anger choked he de-
manded of the king

  what does it mean thou dog of minos
that strangers dare insult our sacred person
before thy very gates is this city so swol-
len with its pride that its bastard depend-
ents think to raise their heads against the
king of kings what payment dost thou
hope to make for an offense as black as
this

  poor dardanus cowered in his cushioned
throne his jaw drooped and his wizened
face blanched

  what have i done to deserve this most
gracious prince he pleaded tell me
who has so offended and i will smite off
his head and have it stuck on a pole

  the princes utterance was choked and
the veins swelled on his temples wrath
had been boiling in him since ragnarr had
outfaced him before his own men and his
humiliated pride clamored for revenge
rhodonthos spoke for him for ambrogeos
avas incapable of utterance

  it is this king dardanus we had just
landed and were proceeding peacefully
through the fair when a stout rascal blun-
dered into our path the captain staltes

undertook to remove him and the fellow
smote staltes with his fist hurting him sore-
ly we would have laid hands upon him
but his master whom i heard called rag-
narr interfered threatening us with a sword
which he had seized from one of our own
men when we resented his deed he dared
to insult the sacred person of our prince and
even menaced him with death we would
have dealt with him as he deserved had not
the mob encouraged by your troops o
king given him their support this de-
mands investigation-look you

  the old kings terror was pitiful to see
oh if that luckless northman had only
taken himself off before the prince ar-
rived

  now dardanus must choose between his
schemes promises and hopes and the wrath
of minos which was destruction sudden-
ly a thought came to him if he could dis-
avow the deed of ragnarr it might be pos-
sible to soothe the cretan with promises of
amends and goodly gifts and so hold him
in the palace discussing terms till the north-
men were gone then it would be too late
for his plans to be checked and all might be
well in the end albeit at some cost to his
treasury

  good prince ambrogeos he said in
wheedling tones these wretched fellows
are no subjects of mine but base barbarians
from the north who came hither to trade
you have my word-

  by the bull shouted ambrogeos his
eyes gleaming with triumph these are
the very men i seek know dardanus
that i have come all the long way from
crete to fetch these fellows to my father
who has heard that they are the forerunners
of great fleets from their own land to cheat
us of the trade of all the seas our spies
report that they are dealing in tin which
as you know it is forbidden to carry save
in cretan bottoms king minos in his
wisdom has determined to have these bar-
barians and feed them to the minotaur
thus we shall discourage those who seek
to rob us give them to me and you shall
be purged of the offense they have com-
mitted

  dardanus buried his face in his hands
it was all over his cherished dream of free-
dom and empire he must die as he had
lived the dog of minos resentment stir-
red in his heart he would make a last
stand for his hopes


adventure

slipping a piece of gold into the
guardsmans hand rala stole away
from the curtained door her eyes
wide with terror she ran wildly down the
corridor her bare feet falling noiselessly on
the pavement ragnarrs life was in dan-
ger and she alone could rescue him

  her thoughts kept pace with her flying
feet as she turned the corner of the great
stair she collided with a white figure which
seized her with clinging arms it was ilia

  let me go cried rala let me go to
him i must save him

  save whom asked the princess coolly
then even as she spoke her heart turned
cold with fear

  speak girl she commanded what
threatens him tell me and it may be that
i can help you

  the frightened girl poured forth her story
knowing what she did of ragnarrs busi-
ness with the king she had suspected some
connection between this and the cretan
visitation and feared for his safety when
she had heard loud voices in the throne-
room and recognized the accents of the cre-
tan court she had bribed the guard to let
her listen at the door and had heard all

  ilias face turned pale go to my cham-
ber she commanded wait there for
me it may be that i can say that which
will strengthen my fathers heart against
this cruel prince if i fail i shall send you
to the lord ragnarr

  so saying ilia walked swiftly toward the
throne-room as she drew near the en-
trance she heard a voice crying in tones of
anger

  enough of your temporizing deliver
me these northmen to die the nameless
death or i will come with ships beyond
number blockade your ports and when it
pleases me destroy your walls and stamp
your city flat those whom i take i will
slay and all of noble blood yourself among
them i will give to the insatiate hunger of
the minotaur

chapter vii

the night of tyr

tlia stood hidden in the shadow of
the doorway watching her fathers
face she saw terror written on it and help-
less acquiescence the sight made her blush
with rage and shame rage at the cretans

bloodthirsty arrogance and shame at her
fathers weakness little did she know
how powerless he was against the vast naval
power of minos

  she had seen enough she swept into the
room head held high eyes blazing with out-
raged majesty and offended womanhood
without waiting for them to notice her she
raised her voice in a torrent of indignation

  you base and evil men she cried
offspring of a wicked race what you pro-
pose is infamy if you could enforce your
cruel threats do you dream that troy
would hesitate to choose between shame
and destruction better to die a thousand
deaths than yield up to murderers him with
whom we have broken bread but you can
not conquer us every man will die every
woman will put on armor and shed the last
drop of her blood before we will listen to
your vile proposals the trojan mother
would curse the son who had saved his life
by yielding the maiden would send her
lover to unending sleep rather than clasp a
living coward in her arms

  and you my father who have called
yourself a king will you barter your hon-
or and cheapen your royal crown for a few
brief years of comfortable life and the hol-
low sham of a power that others wield
will you be a puppet and dabble your with-
ered hands in corruption while the cretan
pulls the strings if i thought so i would
renounce you spit upon your name and
call my mother harlot sooner than own
you father

  oh does your heart not pulse even now
with one drop of that heroic blood which
men say ran in your youthful veins when
you destroyed the warlike race that inhab-
ited this land before you and slew their
king in single combat on the plain are
you that fiery dardanus who scaled the
wall of abydos before a single soldier reach-
ed its base are you that king who built
these mighty ramparts round our city de-
fying as the poets sing a world in arms to
take it from you if you are he then hurl
these infamous ones into your deepest dun-
geon and send your defiance thundering
about the ears of bloody minos

  she stood there like an incarnate goddess
in the robes of her majesty exhorting an
erring world to righteousness

  the cretans had turned at the first ring-
ing word ambrogeos stood like one who
sees a vision his handsome face expressing
in the grip of the minotaur



the liveliest admiration cleared of the dis-
figuring mask of wrath his features though
haughty appeared delicate almost effemi-
nate while ilia spoke he never lifted his
dark eyes from her

 dardanus groaned aloud oh my
daughter he sighed how little you
know the strength of fate i was that dar-
danus that fiery heroic youth while the
island empire chose to let me indulge my
splendid dreams but long before you were
bom my child the young all-powerful
minos chafed at my soaring ambition and
placed upon my neck the weary yoke that
now crushes me to the tomb

  then rise my father shake off the yoke
and if you can not live heroically then at
least seek a heros death

  alas it is too late the countless gal-
leys of the sea-king would lie in every port
and conquer us with the arms of starvation
and poverty can you not see child that
there is rio hope for the land cut off from
the sea

  ilia bowed her glorious head tears of
rage and shame in her brave eyes yet she
was not conquered she was fighting for
love for honor for all that makes life worth
living and she threw back her head with
the color surging to her cheeks and lips
parted to utter further defiance when in
broke the insolent voice of ambrogeos

  o dardanus your daughters words
have found an echo in my heart she is a
maid of rare spirit fit for a heros bride
and her beauty passes the loveliness of the
goddess ariadne her splendor has over-
come me and i relent give her to me in
marriage and i swear to you by the sacred
voice of dicta that i will spare these con-
tumacious barbarians freely forgive their
crimes and the guilt of your city and remit
half of the yearly tribute

  the helpless king snatched at this shame-
ful hope and with a sorry attempt at re-
sumption of his dignity gave his consent
ilia fell at her fathers feet her face white
with terror her arms clasping his knees

  oh unsay it she begged remember
your promise how can you give me to
this man-you who have cherished me all
these years

  she turned and knelt to ambrogeos if
there is one spark of tenderness in your
breast she begged spare these innocent
men and do not stain your generosity with
violence to a helpless girl

  the face of ambrogeos lit up with unholy
joy ah now i see he cried you love
this tall barbarian and would have both his
life and his love you yourself have forged
the weapon with which i shall pierce his
breast and to you king of a wretched
race i offer this choice give me this girl
this very night and all will be well i will
even spare the northmans life but deny
me and i slay the fellow with all his men
and return to my father with words that
shall bring famine fire and sword about
your heads all shall perish-men women
maidens and tender babes and with them
the very name of troy

   ilia rose to her feet pale but mistress of
herself

  i will answer for the king she said in
cold firm tones his majesty consents
not from fear for himself since he scorns
you but to save his people

  and with head proudly raised she walked
from the room

fggbf rala fluttered about the chamber
of the princess in a fever of impa-
tience suddenlythe curtains were
thrust aside and eyes staring with horror
ilia rushed in fell upon the couch and burst
into violent weeping rala ran to her her
own heart hammering at her ribs with fear
you have failed she cried

  i have succeeded sobbed ilia and as
best she could she told the story her stream-
ing tears choking her utterances

  for a moment cruel joy filled ralas
heart then the words of valgard came into
her mind we are but tools in his hand
child can you not be a true tool crush-
ing the rising hope she said gently

  princess i have dared to love him too
but he has given his heart to you we have
both lost him now but we have this com-
fort that he is safe

  the gods be praised for that mur-
mured ilia but i must give him up-and
for what

  for what indeed thought rala as
the splendors and cruelties of crete flashed
before her and with the thought a sharp
suspicion entered her mind

  listen princess she cried i have
lived among these cretans and know them
for a cruel folk who do not value promises
over highly what if ambrogeos should
but postpone his vengeance and return to
seek it after you are his


adventure

  ilia sat up gasping do you think he
would she cried

  i am sure of it he does not look or
speak like one who leaves a single purpose
unfulfilled

  the princess rose to her feet her hands
clenched oh is no sacrifice enough she
cried passionately will no tears appease
the gods must they have blood
forgetful of rank rala grasped her mis-
tress by the arm i have it she whis-
pered i have a knife here hidden in the
folds of my girdle i have had it since
those wild men attacked me lest i should
need deliverance again when none were
near to help me i will creep to this cre-
tans chamber and stab him as he sleeps
and would that keep off the wrath of
minos silly girl exclaimed ilia no
there is a better way ragnarrs life is safe
for a time for the princes word holds good
at least till i am his do you steal out of
the city and hasten to ragnarr tell him
all that has happened and command him
in my name to flee tell him how i loved
him even enough for this and say that i
shall die if misfortune overtakes him
stay she called as rala ran to the door
come with me for i know a secret way
that will lead you to him swiftly

  ilia lit a small lamp took rala by the
hand all difference forgotten in their com-
mon love and the two stumbled through
dark corridors and around drafty corners
till they stood in a wing of the palace which
was still blocked with the scaffolds and leav-
ings of carpenter and mason for it was not
yet finished here in a certain angle of
the wall they stopped and ilia tugging at
a sunken ring swung open a tall stone pan-
el wide enough to admit a man she thrust
the lamp into ralas hands

  i know the way she said my father
planned it himself and showed it to me but
a fortnight ago none others know of it
haste

  the columned hall rang with the laughter
of a merry company assembled in honor of
the royal guest ambrogeos prince of crete
king dardanus his face almost happy with
relief pledged the noble cretan again and
again the betrothal was not announced
though the king had pleaded for it for
ambrogeos intimated that certain matters
must be settled first

  ilia sat at the princes right and her eyes
sparkled with apparent happiness as she

met the admiring gaze of her betrothed
she had never been more beautiful and
ambrogeos could not look away from her
more than one gay lady nudged the cour-
tier next her and it was whispered that the
princess had made a conquest which might
be turned to the advantage of the realm
but ever and again a hunted look crept into
ilias eyes and the roses in her cheeks
seemed to fade

  when the guests had gone ambrogeos
turned to his host

  and now he said let us talk i have
said that i love your daughter and it is so
but it chances that my father in his wis-
dom desires me to wed the daughter of the
pharaoh amenothes and as matters have
gone some lengths you can understand that
it would be impolitic to break off the affair
this is why i desire that my marriage with
the princess ilia be held at once moreover
it must be secret and after a few days of
happiness i shall leave this city and return
to my father then i sail to crete to con-
clude matters there it is necessary that
no word be said of our marriage until i have
won the pharaohs daughter lest the pro-
posed egyptian alliance be broken off and
great harm follow when all is settled i
shall come back and claim my bride
but dardanus protested indignantly
do you propose to make my daughter a
concubine

  far from it answered ambrogeos in
the most friendly manner i shall have
married her first and by the custom of my
land she will be my queen the egyptian
will suppose herself the first and will not
learn of her ill-fortune until she and i are
safely married then it will be too late
she will be mine and the alliance confirmed
i swear most solemnly that ilia whom i
love most dearly shall be my queen
dardanus smiled well satisfied polyga-
my was to him an established fact and the
first wife as head of the household was
well off besides what an honor to troy
that his daughter should take precedence
over a princess of great egypt a daughter
of the sun

rala hurried on as fast as she
dared but had to lessen her pace
frequently for fear of putting out
the flickering flame of her olive-oil lamp
the passage first wound about in conform-
ance to the architecture of the palace then
in the grip of the minotaur



ran straight down at a uniform slope
through the heart of the hill presently it
opened out into a wide vault which rala
knew from its position must be the cellar
of the temple of the mother

  a thought flashed into her mind and she
paused to raise the lamp and examine the
low roof above her yes there was the
place where one of the ringed stone blocks
stood in the temple court for she could see
crevices about its edges wider than those
between the other stones

  the girl hurried on and now it was not
long before she felt the air freshen and a
gust of wind puffed out her light she felt
her way along the wall for a few yards more
and emerged on to the plain close by the
river-bank

  in sheer surprise rala stopped short and
gazed up toward the sky the air was raw
and a thick fog was rolling in from the sea
moisture is so infrequent in the troad that
the girl superstitious like all the folk of
her time was filled with awe nevertheless
she remembered her errand and strove to
get her bearings

  before her ran the scamander from the
left came the multitudinous murmurings of
the unseen fairgrounds muffled by the fog
suddenly a hand touched her shoulder a
familiar voice sounded in her ear and be-
side her stood old valgard

  you child he whispered nay no
noise we are too near that painted ship
and enemies may hear us i had crept up
on her to get what wisdom i could this
way and we will soon be with friends

  he guided her back to the grounds and
through the dark fog-wrapped streets his
seamans instinct steering him infallibly till
at last they came to the familiar spot where
the northmens tents had been partially re-
erected

  here is a friend master he called to
ragnarr who rose from his wooden stool
and came to greet them this is tyrs
own night i have not felt a good fog for
weeks and it minds me of home

  ragnarr took the girls hands in his and
led her to the fire then wrapped her in a warm
woolen mantle his eyes bespoke anxiety

  what is it child he asked is your
mistress well

  rala told her story swiftly with rapid
eloquent gestures all the pantomimists
art was hers and the tale sank deep into the
hearts of the hearers

  so she bids you flee she concluded
get to your ship while ye may and escape
for her sake aye-and for mine too

  her voice failed her and the tears came
nay by tyr and the gray sword
cried ragnarr his face terrible with grief
and rage men will ye follow me tonight
in a desperate venture that may mean
death

  aye master they cried crowding
around him their rough faces kindled with
the exaltation of battle we will follow
where the gray sword leads

  but you are unarmed protested rala
panic-stricken

  our boats are moored just astern of the
cretan galley said ragnarr there is
one chance in ten that we can reach them
unobserved

  nay master old valgard interrupted
i have just returned from the shore where
having crept up through the darkness and
the fog i loosed the boats one after another
and drew them an arrow-fiight down-stream
in this blackness we can easily reach them
undiscovered and go to sea

  thou art one in a thousand cried rag-
narr warmly lead us to the boats we
will row swiftly down to the gray wolf and
bring her softly up-stream with all our good
fellows who have been expecting us these
many hours above here we will land again
rala shall lead us through the secret passage
she speaks of and there will be unbidden
guests at this princelings wedding

  the men would have raised a tremendous
shout had not ragnarr quickly forestalled
them for silence was vital to the success of
their enterprise

  the fog had spoiled all the pleasure of
the fair the streets were empty even of
patrolling archers and from close-shut
booth and hut came loud grumblings and
louder snores as sixteen mighty figures and
one little one filed softly down to the shore
unseen rala walked beside ragnarr who
as if to manifest his gratitude for her plucky
efforts to save him showed the utmost gen-
tleness in helping her through the filthy un-
lit alleys half-blocked with everybodys
bales huge pieces of straw-matting shards
of broken wine-jugs and an oriental luxuri-
ance of garbage

  old valgard led them to the river-bank
and after a brief search he found the spot
where he had moored the boats at his low
whistle the others gathered round and


adventure

cautiously climbed in rala being lifted
aboard bodily by valgards sturdy arms

  they muffled the oars with strips of
cloth and with infinite care to avoid splash-
ing or knocking they rowed down-stream
each oarsman taking his time from the man
before him the fog was so thick that the
northmen could not even see the lights
of the cretan galley so they knew that
they were quite safe from her for the
present the current made their task
much lighter and it was not long before
they floated out of the river-mouth into
the little bay

  here arose a fresh difficulty they might
row directly to their ship which such ex-
perienced seamen had little doubt of find-
ing even on such a night but it would be
hard to rouse all hands unship the long oars
and start the gray wolf up-river without
alarming the coast-guard it was most
likely in this event that the watchers in the
tower would suspect them of hostile designs
and alarm the entire city

  it would be wiser decided ragnarr to ap-
proach the guard-tower boldly call for
kamas and presenting the letters which
dardanus had given him demand in the
kings name to be allowed to take the gray
wolf up-river to the old city landing above
the fair-grounds

  fortunately for ragnarr to whom the
courtly babylonian script that was the regu-
lar diplomatic medium of that day was no
more than so many wedges of black on
white the prudent dardanus in his desire
to avoid any specific action which the cre-
tans might seize upon had phrased the let-
ter of introduction in the most all-embrac-
ing general terms at the sight of it kamas
saluted the kings seal gave the desired per-
mission and went back to his supper be-
fore the trojan officer had finished his sec-
ond helping of broiled fish the gray wolf
with the small boats hoisted aboard sweeps
muffled and arms served out was moving
silently up the broad scamander

  ragnarr himself took the steering-oar re-
joicing in the feel of the fog-damp on the
shaft for he had been off the sea longer
than he liked he steered by memory and
the feel of the current for he could see no
further than the mast

  presently a dim high shape loomed up
off the port bow and he swung the galley
so far to starboard that her bottom scraped
thrice on the shoaling sands three vague

blots of light starred the fog to port and
the sounds of high-pitched pleading voices
reached the northmens ears

  rala standing at ragnarrs side whis-
pered very softly

  master they fear the fog which is
thicker than it has been on these shores for
many years they know it for a sign of the
sea-gods anger and they pray to him that
no harm may come of it

  it is our night answered ragnarr

  they rowed on till he knew they had pass-
ed the next bend in the river where the gal-
ley would be well hidden from below even
in broad daylight by the trees of the same
grove in which he had told ilia of his love
bringing the gray wolf alongside the bank
and ordering the mast to be lowered rag-
narr quickly disembarked most of his crew
and ordered rala to lead them to the city
wall and the entrance to the secret pas-
sage

  it was well hidden a whole precious
hour was wasted in the search before they
found the opening cunningly concealed
in the cleft between two great stones
which rala owing to the darkness and
her haste had failed to notice when she
emerged

  through the narrow opening the north-
men crept feeling their way along till val-
gard stopped them with an impatient growl
from his pouch he drew a dry piece of soft-
wood a blunted hardwood drill a miniature
bow and a handful of wood-dust and shav-
ings twirling the drill with the bow-
string he soon had a smoking glowing mass
in the notched center of the softwood piece
and this he blew and fed with shavings till
fire burst forth

  now fat pine torches were kindled and
as they illumined the way strange sights
met the northmens eyes scenes of bat-
tle of the chase and of worship covered the
stone walls of the tunnel in continuous
fresco these were fresh-painted for the
passage was new as was shown by the heaps
of glistening stone-dust chips and even de-
fective blocks discarded by the builder and
not yet cleared away

 presently the northmen came to the
wide vault which rala had noticed on the
way out and now she plucked ragnarr by
the sleeve halting his men with a gesture
he looked up at the place to which she point-
ed in the ceiling of the tunnel not six inches
above his own tall head
in the grip of the minotaur



  first running his finger round the edge
of the stone to make sure it was free from
mortar ragnarr rested the palms of both
hands against it and lifted mightily the
stone moved slightly but settled again
once more he heaved rising on the balls of
his feet and putting every ounce of strength
into the thrust

  the great block rose slowly hung a mo-
ment then rolled over on its side leaving an
opening wide enough for a broad-shouldered
man to crawl through lifting himself
easily ragnarr took a swift glance at what
lay above and dropped back looking well-
pleased

  it is the temple of the mother he said
softly follow me you who left your wea-
pons here

  they made their way to the altar where
ragnarr counted off the stones till he came
to the one which he had seen kamas press
as he handled it the stone swung inward
and there lay their good bronze weapons
gleaming faintly in the dim light of the sin-
gle lamp that burned before the mighty fig-
ure of the goddess

  swiftly the prince passed the swords and
axes one by one to their owners till at last
every man in the company was armed
then they dropped back into the passage
and pressed on neglecting to replace the
great stone

  on they hastened up steep slopes and
around sharp corners till the tunnel came
to a sudden end thrusting his massive
shoulder against the narrow closure rag-
narr lunged his whole body back of the
blow and fell prone as the door flew open
valgard leaping out over the prostrate
ragnarr threw himself at something that
lay still on the pavement of the corridor
then he rose wiping his fingers

  dead already he announced the
fool was asleep against the door and fell on
his own spear

chapter viii

the song of the sword

	i he six stone lamps in the palace shrine
shone down on a solemn little com-
pany upon high thrones at opposite ends
of the room sat dardanus and a thin little
old man with flowing robes and a long
white beard this dignitary the high
priest of the mother wore about his neck

the symbol of his office the twisted golden
chain of intertwining serpents

  dardanus was clad in his most sumptuous
scarlet robes of state and wore a broad gold
band about his temples his right hand
held an ivory scepter tipped with a heavy
golden ball

  midway between the thrones stood a low
altar with crescent horns of consecration
attached to each of its four faces and touch-
ing at the tips to the left of the altar and
facing the high priest stood prince ambro-
geos with the admiral rhodonthos by his
side to the right stood ilia clad all in
white with a silver diadem upon her head
beside her was a sad-eyed matron the tro-
jan queen her face wearing the patient look
of one who has suffered much

  all semblance of happiness had vanished
from ilias eyes she was face to face with
her fate and she knew not whether her lover
had escaped from his triumphant enemy
her brave spirit kept down any sign of the
terror that sickened her soul she looked
upon her fate with unfaltering queenlike
majesty

  the high priest rose his feeble hands lift-
ed high above his head at this sign dar-
danus came slowly to his feet down the
three steps of his throne and delivered to
the queen a chain of gold then he stood
motionless facing the priest the queen
turned kissed the chain and laid it about
ilias neck then taking her daughter by the
hand she led her to the altar

 ambrogeos and rhodonthos now bowed
their heads before the high priest turned
and stepped to the altar across whose
sacred horns ambrogeos and ilia joined
hands then the high priest began to in-
tone the chant of the mother and as he
sang the first stave in his quavering falsetto
two lines of priests marched in through the
wide doorway chanting the marriage
hymn

o thou who all things quickenest

who givest life to all that dwell on earth

descend from thy thrice holy seat

to bless and fructify this wedded pair

hallow their love and guide their steps

through life to life life-giving all their days

till lost to earth from earth released

in thee they blend again in changeless wedlock

   live

  the song ceased and swiftly in strange
and wild antiphony there rose a ringing
voice


adventure

tyr

           while blade cleaves to handle

          while blood dyes the edges

          while gray sword slayeth

          and gray wolf devoureth

          his fame shall soar upward
          as soars the swift eagle

          the ravening war-bird

          who rendelh his foemen

tyr

  all stood staring in petrified wonder
between the ranks of frightened priests a
towering figure strode eyes blazing under
the bronze helmet the right hand clutching
a great naked sword whose hard gray
edges flashed in the lamplight like flickering
fire

  it was ragnarr and behind him trooped
rank on rank of armed and stern-eyed men
among the first swaggered hjalti the bard
whose tongue had been loosed by the sing-
ing of the priests ragnarr strode to the
altar with eyes only for ilia who rushed to
him with a glad cry

  ambrogeos turned pale but less from
fright than fury he stood for a moment
clutching at the place where his sword-hilt
would have been then seizing the heavy
scepter from the kings hand he struck at
ragnarr with all his might

  valgard sprang in his mighty ax circling
round his head but before he could strike
ragnarr thrust ilia into the old warriors
arms and the gray sword descended to
meet the white staff it cut the tough ivory
handle into two pieces and turning struck
the cretan an awful though a glancing
blow full on the head ambrogeos fell his
blood streaming from the wound the
northmen raised their crashing battle-cry
of tyr

  now were heard the jingling clank of ac-
coutrements and the running of many feet
and through the doorway poured a detach-
ment of the royal guard the soldiers
halted in amazement at the scene but grim
old rhodonthos cried

  warriors avenge the slaughter of your
monarchs guest strike these bold mur-
derers down

  but the soldiers hesitated for between
them and their king stood the stern north-
men swords and axes raised while high
above the cowering dardanus towered the
mighty valgard his ax poised above the
kings head

  stir and i strike he shouted

  ragnarr stood over the smitten ambro-

geos his threatening eyes and dripping
sword striking terror to the trojans hearts

  o king he cried pointing to the
guardsmen it is not seemly that all these
should hear the words we have to speak to-
gether is it your will-as it is mine-that
all these should go

  the soldiers stood irresolute but the
king his tongue loosened by the sight of
the cruel ax that hovered longingly above
him bade them withdraw priests and sol-
diery filed slowly out their faces blank and
staring after them strode the admiral
rhodonthos his fierce eyes hot with hatred

  again ilia came to ragnarrs arms

  you have done what none in troy was
brave enough to do she said in tones vi-
brant with triumphant love but i fear
greatly lest this very deed bring death to
you and to all of us that are here if that
befall then i shall die as i have lived lov-
ing you now shall i go also or is it right
for me to hear what you and my father have
to say to each other

  you shall stay answered ragnarr
valgard look to my bride while i have
speech with my father here

  putting up his ax and descending from
the dais the old warrior drew the girl aside
while all stood silent waiting for the storm
to burst

  dardanus shifted his gaze uneasily under
the northmans piercing eyes his hands
opened and closed nervously and he swal-
lowed once or twice to easethe dryness of
his throat suddenly he could endure it no
longer terrified conscious of guilt as he
was some spark of his youthful fire came
back to him as the contemptuous glance of
the young man roused anger in his heart
and resentment at the violation of his
hearth

  you rash young fool he shrilled
stamping his foot was it not enough that
your ill-omened presence in my land brought
crete about my ears must you now com-
plete my ruin think you that minos will
not take vengeance for this murderous deed
aye and a bloody vengeance well will it
be if one of us survive to tell the tale of the
sea-kings sacrifice to the ghost of his first-
born

  peace interrupted ragnarr is there
aught old trembler that you fear more
than death i have done no more than
my right i have slain or grievously wound-
ed the man who thought to rob me i have
in the grip of the minotaur



won my bride with my sword-hand and
have forced her perjured father to treat with
me in the open where lies and broken
promises will not avail him

  i have braved a people in arms with a
few men and have declared war on my ene-
mies and yours as for this lump of flesh-
and he touched the prone ambrogeos with
his foot-it is no use to raise an outcry
over him if he is not slain outright it mat-
ters not when the sword tyrfing sets her
teeth in a man he is doomed speak of
what counts what do you propose to do
stay here and wait for the coming of this
minos or flee

  dardanus trembled with rage

  thrice-accursed barbarian he scream-
ed you bring death upon me and ask if i
mean to take it standing or running oh
if my frame had the vigor of youth once
more and i were armed one thing i can
do wolf of the waters the compact be-
tween us is no more-i stamp upon it my
daughter shall never be yours in this life
unless you add robbery to murder and tear
her from her helpless fathers arms if you
dare do that my curse upon you both
now go to your ship hoist your abhorred
sail and lift the ban of the gods from my
shores

  now ragnarrs ears caught the tramp of
booted feet and rhodonthos stood in the
doorway with four armed cretans behind
him

   is it the slayers will that we bear his vic-
tims body hence he asked in even tones

  the northmen raised their shields and
drew together save ragnarr who advanced
and spoke with grim courtesy

  sea-thief i will not deny the boon a
brave man asks take your lord and may
we meet again

  may i live to see that day replied the
cretan earnestly

  he signed to his men who entered picked
up the prostrate and unmoving ambrogeos
and bore him away on a framework of
spears at the doorway rhodonthos paused

and looked back till his eyes met those of
dardanus

  dog of minos he hissed we go now
but we shall return to levy such a tribute as
will bring wailing into every house in troy
and spread a royal banquet for the mino-
taur

  valgard who stood by ilias side bent
over the princess and said softly

  when we leave this place we go straight
to our ship the tide will be at the flood in
two hours more if you are bold enough
come through the passage to the grove on
the rivers bank by the southwest gate
we will wait for you he does not know

  i will come she answered simply

  ragnarr looked almost pityingly at the
poor old king who had fallen to his knees
his face as yellowy-white as his cloven scep-
ter

  after all said the northman it is i
who have brought this evil upon you and
none but i should bear what comes of it
what tribute is it the sea-thief speaks of
and what manner of monster is this mino-
taur

  how should i know dardanus groan-
ed wearily they who have seen him have
not lived to tell of it every year crete has
wrung from us a tribute of twenty youths
and twenty maidens for this minotaur and
none has ever looked upon their faces again
it is said and all men believe it that he is a
fearful monster who devours them living
now minos will have a life from every
household for this deed and we are fortu-
nate if he asks no more oh that i have
lived to see this day

  ragnarr raised gray tyrfing above his
head and shook it in his mighty grip

  by this sword he swore and by tyr
the god of my house this is my task and i
take it upon myself i will sail to this
island of crete give myself up to meet this
minotaur who fattens on innocent blood
and slay him in single combat then o
dardanus i will return and claim my
bride

to be continued
    yi was sunday the skidders
i the log-loaders the geared loco-
ija motives the ax and the saw of
cssms the woodsmen were silent over
the mountains lay the soft blue haze that
somehow hallows all the days of september
and october

  the midday meal was over and most of
the lumberjacks clad in their best lounged
here and there on the big rough boarding-
house porches some of them bullied their
friends good-naturedly others told funny
stories all of them were smoking moun-
taineers they were nine out of every ten
of them stalwart sunburned big-hearted
sons of the hills

  suddenly one of them that was not a
mountaineer a heavily built man under
thirty who never alluded to his past any
more than if he had had no past what-
ever rose and went upstairs and to his un-
plastered unceiled unpapered room where
even the bedframe was made of rough
boards

  he halted just inside a strapping young
fellow in cheap blue serge turned from a
small mirror that hung on the opposite wall
he had been giving his thick black hair a
careful combing when he saw his room-
mate he reddened a little

  hello marvin he drawled in the drawl
of the hills-he was a hill man

  marvin blair laughed and sat down heav-
ily on their cheap bed

  all togged up to go to see old henry
larrimores girl he said briskly

  it aint a criminal offense is it smiled
the mountaineer

  i guess not laughed blair fact is
i meant to go to see her myself this after-
noon

  tom harman looked thoughtful and
somewhat perplexed they had been pretty
good friends he and marvin blair and now
-now was a woman coming between them

  well he said finally i aint got no
mortgage on her youve got as good a
right to go to see her as me i reckon we
shore wont fall out over bess marvin
but we oughtnt to both go to see her at the
same time spose we pitch heads and tails
and see who goes and who dont go

  blair nodded

  heads you go tails i go

  the mountaineer took a small coin from
his pocket and tossed it almost to the raf-
ters it fell heads up

  lucky boy said marvin blair shrug-
ging his shoulders

  tom harman stole down by way of the
back stairway to avoid a ragging and hur-
ried off through the woodland from a
window marvin blair watched him go with
a strange light in his eyes more than one
pair of good friends have been brought to
swords points by a woman

  old henry larrimore lived a mile away
in a rambling log cabin at the head of a
a woman keeps a secret



cove the guttered path that led from the
weather-beaten gate to the front porch was
lined with frost-bitten marigolds and pretty-
by-nights

  old henry sat in a home-made chair in
the doorway and he held an open bible
in his hand beside his chair lay a spotted
hound with its tongue lolling out

  tom harman stopped at the stone step
straightened the collar of his blue cham-
bray sliirt jerked at his tie and uttered a
greeting

  larrimore looked up

 hi tom how dye come on take
at chair thar on the porch fine day
been to dinner i reckon set down then

  tom sat down and patted the hounds
head most dogs made friends easily with
tom harman and children liked him and
this is eulogy

  whars bess at he asked awkwardly

  bess old henry bit off a chew of
twisted brown tobacco i don know
at was shore a fine little rifle ye bought for
bess tom but im afeard ye laid out too
much money on it blast my eyes tom
harman ef she caint beat me a-shootin
with it she vows ef ever us and them thar
low-down fallses gits to fightin agin shes
a-goin to hep good stuff in that gyurl
tom and it now looks like thed be more
trouble atwixt us and the fallses joe
falls hes been a-carryin talk around putty
sharp

  bess hates joe by gar she turns as
white as a ghost when she even hears his
name spoke as you know tommy we
alius thought it was joe falls at killed my
boy george-pore george he was the
finest boy in the world twin brother to
bess he was-thars bess now down at
the spring in the lorrels she run i reckon
when she seed you a-comin the mink

  with a long arm he pointed

  harman patted the hounds head again
rose and went down to the spring where he
found a slender young woman who was in
all truth a nymph of the woods-an unedu-
cated primitive young woman she was
barefooted and bareheaded and her chest-
nut-brown hair was caught at the back of
her neck with a faded blue ribbon her eyes
were brown too her mouth was sweet and
mischievous very mischievous she smiled
saucily at tom harman

  hi bess he greeted her

   lo tom she replied

  they sat down on a moss-covered stone
there by the spring in the shade of a great
cool green hemlock tree tom broke off a
fern and began to strip the leaves from the
stem he spoke slowly even for him when
he spoke

  bess he said i love ye and ive come
to ax ye to marry me and jine yore forchunes
with mine and be my wife whats the
verdict

 why-i thought you hated all
wimmin laughed bess

  tom frowned hard his gaze absently
followed a bee-martin that was chasing a
bee

  i did say i did he muttered  a long
time ago five year ago it was i imagined

i	was in love with julie flint over on
grandpap mountain i wasnt but jest
eighteen then and a fool i sold mydawg
and my banjo to buy her a gagement ring
-and she went and told it and laughed
about it told it fust and en laughed about
it a woman jest caint keep a secret its
onpossible for a woman to keep a secret
he had spoken with a great deal of spirit
it was the spirit of the hill pride the finest
and yet the most unreasoning pride on
earth but bess misunderstood if he didnt
still love the grandpap mountain girl why
was he so worked up

  heres a woman at can keep a secret
tom she said spicily im a-keepin a
secret now its a big secret too tom har-
man its so big ef i was to tell you you-
youd shore jump

  tell me begged tom i wont never
tell hope to die and go to the devil the next
minute ef i do

  no said bess im a-goin to show
you that a woman can keep a secret
tom spent ten precious minutes in plead-
ing she refused stoutly to tell

  i bet i know he muttered youre
a-goin to marry marvin blair

  am i she said am i she went on
why dont you quit loggin for a livin
tom and go to tellin forchunes

  well smiled the mountaineer you

  no flatly no i wont go over to
grandpap mountain and marry julie flint
good-by tom and luck be with ye when
ye go atter julie

  she rose and ran from him he watched
her go with fire in his eyes he loved her


adventure

madly as he had never loved the perfidious
julie flint slowly he made his way back
to the logging-camps boarding-house

the other lumberjacks were stand-
ing in somber little groups here and
there on the porches when he ar-
rived something out of the ordinary had
taken place he knew then marvin blair
beckoned to him and they went upstairs-
together

  when they were in their room blair closed
the door and turned to harman blairs
face was pale and anxious

  i didnt mean to tell even you tom
began blair but now i think id better
theyve sent for an officer and hell be here
any minute tom joe falls is downstairs
dead they brought him in from mad dog
creek a few minutes after you left for
henry larrimores he had been dead for
several hours the gun that killed him was
a small-bored rifle the only small-bored
rifle in this whole section is the one you
gave bess bess hated joe like poison
because she thought he killed her twin
brother now do you see where she
stands

  the devil cried the hill man smoth-
eredly but she never done it-did she
marvin

  blair looked behind him

  yes he whispered she did it i saw
her do it

  harmans big hands clenched hard

  see here blair he growled his voice
throbbing you aint a-lyin about her are
you

  lying about her blair was white
tom i love bess as much as you do i
was on my way to see her this morning and
just before i reached mad dog creek i saw
joe falls in the woods ahead of me then i
heard a rifle-shot and i saw joe crumple
like a wet rag and pitch forward with his
face in the leaves i looked toward the little
cloud of powder smoke and there stood bess
larrimore with the little rifle you gave her
in her hands i hurried back here to tell
you then i decided i wouldnt tell any-
body but the size of the bullet will cause
her arrest-that and the fact that she hated
joe so much and when her trial comes off
she wont stand for the grilling of the pros-
ecuting attorney and her very nerve will
give her away

  through harmans brain there flashed

something bess had said to him less than an
hour before im keepin a secret now
its a big secret too so the killing of the
man who she believed had killed the
brother she had loved more than life that
was her big secret that poor little hot-
headed fiery-souled child he regretted
that he had given her the rifle

  blair continued in tones that were low
and tense

  even if the larrimores prove that joe
falls killed the son of old henry it wont
clear the girl and its up to you and me to
save her tpm my friend one of us must
make a sacrifice for this girl we both love
either of us is big enough to do it we
would have a chance of escape but bess
wouldnt dont you see tom well are
you game

  am i game muttered the mountaineer
inclined toward feeling insulted at being
asked marvin my middle name is game
howll we decide which one of us is to make
the sacrifice

  blair took a coin from his pocket it was
a copper cent

  tails its you he whispered and heads
its me is that all right

  pitch it said tom

  blair flipped the coin to the rafters it
spun in the air over and over and fell with
a slight tinkle the two men bent forward
anxiously

  its up to me said harman straighten-
ing and he said it without regret like a
man

  they shook hands silently and then they
went downstairs

ii

fifteen minutes later harman
walked into the room where all that
was left of joe falls lay under an
old quilted coverlet the room was
crowded

  harman forced his way to where a tall
and lean bearded man bent over the silent
figure the lean bearded man was a
deputy sheriff and he had only that minute
arrived

  does anybody here know who killed this
man he asked quietly his shaggy brows
drawn above his alert gray eyes

  i done it said tom harman putting
out his wrists for the irons

  now bill hines knew harman and he
a woman keeps a secret



knew that harman had a reputation as a
good fair fighter

  it seems to me you was hasty tom
slowly you could ha broke joe falls
over your knee and saved gunpowder
what made you do it tom

  i reckon ill carry my little bit o talk
to the trile jedge bill drawled harman
ef youre ready to go i am

  the deputy ironed the mountaineer and
drew his revolver not that he thought he
might need it for harman but because there
was danger of the dead mans relatives
making a violent demonstration hines took
the prisoner out to where his horse stood
hitched to a little cedar and mounted
then with harman walking briskly in the
road ahead of him he started for a town in
the lowlands

  not for one second had the mountaineer
meant to face a trial in the courthouse at
johnsboro nor did he mean to allow himself
to be even locked up in the johnsboro jail
he was fully determined that he would es-
cape from hines before they reached the
lowlands but he had a little talking to do
before he made his escape and he proceed-
ed to it

  bill he said over his shoulder ef
youve threatened to kill me on sight and i
shoot you down the fust time we meet can
i be sent up for that

  hines answered-not if you can prove
that i threatened to kill you on sight
harman stopped as suddenly as if he had
been struck he acted well indeed

  the devil he cried as if greatly cha-
grined bill hines i haint got no wit-
nesses to prove it by

  looks bad lets go on tom said
hines

  he seemed more watchful than before
he kept his hand close to the butt of his
revolver now bill hines had an oath to
keep and he meant to keep it had the
prisoner been his own mothers son it would
have made no difference

  but harman had to escape he was like
the rabbit that climbed a tree over and
over in his mind he turned this plan and
that he thought of leaping from a cliff
the road ran on and hiding himself all but
his nose in a pool of the creek below he
thought of frightening hiness horse and
making a quick dive into the thick laurels-
and half a dozen other things-but none of
these methods promised enough



  hines was accustomed to tricks hines
himself was a fox harman did not fall
upon an idea that thoroughly pleased him
until they had covered several miles

  how small the things that sometimes de-
cide human destinies twice that day al-
ready the tide of tom harmans life had
been turned by the mere tossing of a coin
and still another turn was at hand this
time it was so little a thing as the sight of a
gray squirrel that ran along on the ground
whisking its bushy tail and making a noise
something like the quacking of a young
duck

  it was in the squirrel-shooting season
had it not been the seventh day the woods
would have rung with the echoes of the
hunters rifle as it was harman had
heard only one shot generally speaking
the hillfolk remember the sabbath

  suddenly harman stopped and faced
about

  a word with ye bill he said and he
seemed badly frightened them fallses
will take a shot at me as shore as the devils
bad as soon as we git in them thick hickry
woods ahead thar i want to ax ye bill to
keep both o yore eyes wide open for a
falls with a rifle i haint in a fix to defend
myself now

  hines seemed impressed

  ive been thinking of that he growled

  another mile they made they had al-
most passed through a long stretch of gold-
en-yellow hickories when from the moun-
tainside above and to the right there came
the keen thunder of a rifle and tom har-
man wheeled and crumpled and fell on his
face in the dust of the road he moaned
and turned on his back and bill hines saw
a red splotch on his blue chambray shirt
squarely over his heart

  i told you-to watch for a falls-you
tin-can officer he muttered disconnectedly
gasping writhing

  when a man is shot straight through the
heart there is no chance for him to live
bill hines swore a loud oath spurred his
horse and rode his revolver ready in his
hand into the hickories a moment later
he surprised a bare-headed and freckled
youth in the act of ramming a round bullet
into the barrel of an old muzzle-loader

  youll shoot a man ive got arrested
will you cried hines hands up you-
quick

  the boy smiled good-naturedly


adventure

  youve treed the wrong coon mister
he drawled i shot a squirrel thar it
is

  he pointed to a gray-tail lying on the
leaves light broke to bill hines the fox
he rode at a breakneck pace back to where
he had left tom harman for dead har-
man was gone

  i knowed said harman to the friend
who with a hammer and an ax broke the
irons from his wrists late that night that
thed shorely be a hunter in them hickries
sunday or no sunday so i gethered me a
handful o pokeberries from the side o the
road to make blood and took the resk
and so now its me for kaintucky so long
much obliged and good luck

  the night and the laurels swallowed him

there were no logging-camps in
that section of the blue grass state
to which tom harman went un-
der a high-sounding name he hired himself
to a wealthy horse-breeder and the horse-
breeder liked him paid him good money for
his work and asked no questions

  for nearly three years he tried to be con-
tented with the idea that he had sacrificed
home and friends and his hearts desire in a
worthy cause then he began to think
backward frequently of bess and his moth-
er and the blooming laurels on black pine
mountain and the call came the longing
was too great to be thrown down

  he wore a nicely pointed young black
beard now and he was of the opinion that
even his own brother would have difficulty
in recognizing him so he decided that he
would just slip back home and see bess again
and his people and his good friend marvin
blair then slip back to  kentucky without
the laws being any the wiser and perhaps
-perhaps he would bring bess back with
him as his wife he believed she loved him
and if she did love him could she refuse to
marry him after what he had done for her

  back to tennessees dim blue hills went
tom harman and he walked the last hun-
dred miles of the journey because he did not
like to run the risk of meeting the fox bill
hines

  at noon of a day toward the last of july
he reached the crest of long low black pine
mountain and sat himself down on a stone
to rest spread out before him beautiful
in the waxen white of the laurel bloom was
his beloved home country the old logging-

camp was still there but a great deal of the
timber of course was gone

  from where he sat he could see neither
his fathers nor old henry larrimores cab-
in so he gave his attention wholly to his old
friends the sputtering locomotive the thun-
dering skidders and the long-armed log-
loader

  for half an hour he sat there and watched
it then he rose and went rapidly down the
mountainside to shake the right hand of
marvin blair if he was still there and har-
man hoped he was blair of course
wouldnt tell and when he had seen his old
friend he would go over to see bess

  he found blair easily blair was giving
orders to a pair of cutters-he now held a
foremans place-and that was good har-
man was very glad of that

  harman stepped out of the blooming
laurels and confronted his old partner

  marvin do you know me he cried
happily

  not from a side of sole-leather said
blair halting abruptly

  tom smiled the mountaineer

  harman exclaimed blair howre
you tom

  keen as a mink they shook hands
hows bess larrimore marvin

  all right said blair he went on nerv-
ously say bill hines has haunted this
place almost daily since you got away from
him he feels that his honor will never be
made whole until he gets you-you know
how he is tom and hed know you
through your beard hed know you if
you had a bears face on you better sneak
over to your fathers and hide there and
do it quick ill be over tonight to see you
and ill tell bess youre here be careful
hines holds out that you will be caught if it
takes the rest of his life

  all right said harman and he dove
into the thick laurels

  almost on a line between him and his
fathers cabin was the cabin of old henry
larrimore and the temptation to stop and
see bess for one little minute became strong
he yielded to it and went creeping up to the
spring under the giant hemlock bess was
nowhere in sight and he went on to the
house a gray-nosed old hound came to the
weather-beaten gate to meet him and he
gave it a friendly pat on the head then he
hallooed softly

  bess came to the door he saw that she
a woman keeps a secret	

was a full-grown woman now mature and
roundish she wore her hair up and she
wore shoes and stockings and skirts of blue
percale reached to her ankles it was evi-
dent that she did not know him forgetting
all about bill hines he acted upon a mis-
chievous impulse and said to her

  im a travelin fortune-teller kind lady
and all i charge for a full life readin is the
pitiful sum of ten cents your money back
if youre not satisfied

  it came smoothly enough nearly three
years of association with kentucky horse-
men had taken away much of his native
dialect

  come in and have a chair on the porch
said bess with a vague unhappiness in her
voice ill bring out the money

  harman went to the porch and sat down
he drew the rim of his broad black hat low
over his eyes to prevent her from recogniz-
ing him she came out gave him a nickel
and five pennies and sat down in a chair
facing him he put the money into his
pocket and reached for her hand

  a man who loves you is not far away
he began in a monotone staring intently at
her palm he has come back here to ask
you to marry him he couldnt think of
anything but you in the daytime nor dream
of anything but you at night up in ken-
tucky he loves you more than life and if
you love him the devil hisself caint keep

you two apart if you-

  the young woman tore her hand from his
and went to her feet she knew him now
even through his beard

  tom she cried broken-heartedly and
there was all the grim tragedy and suffering
of death in her brown eyes tom youve
come back for me and i-ive done went
and married myself to a man i hate
married

  harman too went to his feet his face
was chalky white and he looked at her with
stern and bitter reproach

  two months ago she said to mar-
vin blair

ill

iffl she bent her head crushed bro-
pphj ken he stood over her primitive
strong and terrible and yet he
tried to reason with himself she had never

promised to be his wife still-

what made you marry him he asked

and his voice was pinched down so much
that the woman thought he was speaking
gently

  i didnt think id ever see you any
more she answered weakly and hopelessly
my father and mother died after you left
i wanted a home of my own i decided id
as well marry marvin as anybody else or
better acause he was yore best friend i
understood but i soon hated him hes
mean to me hes a brute marvin blairs
a brute to look at him and to hear him
talk youd think he was a saint but he
aint hes oily tom he fooled you he
caint be no friend to anybody 

  yes i reckon he fooled me agreed
harman but he wont never fool me no
more and he wont never treat you mean
no more i run away the other time to save
you but this time ill run away to save my-
self bess i-

  bess had raised her head the man be-
fore her read surprise even amazement in
her countenance

  you say you run away the other time to
save me she cried how come it that
you run away to save me are you crazy
tom or am i i dont know what you
mean tom oh i wisht you hadnt ha
killed joe falls he ought o have been

killed but you-

  killed joe falls cut in the hill man
taking the woman by the shoulders why
you-you was the one that killed joe
falls you done it with the little rifle i
bought for you

  oh tom almost hysterically you
know i couldnt kill a man dont you
light broke to harman suddenly he
understood marvin blair himself had
killed joe falls in a card game of course
and afterward blair had cleverly covered
his crime and cleared the way to the pretti-
est girl in the black pine section at one
cunning stroke

  it threw harman into a boiling rage
and he was disappointed too truly the
real friends of a mans lifetime may be
counted on ones fingers for friendship is
scarce and finer less selfish than any other
kind of love but after all blair had wil-
lingly taken his chance on the tossing of a
coin there tom harman found himself
in a dilemma

  he told bess all about it bess went
into the cabin and returned a moment later
with a fully loaded automatic pistol of


adventure

small caliber which explained much to
harman that pistol had been used in the
killing of joe falls he was sure he un-
loaded it and gave it back to bess

  put it where you found it he said to
her ill be back tonight to have a little
talk with marvin he went on turning
toward the gate and youd better not be
here

  you aint a-goin to kill him tom

  no i guess not ill own up that id
like to but i dont want to ruin yore future
and mine by doin it

  his future and hers she blushed hap-
pily-

  toms people told him they had not seen
bill hines for months plainly blair had
lied then tom and his father laid a plan
and mark harman took his long rifle and
went to see that blair did not try to make
an escape

at sundown while tom sat at
the supper-table bill hines walked
in with a revolver in his hand

  ive got you tom he said quietly
yes i guess you have bill replied
tom and he ate on as if it were a very com-
monplace thing to be arrested on a charge of
murder have some supper old hoss
thanks not if i know it hines winked
youll play no more tricks on me tom
you wont get away this time

  i wont laughed harman with a
broad wedge of huckleberry pie in hands
how do you know i wont

  wait and see if you do smilingly
when you got away from me three years
ago you done something to brag about
tom

  i know it marvin blair sent for you
didnt he telephoned

  hines declined to answer and by that
harman knew that he had guessed cor-
rectly

  on the mountainside above a heavily
built anxious man watched the harman
cabin as a hawk watches a squirrels nest
and back in the blooming laurels and old
mountaineer with a long rifle in his hands
watched him just as closely when bill
hines had taken his prisoner toward the
johnsboro jail marvin blair drew a long
breath of relief and started rapidly home-
ward and behind him stalking him as
silently as ever he had stalked a bear or a
deer went old mark harman

  it was pitchy dark when blair reached the
cabin that he called home there was no
light in the log-house at which he wondered
he entered lighted a lamp that was on a
small home-made table and called for bess
there was no answer frowning he took
the automatic pistol from its place on the
high smoked mantel and dropped it into his
pocket and then he sat down at the little
table and began to turn certain matters over
in his mind

  then the front door opened suddenly
and in stepped tom harman and there was
no officer with him

  hi marvin said harman with a very
good imitation of the camaraderie of the
old days as he dropped into a chair across
the table from besss husband

  hello muttered blair worriedly and
his right hand went to the butt of the little
blue pistol in his coat-pocket seen bill
hines

  yes he arrested me and i got away
from him with a broad smile it was a
victorious smile too

  how

  used my brains like i done before also
i took his star and his gun from him-

see

  he turned his left coat-lapel and showed a
shining deputy-sheriffs badge just above
the edge of the table he thrust the round nose
of a big revolver

  im actin deputy-sheriff now he went
on his voice growing harder and i am
here to arrest you for killin joe falls in a
card game

  all in the space of a second marvin blair
darted downward aimed the little blue
pistol and pulled the trigger harman
laughed

  id done unloaded it he said and i
watched you when you come in to see that
you didnt notice it and you didnt take
your chair and lets have a talk for old
times sake maybe ill give you a chance

  white-faced blair crept back into his
chair the mountaineer tossed a copper
cent to the table

  lets pitch a few heads and tails he
suggested to show you im game and a
sport if youll throw heads once out o ten
throws ill leave the country and keep my
mouth shut im a man o my word mar-
vin you know that but if you dont throw
heads once out o ten throws youre to
write a confession to clear me and then
the manhood of a chinaman



leave the country yourself startin right
now is it a go

  its a go weakly and dazedly

  blair knew that if ever his case went to
court he was a doomed man he picked up
the penny and tossed it it fell tails up
three more times in succession it fell tails
up it was like a coin enchanted blair
examined it closely in the yellow light of
the oil lamp then he swore bitterly and
threw it disgustedly to the floor

 whats the matter asked harman
quietly is anything wrong with the
penny marvin why man its the very
same penny we pitched nearly three years
ago to see which one of us went up in the
place o the girl we both loved

  he went on in another tone

  you scoundrel you cheat you low-down
piker that penny was made out o two
pennies-its got tails on both sides no
wonder you was willin to take your chance
on tails how did i come by it it was in
fhe ten cents your wife gi me for tellin her
fortune-i didnt know you was married
now you write that confession and light

out or else i take you to johnsboro which
do you want to do

  blair wrote the confession signed it and
gave it to harman then he broke for the
front door-and ran straight into the pow-
erful arms of bill hines when blair had
been ironed the young mountaineer gave the
empty revolver and the badge back to its
owner hines a little distrustful had
kept tom covered while he was working out
his part of that which had just taken place
in the cabin

  when bess had her separation harman
went to see her together they walked
down to the spring among the laurels and
together they sat down on a stone under the
great cool green hemlock

  theres one thing im dyin to know
bess said harman as he slowly stripped
the leaves from a fern what was that se-
cret you was keepin-that big big scret
womanlike she answered his question
with two questions

  couldnt you guess tom blushing
do i haf to beat it into yore head with a
club tom-honey

ite was taking a hike cross
country we had laid up at
mojave for a few weeks cool-
in off an gettin civilized
again as old wade put it

  fact is we had started for los angeles
but there chanced to be a pretty good bunch
of good fellows in town when we struck
mojave and we couldnt resist the tempta-
tion to cool off an get civilized although

the old times thermometer at the station
never pointed at less than  in the shade
and the civilization consisted mostly of sa-
loons and other joints with some pretty
tough citizens for playmates

  it wasnt the mojave of today they have
some churches there now and good schools
most of the dives and some of the saloons
have disappeared and with them has also
iaded away a heap of that element of miners

who used to drop in there for supplies
or to blow their gold-dust at poker crap
roulette tiger or women it was some town
in those days open all around with the
skies for the limit

  and speaking of skies reminds me that
measles says once when we had punched
a burro and hiked it in from caliente and
had stopped to gaze in some wonderment at
a new gospel house that had located there
-says he

  gods got his locatin-stakes out here at
last but its a blue chip again a cigarette
that he never would of got a claim here if
the southern pacific hadnt saw it first an
told folks about it

  measles aint much along the prophet
line but he sometimes speaks parables

  well as i was saying we was taking a
hike cross country old wade measles and
me a fool prospector had blowed in to
mojave and told us in strict confidence-
liquor confidence-of a new strike that had
been made down the valley he mentioned
some landmarks and old wade had a full
page rand mcnally of it in his nut at once
he aint a guesser wade aint on califor-
nia localities he knows

  we was heading for milligan at least
thats how the place is known now for the
same old s p has located it too now but
at that time there wasnt any southern
pacific or any milligan there it was just
desert and black burnt-out hills we was
camped for the night in the hills abovewhere
the town or town-site of milligan now is

  i said we was camped for the night but
we wasnt we was camped for the day for
one does his traveling by night there mostly
you would too if you was tenderfoot
enough to once try a daytime hike in
death valley or any of its suburbs mea-
sles was sweating and roasting a chinaman
who had bested him at a little game of
draw in mojave

  they aint no good says measles
theyre a dirty thievin lyin cowardly
cheatin bunch the whole lot of em an
the next one i sights im goin to smoke him
up proper says he

  as a bunch says old wade you may
have em sized proper they sure aint
much on the tidy-up business but theyll
work and take it from me mister mea-
sles youll smoke up no chink while in my
company unless you can beat me to it in
drawin a gun

  at them remarks i kind of raised up and
took interest in the town topics for ive
noticed that when old wade says mister
to a man with that peculiar stress placed on
the said mister theres some feeling in the
matter and the said party addressed as mis-
ter has somehow trod on slippery ground

  measles got the hunch too for he looks
at old wade kind of sidewise like as it were
and says

  everybody has got his own ideas about
chinks i guess same as about anything
else i aint meanin no disrespect about
any chinaman friends you may have but
if any one has ever noticed a pigtail that
wasnt dirty an a thief an a coward id
like to hear all about him cause i aint-
never

  old wade didnt say a word he just laid
back and smoked after a while though
he says as if he was talking to hisself-

  he sure was dirty an i reckon he was
crooked all right but he wasnt no coward

  was you addressin me says measles

  but old wade didnt answer he just laid
still and smoked after a while he sits up
and looks around first at the hills then
down into the valley where the heat waves
was dancing and where the glittering re-
flections hurt the eyes to look at then
he speaks up speaks kind of slow and low
as if talking to hisself and says

  if i was a painter man an could paint
these hills just as they are if i could paint
them cliffs burned an black with them
splashes of blood red an them streaks of
bright yeller an green an all colors all
standin out in places bold an bright against
that far hill of dull warm gray that seems
to disappear somewheres off there in a sort
of haze of all colors an no colors banked
up by that purple bank of mist or clouds or
whatever it is where the eye stops or if i
was one of them men that can write words
what take hold of you an grip your throat
an swell up your heart till you feel an know
that somewhere is god big enough an
straight enough an knowin enough to
make them hills an that valley down there
-that burnin scorchin killin valley
down there-that valley with its burnin
sands its chokin alkali its untold riches its
side picters of cool lakes an streams where
there aint no water that valley what
offers you alkali when you want bread
sand when you want breath a plumb hell-
heat when you want water death when you
the manhood of a chinaman



want life yes says old wadestanding up
and holding out his hands sort as if he was
going to offer a blessing same as a preach-
er man-yes says he a god brainy
enough to make all this-this color this
stillness this desert this heat an to make
it for a purpose that no man yet knows
to make this the likes of which aint no
place else on earth but in death valley
i say says he if i could paint such a pic-
ter er write such a piece id- 

well says measles sort of gulping

id be able to paint the picter or write
the description of him says old wade

  of who asks measles

  of a chinaman says old wade and
he goes over and leans on a boulder and me
and measles didnt say anything

  pretty soon he comes back slowly filling
his pipe tell us about him i asks him
and he points with his pipe-stem out over
the valley that here lay glistening and
white as if it was paved with snow or ice

  look straight in line with that peak over
yonder about three mile out on the valley
do you see that house there

i see a big rock there says measles

   taint no rock thats a hut-a house
says old wade a house built out of salt
rock salt

  huh says measles

  the chinaman is out there we buried
him just forty steps south of the house
the whole valley there is a bed of rock salt
for miles says old wade

did you shoot him up asks measles

it was seven year ago now an-
swers old wade there had been
a silver rush to a new camp over
yonder beyond that far range theres
some pretty good stuff in the way of silver
over there only everything is all broke up
an no tellin when a lead will pinch out

  i reckon there was about forty or fifty
of us right around there in the near-by hills
there want no town only a camp-a few
tents an a shack or two one gin-palace
had broke into the game though an a
chinaman runs a washec house an does odd
jobs an plays poker

  one day right in midsummer when
hell didnt have nothin on it for hot a
party of three struck the town an it wasnt
long till every man thereabouts had fore-
gathered at the gin-shop to talk about em
for there was a woman an a boy in the

outfit seems they had come west from
illinoy or some of them far eastern states
the man had been a professor in a college
or correspondence school or somethin like
that where they teach all about minin to
tenderfeet who aint never saw a mountain
they was here to show us minin fellers how
minin should be done scientific

  he was a nice little feller all right an
real sociable when he wasnt studyin out
some problem in zo-ology or dox-ology or
somethin like that an the woman she
was a wonder full of ginger and go an
shed shake hands with a feller jest as
though she was a real man i dont jest
re-collect how it happened or why but the
zo-ology man got mixed up with one of the
boys over a claim an we buried him neat as
circumstances would allow in a little side
canon near by

   course the woman takes on somethin
grievous she tells us in several kinds of
language how we was all murderers an
thieves an cowards she gives the high an
mighty to all of us cept the chink she
jest naturally adopted that chinaman an
wouldnt leave him out of her sight i
guess its right all right that the woman
human gets a hunch from somewhere as to
whos straight goods an who aint there
aint no argufyin or reasonin about it-she
jest knows anyhow she thinks she does
so that settles it with any proper man

  well she hustles sam ling-thats the
chink-roun that camp till he gathers to-
gether a outfit an they makes ready to
make their getaway for los angeles the
chink strikes me for four bits i owes
him for wash an says we stlike um tlail
to los langelis plitty quick i argues
with the cuss an told him it was sure death
for them to tackle a trip through the valley
in summer but the simp only says she
say we make um plenty allee light that
settles it with sam whatever she says goes
with him

  i asks him if any of em knows the trail
an he says she catch um short way-
over there pointin southwest she plenty
savey says he it sure was the short way
all right but the devil hisself couldnt of
lived an made his getaway by that route
over the desert at that time of year

  so i goes to her an i says madam-
the professor used to call her the madam
-i says madam we-all feels mighty cut
up an sorry for you-all an we will some


adventure

of us go with you if you are boun to go
you might jest as well take nothin with
you as that fool chinaman besides you
cant get by with it goin by the route you-
all aims to go there aint no water that
way an hell aint a patchin to what youll
find down in the valley this time of year

  she jest kinder sized me up all up an
down like an turns up the end of her nose
an says somethin as how as she pre-fers
the company of a chink gent an burros to
the likes of us an the chink grins an
says she plenty good savey so all i
could do was to re-tire but i found a chance
to hit the chink a kick jest where the back
end of his shirtce stops as i went out

  well they started an they didnt have
water enough in their outfit to last the
burro two days not countin themselves
it was clean plumb murder thats all

  i rouns up some of the boys an we had
a confab we hustled together a outfit an
loaded down two burros mostly with water
an two of us strikes out through the hills
aimin to come out about where we decided
they would be when their water played
out

  we stopped about five mile below here
an watched for them a couple of days
scoutin in different directions along
about five oclock my partner shows up an
says he had heard shots somewheres down
in the valley to the north of us we struck
the valley an follows the foothills a mile or
so an then decided to make for the salt
shack out there

  we had gone somethin like a mile when
we foun the woman lyin plumb in our track
she wasnt dead but my she was some
sight burned an blistered with her tongue
swollen an stickin out of her mouth she
wasnt dead as i says but i thought then
she would of been a whole lot better off if
she was

  we picks her up she only moaned an
opened an shut her hands wigglin an
twistin her fingers kind er stiff-like be-
tween us we carried her about two mile to
the salt shack we found the chink lyin
outside the shack near a seep-hole in the
rock salt he had sure crawled there look-
in fer water he found some but it was
fifty times saltier than sea water he was
plumb dead

  we takes the woman into the house an
works over her till next day when she
comes to enough to moan an cry fer water

god i dont never want to put in such a
night an day as them was

  we buried the chink an that evenin
pard went to camp an brings one of the
burros an we contrives that night to get
her to our camp she was plumb nutty fer
a week an then what she tells us changes
my mind a heap concernin chinks

  the first night out their burro got to
thinkin as how the hills looks good to him
an he makes his getaway carryin a keg of
water with him that they bein tenderfeet
had left cinched on to him chink tells
them to stay there an he strikes out after
the beast next mornin without water

  he didnt find the brute but managed
to get back to the woman an kid about
noon he was all in i reckon from what
she says but he never complains he jest
smiles his chinaman smile an says be
plenty allee light plitty quick they
doped him with water an that night they
starts on again chink actin as burro an
carryin most of the stuff

  that night an next day they must of
seen plenty of the hell stored up in death
valley the chink wouldnt hardly touch
no water fer he sees it was runnin low but
he keeps dealin out small lots to the others
that afternoon the boy went crazy-plumb
heat nutty-an broke away an runs fer a
lake he thought he seen chink runs him
down er jest naturally picks him up from
where he had dropped an carries him back
him be allee light plitty quick me cally
him chink smiles an says to the mother

  an all that day he did carry him
staggerin stumblin failin he always
comes up with a smile an a hopeful word
such as we catch um los langelis allee
light but the boy died that night died
fightin his mother an the chink an moan-
in fer water fer by this time all their water
was gone chinks yaller skin was cracked
his lips an mouth was swelled an he stag-
gers like a plain drunk when he tries to
walk and still he smiles

  they buries the boy about four mile up
the valley up there in the sand jest aroun
that butte you see stickin out over there
an then the woman kerflumixed-went
down in a heap she makes signs to chink
tell in as how she can talk no more on ac-
count of her heat-swelled throat an cant
hike no further and chink slings the
empty water-bag over his shoulder again
lifts the woman an staggers on an on
the white hopes understudy



god what a livin hell he was endurinl

  he sees the salt shack there an tries to
holler thinkin some one lives there but
he couldnt make no noise with his mouth
on account of his throat bein baked an
his mouth all swelled out of kilter but he
manages to mumble we catch um housee
-catch um dlinkee plitty quick lillee lady
an he staggers on an on carryin the little
lady failin draggin her god how
he must of struggled for breath an fought
for each step

  the little lady tells me as how the chink
falls with her at the door how they both
lays there for hours till finally she drug
herself into the shack nobody there a few
rusty tins a busted sheet-iron stove but
the shade brung her to some an she
crawls out an drags the chink into the
shade all he could do was to smile in a
kind of leerin way for his face was plumb
out of shape

  she fans him with her hat an squeezes
a few drops of water hot as fire out of the
water-bag that night he gingers up
enough to mumble a few words an you
know how every word was like a knife-jab
to his blistered throat in the mornin he
gasps to her with his chinaman smile
plitty quick-lillee lady-be allee light

go-to-hills shootee gun man -catchee
noisee you-allee-light

   but you asks the woman you will
die here

   no kin says the chink me-
catchee-lest-plenty-well-plitty quick
an she left him an she stumbles on
through the blisterin heat an over the
rough blocks of rock salt shootin her gun
every now an then an then says she
thats all she knows

  we patches her up an finally lands her
in los angeles an she beat it back east
pronto the last words she says to me at
the depot was

   some time get my boy an the china-
man an send em to me

  i aint never done it yet but some time
when i make a strike i will says old wade
an measles stans up an blows his nose
powerful hard an says pointin over to the
salt shack

  i takes off my hat to you mister chink
an tomorrow im goin over to where you
are planted an appologize fer bein a hea-
then myself

  and i made up my mind that i sure would
go with him for whether he was a chink
or a mex he was some real man and god
dont let so many of them loose as he might

his is not a sunday-school story
certainly it is not in theme
and quite unconsciously if at
all in treatment to those
ubiquitous kill-joys who diogenes-like go
lantern in hand through the dark passages

of fiction seeking not an honest man but
a red-nosed sniffling moral i say here and
now and senator-like without fear of con-
tradiction that there is no moral

a moral hints of superhuman wire-pulling
and miracles and things like that but there


adventure

is no miracle here but the miracle of youth
and all the wire-pulling that was done fell
to the sunken hands of doc saunders who
was far from superhuman-poor manl

dennys excitement was positive
agony it mounted him in recurring
waves starting from his toes and
ending by leaping at his throat and choking
him it created a horrible aching vacuum
in the pit of his stomach and folded itself
round and round his heart like a thick
blanket now and then it was akin to
nausea

  it was dark in the little rough-boarded
room beneath the stands the one window
looked out on a forest of piling through
which one caught a glimpse of a white street
running between low square houses of
cream and coral and pale yellow adobe

  over the roofs of these houses denny
could see the mountains shrugging their
shoulders against the blue his mountains
an acute longing for them went through
him like a pain they were so peaceful and
silent and remote and here everything was
blatant with sound and terrifying with the
overwhelming nearness of the many over-
head twenty thousand feet tramped and
stamped and shuffled ten thousand voices
mingled with hysterical effect and always
new feet were joining them fresh voices
adding their mite to the uproar

  it was quiet enough in the dark little
room there was a lull in the coming and
going of excited clamorous men skip-
per burns had taken his lieutenants and
his perspiration and his studs into final con-
ference with the champions manager his
lieutenants and his studs doc saunders
had barred the door to the curious and only
he and denny and the rubbers remained
with gene williamson the challenger

  the latter lay naked on a sheet-covered
board a herculean man as tall and thick
and rugged as an oak his body was
strangely white in the dim light it glowed
corpse-like the rubbers hunched over
him their hands making soft patting
sounds

  denny did not look at gene but at saun-
ders who faced the window and the light
which fell upon his face and revealed with
cruel distinctness the ravages of a dread
disease his eyes were very bright but
covered with a strange glassy film they
were blue eyes so dark a blue they often

seemed black and their gaze was discon-
certingly level

  no one endured that gaze for very long
perhaps for fear of revealing to him their
understanding and their pity one felt in-
stinctively that his was too proud a spirit
to bear pity

  where he had come from no one knew
and no one cared to ask least of all denny
boone for all that saunders was so kind to
him he had drifted into the training camp
one day and become a fixture quite natur-
ally without meeting with protest or offer-
ing explanation it had come out somehow
or other that he was a doctor who had given
up his practise

  skipper burns welcomed his medical
knowledge and his worldly knowledge as
well he seemed to have as extensive an
acquaintance with ring history as did skip-
per and his ideas on diet and training were
authoritative

  he it had been who advised retaining
denny boone as a sparring partner for the
challenger the boy had ridden in from
the mines back in the mountains and tim-
idly offered his services skipper burns

told him kindly but firmly to go to -

burns was a kiridly man but he had been
pestered almost out of his existence by as-
piring amateurs

  but the doctor had taken the boy by the
arm and staring all the while into his eyes
had run his fingers up and down the others
sleeve from the wrist to the shoulder
denny had stiffened under his touch there
was something potentially galvanic in those
thin fingers and he had met the doctors
scrutiny without winking his conscience
was like his blue eyes unclouded

  strip saunders had commanded in
his thin husky voice

  burns raised impatient yet respectful
protest

  aw doc whatta you ringin in a kid
like that for at this stage of the game
besides he aint more than a middle-
weight

  again those fingers swept up and down
the boys arm

  a shade under two hundred skipper

  when they stripped denny and put him
on the scales the beam balanced at one
hundred and ninety-eight

  he had only been in the ring with wil-
liamson the fraction of a moment when
burns dashed in between them
the white hopes understudy



  say he accused denny i thought
you said you hadnt fought before

ive not really fought sir blushed the
boy just with the men around the mine
gwan what do you take me for
you never learned no guard like that around
a mine whos been teachin you

  jeff moloney sir hes foreman of our
shift

  moloney old jeff moloney the wel-
ter why in the blue-blazes didnt you say
so

  burns turned to the doctor in great ex-
citement

  didja see how he covers up and fights
from under doc its the niggers style
down to the ground hes just what we
want to practise this wild-hittin irishman
of mine on go in boy and let him try
to hit you take it easy under gene
under i tell you cut out that swingin
like a gate and come from under you cant
hurt the top of his head under

  the pudgy manager was all perspiration
and delight when he sent the men to the
showers his charge was encountering just
that defense he would meet with in the
great battle

  the kids a jewel he crowed didja
see him doc he covers up like an angel
and hes got a kick in each paw

  he has more than that skipper smiled
saunders enigmatically he has the
greatest asset of all-a clean heart

  burns looked depressed the doc was
always shooting something over that he
couldnt wise to

  as far as denny was concerned saunders
was all enigma he felt drawn to him and
yet repelled he respected him and he
feared him frail and wasted as he was
there was something uncanny in that frail
body teetering on the graves edge some-
thing awe-inspiring in those too bright eyes
that seemed to pierce through the mortal
curtains to the great hinterland and yet
his presence was a tonic to the boy his
touch somehow made him feel strong

  the importance of conditioning william-
son had dwarfed all other considerations in
the camp and dennys needs scant as they
were would have been neglected had it not
been for saunders he rubbed the boy
down with his own hands after the sparring
matches he seemed to experience a holy
joy in handling that splendid young body
but a bitterness showed through the joy

which made denny very uncomfortable it
was impossible to pity him

  he was deserving of pity the boy de-
cided as he watched him now his skin
was waxy-pale and his scanty sorrel beard
could not hide the blue hollows in his cheeks
one did not have to hear the hacking cough
issue from his flat chest to know

  suddenly he turned his head and met the
boys eyes denny looked down quickly
but not quickly enough he feared to pre-
vent the other reading his thought

  denny came from saunders as sud-
denly as that glance had come do you
remember your mother

  denny looked up wide-eyed and startled
by this question so irrelevant to the time
and the place

  no sir he managed to say she died
when i was a baby

  she was a norwegian the man went
on his eyes strangely dreamy a great
splendid figure of a woman true daughter
of the north and the vikings your father
was scotch-irish you see i have been
looking you up he stood six feet two in his
stocking feet ah denny denny lad
what a wonderful heritage

  my father and mother were cousins
he went on after a pause

  the boy stirred uncomfortably once
saunders had looked at him his excitement
had been wiped out as completely as a wet
sponge wipes out the figures on a slate but
he rather preferred that excitement pain-
ful as it had been to this

  youre twenty years old the other
mused aloud youve never smoked

  no sir

  never touched liquor

  no sir

  never-but i can see that ah denny
lad

  the silence that ensued was really de-
pressing denny stared out at his moun-
tains and wished fervently that he were
among them wished that he were anywhere
but here wrapped about by the embarrass-
ing silence

and then that silence was snapped
as a thin cord is

  doc

  it was williamson

  doc

  there was no mistaking significance in
that throaty cry saunders glided over like


adventure

a cat and brushed the rubbers aside and
back the order came casually enough but
with a crisp undertone that had a disturb-
ingly electric quality

  bring me the ice-bucket denny

  the boy obeyed and the little action left
him breathless he was vaguely aware that
the rubbers stood beside him tense as
statues he was tense himself with horror

  in spite of the dim light he saw that wil-
liamsons lips were blue and the rest of his
face dead-white like the belly of a fish
his eyes were rolled far back so that only a
small arc of the iris showed beneath the
upper lids even as the boy looked a gray
froth bubbled from one corner of the challen-
gers mouth

  with movements surprisingly deliberate
saunders lifted -the bucket with its tinkling
contents and dashed a portion over wil-
liamsons face then his hairy chest then
his stomach the outer wall of the latter
winced inward from the icy contact his dia-
phragm jerked up into his chest and he
drew in a long sibilant breath

  doc he moaned exhaling

  dennys tenseness melted every muscle
collapsed into fiaccidity every nerve began
to tingle until he was shivering wretchedly
from head to foot he was stark afraid

  a towel commanded saunders

  neither denny nor the rubbers stirred
they were not able saunders whirled im-
patiently flashed a look at the boy and
smiled under the lash of that look denny
had hurried for the towel the doctor
dipped it in what was left of the ice-water
and bound it about williamsons head cov-
ering his eyes

  whats the matter

  they had not heard the door open and
the cry shrill with premonition made them
turn there stood burns his face blotchy
his paunch quivering his big studs winking
and blinking malevolently in the light from
the little window behind him stood other
men the governor of a neighboring state
who was to make the presentation speeches
the promoter of the fight pink and perspir-
ing ike richards manager for jake jen-
kins the negro champion the door was
filled with curious faces all strained with
the same unreasoning dismay

  his heart explained saunders briefly
i was afraid of it overstrain he cant
fight

  o gawd moaned burns and went limp

  he made no move toward williamson it
was curious that neither he nor any of those
with him thought to question saunderss
decision for a moment there was a
stunned silence and then like a far-off wind
ever growing nearer a whisper spread and
grew it was stilled abruptly by a rasping
command from the doctor

  dont let any one get upstairs with this
we mustnt let them know-yet

  what can be done what can be done
palpitated the governor

  o gawd

  there must be a fight this from the
promoter with tears in his eyes there
are fifteen thousand out there and all
those mex soldiers therell be a riot

 - cut in richards roughly

therell be war

  find a substitute

  they all looked at saunders with quick
relief

  cal motter is out there-

  and dreadnought green

  hog-fat the both of them groaned the
promoter it would be a joke

  its a bum joke any way you look at it
said richards who is around that is in
training

  following the question they were silent
staring at saunders without effort on his
part he had taken command all instinc-
tively looked to him for the answer

  there was a little ghost of a smile on his
lips that was reassuring slowly he turned
and looked at denny boone and all eyes
followed his then he looked back

  lets go outside gentlemen and talk
this over he said quietly

  they filed slowly out with little curious
glances over their shoulders the rubbers
went with them they seemed eager to get
away from that white hoarsely breathing
man on the sheet-covered board the doc-
tor went last of all closing the door behind
him denny was left alone with the broken
challenger

  his first act was to move over into the
far corner from gene williamson and slump
weakly on a bench reason told him that
the latter could be in no danger the doctor
would not have left himso callously had he
been nevertheless denny could not con-
quer an inward shrinking the whole
ironic situation was too truly horrible he
could scarce believe fate able to play such
a prank upon that huge massive frame
the white hopes understudy



glooming almost ghastly in the half-light
it looked too competent too self-sufficient
too perfect a creation of flesh to harbor a
flaw the thing was incredible

  he was glad when two red cross assist-
ants came in and bore williamson away
he hoped the big fellow was unconscious
he was such a wholesome good-natured
fellow and he had worked so hard and so
hopefully for this

  denny sucked in his breath sharply and
hurried to the window where he could look
out at the mountains his mountains why
had he ever left them he did not like this
cruel game he had only come because
moloney had insisted there was some-
thing he could teach the challenger the old
welter had said but of what avail was that
teaching now williamson was out of it
somebody had to take his place

  he shivered he remembered how saun-
ders had turned and looked at him-how
they all had looked at him he remem-
bered those curious backward glances
they had looked first at him and then at
gene williamson there was something
movingly significant in their fastening upon
him the priority of interest of a sudden
the feet and the warring voices overhead
took on a new sound one that concerned
him intimately his eyes clung to the
mountains in a desperate effort to absorb
from them a portion of their serenity and
strength

  a hand fell upon his shoulder he stiffen-
ed as he always did when saunders touched
him slowly he turned and met those
blue eyes a blue so deep it was almost black

  saunders was smiling faintly both the
smile and his eyes conveyed a meaning
denny strove desperately to avoid

  how-how is gene he faltered

  oh gene hell be all right with a little
rest but the fight must come off denny
weve found a substitute

  who the boys lips hardly formed
the word

  saunderss answer was even more inaudi-
ble it was not even spoken his fingers
tightened on dennys shoulder and denny
knew

  it was a comforting touch that dennys
thoughts emotions even muscles which a
moment before had been asserting them-
selves independently suddenly became cen-
tralized and obedient to his will he could
think of but one objection

  but genes trunks wont fit me sir
  saunderss face became radiant

  i knew it not a blemish ah denny
lad

  denny hadnt the least idea what he was
talking about he suffered himself to be
led to a chair and stripped he became
aware then that burns was also in the room

  do your best for me kid pleaded the
stout manager pathetically ive treated
you square now havent i dont let em
show me up too bad its awful awful
whod ever have thought gene would go
back on me this way

  his grief was so profound one did not
dare hint the selfishness of it

  three years i trained him for this
three long years its awful it wouldnt
be so bad if i had spent some time with you
denny but i couldnt spare a minute from
gene and now youre goin into the big
fight and i havent shown you nothing
saunders bristled a little

  he has something more than you could
ever show him skipper

  huh grunted the other jealously
whats that

  have you ever heard of galahad
naw and ive heard of all the fancy
was he a heavy

  saunders smiled and paraphrased

      his strength was as the strength of ten
      because his heart was pure   

  huh one of them book champs
growled burns

  and a good one skipper he whipped
all comers in his time

  yeah but that wasnt in jake jenkinss
time the pudgy manager coughed as he
recalled his duty but you aint afraid of
a nigger are you denny and jakes just
half trained

  on the contrary frowned the doctor
hes trained down fine a perfect fighting
machine-in so far as it is possible for him
to be perfect skipper would you mind
running out and seeing if they are ready for
us yet

  it was a flagrant dismissal but burns
took it with good grace he was too
crushed to care or feel saunders closed
the door after him and returned and sat
down by denny who was dressed now for
the ring

  lad he said-and there was a singing
undertone of tenderness in his voice-


adventure

youve never done a bad deed youve
never had a mean thought your body
proves it your eyes show it and for that
reason you are the only man today fitted to
whip jake jenkins

  let me tell you something whenever
a inan does wrong or thinks wrong a little
hollow place opens up inside him the
more he does and thinks wrong the more
that place widens and widens

  he struck the boy a sudden sharp blow
youre solid dennis boone do you
understand

  im afraid not sir

  that radiance flashed into saunderss
gaunt face again

  good for you denny lad if you had
understood there would be a little hollow
place opening in you now here is some-
thing you can understand

  you and jenkins fight alike it is curi-
ous how much alike it is but i suppose it
comes from moloney he handled jenkins
when the black was first breaking in both
of you cover up alike your head-guard
is well-nigh perfect the result is that this
fight is going to be a body fight you un-
derstand give him your body denny as
long as you can get to his trade with him
and youll come out ahead he may hit
harder but hell have something harder to
hit for-and remember nothing but this
from now on-jenkins is hollowi say it
over and over to yourself denny lad
jenkins is hollow for he is hollow and
youve got to cave him in

  his pause was more emphatic than his
words even

  i dont have to tell you to keep your
chin out of his way and-say it denny
jenkins is hollow

  jenkins is hollow echoed the boy obe-
diently and ive got to cave him in
saunders dropped a thin hand upon his
forearm and squeezed

  all ready sang out skipper burns as
he entered with a cloud of assistants at his
heels

  in a moment denny was surrounded
meeting awe and wonder and respect in eyes
that had hardly heeded him hitherto
youre not nervous kid

  stuff barked saunders

  he threw a bathrobe over dennys shoul-
ders and linking arms led him off

  denny was not nervous he wondered
vaguely why he was not and then decided

that it was saunderss arm pressing against
his that rendered him so very cool it was
not the pressure so much as what that pres-
sure conveyed what he read in those al-
most black eyes he knew he would not be
afraid having those eyes upon him jen-
kins was hollow was hollow and he had
to cave him in-for saunderss sake

  we want you on hand to stop the trouble
if there is any lad said saunders as they
moved down an aisle under the stands
were going to push you right out there in
the middle where they can all see you
and if anybody is disappointed after seeing
you with nothing on but trunks and shoes
why-why ill give them their money back
out of my own pocket

v they climbed up a short flight of
i stairs and emerged through a narrow
opening into the blazing sunlight
everything was so acutely clear it pained
the eyes denny had visited the stands
that morning when they were empty and
had some difficulty in persuading himself
that this was the same place

  they had come from under the ring which
was elevated some few feet above the main
floor it stood in the center of a considera-
ble level space given over to the ring-side
seats behind and above these were the
railed-in boxes and behind and above the
boxes again were other seats rising tier
on tier

  it seemed to denny that he was walled
in by nothing but faces and eyes but he did
not shrink saunderss arm was still locked
with his

  the governor of the neighboring state was
speaking but with little effect those in
the higher seats could not hear and were
making the fact known so loudly that they
were almost imposing the same conditions
on all only those in the ring-side can be
said to have heard that gene williamson
could not fight and that his place would
be taken by-

  a perfect yell of anger and protest
drowned the governor out over which the
metallic chatter of the released telegraph-
instruments rose supreme

  now lad hissed saunders

  he flicked the robe from dennys shoul-
ders and shoved him through the ropes
where the governor took his hand and led
him to the center of the ring

  he had a proud regal carriage this

ml
the white hopes understudy



mine boy dennis boone he bad a proud
lift to his blond head and a serenity of
countenance that was a beautiful thing to
see very straight he stood in his line
young strength with the sunlight sparkling
on his naked torso and his unwavering eyes
meeting the eyes of the multitude some-
thing of a viking he looked and something
of a young pagan god

   the yells from the ring-side subsided into
a sullen mutter and then into a shamed
silence then like the first gentle drops of
a summer rain came a light clapping of
hands-a womans hands surely other
hands assisted the shower became an
approving downpour the gallery cheered
blithely ignorant for the most part that this
was not the advertised challenger a group
of native soldiery on one of the topmost
rows overcome by enthusiasm or perhaps
mescal capped the climax with a fusillade of
revolver shots directed skyward feminine
shrieks were drowned in a wave of mascu-
line laughter handkerchiefs and broad-
brimmed sombreros were flaunted good-
humor reigned again

  little doc saunders in his seat in den-
nys corner smiled and rubbed his hands

  the demonstration had scarcely begun to
abate when it spurted into new and greater
activity it mounted wave on wave to the
point of hysteria the champion had ar-
rived

  all one gold-toothed smile jenkins at-
tired in a vivid green dressing-gown leaped
nimbly through the ropes and stood grinning
and bowing to the applause like a plant in a
gale the management with much wisdom
had decided to dispense with the usual ora-
tory and introductions and to stage the
fight before any malcontents could incite a
disturbance so long as they could feast on
battle the crowd would be content what
furrowed deep valleys in the promoters
pink brow was would that feast continue
long enough to whet the appetite of the
blood-lustful

  how long do you think the kid will
last he screeched to be heard above the
uproar but he only got a mournful shake of
the head from burns and from saunders an
enigmatic smile

  jenkins had ceased bowing although the
storm of sound was scarcely diminished he
flung aside his dressing-gown and began to
umber up his muscles stretching dancing
daintily on his toes shadow-boxing all with

the same pleased self-consciousness that
animates the strutting peacock

  denny from his corner where the seconds
were kneading his limbs and binding his
hands with tape watched the big black
he did not look at the tremendous body or
the knotted muscles flowing up and down
beneath the coppery skin he looked at
jenkinss face

  the negro was all smiles good-nature
but behind the smile the boy sensed some-
thing that roused a slowly mounting ani-
mosity it was not anger rather a cold
scorn in jenkinss thick lips in his low
forehead the slanting skull the wide brutal
nostrils was revealed a capacity for evil
and more a familiarity with evil and more
yet a compliance toward evil that jarred
on the virgin instincts of denny boone
the very sight of jenkins made him bristle
as a dog will bristle when it comes upon
a brute scent

  hes hollow-hollow ran his thought
grimly joyfully i must cave him in

  he felt no shadow of repugnance against
punishing this his fellow creature he
hated him he did not hate him because
his skin was black but because that was
the color of jenkinss soul

   the world-famous referee entered the ring
and beckoned the two fighters to him
briefly he introduced them and gave his in-
structions

  howdy grinned jenkins thrusting
out a big black paw howdy lil massa i
hopes you aint goin to hold it agin ol
jake if he huts you a bit hell try an
not hut you much but hes tellin you
now dat he caint stay aroun hyar very
long hes got er engagement ise got
some money to deposit he leered

  denny said nothing he had been
warned that jenkins was a great kidder and
would try to rouse him to anger but the
blacks chaffing did not worry him nothing
about jenkins worried denny he knew
that he was hollow he could tell it from
his face

   the boys silence excited the champion to
flannel-throated laughter

   look at lil massa he jerked back over
his shoulder to his seconds jes look at
lil massa will you hes too proud to talk
wid a nigger why hes got his back up
wid ol jake

  denny said nothing

  the two went back to their corners and


adventure

were fitted into their gloves behind him
denny could hear burns and his friends
holding a mourners session the skipper
was frankly near tears before him about
him below and above rising tier on tier the
boy could see nothing but faces and eyes
eyes and faces from the seats nearest es-
pecially from the newspaper section he met
many glances some of interest and some of
amusement but the far greater number of

pity-

  his lips just moved in a smile they
didnt know that jenkins was hollow

  denny lad whispered saunders lean-
ing through the ropes remember

  yes sir said denny

  a gong rang silence fell

  ready li massa jenkins sang out

they met in the center of the ring
and touched hands perfunctorily
simultaneously they fell into a
crouch the hands held high and parallel
with the chin the elbows well in over the
stomach with the same slow rocking
movement of the shoulders they circled eye
to eye

  a titter frothed from the audience and
swelled into a laugh the fighters except
for their skins were so alike in pose it was
truly ridiculous the angle of their bodies
the slow cat-like tread of their feet the
hunched shoulders the lifted hands paral-
lel with the chin-they were alike in all
those things

  jenkinss smile tightened a little as he
heard that laugh his lips lifted until his
gums were revealed it was no longer a
smile but a snarl

  he was smiling again immediately but
in those lifted lips denny had seen the brute
and antipathy sang through him like a
clarion call he stepped in feinted with his
left at that grinning black face and drove
his right in wickedly just below the arch of
the others breastbone

  the blow landed cleanly resoundingly
the crowd acclaimed

  again jenkinss gums showed as he leaped
upon the boy like a lithe black panther he
struck as swiftly as a released steel spring
short jerking blows to the head

  but dennys hands were there glove
met only glove rocking swaying he
slipped inside the blows until his chin was
against the negros shoulder almost lean-
ing against each other they stood and ex-

changed rights and lefts to the body
roughly the champion thrust denny away
his incredibly swift upper-cut just flicked
the boys brow

  why lil massa he cried reproachfully
as he dropped his hands and straightened
up is you tryin to steal ol jakes bus-
ness i didnt think youd be er copy-cat
if you insists on fightin dataway why ill
fight disaway

  he leaned backward arms extended in
burlesque mimicry of fitzsimmonss famous
pose denny said nothing shoulders
hunched he rocked in slowly

  jake called ike richards warningly

  the negro gave his mellow throaty laugh
and relaxed into a crouch

  come on den lil massa  jake will
tickle ribs wid you

  denny came on he slid past a pair of
wicked drives at his face until his chin rested
against jenkinss shoulders the gloves
drummed against white body and black

  keep away from him oh keep away
from him wailed skipper burns

  but denny would not keep away again
and again before the bell rang he slid in
under those head blows to offer his body in
exchange for jake jenkinss again and
again the black thrust him away and his
vicious upper-cut just grazed the boys
brow

  denny was much embarrassed by the at-
tentions of his helpers during the rest such
solicitude was entirely new to him besides
it was unnecessary his daily work with
williamson had been just as exacting as this

  skipper burns squatted before him and
took the boys legs upon his thighs and
kneaded them frantically as if the whole
issue depended upon it

  dont step into him he implored
for gawds sake keep away denny
hell reach your chin yet-and when he
does-dont step into him weve got to
give the crowd a run for their money

  the boy looked down at him with a faint
smile he wondered why the skippers fat
cheeks should shake so and his voice sound
so thin and dry didnt he know that
jake jenkins was hollow or was that just
his own and saunderss secret

  the bell rang silence fell

  here i is lil massa

  shoulders hunched the boy rocked in

  the second round was like the first the
third like the precedingjtwo
the white hopes understudy



  for denny the negro had no head for
him there was only that black barrel which
was hollow and the boy might as well
have had no head also for all it availed
jake jenkins always his steel-spring blows
met those lifted hands always that parting
upper-cut just grazed dennys brow or
flicked the little lock of blond hair that fell
over it

  jenkins was meeting with his very own
defense executed as perfectly as he himself
had ever executed it they met and
drummed against each others ribs parted
and met again

  three rounds and neither man visibly
marked but there had been plenty of
action and the crowd exhaled a vast sigh
of content

  jenkins continued to smile to joke he
joked with the referee with the men in his
corner with friends at the ring-side with
denny the latter answered never a word
he rocked in pressed his chin against that
black shoulder drove his fists into that
black body always just below the arch of
the breastbone

  jes look at lil massa hittin ol jake
why son you ought-a be arrested for pickin
on er ol man lak jake what you tryin
to do-cave him in

  and then denny spoke his only word dur-
ing the entire fight

  yes he said

  the negros gums just showed for a mo-
ment

  three rounds that aint so bad
grumbled burns as he pummeled dennys
legs and you feel all right dont you
kid youll last wont you he implored
tearfully and dont let him get to your
chin hes been cornin so close it makes my
heart stop dead

  denny wondered why shouldnt he
feel all right body blows-what were
they they only made his skin feel warm
and all this talk about his chin he wasnt
aware that jenkins had been driving at it
continually he couldnt remember having
tried to guard it

  nor had he consciously tried to protect
his chin any more than he had consciously
avoided those blows to his face as he rocked
in under jenkinss guard all his defense
had been subconscious without effort of
will on his part the result probably of
some supersensitive instinct all his will
and his brain were focused upon one pur-



pose-to reach jenkinss hollow body and
cave it in

  he was as little aware of the real animus
directing this purpose as he was with the
details of his defense he knew he hated
jenkins with a cold consuming hatred but
he hardly knew why unless it was because
he had seen hatred of the black in saunderss
dark blue eyes that too was instinctive
the instinctive hatred of the clean for the
sullied of the humanized for the brute

  now and then looking over the negros
glistening shoulder his eyes met saunderss
eyes that look ever gave him a fresh im-
petus

  he thought he wanted to cave jenkins in
because saunders had told him to he did
not dream the reason was a far loftier one
than the desire of one man how could an
ignorant mine boy be expected to know that
he was impregnated with the same vicious
zeal that animated the puritan and the
jesuit

  the fourth round was like the third-the
second the first-the same but more of it
jenkins ever laughing ever joking showed
a certain reluctance about closing in and
that reluctance only fired denny to greater
insistence he would not be denied the
black could not avoid him he could not beat
him off rocking gliding he slipped in
under a fruitless volley to the head

  jenkins had no choice but fight according
to the others choosing he had to fight
back or go into a clinch and his childish
conceit would not allow of that what
would be said if he the champion were seen
to be holding on because of dennis boone
a mere tyro there were fifteen thousand
people out there some of whom had seen
him batter down the best all of whom had
heard of it there were newspaper men-
friends and satellites-his wife

  he did not clinch when he could no
longer keep the boy off he met him shoulder
to shoulder trading body for body jake
jenkins was no coward only he was hol-
low

  his laugh rang out as mellowly his jokes
flew as fast

  lil massa seems to me you is sittin up
mighty late aint it about yo bedtime
lil massa i reckon ol jake had better
rock dis baby to sleep purty soon

  denny said nothing he rocked he glid-
ed in he drove at that arch below the breast-
bone there was something inevitable


adventure

about it now when his blows landed he
could hear little short pants issue from the
negros mouth close by his ear now he
discovered that that black body was elastic
began to give a little under his blows

  four rounds croaked burns with a
falsetto laugh if i do say so denny

youre doin-fine there aint many that

could trade with jake and last four rounds
how you save your chin i dunno

  they were drenching denny with water
fanning him with towels spluttering advice
in his ear

  suddenly he turned his head he was
not surprised to find saunderss eyes waiting
for his very slowly he nodded and denny
nodded back that one glance seemed to
convey perfect understanding

  the gong rang the crowd grew hushed
the fighters advanced rocking crouching

  gettin close to by-by time lil massa
come to yo ol jakes arms

  denny came swiftly he slid past jen-
kinss blows and refused to be ousted his
arms worked as regularly as a machine
jenkinss arms likewise

  and then without warning the blacks
body was pressed against his the blacks
arms circled and pressed down his arms
the champion had clinched at last

  denny strained backward but still jen-
kins clung to him their cheeks scraped
moistly and then the eye of one was looking
into the eye of the other close very close
unclouded blue eye looking into mottled
brown and the brown fell

  the champion thrust denny away and
sprang back his crouch became accentu-
ated his arms folded across his stomach

  ise quit funnin wid you you hear

  denny said nothing he rocked forward
like an animal jenkins sprang and struck
and struck again but glove met only
glove denny slipped through the blows as
water slips through ones fingers his chin
rested on the black shoulder his hands al-
ternated upon that one spot just below the
breastbone

  jenkins thrust him away crouched
sprang and struck inside crept denny
jabbing jabbing

  again the negro thrust him away but this
time he did not spring he crouched waiting

  watch him wailed skipper burns
keep away from him

  but denny would not keep away the
grin was frozen to jenkinss face he looked
as he had looked at the start only denny
knew for he had felt that black body giving
more and more and the pants issuing close
to his ear had been like low hurt cries he
glided in and struck

  suddenly as before the blacks body was
pressed against his jenkinss arms circled
his arms but they did not cling they
began to slide down

  they slid to dennys elbows to his wrists
it was very still the negros wailing cry
slit through the silence like a knife-blade
through paper

 o-lawdy

  his arms slipped to dennys thighs and
clung a moment now they were around
the boys knees

  before him denny saw an arm an arm
in a pink-striped shirt-sleeve outstretched
he looked down jenkins lay across his
feet when he looked up again the arm in
the pink-striped shirt-sleeve was rising and
falling

  the touch of the negros moist flesh
against his shins was disagreeable and the
boy stepped back jenkins rolled over
limply and turned a face hideously drawn
with pain up to the sunlight he had been
caved in

  denny looked up with the ghost of a
smile to find the world-famous referee star-
ing at him with what almost amounted to
horror

  i knew i would do it he said simply

  huh croaked the referee you knew
it kid do you realize youve knocked
out jake jenkins-in five rounds

  sure he was hollow

  and that youre-champion of the
world

  huh said denny in his turn

  he looked about him dazedly champion
he became aware of all those faces and
all those eyes of a terrifying volume of
sound he had to brace his feet wide
apart he had to grasp at that arm in
the pink-striped shirt-sleeve to keep from
falling

  champion of the world the thought
had never entered his head

  and just because the thought had never
entered his head is the big reason why-

  but we will leave that to the moralists

    synopsis-havens falls is one of the last lumber settlements on the st croix river wisconsin in
it one faction led by devil dave taggart lumber king is working to keep the town lawless so that decent
people who might investigate his timber operations will not live there

    richard hale dr sanders and rose ilavetis lead the respectable element but they are losing out
when into the settlement flies gaston olaf francois thorson a fighting young giant of french-norse de-
scent with his partner tom pine gaston saves miss havens from the insults of red-skirl murphy
leader and driver of taggarts lumbermen who are derelicts from every camp in the north working under
devil daves wing since he will protect them from the law gaston whips murphy in a saloon which forces
rose havens to believe him a common brawler gaston is bewildered and angry at this

    gaston hires out to taggart as boss in murphys place he finds the timber tract about to be cut sus-
piciously well guarded by taggarts men also that back in the woods devil dave has a fine house where
live two women who carouse with him and who he tells gaskin olaf are his sister and niece

    gaston decides taggarts is no white mans outfit he and tom pine leave it on their way to havens
falls they come upon hale who while trying to approach taggarts timber territory has been shot in the
leg they rush him to the settlement there gaston learns that devil dave is really stealing timber owned
by rose havens and he has been aiding in the theft gaston goes over to the side of miss havens

    when taggart sends the stolen logsdown-stream that spring gaston captures them all for rose havens
after a desperate fight whereupon taggart claims he innocently cut her lumber and pays her  cash
for the mistake he then accuses gaston of shooting his henchman murphy and orders him to leave the
country

    gaston leaves but returns secretly to havens falls in time to prevent murphy supposedly wounded
from stealing back the  from miss havens at the instigation of taggart murphy however escapes
and taggart vanishes a capitalist lonergan arrives at the falls he plans to build a railroad through
the st croix country and open the land for settlers but first taggarts gang must be cleaned out gaston
is made town marshal he plans to throttle lawlessness at its source so with tom pine he strikes back
into the woods after taggarl who has taken refuge in his forest house

       taggart s chance	gaston come on

        hen darkness had fallen suffi- as they moved into the clearing an owl
          ciently to hide their movements hooted hoo hoo hoo from beside the
          they slipped down to the edge house

of the clearing the lamps in gaston and tom crept forward pushing

adventure

then at a signal they leaped forward they
were in the doorway their rifle-muzzles
covering the interior the house was theirs
and you wish-gentlemen

  the dark woman whom gaston had seen
at his previous visit to the house rose from
a table the little blonde looked up laugh-
ing

  have some beer she tittered holding
forth a glass or some trout youre just
in time for supper

  gaston looked at the table it was set
for three

  wheres the old man he pointed with
the rifle-barrel at the third plate

  mina called the dark woman

  from the kitchen a greasy squaw came
forth and at a signal sat down in the third
chair

  no you dont cried gaston theres
a bottle of champagne there you arent giv-
ing champagne to squaws

  serve the wine mina said the dark
woman

  the squaw obediently drew the cork and
poured a glass for each of the women

  and the third glass-how about that
  thats a mistake

  it is it gives you away tom you take
a look around ill watch here

  at the word tom eagerly stormed
through the house gaston could mark his
progress as he kicked his way from room to
room and searched for hiding-places in
a few minutes he came running back carry-
ing in his hand taggarts wide-brimmed
hat

  by the open back window gaston olaf
he cried he was here but hes gone
this was knocked off his head getting
away

  hoo-hoo hooted the owl outside now
farther away hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

  gaston and tom looked at each other in
disgust

  that darn injun growled tom and
men like me n you couldnt tell the differ-
ence and we didnt have sense enough to
look for a trail leading out behind

  some wine smiled the dark woman
holding forth a glass

  or beer laughed the blonde you
ought to get something out of your trip
gaston bowed low cap in hand in his
very best manner

  i beg your pardon ladies it was a bad
mistake on our part we should have

watched both sides of the house you may
tell mr taggart that he was too smart for
us

  sit down said the dark woman smiling
her best theres no use chasing him hes
got away by now wont you have some
wine

  with the little knockout-drops in no
thanks youve already gained a few min-
utes for taggart though so we must bid
you good-by

  the little blonde made one bid to hold
them longer

  geel big man i believe i could leave
taggart for you

  good-night im sorry-

  he saw that the girl was laughing at
something and glanced toward the open
window

  taggart standing outside was leaning
over the sill carefully covering gaston and
tom with a double - barreled shot - gun
there was no need for speech gaston and
tom were too experienced to take chances
with such wicked business - like eyes as
gleamed at them over the barrels it was
life or death the decision to be made in a
split second and they froze stiff their rifles
hanging harmlessly under their arms

  thats right taggarts fangs showed
as he smiled he had been drinking a
move and-well we wont speak of what
would have happened the-the tables
are slightly turned arent they thorson
youre not the big man just at present no
just now you look like an ordinary whipped
dog and like every dog who gets in my
way youve had your day

  gastons eyes looked down the gun-bar-
rel into the eyes of taggart there in the
terrible silent conflict of wills the issue was
decided

  ah taggart youve had your last
chance to get me out of your way gas-
tons voice rang with the fiber of triumph
pull that trigger touch her off blow
my head off thats your only chance
and thats gone now it was gone the sec-
ond after you got the drop you could
have done it then while our backs were to
you you cant do it now your chance is
gone-see you cant look me in the eye
and do it it isnt in you taggart youre
trying but it wont work youre done for
your chance is gone ill drive you out of
the country now look at his gun wobbling
look look
gaston olaf



  like a flash he threw himself backward
knocking tom pine under him his long
legs flew out kicking the table smack into
the window where taggart stood

  the shotgun roared ineffectually the
big kerosene lamp on the table exploded
flirting liquid flame about the room

  there was a hells medley of flame and
screams of cursing and scrambling as the
women blindly threw themselves about to
escape the flames tom and gaston thrust
the women to safety through the open door
and running into the next room made their
escape through a rear window

  into the brush commanded gaston
the indians around somewhere hell
have a shotguntoo

  from a hiding-placc in the brush they
looked back at the clearing the cottage
was spouting flame at every window the
clearing was brilliantly illuminated but the
light revealed no trace of taggart or the
women apparently they had fled the mo-
ment that it was certain that the cottage
was doomed not wishing to be found by
any one whom the flames might draw from
the woods

  the same thought was in gastons mind
and when it became apparent that the dan-
ger from taggarts shotgun was passed he
caught tom by the arm and led the way
into the timber

  on a ridge a mile away they dropped on
the ground and lay looking back up in
the dark sky hung a red-tinted pall the re-
flection of the burning building in that
waste of dead black forest the scene was
appalling an angry splotch of passion in a
sea of peace

  higher and fiercer rose the flames licking
eagerly at the rich furnishings of the den
and redder and larger grew the glow in the
sky the fire rose rapidly to its climax
spouted high as the roof fell in then gradu-
ally began to subside while minute by min-
ute the nightly gloom of the forest crept
slowly back to its own

  good enough said gaston at last
thats a good sign taggarts been burnt
out of one of his dirty nests may the good
work go on

  tom pine was rubbing his brow in per-
plexity

  what happened he demanded what
for did you go to rile him up so sud-
den gaston olaf we might a got hurt

  it was our only chance we had to rat-

tle him he got mad i saw by his eyes that
hed loosened his trigger grip then i drop-
ped and kicked the table i had the thing
worked out fine

  pretty fine agreed tom dubiously
thats the closest i ever heard buck-shot
whistle past this old head if it had been

any finer-

  i wouldnt have made a move gaston
laughed we certainly didnt come away
from there with any credit tom walked
into it with our eyes wide open and blind
ye-es it wasnt so bad though we
were able to walk out again we didnt take
anything away but we didnt leave any-
thing either now what next

  well keep on walking the chances
are taggartll have his sheriff and posse out
here looking for us as soon as he can send
em word theyll search this neck of the
woods pretty close and therell be too many
of em for us so well travel come on
he set out picking his way dexterously
through the dark woods at a good pace
and tom followed obediently the course
lay straight westward for two miles to the
bank of a small creek running north and
south

  heres where we lose em when they
come to follow us said gaston and plunged
into the water

  tom followed they went down-stream
a short distance and came out upon a sand-
bar leaving their tracks large and plain
pointing westward

  after losing their trail in a swamp they
reentered the creek and waded up-stream for
half a mile to where a tangled windfall per-
mitted them to quit the stream on the
eastern side without touching the ground
and making tracks their course now lay
eastward and slightly to the north

  they traveled steadily for most of the
night shortly before daybreak they
searched for and found a small well-built
shanty in the midst of a good growth of
timber tom pine laughed as they entered
and by feeling found matches where they
had left them the day they started for ha-
vens falls

  home again he cried

  yes said gaston well lay low on
our claims here for a couple of days well
hit back to town to be there saturday night
saturday night why then

  because then i figure the potll be about
due to boil over

saturday night

it was drive-time on the la croix it
was pay-day for the camps and it
was saturday night in havens falls

  for such nights existed the river-fronts of
river towns in the bad old days on such
nights was made the lurid history that is
remembered even now when river towns
as they were have ceased to exist mad
glorious nights after sober days of bone-
testing toil

  no one who has seen a river town on such
a night will ever forget it even though the
recollection is accompanied by a shudder
then the men came in off the drive wet
with the water which had snatched at their
lives during the day mad with the hunger
for a nights excitement before going back
to their toil then from out of the woods
came the camp-men in bodily condition like
unto a prize-fighter in training mentally
akin to bucks in rutting time prowling
about for a chance to fight there assem-
bled on such occasions dozens of the most
daring reckless muscular men who ever in-
habited this continent in their pockets
they carried money running often into the
hundreds

  to the right and left the red lights blink-
ed and music tinkled advertising the things
that the river-front had to give in exchange
for money supply follows the demand
whisky and women lights and music gam-
bling and association with their kind noise
and strife-these were the things that the
excitement-hungry woodsmen craved and
these were the things that the river-front
brazenly announced itself ready to supply

  in a mud-chinked log building with trees
swaying at its back door one found a gleam-
ing polished dancefloor where by stand-
ing in line and for a price one might dance
with a tiny blonde with the features of a
madonna and the eyes of a snake in the
curtained boxes lumber-jacks had the privi-
lege of ordering the same brands of cham-
pagne that wine - agents advertise along
broadway

  old lumber-jacks mackinawed and shoe-
packed beards reeking with tobacco-juice
but pockets filled with money staggered
about the floor holding in their arms girls
young enough to be their daughters young
jacks slim clean-eyed boys spent their

money on painted things old enough to be
their mothers

  next door one could gamble at anything
from chuck-luck to roulette any lumber-
jack who by accident won a few dollars cal-
culated to hold his winnings by the strength
of his good right arm

  but these devices of pleasure were but
supplements to whisky it was the bars
over which liquor was served that drew the
men and furnished reasons for the other
things and it was in the bare saloons that
the greatest crowds were to be found and
the most violent actions indulged in

  on this saturday night while gaston and
tom pine were wending their way to town
there were probably a hundred and fifty
men from the woods in havens falls jack
mccarthys saloon being the largest in the
settlement drew the largest part of this
number

  mccarthy was experienced in such occa-
sions and he knew that serious rows were
no source of profit to his till hence early
in the evening he seated himself on a stool
just inside the door twenty-five per cent
of the lumber-jacks came into town bearing
rifles as such a one entered mccarthys
place the proprietor crooked a finger and
pointed at a corner behind the bar the
lumber-jack promptly placed his weapon
with the others deposited there there
were twoscore rifles behind mccarthys
bar that night before the fun had fairly be-
gun

  gaston and tom entered the settlement
shortly after dark and at once made their
way unobserved into dr sanderss back
room the doctor greeted them with great
surprise and greater relief

  boys-boys id almost lost hope of
seeing you again

  why so

  for good and sufficient reasons first
because of the way you disappeared with-
out leaving any word that worried me
but i figured you might have done that for
a reason but when the sheriff and his
gang went hunting you-

  oh they did hunt for us then

  hunt for you boys they certainly did
they made a sudden raid on the hotel sur-
rounded it and forced their way in you
were gone as near as i could figure it
youd been gone about twenty minutes when
the raid came then they searched the
town they-
gaston olaf

  did they go up there gaston nodded
in the direction of the havens home

  they did miss rose invited the sheriff
to go through and see that you werent
hiding there she told him you wouldnt
hide from a man like him yes they went
through the whole town

  then that night they got word and went
into the bush after you i heard that theyd
heard where you were then they came
back and said theyd run you out of the
country and boys i was-hm hm-i was
afraid theyd caught you and put you out
of business and say somebody else was
worrying too and i think you ought to
show yourself up there as soon as you can
all right and whats happened since
then

oh the sheriff and most of his gang
have gone back to la croix but the crowd
thats in town tonight-hm hm-therell
be billy the devil to pay before morning
whats up

  well the crew that you took the drive
away frofh has been trying to clean out the
town the rest of the men have been giv-
ing them the laugh there are a lot of men
in town who havent any use for taggart
although theyve been in his camps
theres the crew from camp one forty men
or more just paid off theyve heard about
what you did to that drive and taggart
cant show himself without getting the
merry ha-ha there have been half a dozen
small riots already taggarts bullies have
been trying to choke off the fellows who
dare to talk about how you took the drive
have they been able to do it asked
gaston with great interest

  not much there are too many of the
other fellows but the bullies have turned
to this end of town red-shirt murphy
knocked a kid down and robbed him across
the street there just a few minutes ago
red shirt eh and taggart-whats
he up to

  hm hm hes keeping himself hidden
but-whisper-the old mans been drink-
ing his head off these last two days and hes
egging his bullies on

  fine laughed gaston

  what

  fine then the chances are that old
davy will try to do something tonight to
still the laughter and make people remem-
ber that hes still the boss man along the
la croix

   thats just how we figure it

  and red-shirt murphy has committed
a crime were there any witnesses

  half a dozen

  fine again im marshal of havens
falls its my duty to arrest any one who
commits a crime murphy will be the first
victim of law and order in havens falls

  man dear on a night like this-

  just the time the way to break a jam
is to break her when shes keyed up tight-
est

  he moved toward the door the rear door
for the time to reveal himself to the settle-
ment had not arrived

  you wait here for me a few minutes
tom he said easily

  nix you dont go leaving me out of
any of this fun protested tom

  the fun doesnt start just yet ive-
ive got something else to do just now
yes-hm hm said the doctor shell
be glad to see that youre back

ggzjtb gaston went directly to the ha-
jjsp vens house it was a warm dark

	night and in his rubber - soled
shoes he made no more noise than a cat as
he came swiftly up to the door the door
was open as was a window at one side

  the front room was brightly lighted and
gaston could not help looking in and hav-
ing looked could not help hearing what was
being said it halted him and he stood
looking and listening

  hale was in the room with rose and mrs
havens hale was on his feet speaking
and his strong round face wore a look of
worry

  i think you ought to go if i had the
power i would make you go this is no
time for you to stay here

  are you going away too asked rose
of course not thats different but
theres no reason why you should stay we
cant tell what theyll do before morning
ill give you my team and a driver and you
can go down to la croix and wait until the
thing blows over

  rose smiled

  if you will drive us dick-

  oh you know i cant do that a man
cant run away

  but a woman-a girl-can

certainly thats common sense
were going to stay here dick rose
was very quiet i know how well you


adventure

mean it-but we will not run away
bravo cried gaston striding in they
started at the sight of him but gaston
looked only at rose and his heart swelled
at the look she gave him i apologize for
hearing what wasnt intended for my ears
i was just coming in miss havens with
you here we know we must keep taggarts
outfit away from this end of town and if
we must we can

  he laughed as he spoke his spirits were
at top crest the situation the opportunity
to fight to protect rose was like wine to
his blood it lifted him made his heart
beat madly he felt strong enough to fight
the world he had a mad impulse to go forth
singing to battle single-handed with the
gang in its lairs

  and then he remembered those mad
joyous impractical impulses and actions
were no longer for him that was past
for him sober respectable practical effort

  he heaved a sigh as he noted that roses
eyes were comparing him to hale the
comparison scarcely could be favorable to
him he knew his fringed buckskin trou-
sers high-top rubbers flaming red sash and
carelessly buttoned shirt were in dire con-
trast to hales neat store-clothes in the
woods the odds would have been in his
favor here it was obviously hale who had
the better of it

  as they questioned him about his ab-
sence and return gaston made a mental
note that he would change to town clothes
as soon as the opportunity offered and
then he must hold himself in must sup-
press those reckless impulses and make
himself into a regular respectable citizen

  i can win her whispered gastons in-
stinct but ive got to tame myself-ive
got to quiet down

  as a beginning he reconsidered his words
concerning hales suggestion that rose and
her mother leave town

  perhaps it would be the right thing to
do he suggested but rose laughed at his
sudden change of front

  if we had decided to stay before you
were here certainly we wont change our
minds now that youve come

  well said gaston dubiously i dont
know its always best to be safe and
youd surely be safer down at la croix than
you are here

  rose thanked him with a look

  im very glad to hear you talk in that

 tone she said but im sure you dont
 really think theres any danger to us here
 do you

 as hale says youd surely be safe in la
 croix he replied evasively

 but as you said since were going to
 stay here well be assured safety so here
 we stay

 hale presently excused himself

 i want to see lonergan he explained
 hello exclaimed gaston lonergan
 here

 yes hes here with half-a-dozen men
 hes preparing to lay out his line between
 la croix and here

 that will help that means seven more
 men on our side

 yes good men too i must tell loner-
 gan youre back in town

 gaston left the house soon after hale
 and rose followed him to the gate

 well he said in parting you see im
 living up to my promise to change my ways
 i ran away and hid when the sheriffs gang
 was after me and ive been avoiding trouble
 ever since

 i am glad she said

 so am i im glad that-that you want-
 ed me to change

 without thinking what he did his fingers
 strayed down and reached her hand but
 at the thrill that went through them both
 at the touch he came to himself and drew
 his hand away he had no right to do that
 or think of it-yet

 good night he said suddenly i must
 go

 promise me youll be careful this eve-
 ning that you wont do anything-wild
 nothing wild he said solemnly
 thats all over ill prove to you that it
 is dont you believe it is

 i hope - yes i believe it is good
 night

 good night and-ill remember

 he meant it he really felt that he was
 tamed but he was soon to learn how bad-
 ly he was mistaken

chapter xxix

a fight

as gaston went back toward dr

     sanderss office there came up from the
 river-front a muffled roar of rage and disap-
 pointment that froze him in his tracks and
gaston olaf



 he stood looking down toward where men
 surged wildly to and fro in the gleam of the
 lights from opened windows and doors
 something had happened down there that
 had brought sudden anger to a large num-
 ber of the crowd

   the shouting came from one of the larger
saloons and after the first sudden explosion
of anger there followed an insistent clamor
apparently for revenge

  ever since he had heard from dr san-
ders that a large percentage of the men in
town were laughing at taggart and his gang
and that the gang was growling over it gas-
ton had been imbued with a wild hope if
the two elements would get to fighting each
other the gang would be too busy to turn
seriously on the decent people of the town
he had just promised rose that he would
be careful and to stand to one side and let
the two sides fight among themselves was
the height of caution

   at first he had planned to go down and
arrest red-shirt murphy before the eyes of
his friends casting the challenge of law and
order in their teeth but this would inevi-
tably have precipitated a conflict between
the gang and the decent citizens so now
as he moved alone down toward the river-
front without troubling to call for tom it
was in his mind only to conducta secret
scouting expedition and ascertain if possi-
ble whether there was a prospect that the
two elements in the crowd would clash in
battle if so he and the other respectable
citizens of havens falls had only to hold
themselves to their upper part of town and
pray that the outsiders would lick tag-
garts men to the last whisper

   in this cautious frame of mind gaston
aided by the dark night soon was mingling
with the crowd before the building whence
came the clamor

  whats the row here neighbor he
asked keeping his face averted from the
stranger whom he addressed

   oh he just knocked another of our boys
coldern a dead fish was the nonchalant
reply

   who did asked gaston carelessly

   before his informant could reply there
came a shout from the doorway

  gangway there-gangway open up so
he can get some air

   shouldering and cursing their faces cold
and ugly with rage came two middle-aged
woodsmen dragging between them the limp

bloody figure of a curly-headed youth the
boy was nearly as big as gaston the two
men carried him each holding him up by
the arms his head rolling drunkenly his
feet dragging helplessly on the ground his
face was smashed red and raw and there
was a cruel gash in the back of his head
outside the crowd which only glanced at
him and turned away to view what was go-
ing on in the saloon they laid him down
and splashed water in his face there were
half a dozen in the circle about him tried
hard-bitten men of the woods and gaston
saw that they were all strangers to him

  hes got his gloves loaded muttered
the battered youth as consciousness re-
turned i tell you theres lead in those
gloves of his

  shut up commanded one of the men
who had carried him out doesnt make
any difference if there was dynamite in em
we said we could find a man to lick him
boys he turned to the little group how
about it are we going to let that dam
prize-fighter brag about licking three of our
boys without anybody getting him
lemme go back at him pleaded the
youth i was half stewed when i got into
the ring with him heads cleared now i
can handle him now boys

  you cant handle yourself-lay downl
you handled your mitts like a swede
we got to get him licked growled an-
other man we cant hold up our heads
if we dont

  gastons blood leaped quickly forgot-
ten was the new policy of caution here
was a chance to win crew one as his de-
voted followers

  well rustle around continued the
spokesman get some one who can we
get tim blake hes licked and big ro-
bideau and-erik here

  thems the best men from our crew
well somebody else then holy suf-
fering moses anybody lets go hunt
for some one

  they started back toward the crowd
  hold on boys

  they swung back gaston had stepped
out of the darkness and was standing beside
the fallen youth with one glance of their
sharp eyes those woodsmen appraised him
then they came toward him respectfully
eagerly

  whats going on boys asked gaston
some champion in town


adventure

  they looked him over in silence
stranger exploded their spokesman
can you handle your mitts at all

 have done so replied gaston
whats up

  a knocker-out in sams place a pro-
fessional bets any amount he can knock
out any man in two rounds hes cleaned
three of our boys so far

  where you from neighbor queried an-
other voice

  dont make no difference where hes
from cried the spokesman question is
will you take a whirl at this loud guy
oh i dont mind said gaston

  then hes one of our crew-crew one-
no matter where hes from come on
gangway there you town hoboes we got
a man to clean your champion now come
on boys

  gaston paused to bend over the battered
youth

  how did he give you that clip in the
back of the head boy he asked

  loaded gloves i tell you insisted the
boy i can tell when lead hits me cant
i

  lead nothing said some one he lets
you feel of his gloves but he strikes an
awful blow stranger the boys have drop-
ped like they was shot

  all right

  they were at the doorway of the saloon
now the place was crowded with men
at the farther end of the room was a tiny
stage on which usually singers and dancers
held forth tonight two ropes were stretch-
ed across the front of the stage the two
side walls and a canvas drop at the back
constituted the other three sides of the ring

  through the haze of tobacco - smoke
which hung like clouds about the hanging
oil-lamps gaston could make out the figure
of the fighter leaning over the ropes gloves
on his hands sneering at the crowd while
at his side a hawk-nosed gambler cried
come on boys bring up your fighting
men even money any amount you
havent got a man can stay two three-min-
ute rounds with the butcher boy he
only weighs a hundred sixty-five boys
come on some of you fire-eaters get the
easy money

  gaston looked over the crowd first of all
he recognized here and there one of tag-
garts men red-shirt murphy among them
but to his satisfaction he saw that more

than half of the men were strangers to him
they were the outsiders the men who had
laughed at taggart because of the trick of
the stolen drive and just at present they
were begging for somebody to step up and
knock that guys block off

  the men who were to be counted as tag-
garts were with the pugilist it was their
turn to laugh now and they were taunting
the outsiders with the failure of their would-
be champions

 get a good man they sneered
whats the matter crew one havent
you got one good man among you

  the air of the room was heavy with ten-
sion the outsiders were taking these
taunts in ominous silence

  gaston looked at the prize-fighter last of
all the man was of medium height with
enormous neck and shoulders and a small
shaved head his thick gnarled arms and
bowed legs told of great strength but it
seemed rather the slow heavy strength of
the wrestler than the speed and power of
the pugilist

  whats the matter havent you got a
good man howled the fighters partisans

  you darn know it came back the re-
ply from the door and gaston olaf and his
six new-found friends came rushing down
the room to the ring

  in a vague far-away sort of fashion gas-
ton olaf realized that he had taken upon
himself a desperate venture a small still
voice was whispering to him that this was
a dangerous thing to do that taggarts men
would recognize him that they would seek
to collect the price which he knew taggart
must have set on his head

  but the voice was so small that he scarce-
ly heard it the realization of danger came
to him from far away and as through a fog
what he realized keenly was that his veins
were throbbing with excitement and now
under the spur of the moment he realized
that this was what his nature craved above
all things that he had stepped into his
present dangerous position because his real
nature had led him to it

  these thoughts came and went in one
troubled flash then he was the old reck-
less dare-devil gaston glorying in the pow-
er of his young giants body thrilled to the
core by the prospect of the fight ahead of
him he laughed boyishly he was happy

  there was a moment of stillness as he
climbed through the ropes taggarts men
gaston olaf



recognizing him were awed to silence by
his audacity at appearing in such a place
then the outsiders broke into a whoop and
crowded forward clamoring to bet what re-
mained of their rolls on this new champion

  the pugilist looked gaston over with a
horrible grimace intended for a smile of
contempt

   deh bigger dey are deh harder dey fall
he barked give im deh mitts refree
hes in fer an orful tumble dis guy is
here feel o my gloves so yah wont holler
deres lead in em when i knock yah cold

   gaston felt of the thin gloves there was
no hard substance in them

  heres yours

   the gambler acting as referee tossed him
a pair of thin gloves similar to the pugil-
ists gaston was puzzled at the obvious
confidence of the professional and the gam-
bler by their faces the fight was only a
formality it was as good as over with him
as another victim of the pugs prowess
why was this his keenly alert instinct
suddenly cried out a warning there was
something wrong here he must be on guard
against a trick

  come on bellowed the gambler any-
body else want to back the big fellow against
the little butcher boy

  gaston leaning against the ropes in his
corner was watching the crowd he saw
red-shirt murphy whispering with another
man

  come on he cried lets get start-
ed

  hi dyou know who that big stiff is
cried the man to whom murphy had spoken

  dont know and dont care replied the
fighter

  thats thorson-thats the guy who
stole the drive

  the room was still for an instant then
gastons backers lifted the roof with their
shout

  hoop-la thorson bully boy clean
him up like you cleaned devil dave eat
im alive

  the pugilist grinned and the gambler
looked bored it was apparent that they
cared not in the least about who gaston
was all comers looked alike to them what
could the trick be that made them so con-
fident

  gaston looked swiftly around the ring
the ropes in front were all right there could
be no trick there the sides were bare

walls all right the rear was a sheet of

canvas-

  gaston felt a slight chill along his spine
and his breath came sharply there were
two tiny holes cut in the curtain so tiny
that in the poor light it required eyes as
sharp as his to see them and for a flash
as he looked then instantly disappearing
there showed behind each hole a watching
eye

  something wrong behind that curtain
gaston mused ill keep away from it
his thrill at the prospect of combat sud-
denly changed and gave place to a cold
seething rage they would try an unfair
trick on him would they his jaw set and
his eyes flashed fire

  come on you cheap dirty crook he
hissed ill spoil your circus and break
your head besides

  no more bets all bets on

  our moneys all up kill him thorson
eat him alive

  knock him cold butcher boy roared
red shirt then well give it to him
right

  go shouted the gambler and leaped
from the ring

ikb the crowd surged forward pack-
jjiiiuu ing tightly against the ropes gas-
ton had a flash of the first row and
seeing half a dozen of taggarts men there
knew that more trouble awaited him when
the fight was over

  he had little time to think of this the
fighter came at him like a whirlwind it
was only a feint gaston led the pug duck-
ed and gaston suddenly found himself
clinched and shoved toward the curtain
he broke the clinch without any trouble

  the fighter feinted and clinched again
this time he had a hold about the middle
with a heave he lifted gaston from the floor
and rushed him against the canvas hanging
gaston threw himself forward even as his
back touched the curtain and in that instant
the secret of the fighters success was re-
vealed to him a blow as from an ax took
him on one side of the neck but his for-
ward movement had taken him too far
away to permit the blow to land with full
force as it was it knocked him to his
knees stars flew around his head he felt
nauseated for a moment and then he
was on his feet with a berserk bellow of
rage
adventure

  the pug struck wildly right and left and
turned and ran gaston caught him at the
ropes he grappled him neck and thigh
and swung him over his head roaring deep
down in his chest without a flicker of
hesitation the gambler reached for his gun
only to be dropped by the fists of two crew
one men who had been watching him for
just such action

  gaston steadied himself with the squirm-
ing man held above his head it was a
good ten feet across the ring gaston hurl-
ed his victim straight through the air into
the canvas the curtain ripped and came
down and the two black-jack men behind
it were exposed with their weapons in their
hands

  there cried gaston theres why
your men lost boys

chapter xxx

the coming of law and order

it took them a few seconds to realize
what had happened was it possible
had these town crooks really had the nerve
to play such a trick on crew one for a
moment they gaped then they swore soft-
ly and swarmed toward the ring a num-
ber of the gangsters made the mistake of
trying to halt them and hold them back

  hoop-la cried the woodsmen and the
room full of men exploded in battle royal

  the small ring became a place where a
dozen men were struggling instead of two
down on the floor twoscore men met fist to
fist the outsiders were in the majority
and they were out to avenge the unfair tac-
tics by which their men had been beaten
the taunts hurled at them and the tempo-
rary loss of their money-temporary be-
cause four of them stripped the gambler
down to the last yellow diamond on his
fingers

  in the ring gaston fought furiously
against odds until the rush of his friends
carried his foes underfoot he was marked
but he soon was satisfied with his share of
the struggle and he managed to free him-
self for a moment from the press

  the outsiders by this time had the whip-
hand and the fight had become knock-down-
and-drag-out taggarts gangsters were be-
ing hurled through doors and windows
later they would return with reinforce-
ments and the battle would be renewed but

for the time being the fight was all to crew
one

  it was no part of gastons program to
take part in a general rough-house he re-
alized how greatly fortune had favored him
in his desperate venture and returning
calmness dictated that he escape in a jam
near the door he caught sight of the flaming
upper garment of red-shirt murphy

  murphy was cornered by two young lum-
ber-jacks who were polishing him off to the
queens taste a smile flitted over gastons
face and he dropped into the melee on the
floor it was the work of a few seconds to
work his way through to the door

  let him go boys he commanded
clutching murphys arm hes my meat
all right champeen they said and
turned to hunt a fresh victim

  leggo me growled murphy hey
taggarts men heres thorson knife him

somebody knife the-

  gaston twisted his arm behind him and
thrust him outside two of murphys
friends came running toward him

  out of the way said gaston im
arresting murphy for robbing that kid this
evening im marshal of this town pretty
soon ill come back and get some more of
you out of the way hike

  at a dog-trot he propelled murphy ahead
of him out of the crowd and up the street
before any one dared to make a move the
amazed gangsters stood dumfounded while
gaston ran his prisoner across the open
space separating the two parts of town
he was in front of hales store before they
moved then they shouted

  hi thorsons gobbled red shirt ands
carrying him off come here to me we
got to get red shirt away

  gaston threw his prisoner into hales
store hale tom pine dr sanders loner-
gan and six of his men old perkins the
postmaster and a few others were assem-
bled there

  heres the first prisoner of the first mar-
shal of havens falls announced gaston
law and order has come gentlemen
guard him carefully ill be back in a min-
ute

  he snatched his rifle from tom pines
hand and was outside and half-way back
toward the red lights by the time murphys
friends had gathered courage to follow
there were probably a dozen of them and
they came cursing up the streetdemanding
gaston olaf



gastons life and the freedom of murphy

  where the light from a window streaked
across the street gaston drew a line in the
sand with the toe of his shoe and slung his
rifle into the hollow of his arm

  heres where you fellows stop-right at
this line he said quietly first one across
it gets whats in the old gun who wants
it first

  the gang stopped short in the yellow
flare of light gaston was not a pleasant ob-
ject to face there was blood on his face
from the fight his shirt was torn in several
places his thick crop of hair was disordered
till each hair seemed to be standing on end
and in the half-light his blue eyes gleamed
wickedly

  he was very serious there was no joy
of battle about this this was business
duty it was something that had to be
done and he happened to be the man on
whom the job of doing it had fallen

  theres the line he said thats the
line that marks the coming of law and order
to havens falls you fellows have done
just as you please up to now you cant
do that any more things have changed
ive been made marshal of this town im
here to tell you fellows your day of being
top - loaders here is over understand
from now on ill tell you what you can do
and what you cant do in this town and
first of all you cant come up into this part
of town you cant cross that line do
you understand

  gaston sensed that people were moving
toward him from behind he looked and
saw that in the darkness at his back a crowd
had gathered to his support nearest him
were tom pine lonergan and hale each
of them was armed with a shotgun

  dr sanders perkins lonergans men
and others were there too bringing the to-
tal number up to ten all armed they
came silently stretching across the street
in a ragged line it was a new business to
most of them their faces were white and
they were breathing hard but within them
was the spirit of the town-makers the men
of homes who bring order into the wilder-
ness

  this was something that had to be done
for the good of the town before them were
the forces of lawlessness and disorder from
which they and theirs had suffered helpless-
ly for so long behind them were their
homes their women their children-all that

was sacred in the world to them and the
time had come for them to stand out be-
tween these and the forces of evil

  they didnt like to do it fighting wasnt
in their line but it had to be done so
they were doing it and taggarts gang-
sters looked at the silent line of white faces
and the formidable figure that led them
and grew weak as always the bravado
courage of the bad man was as the reckless-
ness of a boy in the face of the calm deter-
mination of law-abiding citizens defending
their homes

  the two sides faced each other in silence
then gastons voice

  now toddle back to your boss tell
him whats happened tell him this rule
has come to stay you fellows cant come
up into this part of town any more then
round up all of your gang and see if you
can scare up nerve enough to come back
and cross that line

  then the tension broke the gangsters
began to slink back one by one they went
with curses on their lips a dozen yards
away they stopped and put their heads to-
gether

  well come back all right growled one
of them as they continued their retreat
and when we come you fellowsll be glad
to get out of town alive

chapter xxxi

taggarts defiance

gaston turned about and faced the
posse which had assembled to his sup-
port he did not laugh at the threat which
had been hurled at them the mood of
recklessness had passed he was as coldly
serious and determined as the most sober
citizen present

  well weve served notice on them now
he said quietly

  his eyes ran swiftly up and down the line
and suddenly he was filled with a great
pride at the thought of being chosen leader
by such men with the exception of tom
pine and a couple of reckless youngsters in
lonergans crew the business in hand was
appalling to his followers they were not
men of violence they were men with a hun-
ger for orderly communities some of them
actually were sick at stomach from the un-
accustomed sensations of the situation yet
not one of them but plainly told by the


adventure

look on his face that he was ready to stand
up and give life itself if necessary in order
that the new rule of law and rder might
be established

  to gaston who always deprecated his
own courage because the prospect of trouble
only filled him with joy there was some-
thing heroic in the courage of these quiet
citizens he saw them in a new light-es-
pecially hale hale was handling his shot-
gun clumsily but his eyes were as steady as
gastons or tom pines

  yes said lonergan weve served em
notice now theyve either got to pull their
steel or back down

  they-wont back down said hale
taggart wont let em

  nope old perkins was nervously
chewing tobacco nope they wont back
down

  neither will we said another man
  no they said almost as one

  what did you do with murphy asked
gaston

  put him in a shack back of the post-
office with two men to guard him

  they stood looking down toward the red
lights it was quiet down there but gas-
ton knew what trouble was boiling and
doubts assailed him as he considered the
possible results to these men

  have i done right boys he asked
  youve done right

  ive brought trouble coming to you
it had to come sometime better now
than later

  all right they wont be back here for
a little time at least lets go to hales
store and decide what to do

  in the light of the store-lamps they saw
the blood on his face

  hey cried dr sanders i knew
thered be work for me tonight but i didnt
think it would start so soon howd you
get that come here while i fix you up
who gave it to you

  gaston opened his mouth to tell of the
fight in the saloon but stopped looking
back upon it he saw suddenly how desperate
and reckless had been his adventure in the
same instant he remembered how but a
short time ago he had promised to be care-
ful this night he felt ashamed

murphys friends he replied evasively
bending over the basin which the doctor had
brought it doesnt amount to anything
amounts to this snapped tom pine

you sneaked off and hogged the fun after
promising to let me in on it

  dont worry therell be plenty more fun
before this nights over now lets put our
heads together ive arrested murphy
hes our first prisoner those fellows will
be after him sure as were living

  murphys nothing but a big bum and
the best thing to do with him is to kick him
out of town but for the present hes impor-
tant weve got to keep him as a warning
to em so i guess there wont be much
sleep for any of us tonight those fellows
will try to nose around and find out where
weve got him weve got to meet them
at that line out there and persuade em to
keep on their own side of the fence
right youre the boss give your or-
ders

  well i think this store is a good place
for us to make camp in said gaston
how many more men can we get together
that we can depend upon

  a silence fell over the room hale broke

it

  counting the two men guarding mur-
phy were most of us here theres three
or four men more will be here later then
there are some away who wont be back to-
night count on an even dozen

a dozen repeated gaston cheerfully
well well have to make that do then

well-

  youll raise- you will

  a voice in the doorway brought the last
man of them to his feet

  youll raise-and put a foundation

under it you will

  taggart was standing there his bulk fill-
ing the doorway he was all alone he
was stiff-eyed from whisky his fang-like
teeth showed through his ragged beard in a
leering grin and he stood leaning forward
his huge hands curved before him like claws

  the sudden sight of him sent a chill down
the back of most of those present they re-
alized fully now what they had to combat

  hello taggart said gaston easily
wheres your shotgun

  taggarts head dropped further forward
his grin grew wider and if ever eyes flashed
fire his blood-shot optics did then

  thorson if i was bothering about you
any more id have brought a shotgun he
said thickly but youre-youre only one
dog in a flock now one cur in a crowd and
ive decided to whip the whole lot of you
gaston olaf



out of my country do you hear his
voice suddenly rose to a demoniacal shout
that shook the lamps under the ceiling
the whole lot of you curs-dogs bitches
pups yes and your kennels too youre
all going together back up thorson will
you follow him because hes dared to
buck me eh ha-ha ha-ha-ha-ha buck
me

  he paused

  buck me he repeated in a whisper his
face swelling horribly suddenly he swept
his arm before him as if brushing something
out of his way and stepped back a step
all of you - whipped dogs - get away
take your women and kids and travel for
therell be no kennels for you to bed down
in when daylight comes in the morning
he was gone lurching back out of sight
in the darkness as suddenly as he had come

  the men in the store looked at one an-
other old perkinss shrill treble rose

  well the dirty-

  then they all looked at gaston the
doctor had halted in the act of putting stick-
ing-plaster on a cut on his cheek and gas-
ton was calmly completing the operation

  well-darn it doc this stuff wont
stick well boys now devil dave has
served notice on us

  there was no reply they were watching
him by his calmness they sensed that he
was confident that the solution of their
problem lay with him

  wha-what did he mean gasped a
white-faced man

  mean said gaston huh thats
easy he means that hes going to burn us
out

chapter xxxii

the power of woman

  a moment of horror-stricken silence
     followed gastons words

  well the dirty- repeated old per-
kins

  burn us out good god he wouldnt
dare do that

  you saw him didnt you said gaston
did he look like a man whod stop at any-
thing

  lonergan shook his head

  hell do it-if he can hes done things
like it before

   tom pine cleared his throat noisily

  i could have shot him right where he
stood he said puzzled i had my gun
right here and i was thinking you
crooked old whelp ill do one good thing
in this world and rid it of you but i
couldnt do it darn your law and order
its making me soft too

  well demanded perkins what are
we going to do now

  keep him from doing it

  gaston looked his men over there
would be twelve of them all told taggart
would have ftfty gaston moved swiftly
toward the door

   boys there arent enough of us he said
sharply we couldnt possibly keep em
from getting fires started everything is
dry as kindling if a fire once gets hold here
now everything goes so weve got to keep
em from getting started to do that weve
got to have more men and-you fellows
stay right here im going out and try to
get em

  tom pine made to rise but gaston was
away on the run he knew that he must
act and get results swiftly if at all and as
he ran by a roundabout way for sams
place he shook his head at the queer turn of
events for if he was to save havens falls
he must do it because of his carelessness

  gaston knew lumberjacks he knew
that the men whose champion he had been
and for whom he had exposed the methods
of the crooked pugilist were for the evening
at least his sworn friends they would have
liked nothing better than to hoist him on
their shoulders parade the town with him
fill him up on all the liquors that the place
afforded could he halt them in their wild
career of the evening and turn their hero-
worship to serious ends

  he approached sams place cautiously
keeping in the dark inside the outsiders
were holding sway the saloon - keeper
eager for their patronage now that they had
their money back had helped them kick
fighter gambler and knockout-men into the
street and the place was in their hands

  gaston waited until one of the older men
who first had spoken to him came out for
a moments air him he caught by the arm
and drew to one side out of the light

  my names mckenzie boy insisted
the man and im going to buy you a drink
or-

  all right mckenzie-but not just now
i need friends
io

adventure

  put er there cried mckenzie shaking
hands now lead the way

  i need a lot of friends this is serious
mckenzie its life or death for me-and
possibly some men and women and chil-
dren

  mckenzie sobered immediately

  theres forty men in our crew he said
after that fight were with you to a man
well for gods sake mckenzie round
em up tell em its against that gang if
theyre white men tell em this is the time
to show it pass the word on the quiet
and get em up to the big store-hales store
-as soon as you can and you can prom-
ise them a fight that will make anything
theyve ever been in look foolish do this
now if you want to square up for that
fight

   nough said i was their foreman all
winter ill have em there in a hurry or
im a swede

  gaston hurried back to the store three
more scared-looking but determined men
had joined the crowd so there now were
fifteen decent citizens to oppose taggarts
gang gaston looked them over and sucked
in his lips he had just seen the river-front
swarming with the gangsters fifty of them
there would be and they were a tough hard-
bitten crew futile to oppose them with
these soft-muscled townsmen if mcken-
zies men failed him-

  theyre coming came the shout from
outside

  hoop-la

  the first of mckenzies crew came tum-
bling into the room half a dozen of them
with big erik in the lead they swarmed
around gaston olaf thrusting the others
aside one man held toward him a roll of
bills two held forth bottles

  theres your share of the winnings ol
bear we chipped in take it we won
on you take a drink too 

  gaston drank sparingly from each bottle
and accepted the bills they would have
taken it as an insult had he refused

  now thats all the booze well touch for
the present boys said he and this roll
will pay for a little celebration afterward
chaffing them shaking the hands that
were outstretched to him laughing heartily
as they smote him affectionately on the
back and called him endearing and profane
names he received them as they came tum-
bling into the store they were eager to

come eager to shake his hand the man
who had stolen the taggart drive and on
top of that given them sweet revenge on
the slugger was for this night their hero
their great man of the world on the other
hand they were in town to celebrate and
this store and this crowd looked like a
mighty dry place

  wheres the excitement thorson they
cried stir er up this looks too much
like church for us

  when mckenzie came hurrying in at the
head of a dozen men bringing the number
of this crew present up to thirty gaston
held up his hand for silence

  boys he began seriously we want
you to join us we need your help
whos we  demanded a voice

  dont make no difference who tis
snapped mckenzie theres a man we
owe our shirts to you listen to him
the gang thats been bucking you fel-
lows all evening is fixing to burn this end
of town continued gaston he talked
swiftly for he saw that this sober sort of
meeting was not to the taste of the joyous
lumberjacks and he feared he might lose
his hold that gang is taggarts you
know how theyve run things around here
this end of town is where the white people
live in this settlement there are women
and babies in these houses boys and that
gang is fixing to burn em out if were
white men we cant stand by and see that
done we need you boys with us we arent
enough to protect those women and kids
without you what do you say are you
white men will you stick with us and
keep that gang from getting up into this
end of town

  by the silence that followed his speech
gaston knew the men were not won like
wild unbroken colts the lumberjacks were
balking had he gaily placed himself at
their head and led them to clean out a saloon
they would have followed without a mo-
ments hesitation but they balked at this
sober appeal for help to guard the houses of
towns people against fire

  where the - is the fun in that

growled one come on lets go back and
get a drink

  go ahead cried gaston flaring an-
grily go get your drink you probably
wouldnt be any good anyhow

  dont tear your shirt noisy spoke
mckenzie his hand on the mans shoulder
gaston olaf



stay right here but lemme tell you
thorson this isnt exactly what we were
looking for

  afraid

  come off man dont get on your horse
just because we dont fall over ourselves to
go with you theres some of us with wo-
men and kids too and we get a living for
them on taggarts pay-roll thered be no
more work in this country for a man who
bucked taggarts gang too hard

  at this lonergan thrust his square figure
beside gaston

  well well if it aint old iron trail
greeted an old jack speak up lonergan
talks cheap

  not the kind of talk im going to make
retorted lonergan you know who i am
dont you boys

  sure hes the man who grows rail-
roads spit it out old hoss

  lonergan turned toward mckenzie

  you said thered be no work in this coun-
try for a man who bucked taggart too hard
youre wrong thats just the kind of man
wholl be able to find work right here-as
much as he wants-at better wages than
taggart pays in fact im up here to hire
men next week were going to start blaz-
ing the trail for the line from la croix up
here ill need axmen shovelers skinners
drivers spikers cooks water-boys walking-
bosses-therell be two crews the log-
gings over for this season how about a
steady job for all spring and summer and
the boys who get on my pay-roll will be the
ones who help us tonight

  that goes cried mckenzie i play
with you

  together with a few of the older men he
pressed forward toward lonergan but the
young fellows the bulk of the crew stood
still the idea of providing themselves with
further employment was farthest of all from
their minds just then the future might
take care of itself in the meantime furious
thoughtless excitement was what they
craved this thing was too orderly too
sober for them

  to-with a job laughed one our

moneys still good

  but dont forget who saved it for you
shouted mckenzie

  to- we aint playing police for no

mans town come on boys this aint no
fun

  then go gastons voice vibrated with

 

anger though from the first he had feared
just such a turn and when weve won
this fight alone well make you fellows take
the tall timber on the run

  they laughed and started for the door
wild colts that would not be haltered and
then they stopped

  has anything happened is any one
hurt

  gaston and hale started as one and look-
ed at each other at the sound of the new
voice it was rose she came running in
and the men made way for her inside the
door she paused panting her hands on her
breast and looked around

  oh her eyes fell on gaston and de-
spite the plaster on his face she gave an
exclamation of relief then on hale and
she grew quiet i saw the crowd i was
afraid some one had been hurt but-im
mistaken

  nobody hurt miss rose dr sanders
tried to say it jauntily but it was a miserable
failure

  hale looked steadily at the floor gaston
looked over her head neither cared to
meet her inquiring eyes nor did lonergan
or tom or the doctor but the lumber-
jacks of crew one were staring at her as at
a vision and the light of wickedness went
out of many eyes and gave place to some-
thing better they looked at her worship-
fully

  she was dressed in a gown of soft white-
ness and her face was alight with the light
of a mother-heart stirred with alarm to
those rough boy-men she was more than
merely a dainty and beautiful girl she
was the eternal dream woman which men
of their ilk dream of and are prepared to
worship

  their caps came off unconsciously they
grew sober

  rose looked at the serious faces of the
townsmen and tried in vain to catch gas-
tons eye

  nobody hurt at all said he airily
just a little meeting

  what is it she whispered is any-
thing going-to-happen

  no no he said

  dick she cried to hale

  no no everythings all right you-
you had better go home
i she looked around she couldnt under-
stand there was something behind the
faces which she had learned to know so


adventure

well she looked at lonergan at tom pine
at dr sanders she turned and looked at
the men of crew one

  boys she cried to them youll tell
me i know-is anything going to happen

  there was a moment of silence crew
one began to smile then came the reply
bellowed earnestly from a huge pair of lungs
-from the man who had said this aint
no fun

  not by a da- excuse me lady i
mean no sir no siree maam there aint
nothing going to happen no by godfrey
not enough-not enough to fry a six-inch
trout at

  and crew one shouted as one man to
back him up

  thats right you bet your bottom
boots

chapter xxxiii

battle

gaston watching the faces of the men
whispered sharply to hale

  take her home get her away from
here

  he would have given much to accompany
her home himself but his place just then
was with crew one

  roses eyes grew soft at the sudden heart-
felt tribute which had been given her she
held forth her hands to them in a gesture of
fraternity

  thank you boys thank you she mur-
mured yes dick i know ill go home

  they watched her go out watched her
cap in hand watched till the last glimpse of
her was lost in the darkness

  well said gaston you discovered
you were white men after all did you

  they came swarming back to him they
were eager to make amends eager to do
something ferocious to prove that they
meant what they had said

  say husk we didnt understand they
shouted they held forth their hands

how the-could we understand you

know what kind of women wed been seeing
in this burg by godfrey thats a thor-
oughbred little lady come on big fellow
shake hands were all white men together
now now we know what youre standing
up for thorson lead the way well go
to-for you now

all right boys i knew you were white

men if it was put up to you right gaston
leaned over to lonergan lonergan take
all your men whove got guns and scatter
them in a straight line across the town right
here youve enough that nobody can slip
through without being seen if any tag-
gart man gets through lire a shot they
may go into the timber and try to sneak in
and fire her from behind when hale comes
back better have him and a couple others
keep moving through this end of town on
the lookout better go at once

  right come on boys

  lonergan led the posse of citizens out
into the night tom pine remained behind

  all right tom said gaston put
your rifle down you can go with us now
boys a couple of you slip down and see if
the gang is bunched up any place

  two youngsters ran out eagerly they
were back in ten minutes their number in-
creased to a dozen by members of crew
one whom they had picked up

  theyre just leaving mccarthys place
was the report theyre coming this way
fine cried gaston boys i prom-
ised you a fight roll up your sleeves and
spit on your hands weve got to clean up
that gang tonight and the way to lick a
man is to get right at him

  in two great leaps he was at the door
  can we handle em he cried

  let us at em

  then come a-running yelled gaston
and on the dead run he led his men out of
the store and straight at the black mass
which was coming up the street

  taggarts gang stopped suddenly at the
line which gaston had drawn across the
street they stopped in surprise

  they had come on taggarts orders ex-
pecting to find a dozen townsmen in hales
store half a dozen carried shotguns
their plan was to trap the men in the store
hold them helpless at gun-muzzles and fire
the town at their leisure they had even
come prepared to shoot and shoot quickly
at any movement of weapons on the part of
their opponents

  but what they found was considerably
different from what they had expected

  down the street at them came hurtling a
crowd of yelling men as large as their own
with gaston at their head with their big-
gest men at his sides crew one just then
was terrible to behold

  gaston had thrown off all self-restraint
gaston olaf



for the time he had gone berserk throw-
ing himself headlong at the enemy think-
ing not and caring not that they might be
armed eager only to come to grips confi-
dent that nothing could stop his rush

  his fury had communicated itself to his
followers thoughts of danger impulses of
fear were for the time being non-existent
for them shotguns eh all right a few
of them might go down but they would
follow the big fellow through that crowd
and back again trampling the guts out of
em if they never did anything else in the
world

  the gunmen hesitated their only chance
was to have shot instantly without hesita-
tion as at a leaping lynx ere they could
think they were lost

  gaston knocked up the first gun and
struck the gang like a maddened bull his
men at his side in a flash the gunmen
were down their weapons gone

  fight -you fight

  taggarts voice rose from the rear the
roar of a drunken animal

  fight-you fight echoed gaston

mockingly

the gang stiffened at taggarts
command the two sides met with
a thud groans followed curses and
screams drowned the sound of blows over
it all rose gastons laughter

  come on boys - right through em
well get devil dave himself

  a few knives flashed among the gang-
sters the glint of steel drove the lumber-
jacks mad they were not to be stopped
for a minute possibly taggarts men held
then with a shout gaston broke through
with a dozen men and the fight was won

  clean em hold em boys dont let
em run

  crew one was just beginning to fight
gaston and his dozen saw that taggart had
disappeared and threw themselves back on
the gang

  thats the stuff boys dont let em
run

  but the gang suddenly feeling itself sur-
rounded broke away they began to run
to both sides of the street

  dont let em get away rose the cry
they used knives hold em back

  the fight became a rout the gangsters
ran in all directions after them went the
lumber-jacks

  the battle spread to the timber on either
side of town it raged steadily dow- to-
ward the red-lights it swept into the sa-
loons and out again gaston led wherever
a group of the gangsters made a stand in
his hand he carried as a bludgeon the bar-
rels of a shotgun-the stock he had smashed
on a gunmans head-and at the sight of
him the gangsters turned and ran

  shoot him shoot that- they cried

  but nobody found time to shoot it was
a rush that would not be stayed the den-
keepers hastily locked and barred their
doors and taggarts men found hiding-
places denied them down through the
river-front swept the pursuit it ended at
the darkness along the river and gaston
and his men paused and drew breath
there was no one left for them to fight

  hoop-la the lumberjacks danced
jigs and shouted bring on your tigers
we eat em alive

  his face alight with triumph gaston
turned to look back his jaw fell in horror

  good god boys look theyve done
it after all

  up the street in the upper part of town
a sweep of flame was rushing toward the
sky in the madness of the fight no man
of them had turned to note what was going
on behind them now the whole settle-
ment was lurid iinder the rapidly rising
wall of flame and the roar and crackle of it
reached even down to the river

  good god that must be hales store
gastons voice was a hoarse whisper and
if it is the whole streetll go

  he started back toward the flames on a
run followed by his men

  it was not hales store that was burning
but the building next to it this was used
as a livery-barn and stood wall to wall with
hales building the bam already was a
furnace too hot to approach from its dry
shingle roof flakes of flame were flying
about

  thus far hales building larger and high-
er than the barn was serving as a bulwark
shielding the rest of the settlement from the
flying embers if the store went the way
of the barn it would fire the rest of the
street olsons hotel with tar paper on the
walls stood directly across the street from
it dr sanderss little office was at its side

  from these points the flames could reach
out and touch the other buildings each of
which built of pine and tinder-dry was like


adventure

kindling awaiting the match nothing is
as helpless as a new woods-town when a fire
starts in dry weather usually there is but
one thing to do-move out and watch it burn

  dr sanders was bending over a man of
crew one who lay in the street when gas-
ton arrived before the burning building

  well big fellow taggart stole a march
when you were rushing his gang he greet-
ed he and indian charley sneaked
around back of the barn at the height of
the melee had a can of oil and threw it
on the hay this boy here saw em and
jumped em just as taggart struck a match
they didnt quite kill him but the indian
gave him a little steel between the ribs all
right the barn was one flame in two min-
utes

  under hales direction men were carry-
ing cases of dynamite from the store to a
safe place in the woods other men were
salvaging the stock while some were climb-
ing to the roof to beat out the flames as
they fell the heat from the burning barn
prevented any attempt at working on it

  hale came out and sized up the situation
carefully

weve got to start a water line shout-
ed gaston if we get buckets enough we
can wet your building down and save it
hale suddenly looked up at his roof he
shook his head

  cant do it he said look

  the roof and the side wall nearest the
barn had caught the shingles were begin-
ning to burn and dabs of flame began to
fall from them

  ladders get some ladders cried gas-
ton it isnt too late yet weve got
men enough here to save her

  a burning shingle spewed upward by the
force of the flames floated through the
darkness above them and landed gracefully
on the stoop of olsons hotel

  you see too late said hale he
looked long at the big stanch building in
which was a good share of all he possessed
and onde more shook his head we
havent even got time to get the stock out
bill he called quietly to one of his men
go out and bring back one case of the dy-
namite will you

  man cried gaston dont do that

yet lets try first-

  a second flaming shingle sailed high over
the street dropped and was stamped out
beside the papered wall of the hotel

  i wouldnt have those poor women
burned out just to try to save my store
thorson what do you think would hap-
pen if my roof began to flame

  gaston made no reply

  its the only thing to do said hale

  gaston nodded his head silently the
man had returned bearing a heavy box of
explosive

  clear out boys cried hale get
away out of danger weve got to blow
her up

  a groan and a sigh of relief came from
the crowd they regretted the destruction
of the building and yet they realized that
by it the town would be saved

  fill up your buckets scatter your-
selves around ready to put out flying
brands and get out of the way when the
shot comes

  the crowd drew back until hale gaston
and tom pine stood alone before the burn-
ing building

  all right no use delaying it said hale
and the three men moved to their work

  gaston and tom pine salvaged stock af-
ter the charges had been laid and the fuses
lighted at the last moment they rushed
out with armfuls of goods to join hale who
had sought shelter behind the hotel

  there she goes groaned tom pine as
the building rose in the air at the explo-
sion

  gaston vented a curse from the bottom
of his chest the store had fallen together
like a house of cards the barn fell with
it and there remained of it only a low pile
of jumbled lumber which burned without
offering any danger to the other buildings
of the town

  hale wiped his lips with his fingers

  well he said steadily we did a good
job of that

  a small form in white came running to-
ward them it was rose

  oh dick your store-how did it hap-
pen

  there was dynamite in it-it just blew
up replied hale

  her eyes fell on gaston even in the
half-darkness he saw the light that leapt
into them but he looked away as if it was
something he had no right to see

  oh gaston ive heard how you saved

  dont he cried hoarsely theres the
man who did it-hale his store didnt
gaston olaf



just blow up he blew it up himself when
there might have been a chance to save it
because he was too big a man to risk others
property to save his own

  and he hurried back to where men with
buckets were splashing the fringes of the
dying fire

chapter xxxiv

gaston buys store clothes

of all the wild nights that havens
falls had known that was the wild-
est for when crew one calmed down suf-
ficiently to count noses it found that three
more of its members had suflered knife-
wounds fully as serious as those of the man
who had tried to prevent taggart from
firing the barn

   only one result could follow this discov-
ery the lumberjacks went on the war-
path for revenge nothing could stop
them gaston knew the breed too well to
try before the fire had burned down to
embers they were back on the river front
red-eyed with hate and fury roaring their
intentions to revenge the boys who had
been stabbed

  wheres devil dave wheres that-

indian they demanded well show em
its dangerous to knife boys from camp
one

   naturally neither taggart nor the indian
was to be found the jacks began hunting
for other victims these likewise were
hard to find

  most of the gang had gone into hiding
such as had the hardihood to remain in the
saloons also had the cunning to conceal the
fact that they had taken any share in the
struggle at rare intervals one of them was
recognized then there was a beating and a
scurry and only the strength of arm of the
cooler men prevented a lynching

   soon the river-front was cleared of every
one who might be considered a fair object
for vengeance the tension lessened men
began to laugh and slap one another on the
back the fighting was over now to cele-
brate it crew one rushed up to the bars
and set in to get truly good and drunk

  a few of the older men mckenzie lead-
ing them held back they even sought to
urge moderation upon the others as well
seek to whistle down a storm mckenzie
and his kind seeing the uselessness of re-

monstrance went up to the hotel and went
to bed while the victorious lumberjacks
freed of all restraint proceeded to make the
night terrible they drank like madmen
they howled like the bob-cats and wolves of
the forest and they danced

  gradually these effervescences ceased
the dancing and shouting ceased the affair
degenerated into a frightful drinking con-
test they did not move from the bars
standing stiffly leaning lazily or hanging
on with both hands they stayed by the
rude counters drinking as often as a glass
was set before them presently the weaker
ones began to fall away the floor became
littered with them they lay outside sleep-
ing the terrible liquor of the river-front
laid most of them low but when daylight
appeared it found a few stiff-eyed and
sleepy hanging on to a bar with one hand
while with the other they carried liquor to
their already burnt-out throats

  in the upper part of town there was
peace and quiet though few slept gaston
organized the men in watches and himself
kept circling the town all night with the
woods full of gangsters there was constant
danger that one of them would attempt to
sneak forth and start a new fire it was
even possible that taggart might round
them up and make another rush

  when daylight appeared it found gaston
swinging briskly around on the patrol which
had occupied him throughout the night a
feeling of bitterness and defeat came to him
as the rising sun revealed the smoking ruins
of hales store and the barn

  the charred timbers seemed to grin at
him reminding him that in spite of the
overwhelming support of crew one tag-
gart had managed to make good a small
part of his threat

  i broke up the gang but i didnt get
the old man mused gaston devil dave
is still fighting and therell be more of this
to come

  the store was a total loss of the large
diversified stock which had filled it a scant
tenth possibly had been saved as gas-
ton contemplated what was left he forgot
taggart and a thrill ran through him at the
memory of hales splendid action in the
crisis

  hes a man he said aloud yep hes
a real man

  he laughed swiftly as he considered how
taggarts coup had failed after all


adventure

  taggart set out to hurt hale by burning
him out he burned his store all right
but he didnt hurt him not much he
gave him a chance to show what was in
him and hes such a quiet modest little
fellow youd never suspect him of being
that big unless he had a chance like this
now hes had his chance everybody
knows what hes made of peoplell be talk-
ing of this for years to come theyll look
up to hale and he deserves it hell be
one of the biggest men around here which
he is ha and taggart gave him his
chance the laughs on taggart after all

  thus mused gaston as in the first rays
of the-rising sun he marched up and down
the street he had seen a fellow-man put to
the test and meet the test in glorious fash-
ion and he was glowing with appreciation

  his own actions of the night he sincerely
considered as nothing in comparison he
had merely led in a terrific fight and he was
one of those who begin to hear sweet music
instead of the voice of fear at the approach
of trouble he considered that he deserved
no credit had he been completely success-
ful against taggart he might have been in-
clined to strut a little but he had not
been that quite the blackened timbers
were reminders that taggart was not de-
feated

  and therell be no end of this trouble
till the old man himself is licked

  his march had led him to beyond the
post-office at this moment he stopped and
looked around

  the rays of the morning sun topping the
eastern hills was lighting up the front of
the havens home directly before him
gaston smiled the house was very pretty
to his eyes in the morning light apparent-
ly its occupants were sleeping soundly he
thought of rose as he had left her with
hale last night and he was glad he had left
them and had told the truth about hales
store the better man must win it must
be a fair game if hale was the man for
her all right

  he recalled the look she had given him
her face upturned to him seemed to be
before him he grew thoughtful could he
make her happy a woman like her was
he the man for her

  he looked down at himself and felt abash-
ed his shirt was torn into strips and
through openings were to be seen cuts and
bruises he looked at his hands his knuck-

les were raw and his right thumb was swol-
len and discolored there was blood on his
red sash and buckskin trousers no he
was scarcely the sort of specimen to go
wooing a girl like rose

  gaston waited until smoke began to ap-
pear from chimneys and the town began
to stir then he went to the house of the
owner of the settlements clothing store and
dragged him forth

  hello cried the man just in time
for breakfast

  thanks dont want any breakfast
retorted gaston come with me to your
store i want a new outfit

  something like what youve got on i
spose said the merchant when they
reached the store

  no siree pop was the emphatic reply
nothing at all like what ive got on i
want-i want some regular store clothes
there was difficulty in fitting him his
huge shoulders cracked wide open the first
coat he tried on at last an outfit was as-
sembled he also purchased a shaving
equipment and towels

  now youll come back and have break-
fast with us insisted the storekeeper

  gaston excused himself he had some-
thing else to do

  with his new clothing under his arm he
slipped out of town and went down the
river till he found a deep clear pool the
sun was tinting the stream and in the pool
the water was like a mirror kneeling on
the bank gaston leaned over and studied
his reflection in the water he grinned at
what he saw

  you certainly are hard - looking this
morning boy he chuckled but so long as
you didnt get your eyes blacked you can
fix yourself up

  with the pool as his mirror he shaved
carefully next he stripped and stood poised
for an instant in the sunlight a figure for a
sculptor to marvel at

  into the ice-cold water he dove with
scarcely a splash and when he came leap-
ing out to rub himself down he was rosy
he dressed himself in new apparel from feet
to head and stretched himself gingerly feel-
ing cramped and confined at every joint

  he was now arrayed in a sober suit of
blue a soft white shirt with a loose collar
solid leather shoes and a soft black hat
the coat pinched him under the arms and
rubbers and moccasins being his accustomed
gaston olaf



footwear the shoes felt stiff and heavy on
his feet

  with a sigh he tossed his old torn shirt
out into the current and watched it float
down-stream the buckskin trousers sash
cap and rubber high-tops were about to
follow but he checked himself when he
presented himself at the room which he and
tom had taken at the hotel these articles
were under his arm

  tom looked up at his entrance and laugh-
ed uproariously

  what in sam hill gaston olaf you-
you got religion

  oh no said gaston tossing his old
clothes into a corner i just wanted to find
out how town clothes feel

  well how about it how do they feeli

  ohr with a tug at his collar i sup-
pose a man can get used to anything

chapter xxxv

a quiet sunday

a fter the turbulent saturday night
sunday came quiet and peaceful the
calm succeeding the storm it was the first
orderly sunday in the history of havens
falls true a few of the celebrating lum-
berjacks upon awakening sought the bars
and attempted to resuscitate the corpse
of last nights orgy but the attempt fell
fiat

  most of the men in their own words had
got enough to last some staggered up
to the hotel to sleep off the ravages of their
celebration others sought shelter in the
woods for the same purpose

  a pall hung over the river-front the
bars were nearly deserted where a group
was assembled there was no noise some-
thing new had come to the settlement which
made itself felt even in the foulest corner of
the worst den in the front-law and order
civilization

  in a vague stupid sort of way the gang-
sters realized the coming of these new forces
that crude line drawn by gastons foot
across the street was like a wall unto them
they scowled and cursed but they made
no more ebullient statements that the town
was theirs to do with as they pleased
they had read the writing on the wall and
were troubled

  taggart and indian charley had disap-
peared immediately after firing the barn

  he looked like he needed a sleep
chuckled tom pine when hes slept the
liquor out of his head hell probably come
back

  yes said gaston hell come back
sure

  for the present however there was noth-
ing to cast a shadow over havens falls
the day was a warm sunny day in spring
the world was covered with new green
things hundreds of birds sang in the trees
and it was sunday

  true there were the ruins of hales store
and the barn to remind of what had taken
place the night before but havens falls
was young and recovered rapidly and by
noon those same ruins were things to joke
over while wondering if the trout wouldnt
soon begin biting there were picnic parties
up on the big hill and rowing parties up
the river

  dr sanders and hulda paddled down-
stream in a birch-bark canoe when they
returned hulda had promised that if he
would stop drinking so much whisky she
would marry him as soon as they could get
a house it was hales canoe that they
paddled in hale had no time to go canoe-
ing that sunday he and lonergan were
busy hiring men and planning to build up
a new store

  in the middle of the bright afternoon
gaston gave way to the desire that had
tugged at his heart all morning and sought
out rose he found her starting up the hill
toward the picnic party and she stood stock
still and marveled at the change in his at-
tire

  well he laughed do i look civilized

  yes she said seriously and paused

  even if i dont act that way yet he
suggested

  no i wasnt going to say that was
her grave reply i have heard the men
talking about you they say that the only
reason why you were able to save the town
was that-that you had acted so-so dar-
ingly-

  recklessly he interposed

  early in the evening it isnt for me to
judge you naturally i thought it was
strange for you to do such a thing imme-
diately after you had promised me that
youd be careful but men say it was fine
and big-your fighting that you are a
great man i suppose you are a judge of
what was necessary to save the town you


adventure

did save us anyhow i know she concluded
and-and you do look civilized now

  i am glad of that he said gravely i
want to be civilized i want to settle down
but men are wrong when they say that
fighting was fine and big it wasnt it
was fool recklessness it turned out lucky
though for the town and the people and
everything about it and im glad of that
they were half-way up the ridge now
and they stopped and looked back below
them the town and its environs lay like a
green map there lay the settlement on its
flat in the river bend a peerless town-site
through it curved the rushing la croix
lending virility and force to the scene

  on all hands stretched the fat farming
land waiting only the plow of the breaker
the birch gleamed white through the green
note of spring it was a good country it
fairly smiled in the warm afternoon sunlight

  look at it cried gaston his out-door
senses thrilled by the scene isnt it
enough to make a man want to throw off
his coat and dig in to help make it fit for
folks to live in look at that flat along
the river-miles and miles of it think of
what a lot of young couples can find homes
and farms on that look at the power in
that river cant you see mills and wood-
factories along it

  and theres the little town when i
look at it i dont see those little shacks
down there i see a street with brick build-
ings - stores banks everything and
churches and schools and fine homes
down theres where the depot will be and
the trainsll come swinging around that hog-
back yonder and preachers and school-
teachers and all those kind of people will
come riding in on the train and the folks
who marry will have a chance to educate
their kids right here its a dream i know
but this dream certainly is coming true
she cried out clapping her hands in de-
light at the picture he had drawn

  oh gaston to think theres all that
in you

  he turned swiftly a hungry look at the
corners of his mouth

  rose-rose theres many sorts of things
in me more than i know myself perhaps
most of whats come out so far has been

the rough wild part-

  no sir dont you say that i owe
you too much to permit it its been fine-
much of it

  well if there is anything fine in me and

if it has shown its been because of-

  he checked himself suddenly he looked
away out over the town

  rose he resumed quietly every man
-every white man-wants the fine in him
to come out if its in him i want it i
dont know whether its there or not some-
times im afraid its not a man will be
what his nature makes him but-rose
he broke off suddenly are you engaged to
hale

  no she was cruelly agitated he is
my best friend

  hes a brick but-nothing else
  no

  he tore the top off a pine-bush and
crushed it in his hands

  rose tell me honestly he pleaded
frankly what do you think of me
what i-think of you she grasped
his arm drawing him around so he must
meet her eyes how can you ask me that
when youve done what you have for me
no no not that you know what i
mean

  slowly she let go of his arm and slowly
her eyes went to the ground

  oh gaston gaston she stammered
you charm me you thrill me you seem
to warm me and waken me when you come
near me like the morning sun or like a
fresh south wind in spring yes youre like
that your smile is like the sun to me real-
ly theres something in me that leaps up
and makes me want to-to go to you but
theres something about you that - that
frightens me too i dont know what it is
oh please please lets go on up to the
others

  you bet he said and promptly began
to help her up the hill toward the picnic
party but-have i got a chance

  she did not reply her eyes rose and
met his and fell again and he knew that
he could win her that if he persisted she
would come to love him that he could make
her his own

chapter xxxvi

settling down

from that moment he gravely set to
work to make himself fit to have the
right to claim her he realized that he had
a difficult task before him there was hale
gaston olaf

and hale was in love with her and would
make her the kind of husband she deserved

  she would marry hale gaston knew if
it were not for himself and she would be
happy with hale too so he had no right
to think of winning her unless he could make
sure that he would be as good a husband as
hale that was his task now to be the
kind of a man who was fit to marry rose
havens it would be a hard pull but he
had done many hard things and his confi-
dence in himself was unbounded so he set
to work

  his first move was to call on jack mc-
carthy in the latters place that evening
he had selected mccarthy as the strong
man of the river-front mccarthy greeted
him quietly and thrust forth a bottle and
two glasses gaston pushed them back
ill have a little water jack

  without a word mccarthy filled two
glasses with water

  heres how said he now-shoot
for a start began gaston you know
ive got no hard feelings against you
youre in this business and thats all right
but ive been elected to keep order in this
town and thats my business youre the
leader down here and thats why im talk-
ing to you the wild days are over in this
town pin that up over your register and
remember it this gang down here doesnt
run havens falls any longer weve got
the whip-hand up in the other end of town
and weve decided to make the place de-
cent we arent going to interfere with you
unless you interfere with us theres a line
up there in the street you fellows keep
this side of it

   dont think im just talking its seri-
ous you fellows might tear loose and lick
us once but were here to stay you can
pass the word to the gang that their days
over this is your side of the line but
dont let things get so wild that they spill
over on us if you do somebody will have
to leave town-and were high man im
telling you this to avoid trouble
mccarthy nodded

   ive seen it coming he said im get-
ting ready to move

  later that night gaston took red-shirt
murphy a mile down the river road and
pointed down-stream

  good-by murphy he said youve
had your day in havens falls but youre
leaving now dont come back it

wouldnt be healthy lynchings too good
for a man wholl rob a kid heres what you
deserve- hike

   red shirts teeth rattled as gastons right
foot lifted him in the air the erstwhile
bad man picked himself up hurriedly gas-
ton was setting himself for another kick
murphy put his head down and ran out of
sight and out of havens falls

  next gaston placed the deeds for his
own and tom pines timber claim in loner-
gans hands the railroad man added the
land to the holdings of his company a few
days later he returned from la croix with
deeds conveying to the two partners the
parcel of land which he had directed gas-
ton to secure in havens falls

  now i feel sure of you said lonergan
when the last details of the transfer were
completed youll stick now

  whats that

  i say youll stick here now was afraid
youd quit us and go wandering dont
want you to do it we need you right here
feel sure of you now a man usually sticks
in the spot where hes got property

  tom pine grumbled as he studied the
deeds

  town property he growled what
have i got to do with things like that a
piece of timber-land thats all right a
man can build his shack and camp on it if
he wants to but i aint no town real-es-
tater gaston olaf you know that

  you can sell out pretty soon and get
enough to buy all the timber-land you
want replied gaston this is our chance
to make a stake

   tom thought it over for a while

  yep thats all right for you gaston
olaf-to make a stake he muttered but
for me after its made what am i going to
do with it

  nevertheless tom pine followed his lead-
ers example and apparently was resolved
upon settling down and becoming a perma-
nent resident of havens falls he went to
work for hale who backed by lonergan
was rebuilding the store tom worked
steadily through the lazy spring days and
drew only such part of his pay as was neces-
sary for his expenses

if i had any loose money in my clothes
id be apt to want to let er roar a little
he explained and gaston olaf being mar-
shal twouldnt be right of me to do that
gaston finding no immediate call for his


adventure

services as marshal went to work on the
railroad lonergan had started his line
from both ends and gaston was placed in
charge of the clearing crew working out of
havens falls he was a very different fore-
man than the one who had driven tag-
garts men so ruthlessly he worked so-
berly and steadily

  the line ran out through a forest of birch
at times when the white trunks of the
trees glistened in the warm spring sun
when the rapidly growing leaves waved laz-
ily in the slight breeze and a dozen varieties
of birds made the woods alive with their
songs and plumage he was moved to leap
into the air and shout from sheer joy of liv-
ing he didnt do it however at such
times he thought of what he was working
for and with tightly pressed lips seriously
went on with his duties

  there was only one thing to worry him
now taggart had sobered up and had re-
turned to his office as cold and masterful
apparently as ever it was his busy sea-
son his drives were behind the booms
and he was occupied with the work of turn-
ing the winters harvest into money

  gaston agreed with his associates not to
trouble taggart so long as he did not
trouble them he did not for an instant
fancy that taggart had dropped the feud
he kept his skin whole in those days only
by his unflagging vigilance and by showing
taggart and his men that he was not to be
caught off his guard the strain brought
new fines about his mouth what new dev-
iltry was taggart planning when would
he show it and how

  gastons natural impulse was to rush to
meet taggart face to face and have it over
with one way or another in one final clash
he held his peace however a trying thing
for him to do with an enemy in sight his
natural impulses were under complete con-
trol-for the time being

chapter xxxvii

a storm brewing

taggarts old gang had been thor-
oughly broken up a few of its mem-
bers who had taken only a small part in the
memorable night fight came drifting back
carefully feeling out the ground and ready
to flee at the first sign of hostility

the fight had been taken out of them

craven at heart they saw that power in the
settlement had passed from taggart to the
decent element and they sought at once to
curry favor with the latter here however
they met rebuffs

  gaston pointed to the line he had drawn
in the street

  you made your choice that night he
reminded them get back where you be-
long nobody will trust you up here we
wont bother you if you dont bother us but
-youre not wanted

  the leaders of the gang followed mur-
phys example and did not return the
gangsters who had come back hung meekly
around the river-front and law and order
were undisturbed in havens falls

  pretty dull aint it gaston olaf com-
mented tom pine one saturday evening as
they sat before the hotel and looked down
toward the river-front  member how it
used to be on a satday night down there
now-why you cant scare up enough ex-
citement to start a sweat

  dont want to start any excitement
retorted gaston this is just the way we
want it nice quiet and orderly

  tom pine heaved a sigh

  yes but it gets darn good and dull
sometimes youll admit me that gaston
olaf

  ill admit nothing of the sort was the
reply this is the way i want things ive
worked to make things this way dont want
any foolish excitement any more besides
his eyes lighted up therell be plenty of
excitement before long taggart isnt go-
ing to lay quiet much longer

  taggart hm hm what about tag-
gart big fellow

  dr sanders coming to see hulda stop-
ped for a moments chat gaston repeated
his remark the doctor shook his head

  hm hm dont agree with you gas-
ton old devil dave is a bear sure enough
but he isnt exactly mad with the heat no
one man is going to try to buck a whole
settlement by himself and taggarts gang
is gone-busted

  but the old man isnt insisted gaston
hell bear a lot of watching yet the old
gang is gone sure but theres nothing to
keep him from getting another

  the doctor passed on inside and tom
pine lighted his pipe and went for a stroll
after a while gaston rose and went down
the street to the river-front
gaston olaf



  as he passed mccarthys he glanced
through the open door and stopped in sur-
prise mccarthy was not in sight where
he was accustomed to stand on saturday
nights stood a heavy crop-headed man with
the flat face and figure of a slav impelled
by curiosity gaston entered new bartend-
ers of the same type as the man in front
were behind the bar the crowd likewise
was different squat flat-faced foreigners
talking in a strange guttural tgngue

  hullo boss greeted gaston wheres
mccarthy

  gone way was the guttural response
dis place mine now

  gaston recalled what mccarthy had said
about getting ready to move

  youve bought mccarthy out

  yess anting elsse you want know

  a snicker ran around the crowd gaston
looking at their flat evil faces saw they were
regarding him with sneers anger flared up
within him hot words sprang to his
tongue but he caught himself in time

  no thats all he said patiently and
turned to go

  the proprietor followed him to the door
  i hear bout you you run diss town

hah by- you won run jan ulnicks

place jan ulnick polska saloon see
dats wha diss goin be polish manns
goin work for bahss taggar see bahss
tell us all bout you you tink you want to
monk with us hah we don stand dat
see

  i see replied gaston and hurried to
get himself away before his rage could mas-
ter him

  he went at once to lonergan who was
in town and told what he had discovered
lonergan had an old pole in the crew at
that end of the line a man who had been
with him for years and whom he could trust
this man he sent to mingle with the crowd
at mccarthys old place and learn all he
could the old man returned within an
hour shaking his head

  it is jan ulnick the bad saloon-keeper
from over on the iron range he reported
the men with him are bad men miners
who would not work who are driven out of
the mines ulnick had a bad place over
there he is driven out by the sheriff and
these men with him taggart sends for
them he tells them this is a place they
can do as they please in no sheriff nobody
to stop them-if they do not let the people

  here bluff them he tells them the people
here are great bluffers but they are afraid
of bad strong men ulnick buys out mc-
carthy taggart promises the rest work
other bad saloon-keepers and men are com-
ing from the range they say nobody had
better monkey with them

  lonergan looked silently at gaston as
the old man finished his story and gaston
looked back the railroad man shook his
head

   our friend taggart is a great man said
he great general great politician great or-
ganizer-gone wrong

  i knew he was about due to make a
move said gaston but i never looked
for this

  he couldnt have made a better one
from his point of view continued loner-
gan he knows that he could never get
another gang of white men around him here
theyve all heard of what happened to the
old gang youve busted the old mans
grip he had to get hold of a crew that
didnt know what had happened here and
wouldnt understand if they did these ig-
norant pig - faced hunyaks fill the bill
taggart is himself again

  hes a fox and a wolf admitted gas-
ton were too strong for him now
though

  lonergan scratched his head dubiously
i dunno about that thorson of
course taggarts out for one kind of game
you understand that

   the first job hell set these hunyaks at
is to put me out of business agreed gas-
ton quietly 

  yes and if they succeed in doing that
-well you know what it will look like
taggart will be big chief again and god
help havens falls

  thats it and thats why im not go-
ing to take any chances

  whats your program thorson

  keep out of their way as much as pos-
sible leave them alone if they leave us
alone b ut if they get so bad we cant stand
em-

  he stopped abruptly with a snap of his
teeth and stood looking with flashing eyes
toward the river-front

  then what

  gastons teeth gleamed white as he
smiled

  law and order said he law and
order forever


adventure

  tom pine heaved a sigh of relief when he
heard of the new situation

  then therell be something happening
said he contentedly hunyaks are lambs
when theyre alone but wolves when you
get em in a pack theyll be trying to run
us out nacherly we wont go therell
be some excitement then we need it
things have been mighty dull

  in the next few days it developed that
lonergans man had reported the situation
correctly one by one the old saloon-keep-
ers of the front sold out and men of ul-
nicks type took their places the dives
and the dance-hall changed hands last of
all there was a complete change in the
personnel of the front the newcomers
brought women with them the river-front
was in their hands and under ulnicks lead-
ership

  save for this threatening change havens
falls would have been gloriously content
with itself during those bright days of
spring it was experiencing the first thrill
of a boom and the optimism of a boom-
town was its to a considerable degree

  that a railroad was being built up to the
settlement was in itself enough to start the
enthusiasm settlers began to come in
merchants followed them the rattle of
hammers echoed ceaselessly throughout the
warm days houses were thrown up swift-
ly lots were staked out and sold build-
ing lots where a few weeks before rabbits
had romped undisturbed

  plans were made to apply for a city char-
ter to build a school and a church hales
new stock came in by the wagon-load had
it not been for the new crowd in the river-
front the settlement would have whooped
with joy

  the river-front grew more threatening
day by day taggart was discharging all
his old men and replacing them with for-
eigners these men grew more and more
insolent toward the townspeople

  then one day it became known that tag-
gart had started drinking again nobody
was surprised having by choice surround-
ed himself with a swinish crew he proceeded
to sink himself to their level gaston knew
that the inevitable clash would come before
taggart was over this spree

  inevitable hm hm inevitable that hed
do that commented dr sanders in-
stincts all wrong you know whisky and
women he cant rise above them the

whisky has been getting him too this last
year his debauches have been a little hm
hm a little too inhuman even for him to
stand nerves torn to pieces system cry-
ing periodically for excesses each one worse
than the last hell go to pieces had the
willies a couple times go to pieces sure
likely to do damage when he does

  one quiet evening the doctor visiting
hulda at the hotel was sent for to come
down to one of the dives his patient was
an unfortunate woman her thin miserable
arm had been broken above the elbow by a
blow in a corner of the room sat taggart
holding a broken whisky bottle by the neck
leering insanely his eyes popping his head
jerking about helplessly

  fix her up doc want to teach her
nother lesson he sneered teach em all
lessons im king here-flwn em-body n
soul

  dr sanders the professional instinct up-
permost before he left the place spoke once
to taggart

  taggart as a physician i must warn
you if you continue this spree any longer
youre as good as dead

  wrong doc dead wrong sneered tag-
gart promptly another manll die of it
not me his names thorson ill show
im hes the one whos good as dead
gaston tightened his lips as dr sanders
told him of this

  itll come now hell run wild like a mad
dog said he well the sooner the better
tom pine likewise grew serious as he
heard the doctor repeat taggarts words

  that means the old devils set a trap for
you gaston olaf

  sure

  and hes got them hunyaks with him
this time-too many of em

  sure again

  there was a long silence dr sanders
stroked his beard nervously gaston sat
looking at the ground at last tom pine
rose casually clearing his throat

  guess ill go for a little walk before
turning in he said striving to speak care-
lessly but his effort betrayed him

  youve walked enough today said gas-
ton catching him by the arm sit down
dont you go starting a little war against
taggart by yourself ive told you that
doesnt go any more here

  its the easiest way gaston olaf pro-
tested tom hes raving with liquor now
gaston olaf



hed try to get me on first sight then itd
be all over in two shakes of a does tail and
those hunyaks would be easy to handle
with the old man gone

  it doesnt go repeated gaston firmly
no agreed dr sanders with a sigh
it doesnt go law and order hm hm
we cant break the law

  there was more silence

  no use telling anybody what he said
about me said gaston finally it
wouldnt do any good and it might cause
some worry

  as they were about to part dr sanders
hung back tugging at his beard and with
many hm hms indicating that something
was on his mind

  out with it doc said gaston
whats troubling you

  well - hm hm - you know id like
things to run along for the next week or so
without any trouble were going to get
married the girl and myself a week from
today shed feel a lot better you know if
things went along smooth and safe at this
time

  well

  hm hm im pretty sure i know a way
out of this without any trouble for the pres-
ent thorson

  what is it

  this taggart is going to pieces rapid-
ly hes sure to be laid up a while at least
after this awful spree he cant do any-
thing then if the trouble doesnt come
while hes on this drunk it may not come
at all anyhow itll be delayed

  go on

  well the way his crazy mind is running
now its only you that hes really after if
you werent here-if you should go out of
town until this spree puts taggart on his

back-

  but gaston clouded up darkly

  no sir he snapped i left town once
on account of taggart i wont do it again
dont ask it this time one of us is going
away for good

chapter xxxviii

wait gaston

z aston sat alone for a long time after
the doctor had gone so sanders and
hulda were going to get married the
carefree sport-loving bachelor had met his

fate in the quiet blue eyes of hulda he
had found something that was more to him
than his whisky-bottle more than his bach-
elorhood more than all the wild freedom of
the life he hitherto had led

  the doc was going to settle down he
had given up the whisky altogether sam-
son no longer ruled in the back room the
doctor had ceased to volunteer his services
as referee at every fight that came within
his ken he had substituted sober pro-
fessional black for his gaudy waistcoats and
he was building a house for himself and
hulda

  gaston smiled as he contemplated the
change that had come over the doctor in the
last few weeks he was sensible that he had
come to regard sanders in a different light
at first he had merely liked him as a good
fellow now he respected him as a physician
and as a man

  so the doctor and hulda were to marry
and they would settle down in the house
they were building they would have a
home children would come to them the
doctor would know the sober thrill of hold-
ing in his arms his first-born flesh of his
flesh bone of his bone as the town grew
the doctors practise would grow he would
be a big man settled and all that with his
woman at his side

  lucky doctor he had found content-
ment even happiness gaston began to
dream his quick imagination pictured
himself in the doctors place he saw rose
moving about him-about their home-
tripping lightly on her tiny feet her face
alight with joy was there anything better
in the world than that

  whip - er - will whip-er-will whip - er-
will suddenly cried a whippoorwill down
by the river

  startled gaston looked in its direction
he saw the river-front red with lights
heard a sudden shout of drunken song and
his brow clouded

  better have that settled before you be-
gin planning he told himself you may
not be here to plan after thats over

  to rid himself of these dark thoughts he
rose and walked up to where dr sanders
was building his new home to his surprise
he saw that the house was less than half
finished it would be impossible at the rate
it was going to have it completed by the
day set for the wedding

  huh that isnt right he mused


adventure

the doc and hulda ought to have their
own house ready to move into a gleam
of amusement crossed his face the dark
thoughts were forgotten yes by jupi-
ter and theyre going to have it too he
said and went home to bed smiling boyishly

  next morning he broached his idea to
hale

  we owe it to the doc he explained
hes a good fellow well give em a build-
ing-bee and have the house all ready for
them

  hale promptly fell in with the idea

  the store can wait he said and turned
himself and his builders over to the new
project

  gaston explained to lonergan why he
would leave the crew for a week

  sure said lonergan need any more
men

  dr sanders rubbed his eyes when he
came forth to inspect the progress of his
building

  hm hm whats this whats this he
demanded

  gaston in the act of lifting a rafter into
place laughed down at him

  tom pine and i want your old shack
he said so weve decided to get this one
finished for you in a hurry

  hm hm all right said the doctor
do the same for you some time

  the finishing of the doctors house be-
came a lark for the whole settlement other
building stopped for the time being while
the builders devoted themselves to the
building-bee from the rapidly growing
structure rose a constant rat-tat-tat of ham-
mers punctuated by the jests and laughter
of the crowd of workers as they worked
they considered the situation seriously

  the doc was figring on a quiet wedding
but that wont do said one enthusiast
now that weve started on it we mights
well do it up brown lets make it a holi-
day and everybody lay off and give em a
send-off thatll do the town proud

  the idea was greeted with acclamation
it was the first wedding of importance in
the settlement and the pioneers determined
to make it a memorable event the work
on the house went on with increased speed

  two days before the day set for the wed-
ding gaston climbed to the peak of the roof
and fastened a small flag donated by post-
master perkins to the tin chimney the
crowd gathered before the house compris-

ing every man woman and child of the re-
spectable portion of havens falls waved
hats and handkerchiefs and cheered lustily
the house was finished and ready for the
doctor and hulda to occupy

  as gaston came clambering down from
the roof he met rose leading a corps of wo-
men into the building some carried
brooms others carried curtains plants car-
pet pieces and other articles of furniture and
decoration

  your job is done here mr man she
said gaily now the ladies come on the
scene to beautify the labor of mens hands
thats what they always do he re-
plied men cant do anything but put up
the bare walls its you women who make a
home out of a place

  of course but a woman cant make a
home unless theres a man to do the build-
ing you see were dependent on each
other

  yes and each has got to be depend-
able he looked the house over the
doctor and hulda will be happy here all
right theyre both the dependable kind
rose laughed a trifle mischievously
certainly theyll be happy huldas
started mothering him already and the doc-
tor is the kind of man who needs and likes
to be mothered oh yes theyll be happy
huldall be the boss in a month and dr
sanders knows it and is glad of it

  gaston gazed at her wide-eyed with ad-
miration

  thats so i can see it now that youve
spoken of it how did you know it can
you read all men like that

  no she grew serious no some
men a woman cant read at all its all
plain in the doctors case he-hes just a
nice ordinary man

  some men arent-nice and ordinary
arent ordinary she corrected they
-oh i dont know gaston she said
looking straight at him i wonder if i will
ever know you youre so full of surprises
one day i think of you as fierce-no not
that-as restless and reckless sort of a
wild strange spirit and then you do
something sweet and pretty like getting
this house finished so theyll have their own
home to move into when theyre married
what a jolly idea that was

  i like to see folks have homes he said
lamely

  yes i know you do
gaston olaf



  i want a home ofjny own he whis-
pered hoarsely

  she looked at him tenderly for a moment
gaston she said softly are you sure
that you do are you sure that you want
that more than-your freedom for you
know-you know you can not have them
both

  i am sure- he began but checked
himself he hesitated his eyes on the

ground if i was sure rose-

  but youre not gaston she whispered
haltingly youre not i can see it
youre not sure yet you know youre
not

  within him he felt an all but uncontrol-
lable impulse to reply firmly that yes he
was sure the impulse sprang from the very
roots of his being it cried out to him to
swear that he was sure to dominate her to
make her believe it was so to take her for
his own

  his lips even opened to utter the words
he trembled and for an instant his blue
eyes were clouded with the agony of his
struggle the selfishness of the young male
rose strong in him he wanted her so much
and whispered impulse it would be so easy
to convince her that he was sure it would
even be easy to convince himself

  his lips were parted the words came
rushing to his tongue and then he clicked
his jaws together and threw up his head
his eyes were clear again now and some-
thing finer than yearning something finer
even than the light of love itself was gleam-
ing in the deep blue of them

  rose- his voice was normal and
steady again-i dont know whether i am
sure

  she nodded gravely

  i knew you werent sure gaston i
could feel it

  when i am sure do you think you could
feel that too

  again she nodded

  if ever you are sure i think i would
feel that too

   if then you dont think-

  she turned away without reply

  if i do come to know that im sure he
persisted and you feel it what then

  she turned back and looked at him for a
long time

   gaston she said i like you and i like
dick hale but you are trying to make me
more than like you oh gaston you

mustnt talk to me like this unless you be-
come sure of yourself

  forgive me he whispered penitently
ill never speak another word of it-unless
im sure i have the right

  she held out her hand impulsively
shake she said smiling now i must
get to work

  as she turned to join the other women
hale came up his arms filled with rolls of
wall-paper rose eagerly tore open a roll
to look at the pattern

  oh dick she cried what perfect
taste youve got such a dainty blue and
those tiny flowers wont it make their sit-
ting-room perfectly darling

  they went inside rose fairly skipping
with eagerness while hale smiled patiently
gaston looking after them smiled also but
he only did so because it was natural for
him to smile when he was hit hard

  come on thorson called a man from
behind the house and gaston roused him-
self where are we going to build the
dance floor

  that was another idea which the settle-
ment had conceived to aid in celebrating
the wedding they were going to have a
dance of course what would a wedding
be without a dance an orchestra was to
be brought up from la croix not merely a
couple of fiddlers but a real orchestra in-
cluding horns and a trap-drummer

  it would be a celebration to attract
such a crowd as never yet had been known
north of la croix would there be room
for everybody to dance in the doctors new
house obviously there would not be
thus it was resolved to splurge and lay
down an outdoor dancing-floor which would
send the fame of havens falls flying broad-
cast throughout the woods

  the men turned from the building of the
house to the laying of the floor while some
put down the boards others went into the
swamp and cut a wagon-load of small ever-
green trees these were fastened upright
around the floor enclosing it in four odor-
ous green walls

  to further embellish the scene postmas-
ter perkins brought forth a roll of old bunt-
ing the boys cheered it reminded them
of the fourth of july

  on the night before the wedding it was
all complete the house was ready for oc-
cupancy the orchestra was in town the
floor was in shape hale had gone to la


adventure

croix to drive the minister up in the morn-
ing and it awaited only the morning for
the celebration to begin

  well said gaston as he and tom pine
quit work that evening im surprised they
let us get that done without a hitch

  tom whistled

  you mean those hunyaks and taggart
you been thinking about them tod

  i couldnt hardly forget them could i
theyve been noisy enough every night
theyve left us strictly alone though and
that looks bad taggart must have been
holding em in though hes plumb crazy
from drinking if he has its only been for
one thing

  tomorrow you mean gaston olaf
yes it would be like the old devil to
save his worst stroke for a day like tomor-
row

  tom pine grew thoughtful he retired
early to his room from the window of the
room he could look down the river-front
from end to end

  tom carefully oiled his rifle and gastons
tried levers and triggers loaded the maga-
zines to the brim and went to bed in the
morning he complained of excruciating pains
in his left leg alleging that he had strained
it the day before besides his rheumatism
always bothered him that time of the year
he said it would be necessary he declared
for him to keep to his bed most of the day
lest the trouble become aggravated

  gaston laughed knowing well toms dis-
like for conventional festivities and recog-
nizing a subterfuge but tom had moved
his bed so he could lie on it and look out of
the window upon the river-front

chapter xxxix

taggart strikes

the day of the wedding dawned clear
cool and sunny a slight breeze blow-
ing from the woods toward the river car-
ried over the town the many fresh odors of
northern woods in the full bloom of early
summer there was the odor of balsam in
the air and of budding tamaracks and
spruce

  up from the swamp came the smell of
cowslips and yellow - headed water - lilies
while from the sunny sides of the surround-
ing hills there came drifting down the gen-
tle odor of dying woods violets which in

spots covered the ground like a carpet up
above against the sky tiny specks of white
clouds shared with a pair of lazily soaring
hawks in the vast blue dome of the heav-
ens the birds of the forest with no clat-
ter of hammering to alarm them drew near
and in the stillness of the morning their
clear notes ringed the settlement around
with song it was a day when the whole
world seemed glad and filled with young life
-a day fit for the wedding of a hulda

  the people of the settlement and their
visitors appeared early dressed for the oc-
casion postmaster perkins was solemnly
gorgeous in ancient swallow-tailed coat high
leather boots hickory shirt and wide-brim-
med g a r hat lonergan even went
further-he wore a new suit of black a stiff
shirt and collar

  from these extremes of fashion the ap-
parel of the men ranged to the fringed buck-
skin shirts and trousers of the trappers who
had come in from the woods for the occa-
sion most of the women and girls man-
aged to display something new in the way
of dress sash or ribbon some of the girls
were spick-and-span in white dresses with
wide blue sashes a few indians waddled
stolidly about in blankets and moccasins

  the wedding was set for high noon as
the editor at la croix wrote in his next
weeks issue after the ceremony dinner
was to be served and then the dancing was
to begin

  in the private recesses of olsons hotel
rose and other women had hulda prepared
for the event an hour before the time set
it was with difficulty that hulda was re-
strained from doing her share of the work
about the hotel that morning only after
she saw that neighbors were efficiently as-
sisting her mother did she agree to sit like
a loafer as she expressed it

  when fully dressed for her wedding hul-
das appearance threw her attendants into
ecstasies of delight of all the women pres-
ent she was the only one serene and undis-
turbed even in stiffly starched white and
laced to within an inch of her life the mag-
nificent freedom of her body was untram-
melled the red and cream of her com-
plexion was a trifle heightened by excite-
ment her steady blue eyes were serene with
happiness and triumph down her back two
thick braids of yellow-golden hair fell be-
low her waist at times she blushed slight-
ly-
gaston olaf



  in the doctors bachelor quarters dr
sanders in the hands of gaston and loner-
gan sat fully dressed waiting for the noon
hour with all the serenity and composure of
a man about to be hanged for stealing sheep
to further his comfort his two companions
assured him that the agony of waiting was
nothing compared to what he would ex-
perience during the ceremony

  wait until you get up there before the
minister with everybody looking at you
encouraged gaston then youll have
something to get cold sweats about

  the doctor retorted with an old shoe
which gaston ducked laughingly

  lonergan looked at his watch

  hello ten minutes after eleven hale
and the preacher are about due

  maybe theyll be late maybe some-
things happened maybe they cant come
the doctor grasped at the straws eagerly

  oh no gaston assured him noth-
ings happened hale will be here on time
you cant escape a few minutes more now
and well be leading you out where the
crowd can get one last fond look at you
dr sanders swung to the window
glanced out and retreated

  whew everybody in towns ready and
waiting regular mob hm hm youd
think theyd never seen a wedding the way
theyre waiting-think it was a show

  it is chuckled gaston take my
word for it doc youll be a show all by
yourself

  its an almighty quiet crowd said lon-
ergan speculatively the boys are stay-
ing away from the saloons

  they all like doc and respect the trouble
hes going through

  quiet down in the river-front too
wonder if theyre doing that because theres
a little decency left in em

  what time is it cried the doctor petu-
lantly darn it why doesnt hale show
up said hed be here about eleven didnt
he if hes coming why doesnt he come
and have it over with

  a number of women passed the office go-
ing toward the new house

  theyre beginning to assemble in your
honor doc laughed gaston your time
draws nigh all were waiting for now is
the preacher

  maybe he wont come insisted the doc-
tor hopefully maybe well have to put it
off

  they sat in silence for a while again
lonergan looked at his watch

  twenty minutes after eleven he said
theyll be here now or somethings hap-
pened

  gaston and the railroad builder stepped
outside and looked down the street the
road from la croix ran along the river
hale and the minister would have to
drive through the river-front when they
came

  not in sight yet said lonergan

  its a warm morning for fast driving
said gaston hales a sensible man he
wont kill his horses but hell have the
preacher here on time

  lonergan nodded the river-front as
they looked at it was deserted not a man
was in sight and no noise came from the
open doors

  say theyre behaving themselves
down there today arent they said lon-
ergan

  gaston did not reply his eyes suddenly
had narrowed to slits that quiet down
there wasnt natural it was too good to
be true gastons quick senses had caught
the unusual silence and read it for the un-
natural calm that is prelude to a storm

  its too good lonergan he began
then hello there they come

  hales buggy had swung out of the tim-
ber and was approaching the river-front
the horses were trotting easily gaston
could make out the pale face of the minis-
ter beside hale they were passing the first
saloon in the row now and then the peace
of the river-front was broken

  with one single shout as a signal there
sprang from each side of the street a dozen
men they caught the horses by the head
ere hale could reach his whip they threw
themselves onto the buggy

  it was only a matter of seconds then
the frightened team was coming up the
street on the jump hale rolling uncon-
scious on the seat and the men of the river-
front were rushing back into their lowest
dive bearing the struggling figure of the
minister with them

  god cried lonergan

  gaston uttered no sound he threw him-
self upon the maddened horses as they came
tearing up and with lonergans help soon
had them quieted

  good god cried men as they came run-
ning up


i

adventure

gaston said not a word he
dropped his hold on the horses the
instant other hands came to help
he looked not at hale who lay senseless
with a cut on the side of his head he paid
no attention to the crowd gathering about
him with one tug he tore open his collar
to give room to his swelling throat he
was panting through his nose his lips closed

  a double-bitted ax leaned against the
doctors cabin with his berserk rage vent-
ing itself in one shrill cry gaston seized
the gleaming tool and seemed to fly over
the ground straight toward the door of the
dive where the minister had been captured

  good god hes going alone cried a
young man and empty-handed started af-
ter him he was erik the boy who had been
beaten by the pugilist and afterward had
worked in gastons crew on the right-of-
way

  come back thorson cried lonergan

  it would have been too late even if gas-
ton could have been halted then

  they were waiting for him down at the
river-front the mind that had directed
this scheme had expected that gaston would
be in the van of those to rescue the minis-
ter

 hes gone groaned lonergan

  gaston was passing mccarthys old place
in the doorway appeared the bull-necked
ulnick shot-gun in hand he laughed as he
deliberately cocked both barrels he had a
cigar in his mouth his face was devilish with
triumph as he raised the gun toward his
shoulder and the next instant he lay face
downward on his own door-step shot
through the temples dead

  tom pine had not remained in his room
in vain he had not been able to save the
minister that had come too quickly too
unforeseen but he had witnessed the as-
sault on the buggy had seen the minister
borne away and he knew what would fol-
low he had seen gaston go flying down
the street and his rifle was cocked and
ready covering the river-front as a deer-
hunter covers the range before him when
the game is about to jump

  ulnicks was the first menacing figure to
show in any doorway and tom pine threw
down on him and fired with the sure easy
aim of the old-timer

  before ulnicks body had struck the
ground tom had jacked in a new cartridge
and fired again a man with a revolver had

thrust his head out of the dance-hall and
toms bullet passed through his jaw and
splintered a window

  then crack crack crack the river-front
suddenly had a bath of lead into every
door tom sent his bullets the shots coming
so rapidly that it seemed that several men
must be firing glass flew in splinters a
third man sticking his head out of a door
was down on the floor a bullet-hole through
his cheek the screams of the two wound-
ed men supplemented the rattle of shots
and the crash of glass

  from the dance-hall a revolver cracked
the bullet flew past gastons head be-
hind him erik grunted in surprised fashion
and sank down with his hands held to his
breast

  tom riddled the dance - hall in reply
shrieks and curses came forth but no more
shots

  the river - front was a pandemonium
women began to leave their dives and run
for the woods not a man showed himself
suddenly the minister came rolling out of
the dive into the street thrown out by the
terrified men who had captured him their
plans had gone awry the terribly accurate
shooting of tom pine had tamed them they
were eager to do anything that might stop
that devilish rain of lead

  gaston stopped before the dance - hall
his blood-rage had passed he saw things
clearly in the fight which must ensue if
he rushed the dance-hall the minister would
surely get hurt possibly be killed and the
wedding would have to be postponed he
looked through the bullet-shattered door
what he saw inside there caused him to
pick the minister up under one arm and
deliberately turn back behind him toms
bullets ripped the doors of the hall to splin-
ters

  a crowd was coming to help by this time
men had reached erik and were carrying
him away

  get back boys roared gaston get
back and get ready were going down
there again but were going to be ready for
them when we do

  he put the minister down and pleaded
and fought with the crowd and turned it
back

  back boys get to cover weve got
the minister now the wedding neednt be
delayed and well get em down there
when were ready
gaston olaf



  in a few seconds he had prevailed the
minister had been rushed into the hotel
erik sorely wounded was lying in the doc-
tors office and gaston himself had shown
an example and was safely behind cover

  up in his room tom pine sighed with relief
it was about time he had kept the river-
front indoors but now both rifles were empty

chapter xl

the end of devil dave

nphe quiet that settled suddenly down
upon the settlement then was terri-
ble it lay like a pall in the air snuffing
out the life and gaiety that had prevailed a
moment before men moved about silent-
ly their eyes hard a child cried suddenly
somewhere a door slammed then it was
still again

  men looked at each other and parted
without a word they gathered their wo-
men and children from the street from
about the hotel the dance-floor and the
doctors new house and grimly carried them
to their homes

  stay indoors they said and returned
to the crowd gathered in the shelter of the
doctors office

  no time this for the women to wail and
plead against rash action it had gone be-
yond that the women looked at their
mens faces and cowered in their homes
white-faced but silent

  men cried the minister aghast
what is this you plan to do

  thats all right reverend see you la-
ter they said and locked him safe out of
harms way in the hotel

  behind the doctors office the friends of
erik men formerly of crew one who now
were in lonergans employ had armed
themselves to the last man and were insist-
ing that although erik on the doctors
word would live it was their blood-right
to lead the attack on the river-front op-
posed to them were the men of the settlement

  its our town thats been given a bad
name they said weve got the right to
go down there first

  gaston fought steadily to hold both fac-
tions back he realized that the clash was
inevitable but now that his rage had vent-
ed itself he was clear-headed and cool if
the crowd in its present mood struck the
river-front whose men it outnumbered the

result must be a slaughter nothing could
stay eriks friends from taking vengeance
and if a fight were thus started the gang-
sters would fight back and good men surely
would be killed as furiously as he had
rushed to the attack gaston now struggled
to delay the conflict until the men had
grown cooler

  the docs wedding is set for twelve he
shouted are we going to spoil that for
him lets have the wedding first then go
down and clean them up

  a low growl greeted his words he knew
they would not acquiesce but it was any-
thing for a delay

  no time for weddings came back the
reply lets be going

  no cried gaston youll wait a
while this thing has got to be done or-
derly do you want to give yourselves as
bad a name as those hunyaks

  we want to give ourselves such a name
that no toughs will ever again try anything
like this in our town replied perkins

  good thats just it and were going
to do it according to law and order not
like a lot of toughs on a spree

  that struck home with the older men
thats right they said others growl-
ed spit out what youve got to say and
lets get started

  lonergan shouted gaston can that
old polander of yours go down among those
fellows in safety

  yes why

  im going to serve notice on every man
and woman in the river-front to clear out
within an hour

  hour - came an interruption

ten minutes is plenty

  make it five cried others

  he compromised with them it was then
a quarter to twelve

  well make it half an hour said he
realizing that he could hold them no longer
that will give em until a quarter-past
twelve

  good enough

  paper and pencil were brought and with
a board for desk gaston set to work to draft
his notice after scores of suggestions from
the crowd he wrote as follows

to all people in the river-front

   this is to notify you that you have thirty min-
utes to get out of town we are coming down to
get you at s leave before then or god help
you i	thorson

adventure

  thats the style thats doing it in bang-
up fashion was the verdict of the men
who read over his shoulder

  lonergans old polander took the note
and his directions stolidly

  if they cant read translate it for them
said gaston

  aw ri bahss

  the old man sallied forth on his mission
they watched him as he went how would
the toughs receive the note they saw the
old man enter ulnicks place where ul-
nicks body had been dragged inside the
paper held in his hand after a few min-
utes he came out crossed the street and en-
tered another saloon still bearing the paper

  not a sound came up to the watchers as
he emerged from the second place a man
came timidly out of the dance-hall and call-
ed to the messenger in polish the old
man spoke rapidly handing the man the
notice the man tossed it into the dance-
hall and without a word ran for the river
road from ulnicks some one shouted at
the old man he held up his hand and
came back to the doctors office

  they say can they go and you no shoot
em hah he said

  a sigh of relief escaped gaston

  yes he said tell them no one will
be hurt before a quarter-past twelve
hold on cried eriks friends that
dont go with us these guys may all duck
out we wont stand by and see that we
want to play a little with the fellow who
shot erik

  you bet none of that letting em go
lets go down and make em give him up
right now

  gaston held up his hand

  boys i promise you youll get the man
who shot erik

  hes in that dance-hall they protest-
ed hell get away with the rest

  hes in that dance-hall agreed gas-
ton but he wont get away with the rest
i promise you that

  did you see him

  i saw him and if he comes out i promise
you ill be the first to go down and get him
all right thorson but thats got to
be good

  itll be good said gaston and sent the
messenger on his way

  there was a short lull after the old man
had delivered his message then the exo-
dus began like rats the denizens of the

places of vice came slinking out in the sun-
light they hugged the walls casting fear-
ful looks over their shoulders they saw
ulnicks body lying on the saloon floor saw
the broken windows splintered doors and
bullet-marks and they ran

  the two wounded men called pleadingly
for assistance but no one heard five min-
utes before the time-limit had elapsed the
last woman to leave the dives had gone
from the river-front and was following the
long straggling line hurrying down the
river road the last of the forces of vileness
to leave havens falls

  and the man who shot erik wasnt
among em said gaston

  you sure eriks friends were suspi-
cious you aint trying to play with us
thorson

  sure not boys hes still in the dance-
hall

  well go and see

  you will agreed gaston icily when
its twelve-fifteen

  by sheer force of will he held them they
fidgeted angrily like dogs in the leash with
their quarry before them the minutes
dragged painfully two minutes remained
then one minute

  come on said a youngster thats
close nough

  gaston held him back

  presently lonergan snapped his watch
shut and nodded

  come along boys said gaston quietly
they followed down the street in uncan-
ny silence crowding closely about him as
he led the way to the dance-hall the door
was open and they could see inside they
first saw the man whom tom pine had shot
through the jaw he was sitting on the
floor leaning drunkenly against the wall

  then they saw the other man he was
lolling in a chair against the bar grinning
in ghastly fashion at the poor fellow on the
floor his eyes were popping from his head
his jaw sagged weakly his tongue hung out
his long arms drooped down nervelessly at
his feet a big revolver lay where it had drop-
ped from his fingers

  it was what was left of devil dave taggart

the crowd halted at the doorway
aghast at the demoniacal transfor-
mation before them gaston enter-
ed alone taggart neither saw nor heard
his attention was all for the man on the floor
gaston olaf



  taggart shouted gaston putting a
hand on his shoulder

  taggart looked up slowly no gleam of in-
telligence in his blood-shot eyes in spite
of his enmity for the man gaston felt a
twinge of pity he picked up the revolver

  taggart get up

  with his left arm he raised him to his
feet taggart waved a hand at the wound-
ed man and laughed slobberingly

  funny face he whispered look ats
face

  come along said gaston

  with the revolver in his right hand he
led the way out

  boys he said coldly you cant have
him-not now if hed put up a fight it
would have been different now im going
to take him down to his office and lock him
up out of the way

  he went straight through them they
stood back and let him pass without a word
then they followed as gaston led his pris-
oner toward the office on the river bank

  taggart went along in a stupor at first
he did not recognize gaston did not sense
what was happening as they approached
the river however his eyes seemed to clear
at the sight of his own office he stopped
suddenly

  come on taggart said gaston

  taggart looked around wildly he saw
the river a few steps away saw the crowd
behind them and lastly he saw gaston as
if in a flash of lightning he understood
with a cry like a wounded animal he tore
loose he stood up straight and stiff him-
self for an instant his eyes upon the man
who had tom his evil hold from havens
falls

  thorson you - he screamed and

dove forward

  his arms caught gaston and held him
helpless the strength of a maniac was
taggarts for that moment down in the
sawdust they fell tightly clinched twice
they rolled over and over taggarts mad
laugh rang loud to the heavens and then
they rolled over again and still locked to-
gether dropped into the river

  the water was deep and still where they
fell in the current closed over them and
swept on its way again serene undisturbed
while the crowd lined the bank silent help-
less the seconds seemed hours many of
them passed and still the swift black
waters rushed on unbroken

  men panted open-mouthed they groan-
ed in agony as air-bubbles broke the sur-
face and then they shouted once sharp-
ly gaston came popping out of the water
like a cork gasped hungrily at the air and
came swimming weakly back to shore-
alone

  a few more bubbles appeared farther
down-stream then the black water once
more was slipping on its way calm and
beautiful as ever with no hint on its sur-
face of the thing that was hidden in its
depths

  gaston stood dripping and panting on
the river bank he looked at the water
from which he had so narrowly escaped
and he turned and went up the street with-
out a word

      men men said the minister
rftsn when released from the hotel
what have you done you bade
me to come among you to join two of your
young people in a new life and you make
the day one of strife and bloodshed
postmaster perkins bared his silvery head
reverently

   the lord giveth and the lord taketh
away blessed be the name of the lord 
rose his aged treble reverend what we
done had to be done there was a jam
and she had to be broke so decent people
could live here and fellows like you could
come through the white water and bring
light into the wilderness the lord took
the bad people away he giveth us young
people like ilulda olson and doc sanders
to marry and have children and people the
land the old order changeth reverend
the wickedness has gone from havens falls
for good the new order cometh and its
full of hope and promise and the lord looks
upon his work and finds it good reverend
we aint in no mood to hold the celebration
we planned but in this dark moment we
need that wedding to help us look toward
the future

  yes said hulda firmly ve skall get
married yoost the same

  so the doctor and hulda were married
-with a silent crowd of witnesses where
hilarity had been planned and after
the ceremony the minister prayed not
only for the happiness of the newly wed-
ded couple but for the future of the town
that the men thereof might turn from
violence to gentleness toward all their kind


adventure

forgive their enemies patiently turn the

other cheek-

  gaston looked sharply across at rose
she had lifted her eyes to him in the same
moment

  -live their lives soberly and earnest-
ly-

  her eyes dropped

  -god-fearing and useful citizens prid-
ing themselves not upon their strength-

  rose raised her eyes to hales bowed
head

 -amen

chapter xli

days of quiet

peace had come at last to havens
falls the deep abiding peace of a
community solemnly consecrated to law and
order the tragic manner of its coming had
left its mark havens falls was not likely
to forget what the river-front had meant to
it it would never again run the risk of simi-
lar conditions before the traces of the last
cruel struggle had been removed a solemn
mass-meeting was held before olsons hotel

  it was whisky that did it boys-whisky
and wickedness and hell-raising quavered
old perkins touch and go it was boys
and we happened to win because a man
came to town who was big enough to make
us strong we were a helpless little hell-
hole here in the woods before he came to
town now were clean thank god as
clean as the timber around us boys are
we going to risk getting in another gang like
what we had are we going to have an-
other river-front or are we going to have
a decent town that will grow and be a cred-
it to the men who made it

  a decent town-thats the ticket came
the responses weve had enough of the
other thing what do you say thorson
gaston looked down toward the river
front for the time being he was as seri-
ous-minded as any man in the crowd he
saw not the glitter and excitement of the
front but only its sordid vileness its men-
ace to a community of homes of families of
women and children

  i say he began slowly and paused as
a vision grew before his eyes i say we
ought to burn the river-front to the ground
and scatter the ashes and build new build-
ings where it stands so thered be nothing

left to remind us of what was there or what
happened before it was cleaned up

  they voted on it a vote of hands and
even the wild youngsters working for loner-
gan voted ay so the river-front was
burned one afternoon when there was no
wind burned until its last trace of wicked-
ness had been purged by fire and in the
evening before the last red coals had died
to ashes the settlers had decided to build
their first schoolhouse where the old dance-
hall had stood and to do it at once so the
children would have a place ready for them
when the school season opened in the fall

  and now thats done said gaston
the river-front is gone the town starts
new with nothing to make trouble for it or
keep it from having clean hands tag-
garts gone so i start fresh too and theres
nothing left here to stir the hell up in me
or get me to fighting or keep me from liv-
ing quiet respectable and settled

  tom pine coughed in a suspicious man-
ner a coroners jury having decided that
ulnicks death was an act of god tom
had a rather improved opinion of himself
he and gaston were sitting chair-tilted
against the front of dr sanderss old office
they had moved into the building imme-
diately after the doctor had vacated gas-
ton having declared that it was time they
began to practise living in a home of their
own tom pine had acquiesced eagerly
there was more freedom in baching it
than in living at the hotel

  no-o-o drawled tom theres nothing
left here to stir a fellow up thats sure
and thats just how we want it said
gaston everything nice and orderly and
nothing to keep a man from being a steady-
going citizen

  except himself

  eh

  except himself repeated tom if a
man aint made to be a steady-going citi-
zen well it dont make any difference where
you set him down gaston olaf he aint
going to be one thats all some folks are
made to five in houses and use the same
bed all their fives others aint i wont say
any more than that

  no need to say any more said gaston
you mean that im one of those whore
not made to settle down

  tom pine shook his old head

  you cant make a canary-bird or a barn-
yard fowl out of an eagle said he there
gaston olaf



aint any chance for argument about that
-thats nature

  gaston chuckled

  youre a hard one for sure tom pine
have you seen any canary-bird work around
this settlement

  not so far its been a nice busy place
for a he-man to camp in up to now i ad-
mit you that but that was because tag-
gart and the river-front were here and it
was hell-for-leather between them and us

  but theyre gone now gaston olaf
those days are past this towns pretty
near got religion and its going to stay that
way what then day after day the same
thing week after week and year after year
with nothing happening for excitement
could folks like you n me stand it gaston

  the picture unveiled itself swiftly to gas-
ton he saw the neat proper town that
havens falls was destined to be-day after
day year after year of it he felt crowded
confined but there was rose and the
dream

  you quit that kind of talk tom pine
he commanded gruffly i dont know
about you but i do know that i want to
settle down

  he went back to work for lonergan
that was the thing for him to do-break
himself in at steady every-day work

  his experience in the woods and his
natural leadership of men made him an in-
valuable aid to the railroad man with him
at its head the clearing-crew slashed its way
through the timber in record time

  after the clearing came the grading and
filling day after day week after week
gaston stuck to his task the short hot
summer of the northland was on and along
the line swarms of mosquitoes deer-flies and
no-see-ums made life miserable men
threw down their tools and demanded their
time lonergan even suggested a lay-off for
a week

  not for a day said gaston stubbornly

  he was beginning to hear the whisperings
of doubt within himself the clear lakes
the rivers the untracked woods had begun
to call the lure of strange trails and ad-
ventures new had whispered to his restless
spirit

  he put temptation away savagely not
a single day would he yield in the program
he had mapped out for himself for it was
in the moments of idleness that the call
made itself heard

  youre getting kind of peekid-looking
gaston olaf warned tom pine

  i know it admitted gaston his shav-
ing-mirror had shown him the new lines
gathering between the eyebrows and about
the mouth

  the quiet lazy sundays came to be long
and tiresome he seldom sought roses
company since their conversation at the
house-building and save for thoughts of
her he admitted to himself town-life was
irksome

  hale likewise spent less time at the
havens home than previously he was not
given to intruding himself where he was not
sure that he was wanted

  the settlement developed rapidly tag-
garts property had fallen into the hands of
a far-away niece and the lumber company
to which she sold promptly put the cut-
over land on the market induced settlers
to come in and began to assist in all ways
to build up the country

  when the railroad gets through this
country will crowd up right away mused
gaston as he read the signs

  he reproved himself promptly for such
thoughts was it not for this that he had
worked and risked his life

  the heat of the summer passed and the
time for the first frosts drew near instead
of the ring of the axes of the clearing-crew
there now rang out along the right-of-way
the clang of spiking hammers fastening the
steel rails to the new-laid ties instead of
teams bearing loads of ties a small locomo-
tive came tooting slowly toward havens
falls pushing before it flat-car loads of the
rails that the crews were laying

  day by day the twin lines of steel crept
northward toward the settlement and day
by day as he led his crew gaston sensed
how completely the humdrum of civiliza-
tion would conquer the country when the
railroad began operations the toot of the
locomotive in the timber was a warning it
knelled the passing of adventure in that
part of the big woods

  yet gaston worked steadily there was
a certain thrill in the building of the rail-
road and he did not permit himself to think
of the days to come after the road was fin-
ished

  the first frosts came touching the birch
and maple with a gentle wand and tinting
their leaves dainty pink and yellow the
air was like rare wine and the woods were


adventure

clamorous with the chatter of birds congre-
gating for the long flight southward

  in the morning while trudging to work
gaston paused and with his eyes followed
the flight of migrating ducks across the
trackless sky he watched them until they
were out of sight and he wondered what
new scenes they would view before they
sought rest at nightfall

  the whistle of the locomotive now could
be heard in the settlement lonergan had
added more men to the crews and the work
was being pushed so the road would be com-
pleted before the frost settled into the
ground gaston did his work steadily and
well but there was a lack of buoyancy and
enthusiasm in him he now looked for-
ward to the end of the work with a feeling
of discomfort

  the woods were a riot of color now au-
tumn was in the northland and the gods
of the glorious indian summer had painted
the world with a lavish brush deep pur-
ple and burnt umber blood-red and faint-
est yellow ocher rioted together on the
landscape and over the hills like a deli-
cate veil hung the indian summers faint
blue haze

  with less than a weeks work remaining
on the railroad there came to the settle-
ment a rumor of a silver strike in the rough
barrens far to the north across the line
daring adventurous men were flocking
thither said rumor to pit their strength and
luck against the cruel northern winter and
crueler men the men working on the rail-
road leaned on their tools and wondered
what it would be like up there gaston
heard them and grimly ordered them back
to their tasks

  that night however he paced up and
down along the river until far into the morn-
ing and his palms were raw from the pres-
sure of his finger nails

chapter xlii

the trail the trail

nphf railroad was finished the twin
- streaks of steel had reached havens
falls binding it closely to the rest of the
great civilized world

  the finish came at the end of a hard
days work remained only the ceremony
of driving the last spike which was to be
performed with due rites and celebration in

the morning and the first train bearing
mails freight and passengers would come
tooting its way into the settlement the
big job was done and havens falls was full
of gaiety that night anxious to make of the
morrow a big gala-day in its history

  gaston was not gay he was the last
man of the crew to leave the line he left
reluctantly the job was done havens
falls was no longer a stray woods-settle-
ment but a new growing town on a rail-
road

  in the old settlement he had had his
place he had played his part well but
what place did he have in this town where
people were talking of flour-mills and po-
tato-warehouses and dreaming of paved
streets and electric-lights

  this was the question that had troubled
him for the last weeks as the signs of the
towns development increased so had in-
creased gastons sense of strangeness and
confinement he felt cooped up cramped
and out of place he had tried to deny it
but now he was forced to acknowledge to
himself he did not belong

  stores and sidewalks plate-glass win-
dows regular hours electric-lights what
had he to do with them he had come to
havens falls and had found a part waiting
for him to play but now his part had
been played never again would the settle-
ment have need of one of his kind his job
was done he was through

  with something like a sigh gaston turned
his back on the line and came through the
cool early darkness into havens falls

  the town was full of people on hand for
the great event of the morrow at the
hotel there was no talk save of the railroad
and what it would do for the country

  in the midst of this liveliness gaston was
as a stranger at a feast he retired to the
doctors old office and without a word tom
pine and he sat down on their door-stcp
each busy with the same thought up
above the white northern stars began to
gleam through the darkness and in the
lull the cry of a lone wolf on some far-away
hill-top came floating into the town

  i wonder said tom pine softly i
wonder what shes like up there where they
say theyve found silver

  the words fell upon gastons troubled
spirit like skilled fingers upon the strings of
a harp eagerly he began to talk the lit-
tle town fell away and he saw the long
gaston olaf



rough trail through the great rough north
with who could know what sort of adven-
tures at its end

  shes a hard piece of country up there
from all i hear interjected tom pine and
harder than sam hill to get to

  pooh what was a little rough country
did any one expect to find metals stored up
beneath city sidewalks the harder the
better none but real men could win in
all the more for the ones who were strong
enough to stand the going

  gaston rose and stood before tom pine
gesticulating vehemently the new lines
had gone from his face he felt as if a bur-
den had fallen from his shoulders then
suddenly he thought of rose and sat down

  after a while he arose and went slowly up
toward the havens home he would go
and see her he would settle it one way
or another that night

i rose was working on something
a white when he found her and
 though she hastily dropped it into
her work-basket at his coming he saw that
it was a garment so tiny that in his ignor-
ance he fancied it must be for a doll

  whats that he asked making a
doll dress

  yes-no she said tucking her work out
of sight that is-gaston you mustnt
be so inquisitive

  wha-a-at her confusion puzzled him
she was actually blushing whats there
about a dolls dress that youve got to hide
it from me

  nothing absolutely nothing what do
you care about dolls clothes anyway
then why dont you work at it dont
let me interfere

  it isnt polite to work when ones en-
tertaining company she bantered

  go on and work he laughed i like
to see you sewing

  sewing she said scornfully oh how
ignorant men are i wasnt sewing at all
thats embroidery it will take weeks and
weeks to finish it

 embroid-

  gaston he had playfully reached for
the garment gaston well i never
he was holding the tiny thing up in his
huge brown hands

  embroidery he repeated looking at
her and then he understood

  oh oh he said slowly and carefully

replaced the dress in the basket im a
clod - hopper i didnt understand i
wouldnt have said a word or touched
it-

  youre as curious as a woman she said
tucking the garment out of sight

  i apologize you see i didnt know

  i know it they looked at one an-
other

  whos it for

  hulda of course now if you say an-
other word one single word ill be real an-
gry-

  hulda he repeated the doc well
ill be darned

  stop it not another word roses
self-possession had returned tell me who
is going to drive the last spike in the road
tomorrow ive heard that the honor is to
be given you

  he answered aimlessly his thoughts
were not with the road the little garment
had spoken to him of certain things had
opened his eyes to tender responsibilities of
marriage and at last he was quite sure of
himself-quite sure that he had no right to
try to realize his dream for whatever hap-
pened he must not run the risk of making
her unhappy

  im going away he said holding out
his hand

  i thought so she said and he was glad
she smiled ive seen it coming on you

  they shook hands warmly

  are you going away for good she
asked

  he studied a moment before replying
she would have hale now hale the steady
and responsible she would be happy

  yes he said thank god it is for
good

  outside beneath the clear white stars he
breathed to the bottom of his lungs he
had done it with a smiling face he had
done it and though the pain in his heart
was like a sharp knife he had the peace of
mind which told him he had done what was
-square

  down the street he met the doctor

  you old son-of-a-gun you doc he
chuckled and smote him boyishly on the
back

  he found hale in his store

  hale said he sternly youre a dam
fool theres a girl up the street waiting
for you and you stick down here and grouch
by yourself how dyou expect to win rose
i

adventure

if you dont go after her i know-i know
what youre going to say staying away on
my account well that neednt bother
you any more im going away going to
stay away and if you dont go up there
tonight and get down to business ill-ill
change my opinion of you will you do it

 but thorson-

  but nothing say youll do it

  i will

  skookum shake hands

  he went out of the store like a gust of
wind humming

  when he entered the doctors old office
some time later he bore two blanket packs
stuffed and strapped ready for the trail
tom pine was asleep gaston dug out his
old woods-clothes and noiselessly made a
complete change arrayed as he was when
he had come to the settlement-soft rubber
shoes buckskin trousers muskrat cap blue
shirt and silken sash-he sat down for a
moment at the doctors old table

  his light-heartedness left him he folded
his arms on the table and laid his head upon
them he had done what was square but
it was hard oh it was hardl
the picture of rose as he had last seen
her with the tiny white garment in her
hands-the picture he would carry away
with him-came before his eyes and he
raised his head slowly there was a strange
wistful smile upon his bronzed face

  the thoughts of little children came to

him his great arms curved hungrily on
the table flesh of his flesh bone of his
bone was he never to know what that
meant the home the wife the children
the trinity that makes the world he hun-
gered for them then with the strong mans
hunger which the weakling never knows

  but he knew now that these were not for
him his was the lot of the roamer for
him the open trail beneath untrammeled
stars the life of abrupt change and excite-
ment the lone but thrilling way of the bom
adventurer

  foot-loose and free it had to be so it
could not be anything else for he knew
now that no ties could hold him when the
go-gods called

  tom he called softly

  his old partner leaped up wide awake
gaston was standing by the bunk-side the
pack on his shoulders rifle in hand ready

author of the third chance the marrow-bone ctc

number of years ago a pri-
vate soldier of a certain british
regiment then stationed at cal-
cutta was sent to the andaman
islands-the indian penal settlement-to
serve a life-sentence for murder there
were extenuating circumstances and his
name was william driver he believed in
no gods though he swore by many but he
worshiped most devoutly one girl and he
was a very strong man he was also a
crude person of limited education and the
girl annie hall was the marrow-bone of
his existence

  therefore in a most wonderful way she
helped him to escape from the andamans
to the deep forests of burma where they
had ideas of living in a tree my old friend
pickhead cameron who was at that time
head of the forest department persuaded
them to build a hut to which he added
comforts he also persuaded them to be
married-by a presbyterian missionary-
and for many years he aided them so that
they were not discovered by that govern-
ment which paid his somewhat large salary

  in the course of time a baby was born to
the drivers and the missionary baptized
the child and cameron was her godfather
and the girl living alone in those wild for-
ests with her parents grew to be very lovely

x

  on her eighteenth birthday cameron gave
her a pearl necklace and the missionary
her first communion shortly after cam-
eron was called home to london and the
missionary his work done was called home
also

  and bill driver mourned their going for
as he said to his girl

  mr cameron hes gone to london and
i darent go there and mr macneil hes
gone to heaven-so your mother says-and
i carnt go there neither

  now pickhead cameron had so arranged
matters that the drivers saw no other hu-
mans and bill-who by the way stood
only five-feet-six and weighed nearly two
hundred in hard condition-had done his
best to show his gratitude camerons
pride was in the administration of his for-
ests and driver fully appreciated this so
that he patrolled the district wherein he
abided and looked out for incipient fires
and other things and when he wandered
in the deep green of the mighty teak
trees he carried a rifle which had been
with him for a long time and for which
cameron supplied the ammunition with
the carefully kept rifle always went the well-
polished bayonet on the evening that bill
and his woman annie escaped from the an-
damans she clubbed a sikh guard into


adventure

insensibility-the source of the treasured
weapons

  so macneil and cameron went home
but driver still patrolled the district as he
knew cameron would have him do what
thinking he did during his lonely walks was
of an atavistic character and he had some
curiously anthropomorphic ideas regarding
the dead macneil

there came an evening the
shadows were beginning to lie softly
over the dim forest places and bill
driver hungry sought his hut his wife and
daughter and also his supper he was
about a mile from his home when his slowly
working intelligence was startled by the cry
of a woman and the voice of that woman
was the voice of his daughter-annie the
second

  bill driver hurled himself in the direc-
tion of that cry crashing through the inter-
vening brush like a shell from a big gun
the rifle went with him but when he reach-
ed the small open space where his daughter
was struggling with a man he dropped it

  the red haze in which years before he
had shot and killed again enveloped him
but he could not forget-he had brooded
too long over it-that the mere pulling of a
trigger had given him no physical satisfac-
tion and had made him a convict so that
while justified in defending his own mem-
ory bade him use the mighty clutch of his
great hands in her defense and thus sat-
isfy the innate craving of the fighting man

  annies assailant saw bill coming-he
also must have heard him-and he released
the girl and tried to escape he might have
escaped from an angry gorilla but not from
bill driver the strength of the gorilla and
of driver would be about equal

  in the convicts subconscious mind arose
several of his long dead fathers-hairy peo-
ple who patronized no tailor bill was not
aware of their presence but their prompt-
ing swayed him the man who struggled
so impotently was a large man bill could
not see clearly because of the red haze but
he knew quite well that it was his business
to tear the fellow to pieces

  as a preliminary he broke both his cap-
tives arms he dropped his almost swoon-
ing victim on the ground it would never
do to kill him right away that would be as
unsatisfactory as the shooting referred to
had been he must pull the fellow to pieces

slowly yet he must keep him in such a men-
tal condition that he would be fully and
excruciatingly aware of his dismemberment

  bill driver standing over a writhing hu-
man puzzled his slow brain then annie
the second reached him threw her arms
around his neck and brought him out of
the year  b c into a d 

  bill driver shook his bull-neck and the
red fell away from his vision but his
strength and vindictiveness remained

  go away lass-he were trying to hurt
thee more than thou knows abart

  but father

  i mun kill him lass-an hes going to
know im doing it

  but-dont you see hes a white man
  dont make no difference

  but father it does mr cameron
wouldnt have stray white men around here
-whats he doing here you must find out
and let mr cameron know he asked you
to watch out for things

  there has been told a tale about a man
who aided a wounded lion and thereby
earned the lions undying gratitude we
have all heard of dog-like devotion but
greater than either of these was bill drivers
gratitude to my old friend pickhead cam-
eron

  he raised his writhing captive to a sit-
ting position by gripping an ear between a
finger and thumb

  wot you doing in these ere forests

  i vill not tell you moaned the other
oh-you wont eh nobody aint got
no right here unless mr cameron says so
and youre some sort of a foreigner wot
makes it worse wot are ye doing here
the captives arms hung helplessly and
drivers method of supporting him was ago-
nizing nevertheless he did not answer the
question

  there must be something wrong ex-
claimed annie the second clasping her
hands nervously or hed tell you father
you dont want mr camerons forests to
come to no harm you must make him
tell

  bill drivers grin was not pleasing

  hell tell he said tersely you bring
the rifle lass

  he threw his groaning captive across his
shoulder and walked toward his hut at the
regulation quickstep that had never left
him the girl following with the precious ri-
fle the tortured creature he carried moaned
the receipt



all the way but driver paid no atten-
tion to his pain neither did he stop to rest
or shift the weight-his slow mind was busy
with vague guesses

   adjoining his hut was a smaller one used
as a storehouse into this driver flung his
captive then he fastened him securely and
went to join his wife and daughter who
were eagerly discussing the affair and the
mother was all aflame also-for had not the
thing in the outhouse tried to assault her
girl and did it not seem that he meant evil
to the beloved forests of pickhead cameron
yet they ate their supper with thorough
british regard for the inner-man a great
creed which the growth of the empire en-
dorses daily

   once driver left the meal to roughly gag
the man in the outhouse for the english
like to eat in comfort and the crying of
the wounded captive was disturbing then
driver smoked a pipe and performed certain
mental processes almost analogous to think-
ing

   hell tell he remarked as he lit a sec-
ond pipe before proceeding to the outhouse
dont heed his ollering-its mr camer-
ons business

   then he went to interview his captive
and that which he did was not nice in the
abstract it was a boy looking for the in-
ward principle of a watch in the concrete
a gorilla similarly interested in say a pig-
eon i knew bill driver very well and i
think he liked me but i am also of a scien-
tific turn of mind and therefore i tell the
facts

   whenthe other showed a willingness to
speak bill removed the gag

   my countrymen will come to find me
said the captive

   oh responded driver how many are
there-fifty

  two

   bill laughed

   dont-oh dont shrieked the captive

   tell then

   will you let me go if i do

   bill driver significantly lifted the rough
gag from the mud floor of the outhouse and
the captive snatching at the one chance of
freedom from further agony spoke

   youve heard of the andaman islands-
prison

   over drivers face flashed the expression
of the hunted animal the gag dropped
from his hand he bared his teeth and

his forehead wrinkled as he snarled -
so-you found out-summat-and you

-come here-to to-

  wait wait shrieked the other you
dont understand

  yus i do and you swine you tried
to-to-to-my girl

   listen oh listen please let me tell
you tell me-tell me quick-where is
the other two thats after me

   bill driver pressed his heavy chin on the
others nose moving it just enough

  were not after you never-heard-of
you moaned the captive

   bill driver lifted his face and stared
you never heard i was at the andamans
-and got away he asked

  you escaped gasped the captive for-
getting his misery in astonishment

   bill driver was himself again

  how do you want to die he asked
but all we want to do is to rescue a
man from the andamans-help him get
away like you did

   the affair was too complicated for bills
mind he had no objection to another poor
devil escaping but he had many objections
to his place of hiding becoming known
besides the fellow had attempted to as-
sault his daughter and what was he doing
in the forest anyhow

  how do you want to die

  inside the outhouse it was quite dark
but neither man felt the need of any more
light outside the bats flew low and the
teak trees woke to their evening whisper-
ings

  let me tell you-we will give you money
-we dont care about you dont you see
that if we help another man to escape we
darent tell about you

  well

  the prisoner gasped out his tale which
was to the effect that a burman-the lead-
er of a gang of highway robbers dacoits-
had been caught in the periodical dragnet
of the department of justice as usual he
produced a host of friends who swore that
he was an innocent man they went on
the stand and testified that he not only ab-
horred dacoitry but that he was of so spir-
itual a nature that he could not even wring
the neck of a chicken unfortunately for
the dacoit there was other evidence and
the other evidence convinced the judge that
the andaman islands would make an ex-
cellent abiding place for the remainder of


adventure

that dacoits life and so he sent him there
it was the philanthropic desire of drivers
captive and his two countrymen to rescue
said highway robber

  well said bill driver when the tale
was told

  his poor wife cries for him explained
the other

  but bill came of a nation of shopkeepers

   ow much are you getting for doing it
he asked

  the other hesitated

  how do you want to die said driver

  there are mines

  yus

  ruby mines that we made quite sure the
man at the andamans knows about-oh
we are very sure ve vill get him away and
for doing so get the place of the mines
well

  if you will let me go i will-give you
half my share

  how did you get into these ere for-
ests

  i was lost replied the other with ap-
parent truthfulness my friends are at-
a fishing village

  bill saw his daughter struggling in his
captives arms the captive could not see
bills face

  i aint got nothing against you elping a
poor devil escape but-how are you going
to do it

  its all arranged said the other eager-
ly in native sailboats we go-with ma-
chine guns that came as sewing-machines
we will have thirty burmans with us just
for the hard work because with our ma-
chine guns we could do it alone the con-
vict station has no cable or anything and
the guard-ship-pooh just a few colas he
sailors with old niles and ten rounds of am-
munition and english officers with swords
we take our sail-ships and nobody sus-
pects the soldiers-about hundred and
fifty-have also just a few rounds of car-
tridges it is easy

  well

  we go close to guard-ship-little steam-
er you know we go close like poor sail-
ship in distress asking for water guard-
ship we easy find but if in harbor just the
same then we kill all on guard-ship easy
and-

  well

  during his short acquaintance with wil-
liam driver the captive had found little

cause for amusement now he laughed un-
pleasantly	v
then we free all the convicts-fifteen
thousand black men the convicts very
glad to kill guards and soldiers we help
with our machine guns then while the
convicts are having little fun we take our
man away and nobody ever know about
us afterward convicts blamed-mutiny
who will believe tale about white men com-
ing and freeing them we only take our
man-no more lots will be killed so we
free all convicts to get them blamed and
to keep soldiers busy while we take our man
away but we leave convicts having their
little fun so we get away without being
bothered by many wanting to go with us
fun asked william driver

  yes-we tell convicts about english wo-
men you know

  bill drivers powerful body twitchcd
strangely about his lips was a slight froth

  yes added the prisoner english wo-
men-wives-girls-fifteen thousand black
murderers-very few soldiers-very little
ammunition

  a wounded gorilla will first scream then
mutter automatically and continue to mut-
ter bill did not scream but he had no con-
trol of his words

  near twenty years ago i told annie i
loved her then i read a book about what
the blacks did to the english women in the
mutiny cawnpore and the like and i
were scared that some black might do it to
my annie and so i shot the first black i
saw it were foolish of me because the
blacks in india are now all decent folks ex-
cept those they send to the andaman is-
lands they sent me to the andamans for
shooting the black and i deserved it annie
helped me escape i read it in a book
read just what them blacks will do when
your friends lets them loose you wont be
there and-my daughter

  i do not know what bill driver did with
his captive

  i know that he went to his hut obsessed
with the importance of a mission that in
spite of the pleadings of the women who
loved him he gave certain orders and made
known his intention

  the wife and daughter were to do their
best to get to moulmein where there was a
telegraph if they got there they were to
see to it that the authorities sent a man-of-
war to the andamans as bill put it
the receipt



  it will take maybe a week to get there
if i went theyd want to know all about
me and theyd put me in jail then theyd
take a month to investigate-and think wot
them black convicts could do in a month
now you go to moulmein and use mr
camerons name and get a telegram to him
but be careful not to say a word abart what
he done for us do all you can to make
em send a man-of-war im going to the
andamans to warn em-if i get there in
time

  but- from annie the first

  no buts lass there aint no need to
tell who i am though id go anyhow you
start for moulmein

  so they parted at the little hut in the
midst of a circle of great teak trees where
years before they had had notions of mak-
ing their home in one of them where pick-
head cameron had found them and where
macneil had married them

bill driver taking with him
some few stores and the precious
rifle and bayonet made a forced
march of twenty-six hours to the coast and
when he left the jungle at a tiny fishing
village the haunting smell of the clear sea
brought memories of the fog-bound spirit of
england and of the warmer wraith forbid-
ding escape from the andaman islands
the tremulous stimulant of sentiment shiv-
ered his spine with recollection and he
clutched his rifle the more tightly as he cir-
cled the huts of the fishermen

  quietly he laid his small stock of food and
water in the stern of a boat cut the grass-rope
hawser and got aboard there was a slight
creaking when he hoisted the single sail but
the fishermen were asleep and the light
breeze was off the land and bill driver
steered in the general direction of east and
south down a wavering lane of moonlight
that seemed to beckon him along his not-
too-accurate course

  it is necessary to guess at the details of
that voyage nearly twenty years before
he had crossed that same part of the indian
ocean in the scow known at the andamans
as the milk-boat with the woman who
had shown him the way of escape-and a
terrible voyage it had been for it had
only been by favor of the god of the chances
that they had made the coast of burma de-
spite their own heroic efforts and what i
once told about it came from annie in the

main for as has also been told bill was no
teller of tales

  so regarding the voyage when he went
back only guesses can be made since he
went alone besides there is another rea-
son but i am inclined to think because i
have been a sailor all my life and know how
limited was bills knowledge of the craft-i
indeed state without fear of contradiction
that the imperious though ever-bibulous
god of the chances again aided the man and
that furthermore that same decadent deity
prevailed upon his brother tippler who rules
so laxily over the minor winds for bill
driver by simply keeping his frail boat be-
fore it made the harbor of port blair on
the morning of the seventh day and dur-
ing the passage he saw no other ship

  the early morning mists were wreathing
into fantasies as bill rounded the point
these lifted suddenly and the penal settle-
ment thrust itself into his vision but there
was nothing unpleasing about its appear-
ance the man stared at the place and the
place seemed to stare back at the man and
the man felt a sense of friendliness it was
as if he had met an old enemy with whom
he had once fought a hard battle but with
whom he now clasped hands

  and it was all the same-hope island
where he had lived in his lonely hut the
settlement of port blair with the mens
barrack-like jail on that island divided by
a strip of water from the womens jail the
hilly island where the paroled convicts start-
ed independent life again and up the es-
tuary viper where the worst characters
were confined

  the harbor was empty neither the guard-
boat nor the convict-carrying ship being
there

  the breeze died and bill lowered the
sail and with great effort got out the clum-
sy oars dizzily he looked toward the bun-
galows of the officers then he began to
row toward the chief commissioners pri-
vate wharf when a convict it had been
his business to row the milk boat from is-
land to island and the chief commissioners
wharf had been his first place of call

  the heavy oars seemed to have wills of
their own and bill could hardly control
them on the wharf a tall sikh guard
roused from his dozing and watched him
come

  bill driver made the boat fast to the
worn cleet on the steps of the landing he


adventure

clawed out of her like a man trying to scale
a cliff and made his way feebly up the
steps on hands and knees half-way up he
paused and laughed vacantly for he had
discovered that he had reached the right
place and that his fearful voyage was over
it also occurred to him that he had eaten
and drank but little and that he had not
slept at all

  abbe kitha jarlka

  bill at the head of the steps looked up
to the voice it was a long time since he
had heard hindustanee spoken some one
wanted to know where he was going bills
soul tried to tell the voice that it was none

of that voices - business but his lips

were working like an infants at breast-
time and the words he tried to get between
them trailed off into curious little noises
which mocked him

  then he forgot where he was going and
struggling to remember memory asserted
itself over the vague impressions of the
present and memory told bill that he
was again a convict confined and that he
had grown tired of the loneliness and that
he was going to kill the sikh guard on the
chief commissioners wharf so that he
would be hanged and suffer no more

  he lay down on the rough planking and
wandered in the past

  his mind swirled to the boat he had just
left there were two boats no-one boat
he had taken that boat from a burman fish-
ing village and he had grinned at the moon
when he took it from just behind that
moon the voice again spoke to him

  who are you it said in english

  and bill driver opened his eyes and
looked up at the tall sikh guard then he
clutched feebly at his precious rifle the
sikh had grown gray in service and bill
had changed also but the men knew one
another at once

  toom kady

  yus muttered bill its me this ere
was once your rifle-my girl hit yer and
took it i aint come to kill yer this time
did yer know that one morning i were
going to throttle you i went behind that
there hedge and i trod on some english
flowers wot were growing there and the
smell of them made me weepy my girl-
wot had come here as a maid to the chief
commissioners sister - found me there
blubbing so i didnt throttle yer

  the sikhs rifle had followed every move-

ment of william driver indeed i think
that it was only the uncanniness of his ar-
rival that saved him the sikh was super-
stitious and bill had not only reappeared
to him out of the morning mists but it was
as if the rugged personality of the famous
convict had suddenly and fearsomely thrust
itself forth from the fathered years be-
sides he was supposed to be dead any
other man would have been dead

  but when the guard felt quite sure that
his old enemy was not dead he grinned re-
lievedly behind his great beard then he
stepped forward and removed the precious
rifle from the unresisting fingers then he
fired his own rifle into the air and alarmed
the colony

  and bill driver unable to stand but
again conscious glared up at the sikh look-
ing for trouble and cursing his inability to
cause it the chief commissioners bun-
galow was only about a hundred feet from
the wharf a carefully cultivated flower gar-
den separating consequently sir george
furlong was the first man to reach the place
of alarm

  bot budmash waller hi burra sahib ex-
plained the sikh

  but the guards explanation was not suf-
ficiently particular the chief commis-
sioner only saw an exhausted white man
stretched out on his private wharf-a white
man who was apparently a stranger to the
islands

  who is he-what do you mean

  bill was so weak that when he looked at
things they appeared to be separated from
him by a glass globe full of water the man
talking to the sikh was not the old chief
commissioner of his time of captivity and
he loomed above him like an attenuated
ghost perhaps bill guessed at his identity
by forcing all his will into his mighty mus-
cles he managed to raise his hand and sa-
lute

  im bill driver sir he said wot-
got away-from here

  then he fainted again as the wharf be-
came crowded with half-dressed officers and
men the doctor knelt by drivers side

  get some brandy no hes pretty well
worn out-a hypos better

  the sun flooded the harbor and port
blair glittered like a diamond two sol-
diers supported bill whilst the contents of
the hypodermic syringe warmed life into
him and the men and women on the chief
the receipt



commissioners wharf watched in a tense si-
lence plaided with the colors of speculation
and memory

  and this was bill driver the famous con-
vict the only man who had ever escaped
from the andamans and-a man whom a
woman had really loved wonderful wil-
liam driver what was it you had that
made your annie love you it wasnt only
your strength other men might equal that
i almost can myself you who so seldom
spoke and never heard of verses-what was
there in you william driver why should
the tender fate who tries to arrange the
love-affairs of men have made a special ef-
fort on your behalf for-a woman loved
you for yourself alone then how had he
come back to the penal settlement-where
had he been all the years-and for what
reason had he returned

i read it in a book muttered bill
yes yes we know said the doctor
soothingly but that was very long ago
abart a week-a long week muttered
bill

  the doctor studied him

  no fever why is he delirious

the chief commissioner interrupted-
driver why have you come back

  the sunlight hurt bills sleep-craving eyes
and made him angry

some grub and a sleep and ill help ye
yes yes-you came to help us
swine muttered bill there was two
swine-no three at the start-theres only
two now i came to tell you-and ill help
you

  yes driver-go on

  swine replied bill

  cant you help him doctor-give him
something

  hell be all right sir after we get food
into him and let him sleep

  but you dont think he came back here
for the fun of it do you give him some-
thing

  the doctor obeyed reluctantly

  read it in a book about swine whis-
pered bill and the swine is coming here
yes driver-go on

  wots-the-name of-guard-boat
  the mayo

  swine-got her-killed all-crew
  what

  dont bother - abart convicts look
out-for women worse than cawnpore-
coming	



  along the morning breeze came the un-
mistakable rattle of a machine gun punc-
tuated by some rifle-shots

  wot did-i tell yer muttered bill
now-look out they got the guard-
ship

  i dont quite understand said the chief
commissioner tell me driver

  forrin swine-going to loose convicts-
tell em abart white women he said-just
like in book i read-abart mutiny-ma-
chine guns

  god why doesnt the government
give us a cable

  bill blinked up at the chief commissioner
and spoke confidentially also confidently

  just hold on sir its all right-just
hold on and my annie will bring a man-o-
war

  shortly afterward bill driver came as
near blushing as he ever did in all his tur-
bulent life for two very aristocratic ladies
were feeding him beef tea with silver spoons

  they fed him and two tommies put him
to bed he insisted that the precious if
somewhat archaic rifle should be laid by his
side

  when the trouble starts he explained
i want the old girl handy

  he slept for several hours and woke to
all his strength again licking his ups at the
appetizing fight before him-a fight that
had commenced shortly after he had warned
the garrison which had however been able
to build a fairly strong protection of sand-
bags wherein the women were now doing
their best to soothe the pain of many wound-
ed men for the smau stock of anesthetics
and anodynes had been exhausted	

  it was nearing sunset and all the won-
der-colors of the indian ocean appeared to
be playing with the fish jumping in the
harbor there was a lull in the fighting
for the convicts were busy with their eve-
ning curry and rice also the more subtle
were holding conferences the first aban-
don of freedom had worn itself out and
some were beginning to see a rift in the
altruism of the two foreigners who had freed
them the fingers of many dead pointed
to an unpleasing end

  an ancient murderer nibbled at a piece
of dried fish and spoke between nibbles

  they came he said and they cap-
tured the ag boat on which they put their
many-mouthed guns they sailed close to
where the british have made them a fort


adventure

and the water being shallow they ground-
ed with much effort they got off mean-
while their men let us go free-telling us to
seek revenge and the white women now
my brothers what is the reason of this do-
ing in what way are these two white men
who are not english interested in our en-
joyments many of us are dead and the
english still hold the fort

  it is said that they hate the english be-
cause they are white yet are not english-
being of a lower caste suggested another

  and that there is a great war coming
after which there will be no more english
at which time all men will be free said a
third

  free sneered the ancient who is
free what is free even a rajah is not
free by his women is he enslaved as are
others by opium when this matter of kill-
ing the english in this place is concluded
what then suppose it is but the revenge
of the two white men who are not english
well we will have helped at that revenge
and had our fill of womens screams then
will the two white men want to take the
mayo ag boat and go back to their place
-which will show us their wisdom my
brothers- he leaned forward in the little
circle-we who are wise men and friends
must see to it that we also go from here in
that mayo ag boat i have a memory that
the british government has a long arm
it might have been wise said another
thoughtfully had we gone to the side of
the british they have a lion for their
caste-mark and ever do many seek to kill
that lion he is a sleepy lion and wakes
but slowly but when he does wake he
makes the jungle tremble with his rage and
all the lesser beasts hide from him did

not my father tell me-

  and so on there was infinite chatter-
ing relatives and old cronies in crime
jubilated over the cooking-pots the wo-
men prisoners had their peculiar place in
the orgy the dark closed over a chorus of
nasty noises the few little circles of old
men gabbled wisely but the mass was a
thoughtless horde craving many things

bill driver rubbing his eyes
with one great hand and trailing the
precious rifle with the other had
reported himself to the captain in command
of the white soldiers and that officer had
said things to william which made him feel

lumpy inside made him feel that he could
just about lick a hundred of the enemy
very much embarrassed he tried to explain
this feeling

  im only a third-class shot he stam-
mered but im useful with the butt and
baynit

  and over it all hung the peculiarly peace-
ful smell of the wood fires the bats flew
low in the creeks and estuaries the mist-
wraiths began to form

  but there was a hideous unanimity about
the killing of the garrison which was fos-
tered exceedingly when some genius of a
convict found the commisariat sergeants
store of wines and spirits there are cer-
tain castes in india that profess to abhor
drink but religion is at times elastic

  the machine guns spluttered the de-
fenders fired at the advancing menace but
the terrain favored the convicts with every
sort of cover and they were able to creep
almost up to the defenses before attacking
with their axes adzes and weapons looted
from the mayo it must be remembered
that there were about fourteen thousand
convicts and that the two machine guns
effectually prevented any sortie of the gar-
rison which was so very short of ammuni-
tion

  and the whole affair had been so unex-
pected so unprepared for many of the
defenders felt that they were in a hideous
nightmare out of which they would wake
in due time and in that belief many died
description of it all is as impossible as would
be the description of a burning building it
was fight fight fight

  the drink worked in the convicts and the
moon set then they began firing the
houses making a glimpse of an indecent
hell as they ran about with torches and
ever the ammunition in the little fort dwin-
dled thus with all port blair ablaze the
last round was served out and the men were
told of this fact some grinned some swore
some said nothing each after his fashion
but all grimly held on

  shortly before daylight an order was
whispered to certain men it had to do
with the use of the shells in some revolvers
these were on no account to be fired at the
enemy

  the dark lifted to the kiss of the dawn
the breath of morning moved over the har-
bor the ammunition of the defenders was
exhausted the convicts came on careless
the receipt



of creed distinction howling in a reeling
frenzy-hindoos mohammedans every
caste known to india and burma the set-
tlement echoed to their yells as they swirled
forward

  then humanity clashed at the breast-
works and voices melted into a sort of hum
splashed with curses and weapons meeting

  oaths from every one of that little group
of islands in the grim north sea mingled
with the fighting gutturals of the valiant
sikh guards dying for the honor of the salt
they had eaten and b il  d river and his old-
time enemy of the chief commissioners
wharf found themselves side by side they
grinned at each other through sweat-clut-
tered faces and parried and thrust in a glor-
ious spirit of comradeship yet the drunk-
en degenerates prevailed the defenders
did not give way-they fought till they fell
and died

  over the souls of certain men who had
been told off to do a certain clean deed with
the few remaining shells in the revolvers
spread a horror of that duty these looked
furtively at the women

  the sun rose over burning blackened port
blair and flushed at the screaming filth it
lighted certain men agreed that the gar-
rison could not last five minutes longer
these looked at each other then they did
not look at each other they staggered to-
ward the group of women and girls
then-

  she came round the point-a gray lithe
shape cleared for action her ensign snap-
ping angrily and as she came her guns
smashed at the scum that had almost surged
to its desire her boats dropped from the
davits and loaded with armed marines
drove at the beach the women had not
been cheaply protected

in ways beyond my understand-
ing the pleading of annie the first
had prevailed against the precedent
of regulation and the captain of the cruiser
had brought her and annie the second with
her that she was liable to imprisonment
for conniving at her mans escape was a
detail she ignored entirely

  she was the marrow-bone of bill drivers
life and therefore she knew that her place
was by his side and searching frantically
among the wounded and dead she found
him lying unconscious across the body of
the sikh guard among the carefully culti-

vated english flowers in the chief commis-
sioners garden and while annie the sec-
ond ran for the doctor-over-busy with
other wounded men - the marrow-bone
took bills head on her lap and petted him
back to consciousness

  amid her kisses he indicated the dead
sikh

  he were a man lass he muttered
im most sorry you hit him when we got
away from ere-though we did need the
rifle mortal bad

  then the doctor came and after a little
while that doctor nodded slowly and
annie the first dry-eyed and beyond sobs
knew the meaning of it the chaplain be-
gan the prayer he had so often used but
bill interrupted he could not see very
clearly but the haze clouding him was very
different from the red haze of his passions

   scuse me sir he said weakly the
doc says im dying

  yes my man said the doctor

  the chaplain began to pray again

  i want to speak to the chief commis-
sioner said bill driver

  the chief commissioner his left arm in a
sling and his head bandaged leaned over
annies shoulder

  yes driver-what is it

  with a vast effort bill saluted

  you know abart me sir-escaped con-
vict

  yes my man but thats all right you
have wiped the slate clean

  bill smiled weirdly

  thank you sir theres a gent in lon-
don-annie can tell him but theres a
mister macneil-hes dead-he were a
good man and a minister bill gulped
for breath i-i-i want him to know
that ive paid the government back

  he knows now said the chaplain
yes sir-i dont think youd tell a lie
and mr macneil he said the same thing
but-i dont know for myself there may
be a heaven and all that im going to
find out in a few minutes

  its true said the chaplain

  yes sir-but i want mr macneil to
know that ive paid the government

  he knows now reiterated the chap-
lain

  bill was silent his brain had become
strangely clear and he was thinking as he

had never thought before then-

  if i see mr macneil i can tell him


adventure

he said but thats only telling spose
he says yes driver i wont know but
what hes saying it to make me feel good
i wont be able to prove it

  he became silent again the noise of
the convicts being subdued came faintly to
his ears he saw his wife his daughter the
doctor the chaplain and the chief commis-
sioner vaguely

  what is it they give a feller when he
pays a debt he asked suddenly

his audience failed to understand him
you know sir he said directly to the
chief commissioner suppose you pays a
bill what is it the man gives you-the man
you pays it to

  oh-a receipt said the chief commis-
sioner

  bill smiled happily

  thats it please give me a receipt sir
so i can show it to mr macneil and hell
know ive paid the government

  the chief commissioner answered huskily
  very well driver

  he wrote on a page torn from his note-
book signed the writing and gave it to
annie the first

  read it lass whispered bill

  and annie read

  this is to certify that william driver who es-
caped from the andaman islands after being sen-
tenced for life thereto returned of his own volition
to those islands to warn the officials of an impend-
ing massacre that due to the effort of his warning
not a woman or child was killed or injured that he
fought most nobly in defense of the right that he
gave his life in that defense

  and by virtue of the authority invested in me
as governor of the andaman islands i george
furlong do hereby release the said william driver
from the custody of the british government-which
government has received full satisfaction for the
debt william driver once incurred

george furlong

  bills vast chest heaved with the pride of
a work well done

  put it in my hand lass he whispered
so i can take it with me and show it to
mr macneil

ad regan stood with his hand
on the wooden gate-latch and
called a parting message to the
motherly figure on the porch
mebby today mother well get word
yes jim answered the other sadly

its been time you be careful jim
dad regan nodded assent and opening
the gate started down the hill to the rail-
road station a year had passed now since
the brief message had come telling of the
death of their son in the navy it had
hereditary evidence



become a habit with the regans to start every
day with the hope that additional details
would come but despite their earnest old-
fashioned letters and all the inquiries they
knew how to make they received no news

the branch line that curved out
into the coal district at stanton and
struck the main overland track at
pennington was barely fifty miles long it
boasted only one train a day a mixed pas-
senger and freight on which the train crew
were all called by their first names and
whose intimate family affairs were known
to most all their passengers the branch
however owing to its heavy strings of coal-
cars boasted as fine a road-bed as any on
the division and was tracked with ninety-
pound rail

  when the big washout came in march on
the main line between stanton and pen-
nington the overland flyers were detoured
over the coal dust division as this fifty
miles was nicknamed everything went all
right until one of the big-train engineers
maybe trying to show off before the won-
dering natives who had come in to every
station to see a real big train come in took
the high-ball through summerset at regula-
tion straight-track speed and piled up on a
curve the crookedness of which he had
never dreamed

  thanks to the steel coaches nobody was
killed but after that the master mechanic
had one of the coal dust engineers go
through in the cab of every train as a
pilot

  the engineers of the coal dust division
were all old men grown gray in the service
and retired to this eddy of a great system
to work out the years yet remaining between
them and retirement on pension dad re-
gan was one of these he sat on one of the
high stools at the railroad lunch house at
stanton and sipped a cup of black coffee
he was waiting to pilot no  over the
troublesome division

  the morning air was cold and the coffee
caused the old mans pinched figure to swell
and thaw a little his sparse hair was a lit-
tle grayer than his short mustache which
had once been brown like his eyes the
hand on the heavy iron-china cup was wrin-
kled and vein-shaped but did not shake
as he blew the steam off his cup and set-
tled back on the hard stool one caught the
impression held by the company that dad

regan was a mighty dependable man get-
ing a little old maybe but able to hold up
his end yet and proud of it

  jim hundley and stubby nelson of
the light cruiser topeka bound overland
from the atlantic to the pacifit station
were awake and stirring according to cus-
tom at s a m their whole beings de-
manded their shipboard morning coffee

  naw sah apologized the porter there
aint no dinah yit we dont pick it up till
long bout nine

  but we want coffee complained the
two sailors and hundley idly let two silver
pieces strike together in his pocket

  well sah said the negro his wits
sharpened by the clink of the coins you-
all might drap off de train at stanton we
waits dar twenty minutes and sometimes a
mite longer count ob dis here washout
dars a good coffee place near-by de track
one of the coins made a hasty and safe
journey and ten minutes later the two sail-
ors hurried into the railroad lunch

  dad regan took a long look at the uni-
forms started to speak a couple of times
but not until the sailors had finished one
cup ordered another and turned to look at
their surroundings did he see their cap rib-
bons then he came forward a little tim-
idly and asked a question

  are you two boys from the topeka of
the united states navy he spoke a lit-
tle huskily as if under mental stress

  sure thing spoke up stubby nelson
know anybody in the outfit

  dad regan ignored the question and ask-
ed another

  did ye by any chance happen to be on
her a year ago last may

  i was he said then waited for there
was a tenseness in the old mans tone which
interested him

 then ye must have known my son
johnnie dad regan spoke hopefully as
if an affirmative answer would be too good
to be true

  whats the last name maybe i did i
know em all

  regan john regan he was killed
you know

  hundley started to say something and
nelson kicked him dad regan was speak-
ing again

  yes he was my boy all that ma and me
had he got the fever and just had to go
his letters was pretty blue too wanted to


adventure

come home but i wouldnt humor him
then there come the accident

  the old man paused a moment and to
hide his emotion pulled out his watch
then he hurried on

  except for a notice from the navy de-
partment that he was dead we have had
no news at all if ye knew him and know
about the accident id be obliged if ye told
me theres nearly twenty minutes before
train time

  stubby nodded and held out his left hand
with two fingers gone

  i got that in the same mix-up he said
and i knew johnnie well ill tell you all
about it

  again hundley started to speak and nel-
son halted him

  let me do it jim i was in johnnies
division

  regan came aboard the panther while i
was a short-timer i remember the morn-
ing well a bunch of recruits came down
to the south atlantic on the prairie to re-
lieve the men going home all the ships
company not on watch gathered around the
port gangway to see what wed get

   there comes a likely youngster growl-
ed old shorty bray to me and he meant
johnnie regan in less than a week wed
nicknamed him johnnie reb on account
of the way he said you-all and ahd all his
rs pretty soon we cut that-called him
j r for short

  he wrote about it smiled dad regan
happily

  well he made good continued stubby
took the drill and the eats which were
pretty bum after the prairie left and the
kiddixt like a man ought to

about that time we were per-
suadin santo domingo to be good
and the boat j r was in came in
for an awful share of rough work it would
have sickened anybody that owned a streak
of yellow as wide as a rope-yarn

  i dont know why they do it but a lot
of recruits get the power-launch for their
small-boat duty j r was one deck-
hand in the crew of five men night and
day good weather and bad that boat has
to run first thing at daybreak they have
to hustle out to get provisions from shore
a quarter of bloody beef maybe and two or
three sacks of spuds then along about nine
the captain has to go ashore on official busi-

ness and boat and crew have to be spotless
and smiling then theres the liberty par-
ties and the mail and twenty other things
which keep the launch crew humping them-
selves twenty hours a day j r stood all
this fine and i want to say right here that
if i had to have a steady job in a launch
id desert tomorrow

  after six months of it the first luff saw
fit to put in somebody else and j r came
on deck that boy certainly was glad he
showed up the division in neatness with his
clothes and put on his shoes again which
no man ever needs in a launch

  then one morning one of the regular
chain-tierers was sick and the boatsns mate
grabbed j r always in the way for a job
and put him in the chain-lockers that
was the morning we had to beat it out of
our anchorage in a little place called cor-
pus christi to keep from piling up on the
beach the bay there is just a little cup-
shaped affair and safe enough with an off-
shore wind but when one of those west
india storms come up and it blows in from
the old caribbean its no place for a ship
to spend any time

  we were in a hurry to get out of course
and were rolling around pretty lively j r
and a fellow named shere were in the lock-
ers the anchor-chain was something awful
to handle covered with a kind of sticky
blue mud volcanic they call it and things
were in such a rush that we couldnt take
time to wash it with a hose as it came over
the side which was customary

  j r and his partner were making the
best of a bad job when the ship gave a big
roll and threw shere down he tried to
scramble up but the slimy mud wouldnt let
him get his feet under him

  left alone with the chain j r did the
best he could but with the mud and roll of
the ship some of that chain got away from
him and went across sheres legs the two
of them shouted for help thats all they
could do shere couldnt get out and with
the chain still coming it would soon have
him covered and crushed to death

  in the noise on deck we didnt hear
them it was blowing like sin by then and
everybody was working to save the ship
the first we knew j r came running on
deck a kink in the chain had made the
man at the winch slack back a little and
he took this flying chance to get on deck
before we started to heave in again
hereditary evidence



  there was only half a minutes delay
and the chain commenced to come in again
before he could get to the boatswain to
make himself heard he jumped up on the
taut chain and shouted to belay then it
happened

  the chain struck another snarl the
winch man threw on more power and just
at the short break at the hause pipe the
chain parted poor j r caught the full
snap of it it threw him twenty feet and
he struck on his head broke his neck he
died instantly trying to save a friend

  the sailor stopped his story was end-
ed dad regan cleared his throat and with
a voice betraying the effort to control it
asked

  the other boy did they save him
  stubby shook his head

  too late he said and hundley finished
for him thats how stubby lost his fin-
gers trying to get shere out couple of
fathoms of chain rolled them flat

  dad regan slowly took his feet from the
rungs of the stool and stood up

  i want to thank you two boys he said
still a little shakily i do wish that moth-
er could have heard too ye couldnt stop
over and tell her

  he faced stubby squarely and the two
sailors could feel the almost piteous appeal
in his eyes

  hundley wavered stubby shook his
head firmly

  we have to report on time he said
tell her for us tell her that all the boys
thought a lot of johnnie regan

  thank ye both then said dad resign-
edly i hear the westbound cornin and
ill have to be goin ill be ridin with ye
but ill be in the cab

  he spoke without boastfulness yet with
pride in turn he grasped the two sailors
hands and the three walked out

  i probably wont see ye again he said
at the door but im mighty glad ye could
tell me about johnnie motherll be glad
too

  plainly unable to say more he hurried
from them they saw him jump briskly to
his place in the cab of the giant engine which
was to take them over the coal dust divi-
sion from the steps he waved a farewell

  a fine old man said hundley as the
two sailors walked to their coach but
johnnie certainly was a throw-back what
made you do what you did stubby

  i guess your first words answer that
hes a fine old man i couldnt break his
heart by telling him that his son was a low-
down miserable coward

  you could have played ignorant
couldnt you

  and increase the old mans suspicions
didnt you see that he was worried because
nobody had ever written him the details
and besides i for one have never been
quite sure about regan all the ship ever
had was what shere said when he was half
delirious in the hour before he died
wasnt that enough whatre you driv-
in at you know as well as i do that john-
nie regan could have helped shere out and
got out himself if he hadnt had cold feet
and deserted like a coward shere said so
himself

  yes i know all that and again it might
have happened just like i told the old man
honest now did he look like a man whose
only son would have a yellow streak
johnnie looked good too argued the
unconvinced hundley his old man might
have a streak of yellow as wide as a squil-
gee waiting to crop out when you least
expect it

  stubby shook his head

  i dont know jim it might have been
one way and it might have been the other
i did my best anyway for the old man but

i	couldnt stand to stop over and tell the
yarn again to the mother the doubts in
my mind the same as its in yours she
would have caught me

fuel could be had almost for the
taking along the right-of-way of the
coal dust division consequently
the builders of the road economized in the
deep cuts and great fills which make for
easy grades and used the coal the road
went up hill and down dale and the great
engines toiled laboriously up spouting a
cloud of black smoke from their stacks or
rolled ponderously down with a roar of
grinding brakes

  dad regan with his heavy string of sleep-
ers and mail and express coaches stopped
at the summit of squirrel ridge for orders
below him was a long stretch of straight
track it led down into the valley and then
up another ridge to the honeycomb mine
it was the custom for the engineers to tear
out a strip going down in order to get a
running start for the stiff grade ahead


adventure

  all clear shouted the operator above
the roar of the panting engine as dad
regan and his conductor came into the
little office for their orders and a few
moments after regan started his train down
the hill

  this particular section of the division was
one of its worst places there was no switch
in the valley between and if a coal-car or an
empty string got away from the busy yards
of the honeycomb after a train had left
squirrel ridge they ran together at the
bottom and smashed things up

  so far nothing serious had happened
cars had run wild and once the local had
to back up the ridge in a hurry but up un-
til the day that dad regan started down
with the overland there had been no wreck
worth the name even the request of the
roadmaster for a derailing switch had gone
no further than permission for the prelimi-
nary grading

  as dad regan came roaring down he
kept his eyes constantly on the summit
ahead at the ridge he had waited for a
long coal-train to creep up and go safely
into the clear he knew that since the big
trains were routed over this division that
every precaution was being taken against
an accident but still he watched as he
reached the bottom going fifty miles an
hour he looked away for a moment and
hooked the big machine up another notch
for the stiff climb ahead when he looked
out again the thing that he dreaded most
of all had happened his fireman saw it at
the same time

  dad he shrieked dad look at
whats cornin

  dad had already looked he shut off his
power opened the sand and jammed on the
brakes the heavy train already taking
the grade slowed almost instantly seven
loaded coal gons had broken away and
were coming down the hill without a single
man to set a hand-brake even if that would
have done any good

  when she stops jump and uncouple the
engine ordered dad

  the fireman looked at him questioningly
dad picked up a wrench

  quick he commanded again and the
fireman hit the ground at the same time
that the train came to a jerky rumbling
stop

  there were two other things that dad
regan could have done-try to back his

train out of danger up the hill behind him
or jump and save himself and try to get
the passengers out before the coal-train
struck either of these two ways was dan-
gerous to his passengers and comparatively
safe for himself

  the runaway was coming at such speed
that dad felt sure they could not get away
by the first plan and as for clearing the
coaches of their human freight it was out
of the question unless there had been ten
minutes for every one that was available
there were babies and invalids and skep-
tics who would not leave their baggage and
dad knew it he took the only safe course
to save his train and had weighed the
chances and made up his mind in the sec-
onds while his hands were busy stopping
his engine

  he shouted once more and brandished
the wench as his fireman hesitated over
the automatic coupling a moment more
and the coaches commenced to roll gently
away behind him and he was free

  with the step of a man of thirty he sprang
to his levers and started the big overland
engine up the hill to meet the onrushing
coal-cars they were coming in a cloud of
dust and with the rumble of a landslide
dads plan was to meet them head-on as
far up the slope as he could and let the
heavy engine derail and wreck them he
must stand by too for the engine must have
speed and the grade was steep from a
standing start there was precious little time
only an old hand-a master hand-could
do it

  five hundred yards up the grade the en-
gine and the runaway met with a noise like
the crash of a battery of turret-guns the
big engine with sand grinding under its
wheels and the power necessary to haul its
load across a continent loosed for destruc-
tion scooped under the first coal-car snap-
ped the couplings and sent it spinning end
over end down the embankment with
diminished speed it met the second derailed
it and crashed through its middle into the
third the following cars piled up on the
mess and the day was saved the long
string of passenger coaches lay safe in the
valley

  some of the passengers did not come out
to see what had happened until the crash
came but stubby and hundley saw it all
they started with the train-crew in a run
toward the wreck
the woman of the desert



what do you think of it now panted
stubby a man like that couldnt be the
father of a coward

 hundley didnt answer

ten minutes later they dug dad regan
out of the freshly dug earth of the half-
made derailing switch poured water on him

and found him all right he had jumped
just at the last minute and keeping his wits
about him had picked his place

  that night the two sailors stopped over
after all it was hundley who told the
story of johnnie regan to the eager ears of
johnnies mother

thewcmianof tlie de sert

miclijetie

he man named gilbertson
whom the natives called in their
language the honorable for -
eign-devil pill-doctor peered
into the deepening dusk at the swaying fig-
ures of three camels he stood at the en-
trance of the chinese innkeepers stable-
yard leaning slightly forward to balance
himself against the blasts of a shrieking dust-
storm

  the approach of the caravan had been
the first incident worth speaking of through-
out the long winter day though if it comes
to that scarcely any day in chinese turkes-
tan is characterized by incidents at all worth
recording

  gilbertson made out the figures of two
persons in the caravan as he watched the
howling desert wind of a sudden beat up
against him with greater fury it filled his
eyes with dust and left him choking and
sputtering he rebuked it as the chinese
stablemen always did uttering strange chi-
nese oaths

  when he had regained his breath the
foremost camel had brushed past him into
the stableyard and the second mournful
and reeking with the grime of the caravan-
route towered over him he recovered his
vision in time to register genuine surprise
at the discovery that the rider of this sec-
ond camel was a woman women do not
often travel in central asia much less chi-
nese women of the upper class such as was
this one judging from her dress and the
patrician character of her features

  a crowd of stablemen camel-drivers and
loafers surrounded the party as the camels
knelt groaning with relief to be rid of their
riders

  at the command of her chinese escort
the woman stumbled after the innkeeper
into the gloomy interior of the inn and so
far as gilbertson was concerned interest in
the incident ceased he went wearily to
the frosty interior of his own room and
shouted against its bare dirty walls for his
coolie that individual so much swarthier


adventure

than the yellow of the chinese that he might
justly have been suspected of mohammedan
forebears slouched into view from nowhere
in particular and made no comment as his
master railed at him for failure to have the
charcoal brazier burning he had been with
gilbertson so many months that he no long-
er gave a thought to the eccentric demands
of his master

  fire enough to heat the room indeed
with the desert wind sweeping into the
place from a thousand crannies why
didnt the honorable foreign-devil doctor
do as the chinese did-wrap himself in
layer after layer of clothing to keep out the
cold why waste fuel when there was
warmth enough in the blood these for-
eign devils were strangely prodigal and il-
logical people nevertheless the coolie
made a show of complying and soon had
sufficient charcoal aglow to warm his mas-
ters blue hands

  gilbertson sat and thought of the chinese
woman there was little else to think of
he remembered suddenly that her feet were
natural-unbound she must then be no
chinese at all but a manchu

  her face as he had glimpsed it in the
dusk was attractive even to his western
eye it had the high forehead and regular
contour of the northern chinese the nose
was not the typical retrousse of the orient
but almost caucasian in proportions her
color was a bleached olive rather than a
yellow-scarcely darker than the color of a
sunburned brunette of the western hemi-
sphere

  her clothes were richly embroidered
they were of unusual character for a trav-
eler on these distant roads

  vong the interpreter who had become
head caravan man since his master learned
to speak chinese effectively came in and
squatted on his heels beside the brazier
gilbertson offered him russian cigarettes
but vong shook his head

  whats the matter with you vong-ski
gilbertson asked in surprise homesick
again

  vong smiled faintly but made no direct
reply

  this is very far from home he said
my wife you know will have another
baby soon it is very cold here and
vong edged closer to the faint glow of the
charcoal

  gilbertson looked at the chinese with

mingled disgust and suspicion

  see here now he said severely
dont you work yourself up into a funk
why lord buddha man if you desert
me now look where ill be at you cant
do it thats all i wont listen to it

  vong looked funereally sober but said
nothing

  how long before we can start asked
gilbertson bruskly after a few thoughtful
puffs at his cigarette

  vong shrugged his shoulders and mur-
mured-

  ten days

  ten days youre mad as the hung-
hutzes we must start in five at the most
not enough camels we must send for
them to the next town

  nonsense i saw forty in the market
today

  there are plenty but their owners will
not sell they ask too much

  how many have you now

  only four master

  four will do if we cant get more
four for the desert road to khotan
and vong held up his hands in reproachful
denial it is a journey of thirty days we
could take only half enough water

  but there will be ice in the water-holes
at this season until we get well into the
desert and even then we can dig for water
in many places the yamen people all say
so from the governor down to the runners
vong shook his head

  these people who came in tonight-
where are they going to khotan also
arent they

  vong nodded

  they are two and they have three cam-
els we are three and we have four cam-
els enough for us vong-ski eh coaxed
gilbertson

  but vong continued to shake his head
there had been a time when he resented
the entirely foreign and irrelevant ski on
the end of his surname but now he was in-
different plainly he was homesick for the
flat green country of the central chinese
plains the land thickly populated with the
houses of the living and the mounds of the
dead he was thinking too of the bright
lights of metropolitan shanghai and of the
little house on sinza road where his young
wife was about to give birth to another
baby perhaps a boy

  and so vong tze-miao was in no mood
the woman of the desert



for thirty days of the desert-thirty days
of hardship and imminent danger in the
great trackless talka-makan why did
this foreign pill-seller want to go to khotan
anyhow incomprehensible to the practi-
cal chinese mind it was to see the desert
to dig for old bits of pottery and wooden
tablets in sand-buried desert cities said the
pill doctor impossible ever to comprehend
these queer foreigners who wished to risk
their lives and those of their servants for
nothing

  in five days the post will be here from
lanchow perhaps we can have a couple
more camels by that time at any rate we
start then do you hear me vong

  vong shook his head but made no fur-
ther protest

  by the way what have you found out
about these people who came tonight
asked gilbertson

  nothing answered vong as if to dis-
miss the subject

  vong-ski thats old stuff come out
with it every man in the place except me
knew their whole history five minutes after
they arrived ill bet on that is she his
wife

  vong nodded

  number one wife

number two replied vong laconically
oh a concubine eh did he buy her
vong gave way to his natural chinese in-
stinct for gossip and began with interest to
tell what he knew

there is an old kashgar tea-
merchant here who has just come
from peking one evening the old
merchant yolban khan strolled in the im-
perial city just outside the walls of the
forbidden city he became confused in a
certain district where the streets are small
and found himself in a narrow alley beside
the wall of a magistrates garden the place
must have been very beautiful within judg-
ing from what he could see in the twilight
through a small lattice but scarcely had
he put his eyes to the opening for a better
glimpse than the face of a woman appeared
on the inner side he looked long at her
for she was handsome

   go away old man she said to yol-
ban khan it is not you i want 

  vong laid aside his water-pipe and took
one of gilbertsons russian cigarettes
that is why he resumed gesturing

significantly toward the part of the inn
where the newcomers were quartered
that is why yolban khan knows of this
woman

  well go on urged gilbertson you
chinese are maddening tale-tellers it takes
you so long to get to the meat of the thing

  yolban khan continued vong smiling
but not in the least hurrying went on a
few paces but so great was the womans
beauty that his footsteps lagged and yol-
ban khan is an old man he had not gone
far when the narrow street seemed to be
filled of a sudden with a big sedan chair and
a knot of coolies out of the chair bound-
ed a young man who first looked in through
the lattice where the old man had gazed
and then ran to a gate that opened for him

  yolban khan heard the voices of the
young man and the woman beyond the
wall and rejoiced in the boldness of youth
that thus with a fiery spirit defied the con-
fucian law of love-making but at that
moment came still a greater knot of men
who grappled with the coolies and silenced
them some went through the gate and
there followed cries and shrieks from the
woman these ended and the men came
out carrying the woman and leading the
young man there was the look of death
on the womans face but she had ceased to
cry out they closed the gate in the wall
and carried the woman away swiftly

  long after she was gone the young man
stared after her struggling with his captors
yolban khan regretted his age which pre-
vented him from striking and slaying in re-
sponse to the call for blood that gleamed in
the young mans eyes but they led him
away too-the young man-who sank list-
lessly into the sedan chair as the chair
passed yolban khan crouching close
against the wall the old man gave a start
and rubbed his eyes to make sure he was
not mistaken for he saw that the young
mans official cap-button was of the im-
perial yellow

  yolban khan is not unaccustomed to the
life of the imperial capital he knew the
captors of the young man to be eunuchs
from the imperial household because of the
garments they wore one of the eunuchs
spoke to the old man sharply but yolban
khan was able to excuse his presence the
eunuch thinking no doubt to overcome the
old countryman with awe at his part in the
adventure whispered to him


adventure

   you see-the one in the chair he is
the young emperor

  yolban khan believed for there have
been many tales of the young emperors
escapades by night away from the forbid-
den city he is the emperor yet he is the
plaything of the old buddha-the em-
press dowager she does what she will
with him he is her slave

  but why should she have interfered with
the young emperors love-making

  vong shrugged his shoulders

  yolban khan says the womans father
was banished by imperial decree on the day
following very likely the old buddha
feared an intrigue with the young em-
peror

  this is all you know of the story

  this is all master there is nothing
more

  gilbertson watched the little caravan get
under way in the dawn he saw the sad-
eyed woman come from the cheerless inn
and mount the waiting camel

  by gilbertsons side in the throng of sta-
blemen and inn-loafers stood the man called
yolban khan kashgar tea-merchant and
as the woman settled herself to the seat
her eyes rested upon him for a moment in
a glance that lengthened into a stare
speaking almost as if in a dream she mur-
mured

  go away old man it is not you i
want

ii

at nightfall on the twenty-
sixth day in the desert gilbertson
sat on the crest of a great hill of
sand and watched vong the coolie and the
camel-driver who were digging feverishly
at the foot of the dune the three men took
turns at the digging and the one who now
wielded the shovel stood waist-deep in the
hasty excavation

  any sign yet gilbertson shouted

  vong coming up to be relieved scram-
bled to the top of the dune holding out a
handful of moist sand gilbertson felt of
it with satisfaction but vong looked hol-
low-eyed disappointment

  we must dig very deep he said shak-
ing his head

  gilbertson surveyed the limitless reaches
of sand-crests stretching away to every
point on the horizon they were almost
mountainous here-the highest that had

been encountered-gathering into great east
and west ridges like mountain-chains at
intervals of little over a mile sometimes
as on thisjlast day the steep slopes of these
ridges had made it almost impossible for
the camels to cross their progress had
been scarcely a dozen miles since sunrise

  vong gazed too at the sand sea darken-
ing under the slow twilight and then looked
at gilbertson in a silent reproach

  - it shouted gilbertson when his

eyes rested once more on those of the chi-
nese dont look at me that way you
give me the willies

  vong slid down the sand-slope without a
word and stood eagerly over the edge of
the deepening hole

  as he watched the three below him gil-
bertson felt that they were discussing him
there was a manner of hostility in the cov-
ert glances they cast upward toward him
as they spoke

  a wind blew more coldly upon him there
at the crest of the dune and he shivered at
the thought that tonight there would be no
fire in camp they had passed the last out-
posts of the dead tamarisk trees that linger
far into the desert-age-old tombed senti-
nels of the period when the sand-waste was
watered and fertile

  the diggers head was out of sight now
and gilbertson scrambled down to share in
the toil crumbling walls made it neces-
sary to widen the opening of the pit and the
digging went on with painful slowness

  the sand thrown up from the bottom still
was moist but seemed to grow no moister
last night they had been compelled to dig
eight feet before they reached water then
the mud stratum that might have been the
bed of a buried stream yielded only enough
to half fill the water-bags for the almost
exhausted camels there was nothing

  when they had been at work nearly three
hours and the pit had reached a depth of
fourteen feet they gave up the quest and
threw themselves on the sand there was
no hope that water could be reached here
by digging the desert wind shrieked bit-
terly at them with its breath of frost as
they lay panting from their disappointed
effort

  after a time they rose and with one ac-
cord went to the water-bags still unslung
from the wearied camels there was enough
for tonight but none for tomorrow the ice-
bags too carried for days from the last
the woman of the desert



outpost of fertility were almost empty
there was enough perhaps for another
days march

  one by one the men drew cupfuls of
muddy water from the pathetically limp
water-bags there still was enough for tea
to be made over the alcohol burner they
ate their evening meal in silence

   gilbertson rolled himself in his sleeping-
sack and lay down on the sand floor be-
neath his tent and for a time listened to
the low voices of his men trying vainly to
make out the trend of their earnest collo-
quy it was easy enough to guess and the
realization of it made him pull his revolver
from its holster and look at its chambers
he had anticipated some such crisis and
was prepared for it

  vong came into the tent without apology
for intruding upon his masters privacy-
something he had never done before gil-
bertson slipped out of his sleeping-bag and
the two confronted each other squatting on
their heels under the low canopy

  tomorrow we go back announced
vong

   gilbertson laughed a very dry and mirth-
less laugh

  go back youre crazy the only
thing we can do is to go on

  no water muttered vong sullenly

  there may be water tomorrow-we
must find it we cant be more than two
days from the keriya river and then
therell be plenty of it

  but vong only shook his head

  the coolie and the camel-driver-they
will not go further they will go back

  gilbertson pulled the revolver from its
holster and examined it meaningly

  they will not go back vong he said
in a low voice look here he continued
putting away the gun when he saw how lit-
tle effect it had upon the demeanor of the
sullen vong we havent enough food to
last until we get back and the camels
couldnt stand it theyre nearly exhaust-
ed now weve been out twenty-six days
and every desert-traveler since marco polo
agrees that its only a thirty-day trip we
can hold out for two or three days more
even without water and were sure to find
plenty of it by digging when were nearer
the river theres nothing for it but to go
on vong

  water-no water was all vong would
say in reply

  and gilbertson turned from him in dis-
gust these chinese were children when it
came to anything like a crisis demanding
hardship and fortitude against known dan-
ger

  when vong had gone gilbertson drew out
the worn volume of marco polos travels
that had been the inspiration of his venture
into the desert if there had been anything
like inspiration for it he turned to the
passage in the immortal work that tells of
the great desert of lop

  even to handle the volume was a refresh-
ing assurance true the ser marco had
not crossed this part of the desert but des-
erts were much alike what was true of
polos desert of lop would be sufficient-
ly true here there were many who crossed
the takla-makan he would by no means
be the first though the route was little
known and much feared

  one could not go wrong knowing the di-
rection and possessing the strength gilbert-
son thought in four days more five at the
most he should reach the southern edge of
the desert the goal of his expedition kho-
tan was the city from which he hoped to
make his explorations into the sand-buried
habitations of dead centuries

  gilbertson was an adventurer who looked
to adventure as its own reward and its only
aim if he discovered a buried city it would
not be to enrich archeology or geography
he was not greatly interested in filling the
smithsonian institution with new treasures
he was interested only in finding diversion
for yoland gilbertson who claimed no home
but the world at large and who was bound
by no ties save those of the universal kin-
ship

  it was this vagueness of purpose and ut-
ter absence of serious intent that had
prompted him to leave harvard in the midst
of his work for a masters degree and sail
for europe on a cattle-boat

  a personal interest but no particular
purpose had led him to spend weeks in the
slums and among the docks of liverpool
stevensons adventures with a donkey
strangely enough had inspired him to a
mendicant jaunt through germany and
france living as he put it on the staff of
the universal brotherhood what impulse
had led him to mexico he never was able
to say definitely but the spy duty he un-
dertook for a certain revolutionist general
had its climax in front of a gray adobe wall


adventure

at daybreak in the mexican capital with
an attache of the american embassy dash-
ing up to the executioners squad just in
time to halt an unnecessarily violent flight
of mauser bullets

  various parts of south america had
claimed him briefly and to no particular
purpose save once to assist united states
army officers in cleaning up a fever dis-
trict for this he was nearly rewarded with
death from the disease he fought in al-
aska he had found gold but resigned it to
a woman whose crippled father held a bar-
ren claim next to it the woman had wanted
to marry him but he had no such notion
-never had such an idea at any time in his
life-so he went to a place as near as pos-
sible the antipodes

  it was not surprising that finding him-
self in shanghai and without funds he
should have offered to sell pills for an amer-
ican patent-medicine company the man-
ager of the concern sent him forth in the
middle of the cholera and dysentery season
to canvass the villages of tie flat reeking
yangtze basin

  gilbertson came back in a few weeks with
a creditable knowledge of chinese an un-
impaired constitution and tremendous prof-
its from the pills under the influence of
his oratory on street corners and in temple
yards the natives had bought his wares for
all ills these marvelous pellets would cure
anything strangely they did seem to work
miracles the lame and the halt and the
disease - stricken had seemed to become
whole under the foreign magic-pills

  on his next excursion gilbertson was sent
further afield he tired of the re of heal-
er and finding himself in the remote west-
ern provinces of china determined to desert
his employers and march away over the
deserts and mountains of central asia along
the route of the great marco polo and on
to the almost obliterated threshold of the
back door of europe

  gilbertson put away the volume of mar-
co polo blew out the candle and fingering
the holster of his revolver to give himself a
greater feeling of security composed him-
self for sleep

his hands were pinioned as in vises
when he came to a sudden startled
awakening his three companions
stood over him threateningly and vong was
unstrapping the holster of the revolver

   gilbertson struggled vainly then ceased
 they let him up and all four scrambled from
 the tent outside they stood silently de-
 fiantly under the cold desert stars with the
 sand-murmuring blasts of the great waste
 shrieking through them

  we go now-back to the last water-
hole announced vong triumphantly
then one man goes on with the strongest
camel for more food-more camels

  you can go and be- to you gil-
bertson snarled at them ill stay ill
keep going the other way-south you
yellow vermin a thousand curses on all
your ancestors

   gilbertsonsl rage and impotence gave
him a sort of giddy feeling the air seemed
full of lights and noises he wondered if
he were becoming suddenly ill then he
thought of the evil spirits with which su-
perstitious natives people the desert and
laughed until his voice stirred disturbing
echoes

   a passage from the book of marco polo
seemed to stand out before his eyes
sometimes stray travelers will hear as it
were the tramp and hum of a great caval-
cade of people away from the real line of
road and taking this to be their own com-
pany they will follow the sound and when
day breaks they find that a cheat has been
put on them and that they are in an ill
plight even in the daytime one hears
those spirits talking and sometimes you
shall hear the sound of a variety of musical
instruments and still more commonly the
sound of drums hence in making this
journey tis customary for all travelers to

keep close together-

   gilbertson laughed again in a voice that
 caused his companions to glance at one an-
 other with a curious significance then he
 went into the tent wrapped himself into
 his sleeping-bag and tossed in a feverish
 slumber until daybreak

   his companions were gone he found as
 he left the tent so were all but one of the
 camels-the poorest of the lot-and this
 one gazing with a patient yearning in the
 direction his fellows had taken food
 enough to last three or four days had been
 left for him and a small cake of ice he
 marveled at this human justice of the sand-
 sea mutineers

   for an hour gilbertson hesitated over
which course to take should he acknowl-
edge himself beaten and set out to follow
the woman of the desert



 his companions or should he push on into
 the unknown

   the devil spirits of the desert of course
were about him whispering to be off-to
follow them into the waste in the end he
yielded and went their way southward
climbing laboriously up the slopes of the
great sand ranges and at every crest strug-
gling against new disappointment at the
unchanging character of the landscape he
must walk now leading the camel for the
poor beast weakened by his long fast was
sufficiently burdened with the meager camp
equipment

  through the long day gilbertson stag-
gered and when night came he found him-
self too weary for digging half the pre-
cious ice went for his tea and when he had
eaten he slept in a stupor of exhaustion

  before dawn he was awake and had se-
lected a low gully between two towering
dunes for his digging he found then that
his companions had taken the only spade
so he was compelled to sacrifice the alcohol-
burner for conversion into a rude scoop he
began an agony of labor that lasted for
hours with only bitterness and exhaustion
for reward the sand at six feet showed
but a slight trace of moisture

   a sort of calm resignation succeeded the
first panic of disappointment gilbertson
was able to whistle a few bars of the latest
popular song that had been going the rounds
of the shanghai music-halls before he left
on this trip but the whistling only aggra-
vated his thirst he approached the silent
wistful camel and looked into the beasts
hopeless eyes

   not much longer for this world are you
old boy gilbertson could not help saying
aloud

   the sound of his voice so many hours si-
lent startled him a faint echo came from
the sand-dunes and he looked up half ex-
pecting to glimpse somewhere another hu-
man the mute sand-crests stretching in
endless confusion rebuked his thought

   it was with difficulty that he got the
camel to his feet the beast seemed to have
given up the fight his vitality was gone
he soon would be a part of the inanimate
void about him

   gilbertson pitied the animal and would
have given him the brotherly caress a man
gives his horse had not a leering curl of the
lips warned him the camel probably would
maintain his attitude of vicious repugnance

toward humans even in the shadow of
death those foul teeth must still keep the
two from the intimate companionship of
common danger

  they swayed slowly through the track-
less sand animate derelicts mutually repug-
nant but mutually dependent for life itself
the gray sky seemed to creep down upon
them and the wind seemed to mock
them with its spiteful buffetings of drifted
sand

  gilbertson had let his watch nm down
but he had little need of it his eyes were
for the needle of his compass and for a sign
of relief in the still unchanging southern
horizon time was of no consequence for
him space was the only dimension water
the only element that mattered

  toward the middle of the afternoon the
camel faltered near the top of a dune steep-
er than any they had encountered before
and slid feebly backward into the gully
with a moan of infinite melancholy he
stretched his gaunt neck along the sand and
lay still though gilbertson beat and kick-
ed at him then spoke to him softly in the
words of turkoman camel-drivers the beast
would not respond

   gilbertson lay down in the sand his face
on his arms and tried to think it had al-
ways been his theory that the mind is
stronger than the body the mind must
find a way where the body could not

  he reviewed the course of the whole ex-
pedition counted over the number of days
they had been on the march the estimated
number of miles traveled he went over in
mind all the road lore of the desert that he
had picked up in the city at the edge of the
sand-sea and reasoned that the sum of it
could not have led him astray truly un-
less the compass was wrong or the earth
altered or the sun and stars changed in
their courses he must if he kept on come
to the southern edge of the desert to go
back-well that was impossible now he
must go on as long as his strength held
out that was the only solution he must
go on

  strength seemed to fill him-the strength
of desperation he sprang up fumbled
feverishly among the camp equipment on
the fallen camel for the small quantity of
food he must take and the remainder of the
ice it required tremendous force of will to
keep from consuming the whole of the piti-
fully small lump of frozen treasure in a


adventure

single orgy of gratification but he crunched
only a little

  gilbertson did not look back at the dying
camel as he reached the crest of the dune
and slid down into the opposite gully his
haste was too great he was devoid of sen-
timent he had neither pity nor remem-
brance nor any emotion there was noth-
ing in his mind save the compelling desire
to consume the one dimension that was of
any consequence there was but one goal
one aim in life one thing of value-water

  he was not conscious of sand-hills or of
suns presently the stars were out but he
did not seem aware of it he kept on
toiling panting reeling through the night

  this could not continue endlessly he
faltered at last near the top of a steep dune
as the camel had done and fell back sliding
helplessly to the bottom he tried again
but exhaustion overcame him in the at-
tempt and he did not rise from the gully
this time but remained sprawling face up-
ward to the stars then he slept

  the sun and his thirst awoke him he
did not seem to feel the cold though in it
was the chill of frost dazedly he felt for
the ice and in a delirium of haste crunched
the last of his small treasure when he saw
that it was gone a sober fear overcame him
he reviled himself for having eaten it and
threw himself down with his face in the
sand there was almost childishness in the
petulance of his grief

  but the precious liquid had given new
life to his blood and restored some of his
strength he ate something and began to
stumble on ever southward

  at nightfall his thirst was agonizing his
lips were parched and his tongue swollen
he was hungry but he could not eat food
choked him he could not swallow

  he began digging at the bottom of a gully
in the intervals of utter exhaustion and
sleep that overcame him at times he con-
tinued digging through the night at dawn
he had made a hole six feet deep the
sand was moist but he knew that to find
water it would be necessary to go many
feet deeper

  sitting on the edge of his dry water-hole
a thought came to him suddenly and made
him rage hoarsely at the sky why had he
not drunk the blood of the dying camel

  then he ceased his shrieking at the sky
and wondered if he were going mad

  he decided to die peacefully respectably

and looked about him for a sand-crest that
would be a fitting monument when he
had chosen one he climbed to the top of it
and disinterestedly surveyed the sand-sea

  afterward it seemed to him that he had
gazed for some time at an object below him
on the southern slope of the dune before he
realized in the least what it was he was
aware that it was a dead camel long before
he perceived the significance of it then
dully the thought came to him that it was
his own camel and that he had made his
way back to it through some sickening error
in the compass or in his reading of the stars

  but when he had rolled nearer to the ob-
ject he saw that it was not his camel the
wind had driven the stench of it away from
him during the night but could not protect
him now he was nauseated and his illness
for a time robbed him of the strength to
crawl away

  the sun shone full in his eyes yet there
seemed to him to be a great grayness over
everything through this grayness he
gazed at a bit of curious silver inlay in the
saddle of the fallen camel and managed to
crawl close to it in a childish fit of curiosity

  his reward was the ghastly discovery that
behind the camels body was that of a man
-unmistakably the chinese official of kho-
tan who had gone into the desert with his
peking concubine in the dead hands was
clutched a carbine the muzzle of which now
was poked impotently into the sand across
the mans face was dried a streak of blood

  in gilbertsons eyes the grayness in -
creased and then became utter darkness

ill

in the outlaw village nestling
along fertile banks of an out-crop-
ping of the desert-buried river there
had been tremendous excitement all morn-
ing the foreign man the wild-camel hunt-
ers had brought in yesterday was ajive
again and the chinese woman whose hus-
band they had shot and afterward robbed
sat by the mans side talking in a strange
language she had ceased to cry out for
death when she saw him and now wept
gently as she talked

  the language gilbertson and the chinese
woman spoke was german she had ad-
dressed him in german because he was a
foreigner and that was the language she had
learned when her father was on foreign
the woman of the desert



service for the old empress he was able
to reply in german with what knowledge he
had gained of it in his vagabondage though
each would have understood the other bet-
ter in mandarin

  what is this place asked gilbertson
weakly when she had somewhat dried her
tears

  it has no name answered the woman
the people are outlaws-they dare not
leave the desert

  how did they happen to find me-by
the way what happened to you two out
there pointing to the desert

  they shot him she shuddered my
camel ran away with me but they caught
him and brought me here the a mb an was
not killed but fired at them from behind his
camel until they left they are great cow-
ards the chief when he heard of it made
them return the amban was dead then
and they found you there almost dead too
what will they do with us

  the old chief is sick he fears death
perhaps if you give him medicine he will let
you go

  what will become of you

  the foreign gentleman knows what will
become of me-he knows well

  her look of graven resignation disturbed
him

  you mean you will become a slave to
one of them

  the woman nodded and fixed her eyes on
the dirt floor of the hut

  a group of villagers who had stood open-
mouthed about the pile of matting upon
which gilbertson lay were thrust aside by
a man who appeared to be one in author-
ity he was a tall powerful mongol with
keen intelligent eyes clearly he was not
of the inferior breed of turkoman camel-
hunters about him

  zahid beg the chief he said to gil-
bertson in the kansu dialect desires your
attendance can you walk or must you be
carried

  i think i had better be carried into his
royal presence replied gilbertson though
there was no such levity in his tone as in
his words

  they picked him up and in a few paces
set him down in a hut larger than the others
before the emaciated form of an old man

  medicine demanded the sick man in a
dialect that had to be translated give
me medicine



  gilbertson well knew that to the heathen
all white men are doctors he had no
medicine save half a dozen capsules of qui-
nine and a handful of the despised pills he
had sold consciencelessly for all known ills
and all unknown still he thought it
might be well to experiment with the old
man gratitude perhaps would give him
his freedom from what otherwise might be
perpetual servitude

  what is the reward if i make you well
he asked of the old chief

  the mongol muttered hoarsely and drew
the edge of his hand across his throat

  if you do not- he threatened savagely

  but the old chief looked more kindly upon
the captive

  cure me he said and you shall have
what you ask a garden a house a wife-
though of women there are few you shall
choose from among them

  the promise did not give gilbertson great
satisfaction but he thought he saw in it
some advantage with all the impressive-
ness he could muster he took the old mans
pulse looked into his eyes examined his
tongue moved his arms up and down as if
in first aid for the drowning-and then drew
forth the pills rolling one into his palm
he muttered over it solemnly the opening
lines of virgils eneid and then popped it
into the old mans mouth

  with greater assurance even than the
haughty mongol chang ssu-yeh gilbert-
son disdained the carriers who had brought
him into the hut and strode forth to his own

  for three days the village paid homage
to him though chang scowled over it he
ate of the fat of the oasis each day he
went with pomp and circumstance to the
chiefs hut and administered a pill on the
third day the chief arose walked from the
hut and announced himself not only cured
but refilled with the fires of youth

  what a testimonial thought gilbertson
this would be for the pill company if he
could but work it up into ad copy

  the zahid begs first official act was to
proclaim a public banquet in honor of the
great medicine man at this banquet gil-
bertson was plied with so much honor it
wearied him the climax came when the
old chief announced gilbertsons reward for
raising him from a sick bed

  the honorable pill-doctor said the
beg shall have one of the finest melon
gardens he shall dwell among us forever


adventure

as our brother and he shall be a headman
of the village for his wife he shall take
the woman from the desert who comes also
from distant peoples and knows his man-
ner of speech i have said-so must it be

  there were only two at the banquet-
board who did not join in the uproar of ap-
plause they were gilbertson and chang
ssu-yeh gilbertson did not notice changs
glowering silence for he was too busy with
anxious solicitude over himself neverthe-
less with chang for interpreter he made
dignified response and accepted the chiefs
generosity it was impossible to do less

  in three days the old chief announced
further would the nuptials take place on
the morrow a house would be built to shel-
ter the bride in the meantime to respect
the proprieties the woman from the desert
would be housed with the chiefs own fam-
ily let there be great rejoicing and a gen-
eral holiday

  gilbertson strode away from the ruins of
the feast to refresh himself with air and with
contemplation he still was too much of a
curiosity to go unaccompanied by a trail of
urchins and dogs but he had lived in the
east long enough to become accustomed to
finding his needed solitude in entire indiffer-
ence to encompassing crowds of the curious

  he strolled through the straggling village
farther than he had gone before and was
surprised to see the extent of ruined struc-
tures half covered with sand that spoke
eloquently of buried generations from his
knowledge of the sand-smothered cities of
the desert and the fabulous stories told of
the romance and the richness of them gil-
bertson recognized in this extensive reach
of ruin what probably was a city of many
thousand inhabitants the treacherous and
inconstant river probably had shifted its
stream to another bed and left the city to
the fate of parching winds and drifting sands
now it was back again and feeding this col-
ony of outlaws into renewed semblance of
the city it once destroyed

  desiccated timbers impossible to say how
old protruded from the sand-the gaunt
skeletons of houses there were excavations
among many of the ruins showing how the
present inhabitants had made effort to learn
the secret and reap the abandoned spoil of
the dead city

  there were two persons loitering among
the buried houses gilbertson discovered
other than the collection of children and

himself following him at some distance
was chang ssu-yeh and in advance of him
unaware yet of his presence was the chi-
nese woman of the desert he caught up
with her and when she had overcome the
cultivated shyness of all chinese women in
the presence of men he told her the old
chiefs decree

  at first she looked at him incredulously
with black eyes round and wide in surprise
then a pink flush spread under the delicate
olive of her skin and her eyes dropped with
her averted face

  pretty tough for you isnt it he said
speaking in the classical language with
words that expressed as nearly as possible
the terseness of the anglo-saxon

  she looked up quickly with an apprehen-
sive expression her features more mobile
by far than those of any other chinese
woman he had known registered plainly a
growing alarm with a start he understood
and returned rather evasively her gaze that
was filled now with more than doubt-a
gaze full of the tragic resignation that
marks the life and entombs the hopes of the
orients women

  she thought

  the white man does not wish to marry
me but i wish to marry him he is bet-
ter than these camel-drivers i must kill
myself if he does not

  he thought

  by all the gods buddha the woman
wouldnt mind marrying me she doesnt
like the idea of tying up with one of these
dirty camel thieves for life but i cant
marry her it would be something of an
adventure but i couldnt have a flock of
little half-breeds trailing around at my
heels

  as they continued to gaze into each
others eyes she was thinking with a bitter-
ness of heart

  he will not marry me i am a yellow
woman to him he does not know that i
am proud too like all chinese women
and i am better than chinese-i am man-
chu my people would say it is a disgrace
for me to marry a white man besides i
am not beautiful like the foreign women
he could not love me

  but this is what he was thinking

  she is a beautiful woman i have been
too long away from women she makes my
heart beat faster why not if i knew
whether we could escape-
the woman of the desert



  the woman heard the sound of footsteps
in the yielding sand and turned her head so
that the jade pendants from her ears swung
sharply against her cheeks she saw chang
ssu-yeh standing near them in the group of
staring urchins gilbertson looked toward
him without welcome

  chang scattered the urchins out of hear-
ing distance and came nearer

  we can escape he confided to them
how asked gilbertson troubled by
the expression of the womans eyes

  there must be gifts and silks for the
wedding and we have nothing here i go
for it the wedding must wait the old
chief has said it is only six days to the
great caravan route

  are you going alone

  two men go with me the camels will
halt beyond the first great ridge of dunes
and wait until midnight you must come
to us there-you and the woman

  but they will follow us are you well
armed

  there are guns here but only a little
ammunition the chief has it and guards
it as his life he will give me enough for
safety but the woman must bring the rest
she must find it besides we shall take
the best of the camels chang ssu-yeh will
see to that

  the three stood expectantly silent
  tomorrow asked gilbertson
  tomorrow

  gilbertson found it easier to decide if he
looked away from the fear in the womans
face

  it would be best to take a chance he
thought she will be safe in any event
the woman with clearer penetration of
motive than the man was thinking

  i am lost the mongol desires me and
will take me yet i must go since the white
man wills it perhaps if i yield the mon-
gol will not kill-

  and chang behind the yellowed-bronze
mask of his immobile features thought sim-
ply this

  it will be easy to cut the fool of a white
mans throat as he sleeps

iv

gilbertson and the woman
stumbled through the frozen gravel-
paths leading to the first rows of
sand-dunes pausing at intervals to look

back breathlessly to see if they were pur-
sued it had seemed a forlorn hope this
escape so closely were they under the sur-
veillance of the curious villagers with whom
they lodged gilbertson had not found it
easy to slip away until long after midnight
and then he could take with him little that
would be of service on a long trip through
the winter desert

  for the woman it was still less easy and
she came pitifully unprepared for the jour-
ney yet clutching fearfully in her wide
sleeves a collection of cartridge-boxes that
it had been her assigned task to find she
would not let him relieve her of the burden
so gilbertson put his arm about her slen-
der shoulders as the best means of assisting
her she looked up at him startled when
she felt the pressure of the arm then lost
her shyness in a breathless laugh she
seemed to be developing new characteristics
- becoming a new creature - here in the
wild freedom of the desert wastes

  they had reached the dunes and were
picking their way carefully eastward from
the top of each sand-eminence gilbertson
looked for the light that should guide them
to the waiting caravan

  for an hour they toiled on the womans
weary feet lagging and demanding frequent
rest she seemed to lean with more confi-
dence now upon his arm and with a great-
er abandon he was keenly conscious of it
too and it gave him a sense of proprietor-
ship commingled with a certain aggressive
protective feeling less easy to name he
looked down upon the knob of smooth
black hair that came just to his shoulder
and now and then rested wearily but ca-
ressingly against it

  perhaps he was a fool to be leaving the
desert oasis for leaving there meant leav-
ing her of course though she was going with
him in the desert village it would not
have been impossible-the old chiefs vision
of a house a garden and in the midst of it
the woman of mystery from the desert but
out in the wide world-well one must al-
ways be thinking of going home some time
for the remainder of ones days and one
can not go home with a chinese wife and
if he have a conscience he can not leave the
chinese wife-and the children

  there had been many women in gilbert-
sons life but they had been as ships that
pass in the night he had boasted of his
lack of susceptibility so there was little


adventure

excuse for him when as they saw the cara-
van light at last from the top of a sand-
dune he kissed the chinese woman on the
lips and held her in an embrace to which
she yielded wonderingly

  gilbertson discovered that a kiss elimi-
nates a womans creed race and color and
leaves only sex the spontaneity of his ac-
tion and the warmth of her response dis-
turbed him and he stood away from her
almost coldly a dozen paces away he saw
chang who had come out impatiently to
meet them chang had watched them there
on the summit of the dune outlined against
a cold moon and his lips framed unuttered
mongol oaths

  the camels went swaying into the night
and far into the day there was no pur-
suit apparently the villagers robbed of
their only successful means of combating
the fugitives had been content to swallow
their rage the pill-doctor was lost to
them with his magic pellets lack of which
might permit an early grave to enfold the
superstitious old chief

  at midday the camels were halted for a
brief rest and then urged onward wearily
till night the men found water by dig-
ging and gilbertson saw that his old course
would have brought him to safety if he
could have held out

  the woman came to him as chang made
camp and in a voice that had fear and elo-
quence gave him warning

  you will be careful my master she
said he will kill you

  nonsense - chang laughed gilbert-
son

  but she put a finger on her lips and looked
a sorrowful rebuke

  why should he kill me asked gilbert-
son more soberly all he wants is zahid
begs wedding-money and the camels and
an undisputed trail into mongolia

  the woman looked at him pityingly tem-
pering her impatience with fear

  chang interrupted them and though gil-
bertson would not admit the thought of
treachery on the part of the mongol it was
easy to imagine the existence of a sinister
regard in the mans eyes

  chang said something to the woman in a
dialect gilbertson did not understand and
she walked away with him to gilbertson
there was something in her attitude that
suggested the cowering of a frightened child
under a blow

  he turned away and strode a few paces
into the desert a cold wind blew across
the tops of the dunes and eddied into the
gullies with mournful soughing there was
a thick haze over the horizon and only a
few stars near the zenith were visible the
blackness of the night was oppressive the
sound of the wind gave creepy suggestion
of those evil spirits of old ser marco calling
the unwary to destruction in the great
waste

  of a sudden gilbertson recalled that he
was totally unarmed he had not even a
knife he would not permit himself to fear
attack by the mongol yet he knew it was
folly for him to remain without means of
defense some weapon was necessary if
not for his own security at least for that
of the woman among the camp utensils
he had seen a beautiful sharp-pointed knife
one that might have been used for the flay-
ing of wild camels of this knife he resolved
to possess himself

  gilbertson made his appearance some-
what tardily at the meager evening meal
he gulped his tea and munched dried melon-
rinds with a sort of nervous self-conscious-
ness that grew out of his furtive alertness
for a chance to purloin the coveted knife
it was there among the camp utensils
gleaming dully in the light of the fire the
intensity of his desire for it had grown until
the knife seemed to him now the most de-
sired object in the world

  when chang at the close of the meal
picked up the knife and casually slipped it
into his belt gilbertson could have shouted
with rage then a feeling of the utmost
chagrin was succeeded by a sense of grow-
ing indifference that bordered upon reck-
lessness he startled his companions by
laughing harshly as he had done on that
previous occasion in the desert when he
found himself in the hands of a similarly
callous fate

  he went to a sheltered gully to windward
of camp where the drifted sand was soft
and deep and wrapped himself in his sleep-
ing-bag what was the use of battling with
fate if the mongol meant to kill him he
would do it no doubt what chance had
he against a man armed with a gun and a
knife perhaps he might wrest one or the
other from him in personal encounter but
could he single-handed hope to disarm the
man completely

  his mind hesitated a moment over the
the woman of the desert



possibility of stealing upon the mongol as
he slept then dismissed the thought
chang had boasted of the fact that he slept
with his eyes half-open

  strangely enough gilbertson slept as a
child sleeps

chang lay in the lee of a camel
for warmth the vileness of camel-
odor being in no sense a deterrent
to his hardened sensibilities he fingered
the knife at his belt and opening the cham-
ber of the revolver saw that it was filled
with cartridges he placed no great reli-
ance in such affairs as this upon the gun
in fact he had always looked with a good
deal of suspicion upon this invention of the
foreign devil

  the knife-that was the thing

  tucking the revolver into the folds of his
outer garment he felt once more the keen
edge of the blade then slipped it again into
his belt lying back into the sand waiting
the woman was becoming too fond of the
foreigner he could see that in her eyes
it was better that it should end at once
there would be one less mouth to feed and
there was not too much food to last until
they could get more

  the woman under her tiny tent of skins
lay in an icy trembling she had resolved
to sacrifice herself for the man-no uncom-
mon thing in a land whose literature and
tradition are most richly adorned by the
heroic sacrifices of women but one never-
theless to cause this one to tremble it was
the sort of sacrifice hundreds of thousands
of women have made in the east to the call
of filial piety

  the womans trembling ceased when she
rose and stole softly from the tent a sil-
ver crescent of moon etched dim outlines
into the desolate landscape she made out
the forms of the camels and went toward
them very slowly fearful even of the wraith
of shadow that followed her

  in the lee of the first camel lay the man
to whom she must give herself in an effort
to disarm him of that weapon which other-
wise would slay the foreigner the white
man-this was all that caused her to hesi-
tate for she had no fear for herself-might
not understand he might abandon her
even kill her for what she was about to do

  these foreigners she knew had strange
ideas concerning the value of a womans
bodily purity thus success might mean

disaster equally as great as failure yet she
was determined to possess herself of that
weapon about which all life now seemed to
revolve

  the woman knelt swiftly at the side of
the sleeping mongol shudderingly she pre-
pared to waken him with a caress of aban-
donment she saw the gleam of his eyes
through thin slits between his eyelids and
wondered if he were awake but his breath-
ing was regular he was asleep-asleep with
his eyes open as he had so often boasted

  her hesitation gave time for a discovery
that startled her heart into a wild crescendo
from an opening in his cotton-padded outer
garment protruded the butt of the revolver

  with the movement of a cat poised for
recoil she touched it closed her fingers
about it and keeping her eyes upon his
face slowly pulled it forth primitive in-
stinct almost overpowered her rage welled
up within her breast as if in compensation
for her previous fear consciousness of
power made her exult in a desire to kill to
be revenged

  she knew nothing of guns but undoubt-
edly could shoot him as he lay yet she
stole away triumphantly lightly her soul
in a transport of exultation it was a tri-
umph no less keen than if she had made
her sacrifice having desired and dared the
sacrifice hers must still be the credit in her
own soul

  it is the mans place to kill she mut-
tered to herself as she stumbled through the
sand carrying the weapon to gilbertson

  but her knees suddenly became unsteady
the beating of her heart oppressive she
must rest awhile under the rude tent of
skins she held the gun to her cheek and
trembled once more with weakness and fear

  chang dreaming of his native mongol
village with wild flowers blooming in the
wide pastures and the chinese woman of
the desert by his side in the doorway of an
adobe hut awoke suddenly and cursed him-
self for having slept it seemed to him in
his dream that the chinese woman had
drawn a knife from his belt and thrust it
feebly against his breast he reached for
the knife now that he was awake and was
reassured by the touch of the cold blade

  he had not intended to sleep there
must be no sleep for him until the white
man was out of the way perhaps this
would be the best time why wait any
longer


adventure

  chang rose from the foul warmth of the
camels bed and looked toward the gully
where gilbertson lay he had no thought
of the distrusted revolver but kept his hand
caressingly upon the handle of the knife

  gilbertson awoke with a premonition so
clear and ghastly it left no doubt in his
mind as to the intent of the dark figure
that bent menacingly over him with a
stifled cry he sprang as the mongols knife
fell and spoiled the aim of the blow

  all the strength he could command was
centered in a convulsive lurch toward
changs feet he grappled them and tug-
ged with such a tempestuous fury that the
mongol reeled and fell heavily backward
the sleeping-blanket hampered the white
mans efforts to get to his feet and the
mongol was up before him

  the great weight of the mans body
lunging fiercely at gilbertson carried him
helplessly into the sand but he grasped the
hand that held the knife and holding it to
his mouth tore savagely at the tendons of
the wrist with his teeth no sound of agony
came from the mongol but taking the knife
into his left hand he plunged it swiftly sure-
ly into the white mans side

  the woman in her tent heard nothing
save the wind that shrieked like an endless
troupe of demons over the crests of sand
when she had regained her strength she
went out toward the gully where gilbert-
son lay she was in time to see the pitiful
struggle that ended in a moan from the
white man and a quivering into helpless re-
laxation

  as chang stood up over his victim a
leer of barbaric satisfaction curling his ups
the woman confronted him she could not
have told how she managed it but in her
hands the gun spoke shaking the solitude
of the desert before the mongol fell she
shot again and then standing over his
quiet form she made the gun blaze vivid
paths of flame into his body until its cham-
ber was empty and only successive empty
clicks answered the movement of her fin-
ger on the trigger

v

vong found them there in the early
forenoon the woman in a ghastly
hysteria the camel-drivers helpless
with terror and gilbertson moaning in his
blood beside the body of the mongol

  the great caravan of which vong was a
member halted there all day and camped
there at night though it was far from a
water-hole there were chinese officials
wearing insignia of the court at peking in
the caravan and a guard of soldiers from
hami the officials looked upon it as a
miracle that the woman of whom they had
come in search should have been found
thus they weighed secretly in anticipa-
tion the gold of their reward the sur-
prise had been accented by the discovery
three days before of a dead camel and be-
side it the ambons rotting corpse

  to vong the discovery of gilbertson was
no less a surprise after encountering five
days previously gilbertsons dead ship of
the desert and his camp outfit half buried
in drifted sand

  delirium came to gilbertson before he
understood the cause of his deliverance and
the delirium continued over the slow desert
marches that brought him on an improvised
stretcher carried by camel-drivers into the
city of khotan the mission-doctor treated
him there and the verdict was slow recovery

   to the house of the missionary when gil-
bertson regained consciousness came the
woman of the desert they looked into
each others eyes in silence for a long time
before speaking even when they spoke it
was not to make clearer their understand-
ing

  this is a wonderful woman thought
gilbertson beautiful courageous a wo-
man to whom life would be the least of all
sacrifices for the man she loved if she
were only white i would marry her

  i thought i loved the young emperor
was what ran through the womans mind
but this white man is the one who is mas-
ter of my soul i would willingly give up
the life of luxury to which i am recalled in
the emperors household for this wandering
foreigner he will not marry me but i
would be content as his slave his plaything
yet he is too honorable according to the
foolish standards they call morals in his
country to have me for a mistress-or per-
haps too wise since it would be dishonor
to him

   her soul was very full of a great sickness
but the smile that played upon her face was
the studied smile of the stoic east that so
skilfully conceals the ills of the soul when
she spoke it was only to say

  tomorrow o honorable one the caravan
the camp-fire



returns across the desert i am going
back to peking to become the young em-
perors third wife i do not wish to go
stay here then was what impulse urged
him to say but his spoken rejoinder was
has your father regained the confidence
of the old buddha then

  she nodded

  he has become a viceroy

  there seemed to be nothing more to say
yet she sat there a long time silent before
she went away

  when she was gone gilbertson projected
himself into a new delirium by leaping from
the bed to go in search of the woman-to
hold her to keep her to beg her to stay
the half-healed wound opened anew and
the mission doctor looked upon him with a
somber countenance

  the delirium went away and gilbertsons

mind became clear again vong came and
bent over him gilbertson remembered the
perdition to which he had consigned vong
on the desert march and marveled at the
mans fidelity vong could have taken gil-
bertsons silver but he had not instead
he had brought it from the pack on the
dead camel it was all there every ounce

 have you had any word from the little
 wife asked gilbertson kindly

 she has another son smiled the inter-
 preter

 after an interval closing his eyes gil-
 bertson asked in a faint voice-

the woman vong-where is she

gone

how long vong

 five days

 gilbertson turned his face to the wall
 and cursed his conventional western soul

the camp-fire

ameeting-place for
readers writers and
adventurers

arroll k michener with his
first story in our magazine follows our
custom and stands up to introduce himself

  there is nothing more stimulating to the imagina-
tion than to stand at the great gates of peking and
watch the camel caravans filing in with their silent
shuffling tread ending a journey that may have
brought them from the very center of the continent
what endless stretches of desert sands they have
traversed what solitudes what cities what moun-
tains and valleysl they stir up untold images of
the people and places beyond the great wall
through which they have passed not long since in
their descent from the mongol mountains to the
fertile plains of china

tt was such a caravan as one of these dust-
grimed wearied shuffling in through the great
south gate of the tartar city of peking that was the
inspiration of my story the woman of the des-
ert and into the story i put a bit of the per-
sonality of a real man a friend one of the truest
adventurers living and a bit of the life he has lived
it is not his story the story of the man and the
woman in the desert but the web of it is spun from
yam raveled for me from his adventures sitting
through long hot nights in a newspaper office in
shanghai

  i have never crossed a desert but desert lore has
always had a fascination for me i shall cross a
desert before i die or the fates are unkind they
were unkind once when they laid me low with a
far eastern fever while i contemplated a fleeting
opportunity to cross asia by unbeaten paths from
the pacific to the mediterranean but i do not cher-
ish it against the fates with whom it is well for an
adventurer to be on good terms

jdut though i have not crossed a desert in fact
i have passed through all the waste places in
the eastern hemisphere with the greatest of the ex-
plorers of these my favorite companion of the
travel-books has been the incomparable sven hedin
the greater part of whose lifetime has been spent in
trekking through the unknown or little-known re-
gions of asia from him and from my friend the
adventurer-who really is a pill-seller in darkest
asia-i have borrowed whatever there is of desert
lore in the woman of the desert the custom
of carrying ice in a blanket through the deserts will
not seem strange to those who are familiar with
sven hedin-nor will a thousand strange things con-
cerning the peoples and places of remote asia that
might have been borrowed into the tale

tm a little shy of speaking about myself so
even though the camp-fire offers an incom-
parable opportunity im going to be brief im a
	adventure

newspaper man who has haunted the newspaper
offices of many cities in the united states my only
real claim to capital adventure however is having
worked my way around the world as a newspaper
writer picking up a job wherever i landed broke
and staying until i had enough to move on i went
leisurely stopping when it pleased me to stop long
and the journey took three and a half years ha-
waii claimed me for many months then japan but
china held me longest i loathed the country when
i first set foot in it but learned to love it-and
stayed a year 

ld-time members of the camp-fire
will be glad to know that at this writ-
ing the last report from montevideo uru-
guay on our old friend captain fritz du-
quesne states that he was merely severely
wounded in his expeditions fight with hos-
tile indians near the bolivian border of the
argentine not killed as was first cabled
from buenos aires to the newspapers here

  after several years of silence during his
former expedition up the amazon i and
others got brief word from him that after a
bad time with fever he was again all right
and was soon to sail for this country but
on the eve of departure came the chance to
command the bolivian expedition and he
couldnt resist the last report says he was
found by troops somewhere along the pilco-
mayo river which divides paraguay from
the argentine after a fight in which his
party were victorious

so many new readers of adventure
have joined our ranks of late that it
would seem the part of good-fellowship for
all of us old members of the camp-fire to
stand up in our places and welcome them
with a friendly greeting we all come to-
gether here as comrades with a common in-
terest in the strong wholesome things of
life and those who are new among us should
be made to feel as much at home as if they
had always been of our number so many
new readers of adventure have joined us re-
cently - the six months ending with the
march issue showed an increase of forty per
cent and the present six months from all
indications are bringing us a still greater
number-that it seems up to us of the old
guard to extend to them in a body our
hearty greetings and friendly welcome

come time ago f m muhlig county
 superintendent of schools for will
county illinois wrote to me suggesting
that it would make excellent reading if the
magazine could get the full story of the

gang from pinchers creek i wrote
mr muhlig hoping he himself could give us
the tale but he had not the time for this
he did however hastily jot down the story
in brief for me to pass on to the camp-
fire how many of you know about it it
would seem as mr muhlig says too worthy
for oblivion

  received your reply to my inquiry as to the story
of the gang from pinchers creek hope you
can get it from some one posted i can not tell it
but the gang consisted of three men who en-
listed from pinchers creek which is in alberta
they came from montana to canada they pro-
claimed frankly to the world and the british
army in particular that they were from pinchers
creek

  their abilities as horsemen and their plains ex-
perience made them invaluable as scouts as they
were inseparable they scouted together

u pon one of their scouts they discovered the
approach of a large body of boers who were
heading for a pass which if occupied would have
formed a fatal ciu de sac for a hundred or more brit-
ish who had been detached from the main force
there was no lime to rush for reinforcements or to
warn the endangered british there was but one
thing to do-delay the boers until the british had
passed through the neck of the trap

  without hesitation they did this the british
came through without molestation but a search
party found the gang from pinchers creek lying
dead among the rocks where their heroic stand was
made the ground was dotted with empty shells
the three cartridge-belts were found by the side of
one man who was evidently the last one alive
every cartridge had been fired the bodies were
riddled with rifle balls it was ascertained that at
least thirty boers died there

the account of this was read in genera orders
to the men of the british army and i have
heard that a monument was erected where they fell
some old scout who served with baden-powell
will remember the reading of the orders the inci-
dent is too worthy for oblivion-f m muhlig

dy way of introduction from m f

    brooks concerning his story in this
issue

  old wade and measles are real characters with
whom i have for years been associated in trips in
the mountains and valleys of california i have put
in years in death valley and the mojave desert
and i try to introduce into each story locations
and details that are real and descriptive of this
remarkable territory so little known to the people
generally	

to the red-heads the gray-heads
american foreign legion highland
brigade and the other similar regiments
has been added the suggestion of a musi-
cians regiment by r s edmiston of the
the camp-fire	

second ind band miss n g quitman
miss also a regiment of tropical tramps
by g g lansing  ridgewood ave
ridgewood n j who will act as temporary
organizer

  as stated previously the important point
back of all these suggestions is the plan of
naming and recruiting regiments according
to their members common ancestry tra-
ditions physical characteristics etc thus
getting value at no expense from that very
practical thing esprit de corps our present
system of designating regiments merely by
dry almost meaningless and undistinguish-
ing numbers is stupid

  i know quite well that most of these regi-
ments will not materialize unless this
country should be plunged into war the
civil and the spanish wars developed simi-
lar organizations or unless as in the case
of a few of them some one or more of you
take hold of the actual work of organizing
and push it through but all of them help a
little in the work for defense and back of
all of them is this idea of added esprit de
corps which only those unfamiliar with
military affairs will dismiss as not being ex-
tremely practical and important

this thing of truths being stranger than
fiction makes an editor a lot of trouble
frequently we reject a story because it is
unconvincing or sounds improbable
sometimes the author writes back in wrath
or glee and tells us the story is strictly based
on fact he feels he has it on us he
hasnt he has simply forgotten that a
story that is pure fiction may be so well and
so naturally told that it sounds entirely
possible while the truth may be so poorly
told that it sounds untrue or the truth
may be so unusual or amazing that no skill
in telling can make it sound true

  now what would be the good of giving
our readers true stories that sounded like
lies if a story seems utterly absurd to a
reader it does and thats all there is about
it even if it is actually true a reader sel-
dom has time chance or wish to start a
serious investigation of the magazine stories
he reads he reads passes judgment and
thats generally an end of the matter

vtow consider a story in this very issue-
yahoya as the manuscript came
to us it stated that one of the hopi indians
ran  miles in  days- miles a day

it might be true but we knew most of our
readers would think it a wild exaggeration
so with mr gregorys consent we changed
it to twenty days  miles a day-cut it
square in two yet even so some of you
may have written it down as a bad break
and wholly impossible we made similar
changes elsewhere in the tale mr
gregorys letter follows

   i agree with you in the matter of toning down the
startling matter in the endurance racing i put the
stuff in because its the truth because i believe it
because when you speak of hopi you speak of an
animal that is as different from the bahana as is a
wolf from a french poodle those lein-bodied devils
can do the thing i have told of them they were
builded for it by the desert but when all is said
and done i have given you a story and the less it
strains credulity upon non-essential points the better
it is going to pan out will you cut down the num-
ber of miles yourself or do you want me to do it

  and here are two notes that accompanied
the original manuscript

   in connection with the endurance and swiftness
of the southwestern indian the following fact well
known to thousands of white men who know these
strange people may be cited the men of oraibi
will run out across the hot desert sands a distance of
 miles do a days work there in their corn-fields
and run back the same day to oraibi

   see also george wharton jamess the indians
of the painted desert p  one oraibi ku-wa-
wen-ti-wa ran from oraibi to moenkopi thence to
walpi and back to oraibi a distance of over 
miles in one day 

here is a pungent little acrostic for

surest way to spell peace prepare else
america cant exist

who knows whether any concessions
have been granted in respect to
these two south american lakes reported
to contain a vast treasure

daytona fla

   as a mining engineer and more or less an adven-
turer i read with special interest the stories of lost
treasures of the world i was particularly struck
with the physical conditions described in the case
of the treasure of iozo de donto and also the sa-
cred lake of the chibchas

j have had occasion more than once in an-
other part of the world to desire to lift the
wash containing tin and gold from the bottom of
a swamp or small lake such as is described in the
cases above i could not afford much money for
lant and few men were available and wages very
igh i thought the matter out and tried many
experiments and at last arrived at a solution of the


adventure

difficulty i got out the tin all right and it cost
me very little more than mining under more favor-
able conditions the method was noveland neither
before or since have i seen it adopted it would be
the ideal method to employ in the case of these
treasure lakes and is thoroughly applicable to them
if the rough description given is even approximately
correct

an you tell me if any concession is held over
either or both these lakes at the present time
and if so how can i get in touch with the owners
i would iike to suggest to those interested for a
consideration of course if my methods were adopt-
ed a certain and cheap method of solving the dif-
ficulty

  if they are not so held i should like to know for
in that case i should go and look over the ground
and if they are as described then form an adven-
ture party adopt my dodge and-prove if those
 are really awaiting the adventurer-
r purdue 

ty camp-fire custom roy p church-
ill rises and introduces himself on the
occasion of the first story he gives us

  a lot of the people in the united states have no
idea at all or at least a very limited one of the
navy they know we have one but what the ships
do and how the men live is a closed book to them
my excuse for pestering the editors with navy
stories is to tell about the navy and let some of the
people on the outside know how the boys on the
inside live and love and play and fight

t enlisted from an inland town in kentucky

  to be exact as a landsman for training and was
paid off with a big ticket as a boatswains mate
the experiences i had and the yarns i heard form
the basis for the stories some of my shipmates in
the south atlantic may recognize themselves or
their friends and i wonder if somebody will pick up
this copy of adventure and remember the forty-day
trip the windjammer alliance made from hampton
roads to plymouth

  the idea for hereditary evidence came from
an experience while on furlough and a train wreck in
california where i now live i thought it would
be unusual and interesting thus to combine the land
and sea	

publishing a story laid  years
ago is something new for this magazine
personally i like stories of the past but i
realized many of you do not and when mr
bishop then a stranger to me came in to
talk over in advance in the grip of the
minotaur laid about  b c i sort of
shied away from it also i feared he and
dr brodeur knew too much about arche-
ology and ancient history to write a fiction
tale without spoiling its story with too much
lugged-in information

  but i took a chance and im glad i did
i dont think any one can accuse the authors
of parading the knowledge they undoubt-

edly have or of failing to say their say sim-
ply and clearly its a mans story told by
men and to me at least its a very real
world its characters move in

as to cretes wonderfully developed
civilization in that distant day i think
you will find the storys local color true and
in accord with the latest findings of scien-
tific investigation and theory any of
you who can visit the famous cretan col-
lection in the metropolitan museum of
art in this city can verify quite a good
deal of it

  in accordance with camp-fire custom
here is a word of introduction from mr
bishop speaking for both authors inci-
dentally it was written when mr bishop
was enlisting in the first armored motor
battery n g n y a pioneer in that
branch of national preparedness

   in reply to your letter asking for the titles of the
scientific books dr brodeur and myself have
written i would beg to state that there aint no sich
animiles to be sure dr brodeur has translated
the younger edda into english for the scandi-
navian-american society i have written panama
past and present the story of the submarine
and several magazine articles on the panama canal
both of us have had a long training in historical re-
search and a perverted taste for digging up queer
things out of the past

past and present like east and west have the
same fascinating resemblances and differences
whatever times and places you visit there is a
certain village in england where men have been
chipping flints since the old stone age first for
spear-heads then for striking fire then for flint-
locks enough of which were traded into africa to
keep half a dozen aged flint-nappers busy down
to the outbreak of the great war then the whole
village went back to the old trade for many soldiers
in the trenches are lighting their cigarettes with
flint and steel grant lit his cigars that way in the
civil war instead of matches compared to that
what is a little thing like sanitary plumbing in
 b c

the story of atlantis was first set down by he-
rodotus the father of history whom the
egyptian priests told of the vanished glories of a
great island in the midst of the sea from which
ships traded with egypt till the island disappeared
beneath the waves to the greeks of herodotuss
time about  b c the sea meant the great ocean
beyond the pillars of hercules so they placed the
lost island there but to the egyptians of a thou-
sand years before the sea meant the mediterranean
we know that there existed on the island of crete
in the midst of the eastern end of that sea a great
maritime civilization which traded with egypt for
many centuries and came to an abrupt and catastro-
phic end about  or  b c what is more
natural than the growth of a legend during the next
the camp-fire	

thousand years in which the cessation of all news
from the island was explained by its disappearance
beneath the sea

  this theory was first advanced in an unsigned
letter to a london newspaper in  and is now
accepted by many scholars though we must wait
for more evidence before we can say that it is either
proved or disproved it is the simplest and most
plausible solution of the atlantis mystery and calls
for no such tremendous convulsion of nature as the
submergence of a large island or small continent
trying to account for the disappearance of atlantis
is in the present state of our knowledge exactly
like trying to account for the disappearance of the
crew of the marie cilesle

tn ascribing the fall of knossos to raiders

  from the north dr brodeur and i were simply
plot-building my partner knows his norsemen
-he reads sagas in the original icelandic and could
work his passage on a viking ship-and he was
searching for some spot untouched by rider hag-
gard for his heroes to raid when i mentioned
minoan crete that was too early for vikings but
not for the peaceful but by no means pacifist traders
who preceded them

  as for our own adventures we havent had any
both of us have led mild and peaceful middle-class
lives we roomed together at harvard

here is an interesting chapter from an
adventurers life-a look-in for stay-
at-homes at the kind of things that are
happening away from the dull lines of rou-
tine in settled communities

  i am not a writer by all means but a reader of
your magazine ever since i came to the states will
quote briefly bom in the highlands of bavaria
germany southern part in  went to sea at
the age of  years and you can take it from me i
had experiences and adventures of all sorts will
recount some ofthem possibly to you later saw
in your camp-fire an article asking about informa-
tion concerning how your magazine was obtained
in out-of-the-way places if interesting to you will
recount it by the way tell you this only to keep
my mind busy and away from my present plight
as i am down to my last dollar again well here
she goes

tt must have been in  or  that while
wandering down south street i chanced upon
an old shipmate of mine same was mate or
rather second mate and acting bosun on a handy
little three-sticker a fore-and-after decided to
join him on the trip we were bound to west in-
dies and central american ports with a general
cargo outward bound nothing happened the
vessel had very good qualities a fast sailer and the
skipper an exceptionally hard driver there were
only three men in the forecastle myself included

mow owing to harsh and unjust treatment re-
ceived from the hands of german sailors dur-
ing three years of apprenticeship i simply never
can take to any of them kindly but one of these
seemed to be excepted he came from the north-
ern part of germany somewhere up in pomerania
he was of good family and seemed to be an alto-

gether different fellow from the rest that i had to
deal with before to make my yam shorter we be-
came good mates always recounting stories and
happenings from the old country

  he was pretty green as far as seamanship was
concerned never having been on any sailing vessel
but i helped him out whenever possible and he soon
was doing very well indeed in fact too well as
all of a sudden he fell victim to that terrible sick-
ness called swelled-head and became quite a person-
age but he never said boo when it came to reef-
ing or making fast topsails in a squall after his
first attack i left him all to himself and even re-
pulsed his later advances as i now classed him with
the rest of the roundheads

aati came to puerto cortez spanish hondu-
ras christmas evening the old man ad-
vanced us a couple of dollars we rowed ashore to
celebrate in a dive run by a frenchman we got
hilarious and you know how it is when you have a
grudge against some one sooner or later it will out
and wine in a tropical country sets you simply boil-
ing dont know if it was a girl of that dive started
us off or what come to think now it was some
brown venus he claimed that she favored him
better than me and we fools spent our  a mile a
minute just to please her and got thrown out
when we were broke

  outside we renewed the argument he being a
strong young man and i much smaller in propor-
tion he thought to do away quickly with me but
he found out different i found i had to finish him
quickly and accordingly put all my strength and
energy in the assault and attacked him with a feroc-
ity that he had not expected his style was that
of the wrestler mine both wrestling and boxing

ttow mind at the time the country down there
was in a revolutionary state and martial law
was pronounced in puerto cortez when i laid him
out with a right-arm-swing to the jaw my senses
cleared and i thought i had killed the man i did
not have much time to find out either as a bunch
of native soldiers laid hold of me and we went in
the direction of the main part of the town then
realization came quick and all the remorseful
thoughts of my action with it i decided to escape
if possible

  how i got away and how i got back to the ves-
sel and away again and how i had to hide from the
soldiers in the swamps never before penetrated by
white men alone would take a book to tell i real-
ly dont know today how long i hid but found my-
self fever-crazed one morning on the beach about
thirty miles from port i was literally cut to pieces
my whole body was swollen as mosquitoes there
abound in real clouds what a blessing that salt-
water bath was to me when i dragged myself on all
fours down to the waters edge you can not
imagine unless you have experienced something like it
yourself

t-tow i got along and acquainted myself with
some of the natives would make interesting
reading to come back to my subject way out in
the swamps i lived unknown to any outside of a
chinaman and one black fellow he was a deform-
ed hercules the most hideous being you could
imagine he supplied me every month with food
from the town we both were partners in the


adventure

swamps where we gained a precarious existence by
burning blue mango wood and making charcoal al-
most any woman in that country uses same also
gathering palm-kernels stealing and marauding
upon plantations only fruits which the negro then
sold in puerto cortez to traders and in the public
market never did get much more out of it than
my grub as he usually came home drunk half of
the goods lost or stolen and in a very bad frame of
mind on those occasions had to defend myself for
life at times

  went almost crazy with the heat then the rainy
weather arrived and i got spells of fever again the
only medicine i had was a grass which grows there
of a sour taste has very long leaves and is used to
make tea for those stricken with fever

qme day during grants absence he called
himself grant i decided to do something-
get some books at least as i could endure it no long-
er to lay in our mannaka shack day and night-
think and think got out to the beach we were
camped some miles away in the forest swamp and
made my way along the same slowly came across
some natives same are mostly mixed breeds in-
dians blacks spanish and chinese who gave me
a willing ride in their canoe for the day they
camped at night somewhere along the beach and
next morning i left them to make my way by boat
as they told me there was a ranch run by an amer-
ican not far distant when i got there i asked for
reading matter and especially for my old friend ad-
venture imagine my chagrin when i could not get
a single copy of the same

ntowi have told you my yam i dont know if you
like same its somewhat arduous and incom-
plete and not what you asked for only the reverse
i went out for magazines in my mind especially
the adventure in the foreground and got very much
disappointed how i fared after i left the ranch
is still another story too long to recount at present
if you care to hear some more at another time and
are able to read my bad english i am always at
your disposition for the present i am yours-

the patriots military creed

t believe in peace but in peace with honor and
  self-respect

t believe that war is a terrible thing that
should be avoided if possible but i also believe
that there are things in this world worse than war
and peace without honor and self-respect is one of
them

j believe in what the flag of my country
stands for-honor justice truth civilization
democracy liberty humanity

t believe it the duty of every american to up-
hold the flag and what it stands for and i be-
lieve it the duty of every able-bodied american
to prepare himself in a military way for this re-
sponsibility

t believe in personal preparedness by which
i mean if i am ever needed to defend my sis-
ter my mother my home and my country i will
be prepared to do so

t believe in national preparedness by whicfi
i mean my country being prepared to up-
hold what the flag stands for and to defend itself if
attacked

t believe that citizenship carries with it ob-
ligations as well as privileges and i believe
that military service is one of the most important
of these obligations

t believe in the benefits of military train-
ing i believe that it strengthens the body
benefits the health improves the mind and teaches
obedience respect for law and order patriotism
courtesy honor loyalty manliness cleanliness
thoroughness system organization and team-work
in short i believe in military training because it
makes for efficiency and better citizenship

heres an old friend we havent heard
from for two years and he reports
something that will be of particular inter-
est to those of you who knew the old west
the omitted part of his letter was devoted
to roasting one of our recent novelettes
but knocks like boosts we try to keep out of
camp - fire the indian words mr
huston speaks of were referred as he sug-
gested to mr c l gilman but the latter
claims little knowledge of the ojibway lan-

camp in the mountains back of st helena calif

                                  jan is 

   still here just knocked wood but getting older
and weaker a ten-mile line of twenty traps is
hard for me now but the spirit is yet strong

   itjis snowing like-where there is no snow my

stove smokes as does my lantern and the green
pelts stink like well there is no comparison they
simply stink however my colt comes up unlooses
the tent-flap and tries to come in a dozen times in
the twenty-four hours then my dog preempts my
bed and i squat on my heels like a gugu

cince i wrote you two years ago i have lost
the sight of one eye and have to shoot wholly
right-handed now  is that spelt o k
and by the way o k is ar an or am two
indian words meaning quite so precisely
sure all right get gilman to look this up
among the jibways near him but i think its osage

  i hope the author does not make a mess of bill

knew him before his death he was with berdans
sharpshooters with my cousin california joe joe
huston both damyanks but hikox was the
younger man

njow here is a tip for you a few years ago i
walked a beat for the --and one of the offi-
cers of the same was a man i had seen and known
slightly in missouroh years ago i recognized
him and he me but neither said anything then
when i quit he gave me the high sign and promised
me rapid advancement etc if i would stay but i
did not like the yaps and squareheads he had on his
rolls

a year or so later his wife shot him killed him
 and told who he was but very few believed
that what she charged was the truth yet it was
gods own solemn truth i do not know the story
but have an inkling after crittenden pardoned
him for shooting jesse james and he was shot and
reported killed he recovered and knowing he was a
marked man he came to california and as a reward
for guarding otis was started in business yes
bob ford and no other sure of course im sure
i know and evans or sontag or any of the daltons
yet alive could verify it if they would

the camp-fire

the camp-fire flings on high its cheerful glow
and bums a golden cavern in the night
around whose walls the shadows come and gq
projected by the ever-changing light

and here are gathered from die bounds of earth
the men who for the weaker blaze the trail
brothers in everything excepting birth

  whose footprints mark advancements outer pale

and now a voice is heard from out the gloom-
another comes the company to grace-

closer they gather then to make him room
and give to him a comfortable place

what though his face they neer have seen before

   most welcome is he made to all their cheer
regardless of the name or rank he bore

  he is a man or he would not be here

what brings them here none seems to know or
    care

they are the restless-footed ones of earth
hardship they face and countless dangers dare

   and hold their lives as things of little worth

but now the fire has sunk to glowing coals

  and through the branches stars begin to beam

as each within his blankets snugly rolls

   sleep comes to all and silence reigns supreme

tit ere is an interesting suggestion for a
general brotherhood of adventurers
and ex-adventurers of course the adven-
turers club with its various chapters is al-
ready in the field but perhaps there is need
and place for a more general order if such
a society were started it should not i think
use the word camp-fire not only be-
cause our camp-fire already exists but be-
cause if it were definitely organized with
badges bearing the name the proposed
brotherhood would by many be considered
merely a circulation scheme for this mag-
azine also there is a local organization
in new york city called the camp-fire


adventure

club having no connection with this mag-
azine

  if the idea appeals to you write to mr
garvey and talk it over it looks to me like
a splendid idea

  the other night whilst sitting in my room pon-
dering over an old number of adventure i began
to wonder how many more lonely souls there were
that night whose thoughts ran like mine on what
might have been and what had been of men who
write in the camp-fire and men who are more or
less eaten up by the wanderlust and who have seen
both sides of life the more i studied over this
thought the more i became convinced that many
such men who are now unknown to each other
could by some symbol be made aware of the
kindred nature of the other and probably find enjoy-
ment and solace in each others company

then arose the thought why not a brother-
hood of some description possibly an order
of the camp-fire with a specified emblem and
members that pledge themselves to obey the rules
which should be such that any man and i mean a
puin could live up to

 i sincerely believe that some such order might
prove beneficial in many ways to some of the boys
who must forever search new ways and trails and i
believe if such a thing should be born that its
emblems would be seen in all phases of life in all
countries before very long

  thats only my idea if you think its at all
feasible put it up to the bunch and find out what
they think about it

  i believe we could soon have a very strong order
of men who would find it possible to help each other
in many many ways-jno j garvey the cross-
ing rooms  main st akron 

a nd here from another man then in
    mexico comes the same suggestion

  it has been over a year since i have bothered you
with a letter so i believe i am entitled to another
chance

  i must tell you of an incident which happened in
mexico some time ago i was riding pretty fast for
the nearest town i could find as i had been out of
grub for a day and a half and i was a hungry hombre
my horse stepped into a dog-hole breaking his leg
i shot the poor devil and started to foot it still
toward town as my stomach was about ready to
sue me for non-support before i started i had
cached my saddle and pack the best i could

t had been walking about two hours when i
saw the smoke of an engine i headed that
way and found it was a freight i flagged it down
walked to the caboose and took a good american
sassing for being a good-for-nothing cow-puncher
bumming a ride anyway this said hombre invited
me into the caboose cooked me up one meal and
then another one he and two mexicans were the
crew after he had seen me putting that grub away
he said he would take that back about me being
good for nothing as i sure could eat

  we both rolled a cigarette when i saw a copy
of adventure under the bench i asked him who it

belonged to he said he had been reading it ever
since it first came out i showed him my identifica-
tion-card then we shook hands we were brothers
of the camp-fire i told him about my saddle and
pack he stopped the train while the greasers got
it for me

hthere is where the idea hit me why not
organize the camp-fire make it a body of
its own can you imagine what the two of us meet-
ing in such a strange manner had to talk about
why the camp-fire of course think it over old
timer

  he and i stayed together for one week in arizona
i had two letters from him but the last time i
wrote the letter was returned unopened i am try-
ing to find out his whereabouts

j stayed around the state of arizona for a
while then went over into new mexico was
in columbus three days before the villa raid i
tried to get back in time to see the willard-moran
fight but couldnt make it im back home now
taking in the big sights i ran across adventure in
many strange places i will tell you maybe some
time again as this is enough for another year

  hoping you will think over what i said regarding
camp-fire-id
