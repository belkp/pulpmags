the dictator

by holman day

       author of  the forty-ninth talesman  the red lane   etc

       here is a man who takes a crowd of young rowdies from the streets and
    builds up a naval militia with them-the best trained and most efficient
    organization of the kind on the atlantic coast under his leadership other
    battles than those of the sword and gun have to be fought it is a story
    of politics as well as preparedness

a book-length novel-complete

chapter i

shortly after four oclock in
the afternoon the coast artillery
band played the first number of
its promenade concert program
the concert was complimentary to
governor rutillus thornton he was
officially inspecting his state troops
who had been ordered by the war de-
partment to join the regulars in war-
game maneuvers by naval and land
forces in the military district contig-
uous to the states chief city

  society was claiming that afternoon
as its own several hundred automo-
biles trailed the governors party from
the city to the parade ground of fort
caldwell hundreds of motor cars were
there ahead of the party the angu-
larities of grim war were well hidden
by frills and furbelows

  groups of girls were pyramided on
the heaps of old cannon balls which
marked off the grassy slopes the obso-
lete ornamental rodman smoothbores
pitted by erosion and decay served as
ib p

perches for maidens who preened their
summer fine feathers like peacocks and
chattered as interminably as sparrows
the service khaki of the regulars and
the red-striped dress uniforms of the
state troops eddied among these islets
of fluff and finery polychromatic

  beyond the turfed ramparts the sea
swung lazily a blue expanse touched by
flashing spangles of sunlight now and
then above the mellow phrasing of the
bands strains a bugle sounded its call
of the days routine brusquely and
businesslike

  however the bugle in spite of its
curt call to duty fitted the occasion-
seemed to blend

  governor thornton most distinctly
did not blend his figure was a dis-
cordant blot in the panoramic whole
his personality jarred on the scene
even as it jarred most of the sensitive
souls with which it came in contact
he limped from the automobile to-
ward the official marquee a dusty
flapping frock coat humped over his
haunches and sagged in front the


the popular magazine

nap of his silk hat was scruffed in a
style to suggest his nickname in poli-
tics men called him the old ouill-
pig he was old the lines in his face
were deep grooves which crossed his
cheeks and were lost in the bristling
beard but he was tall and broad and
brawny and in spite of his limp he
walked off with vigor

  the marquee was crowded with wait-
ing ladies a samovar puffed odorous
whiffs of brewing tea and charming
girls were arranging cups and spoons
and the adjuncts of a formal afternoon
function-all held in abeyance until the
arrival of the guest of honor

  if governor thornton knew they
were waiting he did not allow that fact
to hurry him he took his own time
in his triumphal progress toward the
marquee he swung to right and to
left and shook hands-always with
men he looked over the heads of
smiling ladies he disregarded salutes
by uniformed men he sought those
whose appearance suggested that they
were prominent citizens he knew
many of them and called them by name
there was a veneer of amiability over
his harsh tones every now and then
he pulled a man to one side and whis-
pered his uniformed staff hitched
along at his heels trying to keep step
and failing they too were plainly
of the prominent-citizen type-they
were not soldiers they tried to look
important and soldierly-they only suc-
ceeded in looking self-conscious and
bored

  behind them came the ladies of the
party unescorted by their squires who
were obliged to march in formal lines
because the governors visit was official
they were surveyed coolly by the wait-
ing ranks of city grand dames in most
cases the uniformed knights who sur-
rounded the governor had been ap-
pointed for political reasons-their
wives were not in society strictly
speaking nor was his excellencys
wife according to information whis-
pered by mrs j corey smuddon to
her house guest mrs esterson peters
from new york

  she was a milliner or dressmaker
or something-his second wife she
was sixteen when they were married
and he was an old man then but he
was a millionaire timberland owner
and that accounts for it the girl in
mauve-their daughter

 very pretty commented mrs
peters

  for the type yes personally i do
not care for that combination of blue
eyes and such intensely black hair its
too celtic i am told that the mothers
name was murphy or obrien or some-
thing of the sort

  socially ambitious of course

  i suppose so considering the money
and all the rest but the daughter is
not at all known in the younger set
she has been educated out of the
state

  the girl whom they were discussing
was unperturbed by the staring eyes of
the throng a chauffeur came to her
leading a leaping and frantic boston
terrier on a leash

  he jumped about in the car until
i was afraid he would break his neck
miss thornton he reported i cant
manage him

  she took the leash and quieted the
animal several guard officers on the
side lines surveyed the terrier with
something like envy

  your governor-with all due re-
spect-seems to be a rather gross sort
of a creature declared mrs peters

  nobody in the state wanted him
to be governor-corey says nobody
wanted him

  then why was he chosen

  it was-was politics of some sort
i dont understand politics-and corey
declares he doesnt either corey says
that the governor wants to be reelected
this year

  i should judge so agreed mrs
peters dryly he is shaking hands
with everybody

  but of course the voters will not
make another mistake-even if it is
politics corey says they will not
but mr smuddon is shaking hands
with him this moment
the dictator



  oh thats merely politics do you
care for their tea

  it seems to be rather crowded and
common in that tent

  lets go back to the car i brought
a thermos bottle

  governor thornton did not take tea
when he arrived at last in the shade
of the marquee two pretty girls came
to him one with a cup steaming and
brimming on a salver the other with
cakes they gently forced their way
through the circle of men who were
listening to his excellencys scraping
tones

  again let me repeat gentlemen
as for me i dont need any help i
shall be renominated i shall be re-
elected

  perspiration trickled down the
grooves of his cheeks and he took off
his silk hat and scrubbed his forehead
with his forearm dust from his coat
streaked his face the pretty girls
submissive and as silent as slaves in the
presence of royalty tendered their sal-
vers but he did not lower his gaze to
consider what they offered

  only political lunkheads believe dif-
ferently but remember men that i
cant continue my business administra-
tion if i have a council that wont back
me up every legislative district in this
state must see to it that the right men
are sent to the house and senate i
want men who will elect the right chaps
for my councilors who will give me
safe men for state officers who will
then go to work and handle legislation
in the interests of the people and the
party dont let the opposition land a
pack of darned fools on my shoulders
one of the pretty girls gasped and
held her tray higher in order that she
might fulfill her duty and escape the
steam from the cup caressed the gov-
ernors dripping face

  take it away he snapped hot
tea on a day like this bring me ice
water

  she fled vhe saw the other girl and
grasped her arm in order to arrest her
flight for she had turned to escape

  just a minute sissy i can take
care of a few of these cakes he

scooped up a big fistful now if they
have ice cream you run and fetch me
a good big slice thats a nice girl

  munching an eclair he continued

  im looking into all the legislative
districts hunting for the growls and the
grouches i reckon that this bull wras-
sle here-he flapped his hand to indi-
cate the forts and the tented field-
will bring in a lot of the boys from all
parts of the state thats why i am
down here i dont know anything
about war-even a play war like this
one its a waste of time effort and
money as i view it from a business
mans standpoint but no matter let
em play i want to say that i have
established headquarters in the city at
the holland house while this thing is
going on and i call on every party
worker to come to me there thanks
sissy

  he snatched the plate of ice cream
and began to eat it was soft in the
humid heat under the marquee from
the spoon driblets fell on the gover-
nors vest and added to the other stains
on the expanse of fabric

  thats where the fight is coming
gentlemen we must have control of
the house and senate i dont pro-
pose to sit and twiddle my thumbs for
the next two years with a majority
against me

  the band began a march in spirited
style and his excellency scowled

  its a poor place to talk sense-in
the midst of all this foolishness im
glad to meet so many here to-day
come yourselves and bring the work-
ers to my rooms at the hotel-to-night
-to-morrow-any time i trust you
are all with me-members of the
party

  many in the crowd of men waved
their hands at him to signify allegiance
the music drowned their voices

  an elderly man in uniform pressed
through the ranks of the clustered poli-
ticians he was the chief of staff for
the governor the adjutant general
warren wade a former captain of
volunteers in the civil war he sa-
luted

  the ladies and officers of the staff


the popular magazine

are ready in the receiving line your
excellency

  i understood that this was an in-
spection not a reception stated the
governor he exhibited resentment

  the committee has requested a brief
reception

  i cant bother with it let the
ladies of the party and the officers at-
tend to the social folderols ill attend
to the inspection at once

  the inspection is timed for dress
parade your excellency

  and that is when theyre all lined
up out yonder in that field i suppose
and that cursed band banging away
ill do my kind of inspecting right now
do you know the captains of com-
panies in our militia

  yes sir

  the governor linked his arm into
that of the adjutant general and
dragged him away

  i hope you know their politics
wade he said when they had left
listening ears behind them take me
around and introduce me to the boys
of our party this is a devilish good
opportunity and i want to make the
most of it the captains ought to be
able to do some good work among their
men here and after they get home
the veteran sagged back on the gov-
ernors arm his resentment showed in
his sullen countenance and blinking
eyes

  i want em to carry the gospel
wade we can cover a lot of ground
with these boys

  i hate to see politics taken into the
guard muttered the general

  theyre voters arent they i dont
ask em to parade around their districts
in their uniforms

  with all due respect governor i
honestly believe its poor policy to bring
up politics at camp it is mixing in
something which doesnt belong here
just now you are here as commander
in chief to talk politics to the men is

-is-

  well what is it demanded the
governor sharply

  its taking advantage of your posi-
tion

  im glad i have a position from
which i can gain advantage wade his
excellency declared with vigor the
other gang would like to have the same
advantage you are merely playing
war down here but my politics is the
real thing

  they passed headquarters on their
way into the company streets general
wade removed his cap when they
crossed the line before the colors gov-
ernor thornton did not bare his head
he was energetically censuring his ad-
jutant general for lack of political en-
thusiasm

  i want you to wake up wade he
insisted remember that i appointed
you to this office youre holding

  i wasnt told that i was expected to
dabble in politics sir

  it wasnt necessary to tell you-it
goes without saying and the men who
hold office in my administration are not
expected to dabble ill have you under-
stand  they are expected to peel off
their coats and pitch in and work

  at sight of the commander in chief
an officer rose from his camp chair sa-
luted and stood at attention before his
tent

  governor thornton broke in on a
stammering and rather grudging intro-
duction by the adjutant general the in-
terruption was impatient harsh and in-
sulting 

  all right wade all right
thomas i understand captain
thomas what town eh 

  dixmont sir replied the captain
the governor pulled a memorandum
book from his pocket yes dixmont
-abel trufant chairman of town
committee when you get home
thomas you tell him you have had a
chat with me and that i have outlined
a plan by which you can grab in with
him on the legislative primaries

  captain thomas did not seem to be
overjoyed

  i am not much of a politician sir
you listen to me and ill make one
out of you

  but at that moment the captain
snapped himself around on his heels
and listened to something else
the dictator



  a bugle was sounding a staccato call
the bugler was outlined against the
sky on a hill before general headquar-
ters even a novice in military affairs
would have understood that there was
something sinister in that impatient
clarion immediately other bugles took
up the call one clamored almost in
the ear of the governor men came
leaping from their tents buttoning
blouses gathering up equipment cap-
tains frenziedly were shouting fall-in
commands to their companies the
headlong rush of one squad moving at
double-quick drove the governor stum-
bling into an alley between tents catch-
ing his toes on guy ropes his adjutant
general deserted him

  the marquee poured forth its con-
tents  most of the throng were women
in summer white in their fluttering
stampede they suggested feathers es-
caping from a rent pillow

  the adjutant general reappeared in
his excellencys range of vision the old
soldier was lugging a gun and was hop-
ping along in the rear of the company
led by captain thomas

  look here wade shouted gov-
ernor thornton what the devil does
all this larruping about mean

  general wade did not halt he was
beside himself with excitement

  attack-attack by the fleet he
squeaked breathlessly fleet has ar-
rived surprise attack

  and he acts as if he thought he
could held off the united states navy
with that gun muttered the governor
he narrowed his eyes and stared after
his chief of staff soldier silliness
it seems to be ingrowing in some men 
he limped past the deserted tents
and stood at the edge of the parade
ground and watched the crowds sweep
past on the way toward the ramparts
and the higher ground of fort cald-
well he scowled at their flushed and
excited faces and found his own firm
calmness undisturbed

  he wondered how sane folks could
work themselves into such a state of
frenzy over nothing it seemed like
nothingness to him the parade ground
was empty even the members of the

band had piled their instruments among
their chairs and had gone with the
throngs

  slowly a long black cylinder rose
over the rim of a rampart it poised
itself on steel stilts in silhouette against
the flashing blue of the sea bright as
the sunlight was the governor saw the
wicked lance of white fire dart from
the muzzle a moment later the earth
jarred under his feet and the thunder
of the great gun boomed in his ears

  he went across the parade ground
into the empty marquee and ate some
cakes and washed them down with ice
water

  on the opposite side of the highway
which bordered the government reser-
vation there was a row of wooden villas
whose fanciful design and frail struc-
ture marked them as summer cottages
from one of them emerged a gaunt old
man who looked his part even as the
summer cottage betrayed its character
by its facade his sweeping mustaches
and his narrow chin beard were frostily
white the tails of his frock coat flared
as the wind caught them he wore a
broad-brimmed hat one felt like ac-
costing him writh the title of colonel
and inquiring how were all the folks
in calina

  he crossed the highway came upon
the parade ground and limped toward
the marquee with a gait which much
resembled that of governor thornton
he saw the governor busy at his al-
fresco lunch and entered

  over the rampart other great cylin-
ders in the various batteries mercilessly
slow and precise belched and sank back
upon their concrete beds

  a damnation nuisance sah ex-
ploded the gentleman from the cottage

  youre right agreed his excellency
scratching crumbs from his beard

  i am up here from my home-home
in the south sah for my nerves-by
physicians orders

  glad to have you in our state said
his excellency cordially

  but i am not glad to be here sah
i hired that eggshell cottage across
there on account of the scenery because
i have easy access to the water-i en-


the cpopular magazine

joy deep-sea fishing it calms my
nerves and three times while i have
been fishing the howling shells from
those damnation guns have narrowly
missed me good for my nerves-
what

  why didnt you come ashore and

  i did come ashore sah i com-
plained-and a southern gentleman un-
derstands how to make his complaint
effective and i was merely told to
keep off that part of the ocean-its
reserved for target practice and now
after all those weeks of practice-
service charges sah powder wasted--
god only knows how much-cracking
plaster in my cottage-breaking dishes
-throwing down pictures from the
walls-i say after all the infernal
racket now comes this breaking more
dishes cracking all the plaster which
has not been cracked i shall go home
and report that this state is no place
for summer sojourners sah i con-
sider it my duty to do so this state
advertises widely for summer folks-
offers a home wtiat does it give
them bedlam sah

  there are plenty of other places in
our state declared his excellency
with some stiffness

  a gentleman has the right to select
his location as suits his tastes and his
convenience sah and when he has
settled he has a right to demand that
he be left undisturbed i do not con-
cede to anybody the right to tell me
where i shall reside or to disturb me
after i have settled

 however-

  the situation doesnt admit of a
however

  governor thornton was no more a
cherub in point of impatient temper
than his southern caller but he held
himself in he was governor of a
state which held out inducements to
tourists and needed the money

  i am of the same opinion as you
about this folderol he stated the
folderol had settled into awful din at
each earth-jarring and ether-rocking
discharge he teetered its money
wasted theres no sense in it we

can lick the whole world if it comes to
a pinch-and we dont need to practice
up ahead we licked the english we
licked the spanish we licked the south
and-

  i beg your pardon broke in his
caller with acerbity i am jasper
lithgow of georgia sah brevet ma-
jor late of the confederate army

  i am glad to meet you major re-
turned his excellency undisturbed my
name is thornton-im the governor
of this state

  major lithgow fixed his eyeglasses
more firmly on his nose and looked the
governor up and down with something
of the air of a man who resents an at-
tempt to hoax him this individual of
the rumpled attire seamed face and
uncouth demeanor-a straggler whom
the major had found devouring the
remnants of an official tea function he
certainly did not resemble any gover-
nors with whom the gentleman from the
south had been permitted to come in
contact but his excellency was en-
tirely oblivious in the matter of the
majors doubts probably he mistook
the others amazed silence for pertur-
bation in the presence of greatness

  what this country needs to consider
first of all sir is business we have
had our little scraps we have shown
the world what we can do when we
pull up our sleeves and double our fists
and now we ought to settle down to
business for keeps i hope you agree
with me

  theres honor to be considered
sah

  well consider it but keep on
working thats the real patriotism
the most patriotic thing a man can do
is to build up business and develop his
country a man who lets this coun-
try be pulled into a row isnt patriotic
-hes a traitor if other nations come
up to our fence and make faces best
thing to do is to turn around and keep
right on with our digging-turn our
back and keep digging

  permit me to observe sah that the
attitude might be provocative

  theyre going to think twice before
they kick us as to war-well didnt
the victjitocr



you southern fellows get your belly full
when it was going on

  major lithgow exhibited frigid in-
dignation

  i know you did insisted the gov-
ernor i took a swing down around
your way after the war was over you
had to dig out from under a scrap heap
and start all over again you have
done well-have come along fast--ill
admit that but think where youd
have been to-day if you hadnt pulled
that war onto yourselves

  the words were bad enough in their
way but the governors coarsely patro-
nizing tone wras insult infinitely worse
the major licked his trembling lips and
seemed to be groping in his soul for fit
speech

  as governor of this state i have
noted what you say about this infernal
racket im going to take the matter
up with the business organizations
such performances are calculated to
drive tourists away if you will write
a letter to me on the subject i wtill
make it public

  his excellency popped a macaroon
into his mouth and drained a glass of
water

  major lithgow was plainly uncon-
vinced as to the identity of this person
he glared with the withering gaze he
would have bestowed on a proven and
audacious impostor

  i dont blame you for not trying to
keep up a conversation here in this hul-
labaloo proceeded the governor after
he had paid his respects to a few more
cakes call on me any day this week
at the holland house glad to see you
will try to show you that this state and
the folks in it are not as crazy about
this popgun business as this crowd here
would lead you to suspect

  he was interrupted by the arrival of
a man in chauffeurs dress who came
running across the parade ground
miss thornton has sent me---
who in the devil sent you off-leav-
ing my car

 i wanted to-

  well i want to get into the city
away from this riot swing my car
around here-hiper your boots now

  his excellency gathered another
handful of the cakes and hobbled out
of the marquee

  the chauffeur brought the car leaped
down and opened the door of the ton-
neau

  i am sorry sir but the ladies-

  you can come back after the
women let em stay out here with
the rest of the fools till they get enough
of it snapped the master

  the man touched his cap

  very well governor thornton

  major lithgow watched the car out
of sight

  so he is-what he said he is well
ill be-

chapter ii

  cates colonel commanding the artil-
lery district had made his favored
guests comfortable in hammock chairs
on the terrace before general headquar-
ters the big red building shaded them

  around the range finders and the
outspread charts were grouped the staff
officers of the regular troops on station
in the district

  telegraph men were busy at their
keys transmitting the details of gun
elevation and direction to the far-dis-
tant forts on the harbors islands the
licker slowly unreeled its tape on that
terrace was the principal ganglion the
brain and nerve center of the artillery
district from there the cables radiated
every one of the hundreds of great
guns-some of them ten miles distant
-were loaded by command from that
terrace were lifted and aimed and fired
by the central intelligence men in pits
and behind parapets toiled without be-
holding the enemy

  seaward the horizon line was mel-
lowed by summers haze in that haze
crept gray shadows carefully spaced
it was the fleet

  you understand of course that this
daylight attack is more especially a
spectacular show than an engagement
in accordance with tactics explained
colonel cates to the visiting congress-
man

  exactly a bit of a show for pub-


the epocpular magazine

lie consumption agreed the congress-
man with the air of a man who knew
just what the public needed he looked
into the empty chair at his side-the
central chair of the row-a chair osten-
tatiously reserved for the tenth time
he inquired of nobody in particular
wheres the governor he ought to
be here

  we have only the sixteen-inch guns
in play at present congressman those
ships are nearly fifteen miles distant
but at that range we are registering
hits

exactly a matter of figuring eh
necessarily since we are firing
blanks said the colonel with a smile

  i dont see why thornton doesnt
get along the congressman stood up
and peered anxiously in all directions
turning his back on the sea and the
fleet

  they have not attempted to reply as
yet went on the colonel they have
the guns to cover the range of course
but it would be a tactical error to give
us reply at their distance they must
attack earth and concrete and their
shells would lack penetrative power if
fired from their present location

  he took advantage of the congress-
mans preoccupation to step across to
the chart table

  the primary battery of fort scott
will now fire he stated returning
the fleet is now making an evolution
in order to render their big guns ef-
fective as soon as they swing in
nearer we shall put in play our sec-
ondary batteries and the mortars
right you are colonel give the
folks a good show agreed the con-
gressman i wish the governor would
hurry along cant you send an orderly
or somebody  i have a few matters
i want to discuss with him i had
planned on this opportunity you un-
derstand

  the colonel dispatched a soldier

  the gray shadows followed their
leader in a huge curve which brought
them into clearer view even their spi-
dery fighting tops were revealed the
concerted roar of their broadsides came
booming in from the sea the sec-

ondary batteries of fort caldwell
joined the ear-splitting earth-jarring
chorus and the island forts went into
the game with all their vociferousness

  something like the real thing-this
is  commented colonel cates gleefully

  too blamed much like it muttered
the congressman his fingers in his ears

  better stand on tiptoe and open your
mouth suggested the colonel its a
precaution to save the eardrums

  the congressman obeyed and seemed
to feel an orators embarrassment in
finding himself on his feet before a
crowd with his mouth open and no
words issuing from it

  below in the pits toilers in overalls
were wheeling out trucks loaded with
bags of powder the big guns uprose
lazily spat and sank back and eager
hands twirled the levers of the breech-
blocks and then fed fresh powder into
the smoking apertures

  the congressman teetered on his tip-
toes his attitude became torture

  if the governor comes tell him ill
wait for him down at the marquee he
said nudging the colonel to get that
gentlemans attention this is a little
too much for me

  colonel cates went back to his task
plainly relieved because he was obliged
no longer to be nice to a gentleman who
required attention because he had a
hand in voting for army appropria-
tions

  the onlookers had disposed them-
selves variously the ladies of the gov-
ernors party had a section of terrace
to themselves but in spite of the van-
tage point it was plain that they were
not enjoying the exhibition overmuch
but the governors lady showing the
heroic spirit of a martyr remained in
the place to which she had been ush-
ered for she had been trained to obey
the mandates of committees of recep-
tion her daughter was not so amen-
able to discipline

  she wound her dogs leash around
her hand and rose

  i think i will go back to the car
mother if youll permit this noise is
hideous

  very well aileen and find out
the dictator



why wallace has not delivered our er-
rand to your father mrs thornton
was anxious and a bit querulous

  the crowds had blocked the near way
to the parade ground and the girl was
obliged to make a considerable detour
she walked along in front of the
massed populace and having left her
party passed unrecognized as the gov-
ernors daughter

  the spirit of utter perversity ani-
mated the excited dog he ran he
leaped he swung in wide arcs straining
at the leash he had conquered a mere
chauffeur that day he displayed little
respect for the decorum of his mistress

  he swept against the legs of a gen-
tleman who was intently scrutinizing
the fleet through field glasses when
miss thornton called sharp command
the dog leaped back to her and the leash
noosed the gentlemans legs she threat-
ened the culprit with her parasol and
he made another leap and then the gen-
tleman was a captive fast and sure

  he lowered his field glasses and made
amused survey of his pinioned legs
the dog stood still and blinked up ami-
ably mouth wide open and dripping
tongue lolling to one side

  then the gentlemans brown eyes full
of twinkles took note of the confused
mistress he raised his hat

  i am sorry she said he is un-
ruly she perceived that the captive
was unable to move his feet and she
was about to walk around him but he
reached for the end of the leash took
it from her gently and extricated him-
self

  i thank you she said when he had
again put her property into her hand
and i apologize for batsie

  he saw that the face under the broad
hat wore a very pretty flush and she
perceived when he lifted his hat again
that his hair was touched with gray at
the temples so they parted

  hi everybody  warned a bystander
in shrill tones up on your toes fin-
gers in your ears the mortars are
going

  the huge oval pit grassed within
with velvety green down to the granite
of the substructure yawned only a few

yards from the scene of the chance
meeting the crowd had not been tak-
ing thought of the mortars that pit
seemed as innocent as a sunken garden

  the governors daughter obeyed the
impulse suggested by the voice and fol-
lowed mechanically the movements of
the crowd about her her fingers went
to her ears-and she dropped the end
of the leash a sparrow was skimming
in spirals at the edge of the pit near the
turf the dog yelped and started in
pursuit over the rim of the pit and
around and around the grassy bowl de-
scending deeper at each turn

  good-by fido commented an ir-
reverent onlooker that mutt is
spoken for

  a hundred voices were joined in ap-
peals to the romping animal to come
out of there shrill whistles were
threaded in the uproar but the heed-
less terrier continued the pursuit

  the gentleman of the field glasses
had ventured a following look full of
respectful interest as soon as the lady
of the contretemps had passed on her
way he saw the escape of the dog
he understood the distress on her face
when rude voices predicted what would
happen to fido it was plain that he
was either a man of prompt and deter-
mined action or else was subject to the
vagaries of sudden impulse he handed
his field glasses to the nearest man in
the crowd and leaped over the rim of
the pit

  good jericho that man doesnt un-
derstand what the concussion amounts
to in that pit  gasped a bystander to
his neighbor

  he is hart marston lieutenant
commander of the state naval militia
and i reckon he does stated the other

  the frolicking dog was deep in the
pit the rescuer slid down the grass
like a venturesome ski expert grabbed
the fugitive by the scruff of the neck
when batsie came in reach on his scam-
pering circuit then he began to struggle
up the slippery slope

  the mortars were operated in broad-
side by one touch of the spark the
operators had retired to the sound-
proof casement and were not observers


the popuuir magazine

of the intrusion before marston
reached the rim of the pit the mortars
volleyed their tremendous blast the
earth -rocked and the adventurer fell
on his face but he rose promptly and
staggered up and over the edge then
he walked to the young woman and he
was smiling though his face was pale
he carried the dog under his arm and
gave it into her possession

  are you hurt she inquired with
wistful apprehension he did not re-
ply and she repeated the question sev-
eral times her tone more wistfully ap-
pealing

  i think i have been made a little
deaf for the moment but ill be all
right presently

  you should not have risked so much
for this wretch she cried

  it was not so much for the dogs
sake-considered as a dog he returned
dryly but i know how much one
becomes attached to a pet animal i
am glad i could serve you

  may i know who has rendered this
service 

  your desire is a compliment i am
hart marston

  i am aileen thornton she said
careless of listening ears she felt a
little feminine prick of wounded pride
because he gave no sign that he recog-
nized her identity

  she added my father is gover-
nor thornton

 he was frankly surprised and
showed it glancing from right to left
in order to discover her escort she
understood the quest of his eyes she
smiled when his gaze returned to her

  i ran away from our party the gen-
tlemen were-were looking the other
way

  there was a touch of provoking hu-
mor in her tones he replied in kind
theres a fine spectacle out there
miss thornton ill admit but after
all sunflowers should obey nature and
keep always turned toward the sun
but in the case of bachelors but-

  perhaps i can answer with some au-
thority for them-at least i can reply
for myself in this fashion will you

grant me the honor of serving as your
escort until a more worthy one presents
himself the crowd is rather trouble-
some

  it is she confessed i have come
so far out of my way i hardly know
where our car is it is off somewhere
-that way she made vague motions

  i believe i know i saw your party
arrive i was on the hill here

  he recovered his field glasses from
the citizen joined her promptly and
they walked away together

  they were fronting the west and the
sunlight was frank he stole glances at
her face and decided that she was un-
der twenty she grasped her own op-
portunities for observation and was
quite sure that he was over forty
though his face was unlined he was
very erect and his legs were straight
she had noticed them during the episode
of the leash they did not hurry but
even in their leisurely pace she saw that
he walked with the snap of youth

  yes he might be forty she reflected
glancing at the gray of the temples but
there was youth in his manner as they
walked on they chatted and she found
buoyancy in his tones and lively humor
in all his discourse he was so wholly
at ease with her at once she had been
annoyed by the stiff deference paid her
by the politicians who composed her
fathers staff and by the smug toady-
ing by their womenfolk association
with these persons and bored attend-
ance at a few receptions had been her
only social experience since her return
from college in the early summer in
former years she had spent her vaca-
tions traveling with her mother her
own state was a strange land to her
she found herself wondering just who
was this alert well-mannered witty
and plainly cultured gentleman who
had volunteered as her squire

  her own viewpoint on life wras that
of amused tolerance she knew how to
laugh he found her a stimulating
audience when they arrived at last
where motor cars were parked she was
conscious that he had not uttered one
trite mawkish or banal commonplace
and he was deciding in his own mind
the dictator

ii

that she was an especially bright girl
--she was so quick to catch a point and
so plainly appreciative-there is always
subtle flattery in a womans laughter
when it is with one and not at one

  a strange idea came to her when she
looked at the gray in his thick hair
how proud of him she could be were
he her father however that idea
came naturally one of aileen thorn-
tons secret mental quests for many
years had been the pursuit of picking
out a father rather it was molding
a model in dream shape than select-
ing an actuality in the flesh she in-
tended no derogation of rutillus
thornton she was too loyal and good
a daughter to make comparisons where
he was concerned

  years and the uncouth manners of
the old and stubborn had removed her
father so far from her that she uncon-
sciously ticketed him as her grandfa-
ther-to be borne with and humored
in innocent dreamings she pictured a
father who would be elder brother al-
most instead of father-a gay debo-
nair chum-a being who would flash
and sparkle when he appeared to her in
her circle of girl friends-who would
stir envy in every girlish heart-who
would be nice to all her young friends
but who would put his arm about her
waist and draw her away from all the
others saying now dearie just we
two alone there had been two ex-
tremes in her father building-the man
of letters pale smiling sensitive-pref-
erably a great poet who would consent
to pen lines in the albums her girl
friends brought timidly on the other
hand there was the heroic figure-the
general the admiral she had never
been quite able to decide therefore
her mind was still open she looked at
marston in the flesh and almost de-
cided that he would be satisfactory com-
promise between her and her dream
characters for here were wit and phy-
sique

  however one cannot listen and laugh
all the time

  miss aileen arrived at a serious mo-
ment when she searched through the
ranks of the automobiles their car

was not there-wallace was not there
and the marquee was empty she
walked over there at the suggestion of
her ideal father who doubtless would
have been considerably astonished to
know that he had been adopted in that
fashion by a charming girl

  she came from the tent and stood in
the sunshine here and there in front
of her were scattered cakes the dog
reached and nuzzled for them she
pointed to them with her parasol call-
ing marstons attention and laughed
merrily

  i quite believe that i have happened
on my fathers trail she explained

  marston cocked his eyebrows in mute
query and did not seem to understand
nor did the daughter explain she set
her white teeth over her lower lip and
frowned as if chiding herself for the
outburst

  perhaps his excellency has gone
back to the city he may have been
called suggested marston

  perhaps so she admitted her
flush deepened as she remembered the
empty chair on the terrace and took
thought of other examples of her fa-
thers brusque tactlessness

  i have many friends here who own
cars miss thornton if you will per-
mit-

  my father will send our car back
for us-at least he will do that she
broke in unable to keep resentment
from her voice but there comes mrs
bates

  three ladies were crossing the pa-
rade ground on their way toward the
cars

  probably she has become as tired of
this noise as i am i am sure she will
find room for me she extended her
hand in frank and friendly fashion and
he took it i thank you mr marston
it has been a bit unconventional but
i hope we may meet again

  you are very kind he said grate-
fully for my part i hope so he
stooped and patted the dog i thank
you batsie for your very gracious in-
troduction you see i remember his
name he told her

  he stood with bared head when she


the pypular magazine

departed he heard mrs bates cor-
dial greeting and eager proffer of con-
veyance and then she turned and
looked in his direction plainly
prompted by some remark from the
governors daughter mrs bates flut-
tered her fingers in token of recogni-
tion by a friend and then the car car-
ried them away

 a charming child commented
lieutenant commander marston on his
way back to the hilltop

  miss thornton asked no questions of
mrs bates that chatty lady did not
need the corkscrew of query her in-
formation was not imparted in cate-
gorical fashion however before the
governors daughter reached the city
she realized that she knew considerable
about one hart marston his grand-
father had been war governor of the
state his father had come home from
the war a brevet brigadier general and
had tried to manage the family fortunes
and had failed lamentably

  mrs bates was a little vague on mat-
ters of business and did not know just
how it had happened she depended on
scattered recollections of what her hus-
band had told her about the marston
family somehow as she remembered
it while the amiable and unsuspecting
general was busy writing books about
the war-he seemed to be all wrapped
up in that subject-some cheating spec-
ulators took advantage of him behind
his back and stole all his money it was
something like that her husband knew
all about it for he was in business him-
self  and he always said that a busi-
ness man ought to be downtown at eigfyl
oclock in the morning with a club in
each hand and an eye in the back of his
head and it was too bad about hart
marston-so polite and so popular but
so poor all the men did speak so
nicely about him but he just would
not practice law so as to make the most
out of it mrs bates had heard-per
husband-that hart marston did not
get big cases because folks who went to
law with lots of money to spend wanted
lawyers who would go at folks in sav-
age style and would play just as many
tricks as the other side tried on and

there was that case-she had forgotten
the names but two men were sent to
state prison for robbing a bank-and
they had been in general marstons
regiment and hart just simply wasted
two whole years in proving that they
were innocent-and they hadnt a cent
to give him more than that he went
down into his own pocket to help their
families oh of course thats a nice
spirit and all that but it isnt what the
real successful men do

  if it wer not for the estates he man-
aged for two or three old gone-to-seed
families who made their money in the
west indies trade at the same time
governor marston made his hart mar-
ston would hardly get along at all and
mrs bates quoting business husband
said that hart did not take half the
pickings from the estates he was really
entitled to take

  miss thornton found herself feeling
rather ashamed of her limited knowl-
edge of the paragons of her own state
the fact that a marston was war gov-
ernor was not included in her stock of
information her bryn mawr education
had been followed on lines rather more
sesthetically eclectic

  furthermore said mrs bates mar-
ston seemed to be perfectly crazy over
the state naval militia which he had
taken in hand now if it had been
the hamilton rifles there might have
been some sense in it the rifles were
made up exclusively of the west end
young men and their invitation hops
were society events but folks seldom
saw hart marston in society any more
he just buried himself down in that
old armory on the water front and his
militia was made up mostly of young
fellows who had been the terror of the
city to be sure it was nice to have
them in off the streets and he was
teaching them all sorts of things and
they did look fine in their white uni-
forms when he led them in the parades
but really it did seem that he might em-
ploy his time better than in running a
night school for young plug-uglies-it
did amount to that

  its strange how i have run on about
that man declared mrs bates j
the dlctfltor



really did not mean to but somehow
when folks begin to gossip about hart
marston they keep on and on if he
had done the sensible things-married
money and practiced law for what there
was in it-he wouldnt be talked about
the governors daughter asked her
first question at that point

  and his love affairs it was query
in tone of polite indifference never-
theless mrs bates snapped a quick
glance at the demufe face under the
feig hat

  i am not a gossip she said rather
stiffly

  oh dear mrs bates i did not mean
to imply that you were

  furthermore aileen the topic for

a girl of your age-

  an infant at nineteen

  i suppose not-not in these days
but i do not know anything aboitt mr
hart marstons love affairs perhaps
he has never had any

  perhaps not agreed miss thornton
-this time very demurely

  or what is more likely he is very
sly stated mrs bates

  miss thornton did not comment
this however she said to herself
i should not have asked such an in-
discreet question about my dream fa-
ther of course he has no love af-
fairs

  when she stepped down from mrs
bates car she felt that she had a good
working knowledge of mr hart mar-
stons habits and character-enough to
enable fancy to habilitate him with the
virtues of an ideal

  and then she put it all from her with
the impatient exclamation  silly 

chapter iii

  the first phase of the war game-the
spectacular daylight attack attendant on
the arrival of the fleet-ended as ab-
ruptly as it began the flagship sig-
naled cease firing the big guns
of the forts left off and squatted sul-
lenly back on their haunches in stately
procession the ships came up the broad
channel from the sea and anchored in
formation

  then relieved of the excited appre-
hension that his country was in dan-
ger adjutant general wade gave his
rifle into the hands of a soldier and
went to hunt up his chief a new appre-
hension had replaced the old one with
which he had been concerned during
the attack how would his excellency
view that precipitate desertion  the
adjutant general could not find his chief
in order to inquire the governors
chauffeur returning from the city told
the adjutant general that the governor
had been left at the hotel and the gen-
eral called timorously by telephone
the clerk in charge at headquarters in
the holland house stated that the gov-
ernor was closeted with the chairman
of the county committee urged to in-
form the governor that dress parade
and inspection would occur at colors
he brought back word that his excel-
lency regretted that he would not be
able to attend the function general
wrade was fully acquainted with his
chiefs style of language and that re-
port did not sound plausible he sus-
pected that the clerk had returned an
apocryphal answer because of timidity
in demanding audience

  this is important its official in-
sisted general wade did you ex-
plain that i was calling and just what
did he say

  if you want his exact words he
said i havent any time to waste on
that flubdubble  and dont come knock-
ing on this door when im busy 

  the general hung up he was con-
vinced that the governors refusal was
authentic

  worry was mingled with his resent-
ment his position was appointive
subject to a governors whim he knew
that he had repeatedly failed to come
up to governor thorntons expecta-
tions in regard to political activity and
that day the governor had flung at him
something very like a threat there-
fore after the general had girded on
his sword in readiness for dress pa-
rade he sat on his camp stool and stared
down at the cracks in the floor board-
ing and was in a solemn mood the
honor of his position gratified every


the popular magazine

ambition he had ever entertained on
every place where pride might itch he
was comfortably scratched but now
he cowered behind his tent flap won-
dering how he could make his captains
pension do for himself and his old wife
pomp and circumstance had been using
up his salary of three thousand dol-
lars he understood the touchy nature
of the tyrant when political exigency
arose

  over at headquarters in the holland
house a conference had revealed po-
litical exigency according to the view
the governor took of the situation
general wades depression would have
been more profound had he been able
to listen in

  chairman stokes was finishing his
oral report of conditions to date

  the governor had been listening with
increasing impatience the grooves in
his cheeks deepened more grimly
every now and then he snorted with
disgust his feet shuffled on the car-
pet and he thrust rude fingers into his
shock of hair

  finally he slammed the flat of his
hand on the table

  see here stokes are you asleep in
this county

  no sir

  i say you are a mud turtle would
make you take his dust a saccarap
clam would have to wait for you to
catch up in a walking match

  chairman stokes was sullenly silent

  the whole state is asleep com-
mittee after committee youre all
alike ive been swinging around the
counties they come in and sit down
and look at me out of one eye and gap
and swallow and grunt county com-
mittee-even the state committee i
see that ive got to run this campaign
alone

  a man less self-centered in his
brutal self-sufficiency than governor
thornton would have noted that mr
stokes was certainly not asleep re-
sentment flashed in his eyes and creased
his aristocratic face he was wholly
urban in manner and attire he stood
up and took his lawyers green bag
from the table and returned his ex-

cellencys angry gaze with calm stare
of disgust

  ill ask you to excuse me sir i
have to attend an important corporation
meeting at my office

  you hold on until i get some head
or tail to this situation here

  that rasping command was plainly
too much for mr stokes self-control

  will you allow me to remind you
governor thornton that i am neither
one of your river drivers nor log chop-
pers 

 i know who you are-you are a
corporation lawyer and a good one
and i have paid you a good lot of
money in my time

  for vlue received sir

  but you are also chairman of our
county committee and youve got to
give me an account of stewardship

  i have done so sir to the best of
my ability

  and a punk showing it is noth-
ing done nothing-

  chairman stokes understood what
was due from him as a party wheel
horse but the goad had been applied
too brutally he broke loose from all
the straps of duty deference and dis-
cipline

  just a moment governor

  you let me talk stokes

  the lawyer whacked his green bag
on the table

  you have done too much talking
your kind of talk may go upcountry
among the cowhide-boot chaps who are
afraid of you but you cant come down
here and hand it to city men sir he
raised his voice when the governor tried
to break in you need a little talk
handed to you yourself thornton
you have been insulting me you in-
sult every man you talk with you
have rampaged up and down this state
butting into folks until you have made
yourself absolutely impossible

  astonishment made the governor
dumb for a moment this amazing re-
bellion took his breath away he tried
to bellow the lawyer into silence but
the chairman had the persistence and
poise of an angry gentleman with a will
and a way of his own
the cdictltocr



  you have provoked this talk from
me governor and youre going to get
it it will be good for you im talk-
ing now for our party which you have
put in a hole by your own bull-headed-
ness you are so infernally unpopular
in this state that were going to have
hard work to pull you through you
havent any perspective on your self
you are such a tough proposition to
handle that the committees are lying
down  theyre discouraged they cant
be blamed they are men before they
are politicians im not sure that you
can carry this state

  the governor gasped this apostasy
left him without speech

  you have insisted on having for
your campaign managers a lot of mangy
old political hounds who have been run-
ning under the party wagon for so
many years that they are footsore and
no good they are out of date in these
days governor these are the auto-
mobile days no more dogs under the
wagon theres another generation to
be handled the younger men can
swing things and they are not with
you-theyre against you im sorry
to be compelled to say all this but you
have driven me to it youre the big-
gest load our party ever tried to lug
i believe youre going to break our
backs

  the governor got control of himself
after a time this arraignment was
hideous but there was horse sense in
his make-up and this crisp surely
poised fearless city man had penetrated
the shell of obstinate self-sufficiency
and touched the sane sense

  i have never posed as a dude he
said with more humility than he had
ever displayed before i have tried
to give this state a strictly business ad-
ministration without fear or favor

  oh i am not criticizing your man-
agement of public affairs sir but per-
sonality has become more and more a
controlling element in politics they
are going to put a mighty smooth fine
man into the field against you-the
other side

  jeffries is a dude snarled the gov-
ernor

  the lawyer smiled tolerantly and was
silent

  i was elected by over thirty thou-
sand plurality insisted his excellency
they cant overcome it this year
but you have been governor for a
year and a half suggested chairman
stokes with dry sarcasm

  a dark flush settled in patches over
the governors knobby cheek bones

  theres such a thing as going too
far with your frankness he growled

  i apologize for what seem to be
personalities sir im talking for our
party it has a lot at stake we have
had control for twenty years and its
going to be tough if the other side has
the parceling out of state offices
theyll never get the chance
shouted the governor ill never have
it said that i dumped my party after
twenty years-not if this election costs
me a million dollars

  money cant buy the state sir
but it can help in carrying an elec-
tion

  you need more than money you
need younger men as managers you
need to get in touch with the new gen-
eration and you must appeal to the
younger voters

  i have started a movement of that
sort cried his excellency his courage
reviving i know politics i started
around that camp out there to-day
brushing against the boys but that
old caterpillar of a wade was  help
to me stokes i feel you are right
you have made me infernally mad but
it has done me good perhaps im the
one who needs to wake up its hard
to teach an old dog new tricks i made
my money because i knew how to boss
men in the woods ive got to come to
a realizing sense that im out of the
woods these days ill try to sneeze
and wag my tail even if i am an old
dog

  theres no need of forgetting your
dignity governor but you just men-
tioned general wade for instance a
man like that cant help you any in poli-
tics he isnt next to the boys he is
not a diplomat a real diplomat-a
popular fellow-could win votes for


the popular magazine

you without ever insulting a voter by
direct appeal direct appeal is crude
is coarse work you need younger men
-with class with breeding with per-
sonality with popularity

  i reckon i dont know any con-
fessed the governor wistfully

  fm sure i can find some

  well name a sample to me-name
one so that ill know the others when
i see em snapped his excellency with
some impatience

  um-m  lets see  mused the law-
yer

  if ive got to start in keeping pets
in politics i may as well make sure of
the right breed before i begin

  a half a dozen men occur to me
right away of course said mr stokes
but ill pick one wrho is known to you
so that youll understand what im driv-
ing at theres marston-you know
him-of the governor marston fam-
iiy

  i knew his grandfather-and the
general devilish numbhead in busi-
ness too but i dont know as i have
ever run against the young fellow

  he isnt exactly young governor
around forty but you never think of
his age he fits right in with the boys
and the old men too he has taken
a crowd of young rowdies in this city
who used to run the streets and has
built up the naval militia with them
until-so i was told by a navy com-
mander this summer-he has the best
trained and most efficient organization
of the kind on the atlantic coast
who pays him demanded the gov-
ernor i know that the marston fam-
ily went bump financially i foreclosed
on four pieces of their real estate-
made some money too he added with
a smack of his lips

  yes a lot of marston creditors
grabbed in to advantage commented
the lawyer it was pretty much of a
sacrifice	

  oh i only ran with the pack said
the governor roughly young mar-
ston doesnt get a living out of that mili-
tia business does he i might offer

him good pay to-

  i suggest most emphatically that

you do not offer pay to hart marston
for any political services he might ren-
der advised the lawyer all his work
for those militia boys is gratuitous of
course lie is a son of his father all
right patriotism is his obsession
uh-huh grunted the governor
but you cant eat it or wear it you
cant make a business of it if this
marston chap is your model party
saver youd better send him around to
me it may be to his advantage

  i am not at all sure how the matter
should be broached confessed chair-
man stokes i dont know whether it
can be put up to marston in any ef-
fective way he has never been in poli-
tics at all

  then what good is he

  because he is just the kind of fel-
low who ought to be in he would have
a wonderful following governor you

need him but-

  no buts about it ill get him

chapter iv

  lieutenant commander marston had
been left guessing as to what part he
and his men were to play in the war
game all orders to the state troops
had come from the war department in
washington and no mention of the
naval militia had been made dis-
creet inquiries at the adjutant generals
office had brought forth no informa-
tion

  general wade had hazarded the sug-
gestion that perhaps the militia did not
fit in with the scheme the fleet was
a hostile force in the game and might
be expected to limit the personnel of its
men to the regulars on the other hand
the web-foot militia had no standing
in the land forces strictly speaking
for some weeks marston had been try-
ing to elicit some encouraging word for
his disappointed boys

  while he stood on the hilltop that
afternoon his ears full of the uproar of
make-believe battle his eager gaze sur-
veying the magnificent sweep of the
battling ships he found himself resent-
ing the situation on behalf of his men
hoping for some call to duty in some
the dictator



capacity he had ordered them to the
waterside armory that afternoon and
he had come unobtrusively in citizens
garb to follow the affair at close range
he felt a twinge of homesickness when
he looked down on-two of the battle-
ships at anchor- in past seasons he and
his men had taken practice cruises on
those ships that his organization had
been overlooked even to the extent of
no mention of exemption was rather
cruel oversight he pondered pie
flinched wrhen his friends put questions
to him about the matter

  there was vague hope that the fleet
might communicate something through
the adjutant general after its arrival in
port there was time to inquire before
dress parade he hurried down from
the hill and scratched respectfully on
the flap of the generals tent

  no general wade had received no
word he remained seated on his camp
stool in an attitude of despondency as
if telepathic wireless had brought to
him a hint of the governors state of
mind the general did not seem to be
at all interested in marstons personal
gloom he offered no comment on
marstons observation that it seemed to
him rather strange that the naval mi-
litia was left out entirely

  it would be mighty interesting and
valuable to us if we had a part in it
ventured the lieutenant commander
after an awkward silence

  i dont know whether it would or
not blurted general wade evidently
resolved to nurse his grouch we
used to know where we were in the
old muster days when the regulars let
us alone

  marston smiled at his memories
however the officers did not know
where the men were most of the time
general it was more of a lark than a
training i was in the guard you know
having elective officers means playing
guard politics-being good fellows in-
stead of strict disciplinarians im glad
to see these maneuvers handled in the
good strong grip of the regular army
the boys are working this trip

  a bugle outside sounded assembly
  b p

the general rose abruptly pulled the
wrinkles out of his coat settled his
sword belt and inarched out grunting
some sort of wordless reply

  marston followed leisurely and took
his place with the crowds who came to
witness dress parade

  the low sun shot level shafts which
were broken into gleaming fragments
on the polished equipment of the
massed men the band made its prog-
ress around the hollow square and its
music swept and swelled in solemn
cadences

  then there was a hush

  somewhere a cannon boomed

  at the head of its lofty staff the great
flag rolled its slow billows against the
heavens

  time for colors

  the eyes of all the throng were lifted
to the flag

  the band phrased softly lovingly the
first notes of the star-spangled ban-
ner and the flag began its measured
majestic descent

  marston took off his hat and gazed
upward at the streaming folds with the
rapt stare of the devotee only bits of
bunting-red white and blue  but
his eyes were filmy and there was a
clutching ache in his throat-there was
almost a sob on his lips

  a soldier stood at the foot of the
staff arms upraised as the last notes
of the music died away in echoes
among the hills he took the flag to his
breast folding it reverently careful
that no portion was profaned by touch-
ing the earth

  a girl whom marston did not know
stood at his side she uplifted brim-
ming eyes and met his tear-wet gaze
sense of comradeship in a common sen-
timent emboldened her

  i always cry like this when they
play down the flag she told him i
cant help it i wonder why i cry

  dont wonder-not at that he re-
turned gently but if the time comes
when you dont want to cry then won-
der what has happened to your love for
your country

  he accepted the most insistent of the


the cpopullr magazine

half dozen invitations called to him by
friends in automobiles and was put
down at the armory in the city but he
did not find within the disappointment
he was so illy prepared to soothe his
men greeted him with suppressed ex-
citement

  a boat from the flagship has just
left that sir reported an ensign he
pointed to a big envelope propped con-
spicuously on the commanders desk

  marston hastily ripped the official
communication from its sheath

  good news men he shouted we
are ordered in our full strength on
board the flagship boats for us at our
landing eight bells sharp to-night
forty minutes leeway

  he rushed for his locker stripping
coat and waistcoat from him as he ran
he pondered while he dragged on his
uniform the delay in giving him or-
ders had been unusual so was the man-
ner of making the communication--the
ordinary routine had been disregarded
it was merely terse notification--he
had given his men the entire gist of the
orders in his few words however the
bit of mystery in the thing-this hasty
call was mighty stimulating he re-
flected he felt as young as the boys
who were furiously preparing equip-
ment in the armory their enthusiasm
was his

  when the launches came towing the
cutters to the float marston and his
men were ready after they were over
the rail of the flagship he was sum-
moned into the presence of the rear
admiral commanding the fleet he was
a small man and during the formalities
of reception he surrounded himself
with the dignity which small men so
often employ to add to the stature of
their personality but after a few mo-
ments his gray eyes deep set beside his
huge nose began to twinkle he put
aside formality and asked marston to
sit down

  i offer you compliments on the ap-
pearance of your command sir as they
came on board just now perhaps you
suspect that i was trying a sort of an
experiment

  i am not allowing myself to do
much thinking on the matter sir i
received orders and i obeyed them
very good mr marston i can
assure you that the navy department
has a very good opinion of your partic-
ular organization all reports have
been excellent it was decided by the
board as a part of the maneuvers to
determine with what celerity a volun-
teer land force could be mobilized and
put on board a battleship without ad-
vance notice for preparation you have
acquitted yourself splendidly

  i thank you sir in behalf of my
men

  they show the effects of excellent
instruction commander but i had an-
other reason for requesting this sur-
prise mobilization the twinkle in the
gray eyes was more apparent also
for the purposes of experiment we
want to steal a bit of a march on the
shore enemy are you fully ac-
quainted with the details of the coast
in this vicinity 

  i have been a yachtsman all my life
and know it in that way sir since
i have been in command of the naval
militia i have explored all the coves
reaches landing places inlets and reefs
in our cutter this work i have done
wholly from the strategy standpoint
the admiral was frankly pleased
excellent excellent indeed 

  in fact sir i have spent much time
in preparing military charts of this ar-
tillery district

  differing in any way from the of-
ficial government charts 

  i have not presumed to attempt any
improvement on the government charts
sir i have plotted to find possible
weaknesses in our coast defense

  ah not taking it for granted that
the government has fortified thor-
oughly eh

  marston smiled

  i have taken the attitude sir that
it is not always the best kind of friend-
ship to gloss over all the imperfections
of our friends

  the admiral stroked his big nose
downward with thumb and forefinger
the cdictjjtocr



  i have given you one reason mr
marston why i served an unexpected
call on you an even more important
reason was that i did not want any in-
formation to leak out regarding a pet
project i have now that you and
your men are aboard i will explain
i am glad to hear what you have told
me just now for im sure of excellent
cooperation i have been studying the
coast-defense matter myself prob-
ably on a broader scale than you for
i have had better opportunities i de-
cided to go a bit more into detail in this
war game so i have arranged to have
you and your men assigned to my ship
for the sake of the information i can
get from local men briefly i propose
to make a night attack with the fleet
and under cover of the bombardment
of the forts and the city land a force
at some point of strategical importance
you grasp the idea

  i do sir

  the chain of forts seems to be
pretty well linked the engineers have
plotted excellently have you found a
weak link in the chain 

  i believe that i have sir marston
informed his superior with eagerness

my charts-

  where are they

  marston drew from his pocket a
thick parcel of papers folded in oiled
silk spread them on the admirals desk
and asked permission to explain

  with an intimate knowledge of detail
which evoked frequent admiring excla-
mations from the master of the fleet
he took the forts in order stated their
armaments their range their limita-
tions if it became necessary on account
of surprise to depress their guns he
also showed by computations already
prepared to what extent they were
estopped by natural features from con-
centration of fire on certain points

  at last as the climax to which his
explanations tended he put his finger
on a spot in his chart

  this is beauchamp island admiral
it is the weak link an occupying
force could be harmed only by mortar
fire-and we have allowed mortar bat-

teries to become almost obsolete there
is bold water to seaward-plenty of
water bonnet island is a granite peak
and serves as a natural shield to an en-
tering fleet

  the engineers know it commented
the admiral for ten years they have
been trying to coax congress for
enough money to blow that island up
a hostile navy could establish a
land base on beauchamp island de-
clared the amateur the entering
wedge could be driven in right there
the admiral took the charts and
pored over them one after the other
he asked many questions and he made
many notes

  according to my information se-
cured by the scouts and the destroyers
the island is garrisoned by state troops
during these maneuvers

  second regiment of the guard with
six-pounder batteries and machine guns
but the intrenchments are only tem-
porary sir beauchamp doesnt seem
to be taken seriously the adjutant
general wanted to give the infantry a
little practice in camp i presume and
he placed it where it would be out from
underfoot of the coast artillery 

  lingering relic of the civilian sol-
dier-excursion idea eh  drawled the
admiral it is hard to slough all the
old notions regarding the defense of
our country it may be well to give
the attentive public a concrete example
of what would happen to troops thus
disposed in actual warfare we are
trying to learn something for ourselves
and teach lessons to all by these annual
maneuvers here seems to be an op-
portunity to teach a lesson which may
prevent sacrifice of the helpless in the
future when somebody starts to heav-
ing solid shot at us infantry forces
planted on an island with field batteries
eh 

  marstons smile grew broader
colonel barnaby is taking the situa-
tion very seriously sir i talked with
him when his troops were going aboard
the steamboat and he told me that he
would defend that island against inva-
sion with his last drop of blood he


the popular magazine

served in the civil war and so we hu-
mor him a bit in his enthusiasm

  since he takes so much interest in
the matter we will meet him at least
halfway stated the admiral with a
touch of cynicism in his dry smile

  i have been much enlightened by
you mr marston he proceeded after
a pause i compliment you most
highly on the work you have done ill
admit frankly that my original inten-
tion was to have you cooperate merely
with my forces but you deserve bet-
ter treatment

  he rose signifying that the interview
was near conclusion

  marston sprang to his feet and sa-
luted he felt a strange quiver of
excited zeal within himself at the ad-
mirals next words

  we shall make our night attack
within the next few hours we shall
slip our cables and steal out to sea as
quietly as possible at eight bells mid-
night

  the younger man bowed

  the especial feature of the attack
will be a landing force on beauchamp
island under cover of our bombard-
ment i hope to expose a weakness in
the defenses and to teach a lesson i
assign you and your men to the honor
of the first line-you will lead the land-
ing party employing the usual maneu-
vers as to guns and disposal of troops
as soon as you are on the beach

  he pressed a buzzer and a marine
appeared

 conduct lieutenant commander
marston to commander eberhard
the admiral put out his hand with
cordial farewell

  i thank you-rather in a personal
way-for the information you have
given me and which will be so valuable
to commander eberhard in the case of
the marines i depend on you for won-
derful results

  marston saluted color flaming into
his cheeks and hurried out on the heels
of his guide

  in the tumult of his pride and his
patriotism he was making no account
of the fact that he had been ordered
into play war instead of the real

chapter v

  four rooms of his five-room suite
at the holland house that evening
governor thornton was devoting to his
own special uses he was entertaining
his political adherents his wife and
his daughter were obliged to put up
with the limited accommodations of one
room which contained two beds to fur-
ther encumber its narrow space the
apportionment of rooms suggested the
governors opinion of the relative im-
portance of women and politics

  his rooms were filled with cigar
smoke which eddied in clouds and
drifted in strata bottles and glasses
were crowded  the sticky top of a
table men helped themselves unstint-
edly the cuspidors were filled with
the butts of half-smoked cigars it was
a rich mans treat and smokers were
not economical

  the governor hobbled here and
there manifestly endeavoring to make
his clumsy familiarity amiable he se-
lected men and pushed them into cor-
ners for conferences he asked ques-
tions sought for information was po-
lite with a sort of wistful eagerness the
men with whom he talked were plainly
a bit puzzled by this new demeanor in
rutillus thornton

  but his excellency had sat long with
his own thoughts that afternoon after
chairman stokes had marched away
bowing a cold farewell

  bull-headedness tough personal-
ity domineering ways insulting
everybody load on the back of the
party-for the first time he had heard
flung into his face what men said be-
hind his back

  the governor had pondered he was
not ashamed he had a coarse mans
pride in his own code of manners

  but he had been considerably intimi-
dated by the lawyers arraignment
politics did demand some measure of
diplomacy im not a dude and im
proud of it he growled but i sup-
pose ive got to wag my tail a little

  that evening he was trying his best
to wag his tail

  those phrases from the indignant
the dictmor



lawyer kept grinding in his thoughts-
like a gizzardful of hard pebbles he
told himself

  therefore his secretary set forth
cigars-which his excellency never
smoked

  he turned his back diplomatically on
the tableful of bottles-he affected se-
rene ignorance of beverages which he
never used he bent himself to the dis-
tasteful task of making men feel at ease
in his presence-and in many cases this
new air of his disconcerted his guests
extremely they blinked at him when
he purred and then they backed away
and buzzed among themselves

  perhaps if it had occurred to gov-
ernor thornton that women amounted
to anything in smoothing politics he
would have had in his wife and daugh-
ter on the contrary he had ordered
them to stay in their room and keep as
quiet as possible in order that his men
might not be embarrassed by feeling the
proximity of women

  his politicians were not embarrassed
after a time and after a number of bot-
tles had been emptied the politicians
became less wary in the presence of this
mystifying mildness and meekness
they even took advantage of the gov-
ernors apparent humility they told
him brutal truths about disaffection
about workers who were sulking about
resentment of men who had sought of-
fice and had been turned down in order
that the old men of the ring might be
taken care of

  the party is sick was the burden
of the lament

  frankness grew more bold

  i realize that you have found the
old bulls easy to handle as you needed
em averred one man the rings
were all set into their noses and all
you had to do was grab with the snap
hook at the end of the party pole you
trained with em in the old days and
of course it came natural for you to
give them the best jobs but it was
wrong policy in these new days of poli-
tics you ought to have remembered
the younger men they have been com-
ing up without your getting a line on
em

  i suppose so admitted the gov-
ernor he was reflecting on what
chairman stokes had said what was
all this new idea in politics what
young man would explain to him and
serve as rallying sergeant

  the opposition is making a play for
the young crowd declared another
politician they are promising some-
thing more than the hind teat of  the
party cow

  id like to run afoul of a sample of
the young crowd pondered thornton
stokes spoke of marston

  there isnt any organization among
em stated another adviser they
are merely running around in circles
like young steers but they will stam-
pede behind the first likely and likable
chap

  the governors soiree had begun late
and it lasted long after midnight
most of the party lingered because his
excellency still preserved hospitable de-
meanor and the tactful secretary unob-
trusively renewed the supply of refresh-
ments he opened all the windows and
started the electric fans trying to dis-
sipate some of the smoke fog

  from far away evidently from off
the sea came rolling in the thunder of
great guns the volleying detonations
blending in a concerted window-shak-
ing uproar

  that night attack-by the fleet
they aint wasting any time declared
a guest showing prompt excitement and
rushing to the nearest window the
others crowded to similar vantage
points and thrust their heads out into
the night

  but in one man at least the spirit of
politics throttled the zeal of the patriot
hearing the call to arms he took the
governor by the arm and led him into
a corner

  that noise out there reminds me
that theres opportunity for a lot of
lively electioneering in the guard now
that its mobilized here and in handy
reach

  his excellency beamed on this ad-
viser a politician to whom guns at
midnight suggested merely politics was
a patriot of the right sort


the poepular magazine

  i have made a start already-per-
sonally andrews i was at em in the
afternoon till that devilish foolishness
got to going out there

  i understand but the boys at the
forts are being worked hard by those
army officers-are not settled down for
half an hour at a time we can do the
best work in the second infantry its
down on beauchamp island and is just
loafing its what we have been talking
here all the evening-get at the young
men

  exactly

  now what do you say governor
thornton if we take a trip down there
to-morrow  it can be official-with
your staff along then well circulate
-i know em ill put you next
thats good talk andrews all i
had to depend on over at the fort was

old wade and he-

  the forts began to reply to the fleet
  and he is no more use in politics

than-than a-

  the governor raised his tones to
override the din and then gave up
trying

  at last he had found a man who
seemed to know what was what and
again that infernal uproar of cannon
was interfering with real business his
natural temper asserted itself

  shut down those windows-keep
out that infernal noise he shouted
a few of the men turned and looked
at him the others kept their heads out
it was a spectacle worth beholding
ah the stars were out in the heavens
above and the harbor lights below
sprinkled the expanse of the bay

  out at sea vivid flashes signaled by
fire the onrolling thunder of the fleets
guns the forts spat flame over their
ramparts crashing out fierce reply to
the attack the glasses set edge to
edge on the governors table top tin-
kled when the earth-jarring thuds
shook the building

  the governor surveyed the massed
backs of his guests with increasing
choler

  we are here to talk business he
cried shut down those windows i
say

  its a mighty interesting sight gov-
ernor protested a guest there isnt
a better place in the city to see it than
right here

  and here happens to be rooms im
paying for to transact my business in
this isnt any grand stand go some-
where else if youre not going to at-
tend to business

  his angry authority drove them from
the windows most of them picked up
their hats and went away sullenly the
few who remained displayed only re-
sentful interest in the governors busi-
ness

  his excellencys secretary came on
obsequious tiptoe though the outside
noise would have deadened the tramp
of an elephant

  the ladies sir--mrs thornton and
your daughter have some ladies and
they cannot see from their windows
would it be proper for them to come
in-

  oh tell em to come in and join the
rest of the gawkers said thornton
roughly and after they have cleared
out of that back room andrews you
and i and any others who have sense
will go in there and finish this busi-
ness

  he acknowledged the entrance of the
ladies merely by a brusque word and
a nod

  buttrick he told his secretary
turning at the door of the inner room
you get in touch with general wade
at once messenger or otherwise and
tell him to be here with the staff at five
in the morning sharp they are up
somewhere probably listening to this
hullabaloo and that shows they dont
need sleep he commented with venom
also you charter a steamer to take
my party to beauchamp island-start
at five-thirty

  its the early bird that catches the
worm in the political field he informed
andrews closing the door ill get
down there before they begin to build
mud pies in this war game

  mrs thornton had overheard

  please arrange so that the ladies
may join the party mr buttrick i
will speak to the governor after he fin-
the dictator



ishes his business she added perceiv-
ing that the secretary looked a bit
doubtful

  isnt it terrible gasped one of the
ladies at a window her face was pale
and her lips trembled one can imag-
ine that its all real

  it may be real some day declared
aileen thornton i am glad to hear
those guns and to know that oun boys
are firing them for we have the guns
and the boys will know how to fire
when its all real instead of play

  she leaned far out and looked and
listened eyes bright and cheeks flushed

chapter vi

  marston found the silence grateful
after the hideous din of the thunder-
ing guns the night attack had con-
tinued for an hour

  the sweating gun crews came away
from their stations and stood on the
decks under the stars breathing deeply
ridding throats and lungs of the acrid
fumes of the high explosives

  shoreward the myriad lights of the
city dappled the hills with radiance
the night was without stir of breeze
the big ships rolled sluggishly on the
slow heave of the sea

  marstons earlier conference with the
flagships executive officer a grizzled
commander with three stripes had cov-
ered all the details with scrupulous ex-
actitude the boat crews had been told
off and assigned the three divisions
of the naval militias battalion were to
go first in the big motor-sailers-boats
capable of accommodating nearly a
hundred men each these boats
mounted three inch guns on platforms
-and wheels limbers and drag ropes
were in readiness for shore service
the regular marines were given motor-
sailers also and the bluejackets had
pull boats-cutters with oars three
battleships beside the flagship were to
contribute quotas to the landing force
the expedition was an adventure in
pure tactics and the numerical force
was theoretically able to cope with the
regiment on shore-a skeleton organ-
ization recruited to half war strength

  in order that the official observation
might be effective the landing was
scheduled for early dawn the ap-
proach was to be made under cover of
the waning night after landing the
men the divisions would automatically
become companies under command of
the lieutenants

  the big ships swung toward the shore
line taking advantage of the bold
water it was decided for the purpose
of more effectual surprise to move all
the boats with oars between the ships
and the shore

  the shrill call of the boatswains
whistle cut through the shrouding dark-
ness it was the signal for which the
crews had been waiting eagerly the
boatswain was piping the boats away

  the ladder booms and the davits had
been swung out the boats dropped in
unison and the men swarmed down into
them

  crisp orders sounded  up oars
let fall give way the fleet of
boats swept away into the night mar-
ston setting the pace told his men to
take it easy there was less than a mile
to row and he timed progress accord-
ingly

  the slafy dimness of coming morn-
ing in the east showed a flush of sun-
light after a time

  marston scrutinized the seaward
lines of beauchamp island anxiously
through his glasses the tents of the
holding regiment were not in sight from
the sea they had been pitched in a field
near the steamboat landing on the reach
which separated the island from the
mainland the island was almost a mile
in width and the transportation ques-
tion had determined the selection of a
camp site therefore at that hour the
bulk of his enemy was in all probabil-
ity safely and soundly asleep a mile
away from the beach where he had
planned his landing he was searching
with his gaze for the location of the out-
posts against the brown ledges hardly
distinguishable from their background
he saw a group of men in khaki they
were squatting on their haunches and
from the motions of their arms he de-
cided that they were eating their snack


the vovulatr magazine

or drinking their early coffee they
seemed to have no eyes for the ap-
proaching boats

  at a little distance from the squad
earth freshly turned marked the prob-
able location of a field battery

  he ordered his signalman to wigwag
orders the trail boats were told to
approach the beach in echelon their
guns ready to sweep the hillside the
advance boats made a dash for the
beach

  all at once the men in khaki lost in-
terest in their breakfast they came
upon their feet they shouted somebody
fired a rifle

  the three-pounders in the boats be-
gan to bark the leaders fired one
volley and then the crews hastily
lashed the guns to spars and leaped
over into the shallow water men fol-
lowed with wheels and limbers and
the pieces were assembled with rapid
precision all the time the echelon
formation kept up a persistent fire on
the hillside a maneuver intended to
protect the skirmish line on the beach

  all the while the boats came rushing
on the rowers making the water boil
under their strokes

  marston knew his ground a gully
gashed the hillside obliquely and he
led the way his men grabbed the tog-
gles of the drag ropes and galloped be-
hind him hauling the guns the hill-
side battery began its fusillade but in-
side of a few minutes he had a dozen
guns replying from the gully and the
marines and the bluejackets were bring-
ing up their equipment and adding to
the uproar moreover three machine
guns and the small arms were now in
play

  the flagships captain of marines
came close to marston and shouted
flushed and panting

  its good work sir how do you
figure their strength

  less than one hundred men five
fieldpieces and a machine gun

  just my estimate

  im going to order a charge cap-
tain do you agree with me

  certainly commander technically

their battery is disabled and they have
lost three-quarters of their force

  the lieutenant commander went with
his men they came out of the gully
with yells when he sounded his whistle
they ran fired a vclley and fell on their
faces behind them following the pre-
pared plan the three-pounders took ad-
vantage of this rest and fired over them
guns trained on the battery again
they charged fired and fell three
rushes took them up the hill but the
guardsmen were not slackening fire in
the slightest degree at each rush
marston ordered a certain proportion
of his men to remain where they had
fallen-the estimated sacrifice in the
charge

  but the stalwarts on the hilltop it
was plain were not admitting that they
had lost a gun or a man their field-
pieces were banging and all their rifles
were popping briskly the operators out
in full sight

  a captain came rushing from behind
the line of the defenders slashing the
air with his sword he ran close
enough to marston to make himself
heard

  dont come up here he screamed
the fire which the guns were spit-
ting made farther advance hazardous

  cease your fire shouted marston
his indignant tones carrying far you
are captured

  captured hell we have killed off
the whole of you 

  i insist on the rules captain you
ought to know them

  ill never give up this position ill
never betray my country

  the captains little eyes were as hard
as marbles the froth of the fury of
battle was on his lips he had screamed
orders until his voice was cracked and
he was in a mood only a little removed
from the mental condition of a raving
maniac marston knew him and was
aware that in his normal state this gen-
tleman was very well behaved as a
garage proprietor

  give it to em howled the captain
whirling his sword wildly

  advance against those lunatics
marston reflected was dangerous and
the dictltor



he resigned himself to the grotesque
anticlimax after signals and protests
and appeals he managed to secure a
cessation of firing on both sides

  now captain stilkey get down on
earth he advised curtly this is a
war game with rules-and you have
had a chance to learn all those rules
tts my rule to protect my country
against invaders

  talk sense captain stilkey  i have
told off men in the sectors of your fire

and they-

  they are all dead the whole of
you are dead insisted the amateur
warrior we fought twice as hard
as ordinary soldiers would fight we
were surprised we were set here to

defend our country we have-

  captain stilkey you have been out-
numbered more than five to one-our
guns were well placed-this battery is

disabled-

  no such thing

  your folly is delaying us in our
march against the main command i
insist that we have taken this position
all our plans will be spoiled unless we
can move at once and make the surprise
effective now be sensible

  betray this position be a traitor
to my country no sir

  but this is only play-according to
rules you have lost this position i
say again

  i dont care what you say youre
the enemy i take no orders from the
enemy

  the sun was up and marston was
desperate his plan to sweep on and
catch the main body napping was in a
fine way to be wholly spoiled by this
dogged idiot

  i am going to order an advance
sir and if you injure any of my men
with fire youll be held responsible
look at em theyre picking up
rocks declared one of marstons web-
footers it was true the guardsmen
had laid down their guns and were arm-
ing with weapons which they considered
more effective than mere barking
blanks

  if thats the way they want to fight
they have picked the wrong crowd to

try it on muttered a lieutenant junior
grade in the naval militia these
water-front boys of ours learned how
to heave bricks before they were big-
enough to wear pants

  have you  control over your
men demanded marston sharply

  captain stilkey showed vicious tem-
per

  not in a case like this we are not
surrendering to a lot of dead men
marston showed a temper of his own
this absurd holdup was maddening
he knew that the eyes of the fleet wrere
on him this delay must seem like most
unseemly loafing on the job the reg-
ulars at the foot of the hill wrere show-
ing much impatience

  he turned his back on captain stil-
key  he gave his men a meaning stare
along their impatient line

  rules of war are suspended for five
minutes he snapped get busy
well show em whether were dead
ones or not bawled a yeoman fists
boys down with your guns 

  he caught the first rock which was
thrown with the ease of a ball player
pulling down a pop fly he returned
the rock and bowled down an infantry-
man then he led the rush the lines
had been working close and there was
little opportunity for much ugly dam-
age by missiles

  in fist work the boys of the naval
militia were the abler antagonists
they were nimble as sailors must be
their arms had been toughened by boat
pulling and every one had received
boxing lessons in the armory

  the captain of marines stated after
it was all over that in a somewhat wide
experience in various scrappy ports in
the world he had never seen a hundred
men licked so promptly and so thor-
oughly and scientifically and then the
marines sat on them till the bluejackets
ran up with marline rope and tied their
feet and arms

  as to captain stilkey commander
marston saved him from any manhan-
dling and offered parole which the cap-
tain refused to accept

  very well you are a prisoner of
war sir


the popular magazine

  go ahead  abuse me for protect-
ing my country blubbered the captain
but you wait till the old second comes
whooping across here youll be swept
into the ocean my message has got
to them by this time

  his delay by an enthusiasts folly
and now this taunt made marston still
more angry

  i have no patience at all with you
sir i shall report you to the depart-
ment

  this isnt war-tying up my men
like calves clamored captain stilkey

  but marston had no more time to
waste on this exasperating affair

  he conferred with his coadjutor the
captain of marines

  of course the main force has been
warned by this time the sound of
the guns was warning but the mes-
senger has carried more exact infor-
mation we may be able to substitute
another kind of a surprise-an ambus-
cade in the broken ground halfway
across the island

  that plan was heartily indorsed

  a guard was left with the captives
and the landing force advanced in com-
panies at the double-quick dragging
their guns a detail of scouts went on
ahead leaping as nimbly as rabbits

  they came doubling back after a
time and reported breathlessly that the
enemy was coming

  marston intrenched behind natural
barriers in the broken ground

  he was able to locate his fieldpieces
and hide his men in advantageous posi-
tions before ony of the opposing force
came in sight he was astonished by
what he saw they were not skirmish-
ers advancing with caution three of-
ficers came pelting along on horseback
making the best work they could of the
rough going

  its old colonel barnaby and two
of his majors marston told the cap-
tain of marines out here alone
this thing has become ridiculous

  it sure has agreed his new friend
wonder if theyre in a condition to
be tied too

  the officers were too intent on steer-
ing their mounts past the coppices and

between the bowlders to take careful
note of what was ahead of them

  you are prisoners  shouted com-
mander marston rising suddenly al-
most under the nose of the colonels
horse the effect was more precipitate
than marston had reckoned on the
startled horse swerved reared and the
colonel slid off the animals rump while
the commander dragged at the bits in
an effort to control the brute the
majors whirled and galloped away dis-
regarding all commands to halt the
captaih of marines gave a sharp com-
mand and a volley of musketry fol-
lowed the fugitives

  but according to their notion of this
game they have only been tickled in the
back muttered the disgusted regular
beholding the final flutter of the horses
tails

  my horse sir my horse de-
manded the colonel advancing on
marston and snapping his fingers
what does this mean 

  it means that you are a prisoner of
war colonel barnaby

  certainly not sir  certainly not
i am inside my own lines you have
no right to be here

  we have taken your outpost by as-
sault sir we have obeyed all the rules
as far as your captain out there al-
lowed us to obey them

  i still insist that i am inside my
lines-my fortified lines sir i have no
official knowledge that you have any
right here

  colonel barnaby this is a war
game and not a joint debate and by
certain sounds i judge that your men
are coming there were frantic bugle
calls beyond the woods and the distant
clamor of voices in orders we are
going into action and i am obliged to
send you to the rear under guard
this is a trick-a fraud-a dam-
nable outrage furiously protested the
colonel my place is with my men
that is right agreed marston
stiffly you were certainly out of
place galloping through the lines of our
ambuscade

  i will admit my possible error sir
still insisting that you have exceeded
the dictator



rights and bounds i wim return to my

command-

  errors in warfare are not adjusted
in any such fashion colonel barnaby
i have no time for any more talk
please retire with the guard

ill be eternally condemned if ill
be bottled in any such fashion look

here marston-

  ensign escort the prisoner
marston the governor and his party
are coming down to my headquarters
this morning i must entertain them
this little affair on this island to-
day is not a social function colonel
barnaby

  theres politics in it where im con-
cerned pleaded the colonel growing
desperate

  the captain of marines hid a grin
behind his big hand

 you mustnt put me in wrong
marston

  colonel you came in wrong-of
your own accord-on board this horse
i have exhausted my patience since
i have met up with your regiment this
day i have been doing more talking
than fighting

  he turned and gave orders in ring-
ing tones ordering the gun crews to
make ready to shell the woods in front

  colonel barnaby he cried swing-
ing to confront his clamorous and pro-
fane captive you can either start in
ten seconds to walk to the rear or ill
have you carried there by my men
he told an orderly to lead the horse
into a small ravine

  ill fight this thing with the last
ounce of my blood insisted the fran-
tic colonel of infantry im protect-
ing my- native soil

  carry him said marston curtly
and the men bore away the prisoner

  theyre all patriotic ashore here
commented the captain of marines

  this country is full of patriots-
all built on the broad scale returned
the commander but its time we all
learned some of the details on the small
scale of how to be an effective patriot
after a few more practical lessons we
may wake up

its what is needed sir the colts

are full of life but colts have to be
trained

  im sorry for colonel barnaby-
hes in a ridiculous position confessed
marston but i guess he needs his
lesson in regard to impulsiveness the
war checker game these days needs
study before every move

  he pointed to the woods men in
khaki were appearing it was a thin
skirmish line and the soldiers were tak-
ing advantage of every inequality of
ground to conceal themselves

  theres good work captain the
boys know how when they remember
to be soldiers he trained his glasses
on the skirmishers its hassetts
company he has been a sergeant in
the regular army but there come a
lot of blunderers to spoil his work
crashing along behind the skirmish
line came troops close massed

  get into em men screamed an
infantry officer get your colonel
swtift orders went down the line of
the invading force the three-pound-
ers barked and the machine guns added
their ferocious chatter

  but it was immediately plain that the
main force of the excited guardsmen
did not intend to play the game accord-
ing to the book of tactics they came
on shooting furiously exposing them-
selves recklessly

  its no use stated marston angrily
to the captain of marines its their
first war game and they have simply
lost their number

  half of em have gone crazy com-
mander i dont think its sensible to
risk our men it will mean a scrap
again and heads will be broken
marstons quick mind took stock of
the situation

  in his vigil of the night before he had
gone over all points of the proposed
invasion had made allowances for cer-
tain checks and had blocked out sub-
stitute plans for emergencies but what
had happened was wholly outside of all
his calculations

  the thing has been all shot to
pieces he reflected angrily

  but a spirit of grim humor replaced
his protesting resentment if the others


the cpocpulacr magazine

proposed to indulge in lunacy for a
time he decided that he might as well
match them in craziness of operation
it would afford basis for profitable re-
construction of methods after it was
all over

  he devoted thirty seconds to hasty
consultation with the captain of ma-
rines they hurried orderlies in both
directions along their lines their men
obeyed with appreciative understand-
ing-entered into the spirit of the huge
jest

  out into the open space which was
then debated by the guns the marines
tossed smoke grenades and behind this
wall of opaqueness they performed
their evolutions three guns were left
to continue the defensive fire and fifty
riflemen remained to add to the decep-
tive uproar the rest of the invading
force took advantage of ravines and
bushes and dodged to left oblique on
the double-quick marston ran ahead
as guide leading the colonels horse
the meager force left with the guns
had been ordered to break and run for
the boats after ten minutes if they were
able to hold off the infantry by their
bluff for that length of time this was
not straight tactics it was a joke but
marston had decided that a joke was
needed to impress certain facts upon the
citizen soldierv

                          j

  more smoke grenades were dropped
in the rear of this flanking movement
in a short time marston had his men
beyond the woods in a clear space and
was leaving the sounds of combat be-
hind then the din began to die down 
the infantry was in pursuit of the
dummy force

chapter vii

  the morning was well advanced and
the sun was high

  a ridge hid the upland pasture from
the woods where the combat was in
progress and marstons troops mus-
tered after their dash with the good
humor which quietness and security
produced in them

 the commander gave his men a
breathing spell birds swirled and

twittered overhead in the bland sum-
mer haze among the daisies the crim-
son little blobs of field strawberries
peeped and the men kneeled and
plucked and ate with zest seaward
over the sparkling waves smoke trailed
from the stacks of the fleet

  ten to one they havent even left
a corporals guard at the camp said
marston he straightened the stirrups
and mounted the colonels horse

  its a sunny day for a ramble said
the captain of marines it will do
the boys lots of good to stretch their
legs ashore

  the orders were march at ease
and the expedition started off

  after they had crossed the pasture
the daisy stalks snapping across their
feet a lane conducted them to the edge
of the hill overlooking the field where
the seconds tents were pitched hasty
survey showed only the cooks busy at
the mess houses and a few sentries who
patrolled the guard lines with gait
which suggested their disgust at missing
the big show

  marston whirled his horse and faced
his men

  attention  dress ranks 

  there was mock gravity on his face
but fun twinkled in his eyes the reg-
ulars caught the spirit of the occasion
as quickly as did the boys of marstons
own command

  soldiers i desire to congratulate
you on the completion of an arduous
campaign we have won the victory
to the victors belong the spoils we
will eat the seconds breakfasts before
our enemies get back forward
march

  he galloped his horse down the hill
straight toward regimental headquar-
ters and his men followed on the run
yelling shrilly persons came hurry-
ing out of the colonels tent but the
commander did not recognize them until
he came to a precipitous halt his horse
skating to a standstill on the torn turf

  he faced the governor of the state
his staff and his ladies

  he had been warned of the visit by
colonel barnaby but this peep-o-day
earliness was rather disconcerting
the dictator



  he dismounted hastily and saluted
and gazed past the governor into the
dancing eyes of miss aileen thornton
down the hill scampered marines mili-
tia and bluejackets trundling their
guns they halted at his back

  i beg your pardon your excellency
i didnt know your party was here
im glad to see somebody here at
last beside ourparty what is going
on here demanded the governor

  we have attacked the island-a
landing force from the ships sir
you mean that you are fighting
against the infantry

  yes sir

  well why arent you fighting em
then  what are you doing up here in
their camp havent eaten all of em
have you the governors tone was
distinctly amiable he blinked cordi-
ally at the commander and seemed to
see humor in the affair then he
turned on adjutant general wade

  if this gang has eaten up eight hun-
dred voters wade i shall hold you
responsible he said

  we simply outflanked them gov-
ernor marston hastened to explain
we have captured this camp

  then im in a serious position
stated his excellency prisoner eh
devilish nice bunch of state troops ive
got

  its hardly as bad as that sir
marston smiled and showed a little em-
barrassment its all hardly regular
i fear considered from the standpoint
of tactics but there was a mix-up-
the plans didnt work out right and we
sort of took advantage of conditions
but you have captured this camp
where are those fellows-barnaby and
his gang

  we captured colonel barnaby sir
he was impudent we left the regi-
ment chasing a decoy body of our men
i suppose they are at the other end of
the island

  general wades face expressed vary-
ing shades of emotion

  i can well believe it was not reg-
ular he blurted it looks to me like
pure farce i shall be obliged to inves-

tigate this affair commander mar-
ston

  i hope you will do so sir there are
some valuable lessons to be learned
all this does not interest me-not
now declared the governor showing
impatience i expected to be properly
received here by colonel barnaby i
sent word that we would take break-
fast with him

  under the circumstances i trust you
will allow me to act as host pleaded
marston saluting he returned miss
thorntons understanding smile i
presume i have some rights here as
commander of the victorious forces

  i dont know as im so sure about
that stated general wade with official
gravity as you have admitted this
is all very irregular you seem to be
intruding here on state property which
is assigned to the infantry and issued
through my office

  with all due respect i hardly like
the word intrusion  was marstons
reply i was ordered in due form by
the admiral commanding to make an
attack on this island i have not been
recalled from that duty and am still
under orders apart from your author-
ity sir i claim jurisdiction over cap-
tured equipment

 and yet--

  look here wade broke in the
governor you can do your argument
over this poppycock business after
breakfast he limped forward and
put his hand on marstons shoulder i
have just woke up to what your name
is i thought at first you were one
of those regular navy fellows but
your name is marston eh 

   it is sir

  yes i see now that youre at the
head of the naval militia i dont know
much about these war matters and
youll have to excuse me for being slow
well have breakfast with you sir
with the greatest of pleasure thats
enough wade he snapped whirling
on the general who was muttering re-
monstrance if theres any red tape
about this thing tie it onto me and ill
know how to cut it

  marston made prompt disposal of his


the cpocpulacr magazine

troops and fifteen minutes later his
bugle sounded the mess call

  he was under apprehension that the
breakfast might be subject to some
rather startling interruptions if the
guardsmen were allowed to return to
camp without proper notification of the
presence of the governor their com-
mander in chief therefore he sent a
flag of truce over the hills accompany-
ing a lieutenant charged with explana-
tions

  in the minds of those who sat at
headquarters mess that morning there
was no questioning the fact that lieti-
tenant commander marston had risen
to particular and peculiar favor in the
eyes of power the governor asked
questions exclusively of commander
marston-he addressed his remarks
wholly to commander marston-he had
placed the commander next to aileen
thornton on his excellencys left and
the listeners and the onlookers believed
that this favor was shown merely be-
cause the commander had presented a
picturesque figure that morning and
was custodian of the camp pro tem by
right of conquest

  but the hard and bitter words of
chairman stokes were grinding within
the governor as he narrowed his eyes
shrewdly and took stock of marston
if this is the kind i need ill get him
he told himself

  however as he pondered further on
the inflexible dispositions of the elder
marstons whom he had known in the
old days he was conscious that he was
at a loss what bait to use ramrods
in backbone and numbheads in busi-
ness the governor reflected

  colonel barnaby rode at the head of
his straggling and sullen troops when
they returned he was on a horse
which had been loaned to him by one
of the majors when he passed head-
quarters mess he scowled and muttered
at sound of the clatter of tableware and
chatter of lively conversation marston
observed this return and dispatched an
orderly with a polite message

  commander marston regrets all the
circumstances of the case and asks col-

onel barnaby to join the breakfast
party

  replied the colonel in tones quiver-
ing with wrath

  colonel barnaby presents his com-
pliments to commander marston and
adds that he is not hungry

  he continued in this uncompromising
mood when the party came out of the
mess tent and strolled across to head-
quarters the governor walked ahead
of his party with marston at his el-
bow  his excellency insisted on con-
tinuing the conversation with his new
favorite and was chewing on a tooth-
pick with the amiable satisfaction of a
man who had fed well and desired to
advertise the fact

  well barnaby he remarked jocu-
larly condescending maddeningly pat-
ronizing the web-foot boys seem to
have put it over on you for once what
is it you do about prisoners of war-
bail em out exchange pay ransom or
what hope you know how to get
me out of the scrape im in ive got
politics to attend to

  has any lunatic presumed to tell
you that you are a prisoner governor
thornton  demanded the colonel in
fresh fury

  but i am chuckled his excellency
you were not here you left the camp

unguarded-

  i have not surrendered your ex-
cellency i will guard you with the last
drop of my blood

  oh i dont think i need a guard-
ian barnaby the thing has not gone
as far as all that

  the thing has gone too far sir we
have all been mocked at i have been
insulted by a lot of ruffians instead of
war on a dignified basis it was peek-

a-boo business i register my protest
ff

  oh dont be so infernally serious
barnaby broke in the governor with
impatience theres no skin off any-
body as far as i can see

  my men have been beaten up bat-
tered and bruised-left tied hand and
foot by water-front plug-uglies sir
he pointed trembling finger at mar-
ston
the dictator



  by men he has trained to do just
such cursed tricks he declared

  just one moment sir pleaded the
commander i must justify myself
the infantry attacked us with rocks
contrary to all the rules my boys
simply made their bigness in a scrim-
mage which they did not provoke

  of course they did  commented the
governor is that the way you make
war barnaby heave bricks

  the colonel goggled -at the governor
and gasped this championship of the
enemy passed understanding

  i have admitted that much of the
affair has been irregular marston
went on i refrain from criticism at
the present time but i shall demand
a hearing on the matter in order that
such irregularities may not happen
again in a war game between state
forces

  exactly agreed the governor
learn by mistakes im growing to
adopt that policy more and more my-
self he looked at marston with an
ingratiating grin

 but in this case- began the

colonel

  his excellency broke in rudely
what was the order to you mar-
ston  what did the admiral-i believe
you said it was the old he one himself
-what he tell you to do

  land a force on this island and cap-
ture it

  and you did it didnt you

  the colonel took the words out of
marstons mouth

  he did it by tricks-by underhand
methods-by taking advantage of me-

by fooling my men-by-

  well all that is war isnt it bar-
naby shouted the governor war
as they run it to-day  anything to
beat from cannon balls to poison gas
what in the devil are you whining
about 

  but your excellency his number of

men-

  he has taken this island hasnt he
they told him to do it he has done it
i saw him do it i had breakfast with
him after it was done

  but what colonel barnaby means

put in the adjutant general is that un-
fair advantage was taken by the in-
vaders

  that is not true general wade
protested marston with indignation

  he took the island thats the main
point insisted the governor exhibit-
ing peculiar interest in the controversy
wade why are you butting into some-
thing you dont know anything about
it was an insulting query to pop at a
chief of staff

  i do know about it governor my
position gives me the right to talk
and dispute me eh

  but war is a matter for trained men

-officers who know-

  thats right-it is and it is plain
to me that our friend marston here
knew just how to get what he was sent
to get thats the main point thats
the whole point when i have hired
men in business thats the point i have
insisted on and war has become more
or less of a business in these days now
shut up he bawled making his tone
of insult more emphatic when he
checked his adjutant general again

  general wade stiffened and grew
white he had a job it was a gratify-
ing job but his old soldier soul had
been goaded cruelly in the past and
now it was lashed into unthinking fury

  i shall tender my resignation at
once he shouted

  a good idea barked back his ex-
cellency you have got ahead of me
i was going to ask you for it

  he whirled on his heel called to an-
drews his political friend took his arm
and started to limp away

  marston i have some matters to
attend to he called over his shoulder
i hope youll tend out on the ladies
and do as good a job of it as you did
in taking this island

  i am sorry your excellency but i
must lead my men back to the ships
his bow of apology and regret in-
cluded them but as he resumed his cap
he singled the governors daughter with
his gaze for a moment

  his bugles sounded the recall his
men formed and he led them away over
the hill through the sunshine


the popular magazine

  now we can get down to some sen-
sible business after all this flubckibble
the governor informed andrews im
glad that navy sculch is out from un-
derfoot here  the two packs were scowl-
ing and growling at each other like
bulldogs couldnt get their minds on
politics with that going on by the
way that marston seems to be quite a
hustling- fellow

  sure does sir

  knows the military game i should
say

  seems to be up to date

  anything in politics 

  never heard he had done anything
glad of it declared his excellency
id like a man like that in the adju-
tant generals office now that wade has
left me in the lurch it would keep it
out of politics

  to andrews leading the governor
around the company streets of the
encampment that utterance sounded
rather cryptic

chapter viii

  during the next few days governor
thornton dropped that utterance in
divers places and in various ears and
the politicians blinked at him as if they
were wondering whether to admire him
for artful dissimulation or were deplor-
ing his folly in his old age they re-
membered that rutillus thornton had
not been in the habit of taking anything
out of politics

  the news reached hart marston that
the governor proposed to keep the mili-
tia branch of his administration out of
the political game whispering bill
saunders one of the governors trail
snuffers imparted that information to
marston in quite a casual manner-and
then hurried up to the statehouse and
told the governor that the matter had
been planted according to others

  i told him that it was more or less
hearsay with me but that if he would
inquire around a little hed probably
find out that you had been talking the
thing pretty generally governor

  he belongs to a family thats gun-
shy in regular politics ive known em

in the past saunders he would have
bolted if i hadnt come up behind him
carefully-and he may as it is but
well see

  his secretary appeared at the buzz-
ers call

  buttrick get lieutenant commander
marston on the long distance for me
when the connection was made his
excellency was noncommunicative he
merely asked marston to come to the
state capital at his earliest convenience
on a matter of some importance and
mr marston amiably consented to
come

  he walked in on the governor the
next forenoon

  you know that wade has resigned
as adjutant general stated his excel-
lency without preface

  i did not know it governor

  but you heard him resign-stood
right there and heard hirn with your
own ears

  i saw that general wade was con-
siderably wrought up spoke without
thinking i did not take the matter
seriously

  well i took it seriously sir he
has resigned he tapped a paper on
his desk in order that there might
be no doubt about it i have had him
write his resignation the grooves
about the governors mouth deepened
i have found that he has been dab-
bling in politics that might have been
excused in the old days but not now
when the whole country is waking up
on the war question

  i am glad to know that you take
that attitude governor

  of course i take it the political
game is all right it has to be played
but thats one thing and defending this
noble country of ours is another i find
out that you are very progressive in
military affairs i ask you to take the
position of adjutant general of this
state and bring the department up to
date

  marston was too frankly surprised
to make immediate reply

  i shall consider it a particular favor
if you will accept sir i have not acted
the dictatdr



hastily i have looked over available
men and i want you

 but the custom has been to give the
honor to civil war veterans sir

  the civil war was fought a good
many years ago we need new blood
and new ideas marston i know you
will accept you have the knack of this
thing and its a duty you owe your
state

  the commander tugged at his ear and
stared at the carpet the wrinkles of
hesitation creased his forehead

  you havent been mixed into poli-
tics at all have you demanded the
governor

  no sir

  im glad to hear that however i
suppose your acquaintance is pretty
wide in militia circles isnt it

  ill admit that it is governor i
was in the guard for many years before
i got interested in the naval militia
youre just the man i want in-
sisted the commander in chief with
vigor cant you see that youre going
to have an opportunity for a lot of big
wtork and dont you admit that the
guard needs a good overhauling dont
be too modest about yourself mar-
ston

  the war maneuvers showed that we
do need some sort of readjustment to
conditions governor

  then accept a position where you
can be of some value to your state
sir he brought down his big hand
on his table so violently that marston
snapped his eyes accept i say

  i will take the position sir

  good he pressed a button and
the secretary appeared post the nom-
ination of hart marston as adjutant
general quartermaster general and
paymaster in chief

  the governor stood up and took the
hand of his new chief of staff

  i shall be glad to have you confer
with me and submit plans at any time
general i wish i had the power to
appoint you for a term of years but
of course you know that your fortunes
end with mine-and there are vicissi-
tudes in politics

  however theres no doubt about
  b p

your reelection governor thornton
said marston with a smile

  but the governor was serious and a
bit wistful

  you have never been in politics and
you dont know the tricks they can
work marston

  but defeating you for your second
term-its inconceivable sir why you
were elected by-by-i forget but

  by more than thirty thousand plu-
rality sir but as soon as a man gets
high office he begins to pile up enemies
for himself-if he tries to assert his
authority theyre mad with me mar-
ston  a lot of em are ugly i have been
governor of this state-thats the
trouble i have kept their fingers out
of the treasury i have kept everything
on a business basis and the result is
that they say im domineering im not
polite i have bad manners i dont fit
their cream-tart aristocracy i know
what they say behind my back you
neednt blush you have heard em say
it but i never had the advantages the
dudes have had marston when i
was fifteen years old i was helping my
father cruise timberlands my only
schooling was a few summer terms
while the black flies kept us out of the
woods winters i was with the crews

i have walked thousands of miles
through the wilderness exploring for
lumber operations i have slept thou-
sands of nights under the open sky with
my back against a tree and because i
had to go light foot i ate raisins and
i didnt fry my pork-i ate it raw so as
to get all the good out of it i havent
had the parties and the pleasures and
the easy-chairs and the down pillows in
my life marston im an old man now
-past the age for enjoying things
which human nature really does enjoy
im too old to make myself over no-
body wanted me to be governor i
fought my way to it it is the only
good thing which has come to me in my
life i dont count money a good thing
for me i dont know how to enjoy
money you can see that for your-
self

  this outburst took power of speech


the cpocpulacr magazine

from marston it rather shocked him
as if he had been peering and eaves-
dropping in all that he had heard of
the personality of rutillus thornton
he had gathered that the old mans taci-
turnity regarding himself was that of
the indian stoic sudden peculiar
sympathetic interest was evoked in the
younger man he looked at the crum-
pled garments-one trouser leg was
caught up on the tag of an old-fash-
ioned long-legged boot he had heard
many men make mock of those gar-
ments of the states chief executive
stains were on the vest and it yawed
because it was buttoned awry

  and so they would like to deal me
a wicked stab-a lot of em would
marston for twenty years in this
state every governor has been given
his second term-complimentary but
they want to kick me out

  i can hardly believe that there are
men of that sort governor thornton

  i suppose its the younger crowd-
the voters of the new generation that
has come along the younger folks
are apt to go more on looks than ac-
tions they dont know how proud i
am to serve my state well to serve my
party they dont know how many
nights i have spent here alone in this
room going over state business so that
no department could fool me i have
slept in that chair betweenwhiles as i
slept in the woods with my back against
a tree

  it was a strange new picture of a
man that marston was getting all the
harshness so usual in thorntons tones
was gone he was wistful there was
a hint of a quaver in his voice

  its the young generation thats com-
ing-the younger voters of to-day who
will have to pay the taxes to settle for
what we are assuming now for bur-
dens marston i wish they realized
how i have studied and have worked
to economize for the state

  it can be explained to them it must
be explained to them declared mar-
ston eagerly

  he felt a sudden rush of sentiment
toward this old man he did not dare
to call that sentiment pity and yet

it was pity in spite of the fact that
thornton was a millionaire and a gov-
ernor this arid life was so bitterly
bare even with its climax of honor
marston felt that in comparison his own
life had been full and opulent and alto-
gether desirable in spite of his poverty
in his new emotion and in the pres-
ence of this old man who confessed and
lamented he felt as if he had been
guilty of usurping something somehow
some privileges which had belonged to
somebody else

  i dont know how it would seem to
em if i had a few real friends to ex-
plain for me said the governor he
walked up and down limping more than
was his wont the leg is bad to-day
he told marston i jumped into a log
jam once to pull out a river driver-
it got its pinch then as i was saying
if i had a friend the right sort oh
i can hire pussy footers and campaign-
ers and electioneerers and all that ruck
of politicians but its got to such a
point in this world to-day that folks
dont take much stock any more in what
politicians tell em

  governor thornton i believe in
you and in your honesty of purpose
blurted marston and yet even as he
spoke with such precipitancy he was
not quite sure that he knew anything
of an intimate and  definite nature in
regard to thornton and he did not just
understand why he was willing to vol-
unteer as a champion he was sure
that it was not because he had been ten-
dered an appointment he did not par-
ticularly care for the office the job
meant cares in abundance and monop-
olization of his time for small returns
from the money point his acceptance
had been a part of his sudden conver-
sion to the side of this old man

  the governor halted in his march
and faced this new recruit his gaze
was a bit quizzical

  and yet somebody has probably
told you that i stole half a million
acres of public wild lands from the
state by juggling tax titles

  i dont remember that i ever heard
anything of the sort sir faltered
marston
the dictator
 



  then they havent been sneering so
much about it in these later days but
i didnt steal the lands marston i
simply beat the gang to it i got em
at a good bargain its easy to call a
man a thief if youre mad at him

  i say i have never heard your hon-
esty questioned governor

  not even by your own family
no sir there was sincerity in
the younger mans tone

  the marstons were always good
sports never anything else grunted
his excellency resuming his slow
march when a man plays business
marbles with me its for keeps not fun
but after the game was over ive had
a lot of men whine to me that they
were playing in fun if they want
charity after its all over theyll have
to ask for charity-they wont get back
anything on any other basis

  i am quite sure that my grandfather
and my father never asked for charity
sir

  i wasnt talking about them i was
talking of the other sort and i havent
been popular marston i wish i knew
how to be-i do i dont know how
people who have been brought up right
and know all the right things to do
because its second nature-they dont
understand how anybody else can make
mistakes im ignorant i know it i
do things and they think im coarse
they dont know how much blood im
sweating under this shell of mine he
beat his fist against his breast

  again that wave of sympathy swept
through marston

  i wish i could show you in detail
what i have done for the benefit and
the finances of this state cried the
governor by gad sir i will show
you i want an unprejudiced chap
who isnt in politics to understand what
i have accomplished

  ill be glad to know sir governor
thornton he went on with enthu-
siasm i hope you wont think im of-
ficious but i understand just how an
honest man may be misunderstood i
would be sorry to see foolish prejudice
keep you from an honor which is right-
fully yours if i hear men attacking

you behind your back i propose to
make myself heard in protest

  the governor fingered his nose reflec-
tively and looked down at the carpet

  i wouldnt want you to get into poli-
tics marston he protested mildly

  i dont think that it would be merely
playing politics sir it would be plain
and simple loyalty to my chief he
spoke warmly and the governor smiled
he went to marston and put his hand
on his allys shoulder

  my boy he said gratefully i
know you are not offering this service
because i have coaxed you to accept a
trumpery office it sounds awful good
to me when you say it i havent had
a disinterested offer of help from a
man before in all my life

  i prefer to decline the adjutant gen-
erals position in order that i may be
free from all suggestion of self-interest
sir ill go out and frankly work for
you among the boys

  the first need in this state is the
rehabilitation of the guard i cant
spare you from the office marston i
put state affairs at all times ahead of
my personal interests and yet i know
you could do wonders for me

  then ill accept the position-and
ill be a man in it and not a politician
declared marston but in order to be
a man and loyal to my chief ill do all
in my poor power sir to see that you
are renominated and reelected heres
my pledge he took the governors
big hand in a warm clasp

  i accept that service general mar-
ston i accept with all confidence that
you will operate to help me without
hurting either of us for you have
tact you know how to do it right
i have no tact i need yours and if
you are willing to add a bit more to the
pleasure of this day you will join me
here at one oclock and have your snack
with me at home with my wife and
daughter

  i gratefully accept governor
marstons cheeks flushed with pleasure

  ill send buttrick with you to the
adjutant generals office so that you may
begin arrangements for the official
transfer


the vocpulacr magazine

  after marston had departed the gov-
ernor sat down at his desk and sighed

  its as josh billings said he mut-
tered to be a successful politician
a man has got to be buttered on both
sides well i dont believe im any
worse than the rest of em who are
operating

  he drummed his stubby fingers on
the table in a tattoo

  hes the right kind of a chap to
have on a job i have seen him oper-
ate ordered to capture a camp-and
he captured it rules be condemned 
thats the material to make a good poli-
tician out of 

                                                

chapter ix

  corporal john candage quondam
noncom of the old seventeenth in the
civil war arranged the function

  he was captain of the statehouse
night watch and usually slept until
noon but his wistful eagerness pulled
him out of bed early that morning he
put on his best blue suit-his memorial
day parade garb with insignia on the
breast his old wife brushed his
grand army hat with tender solicitude
and saw to it that the cord was settled
into place just right she gave him his
clean handkerchief and white cotton
gloves freshly laundered by her own
hands

  its my own idea repeated cor-
poral candage i reckon some of the
other boys around the statehouse
would have thought of it in due course
but it came to me like that he
snapped a finger into his palm says
i to the boys well give him a couple
of days to get settled in his office-nor
wanting to presume whilst hes too
busy and waiting till wade gets out
from underfoot then well do it 

  the old wife picked off the last fleck
of lint

  i hope all the others will look as
well as you do john

  they will liza theyre taking
pride in it

  they were

  in the rotunda of the statehouse the
corporal marshaled his corps and gave

the old men critical inspection they
were all veteran soldiers employees in
the state capitol building rewarded for
valor by employment in the public
service

  tenfion said corporal candage
he began to lift his feet alternately
marking time without moving ahead
it was thus plain that the function was
to be strictly formal

 ump  ump  ump ump ump 
called the corporal seeking unison
left left-march 

  they tramped across the rotundas
flagged floor up the broad main stair-
way turned to the -right with sharp
and orderly swing of ranks and
marched through a door which a fore-
warned deputy had opened for them
straight into the presence of adjutant
general hart marston

  the general arose genuinely aston-
ished and received corporal candages
salute the old soldiers white-gloved
hand shuttled meteorlike in the salute
and then dived into the breast pocket
of the blue coat he pulled out a paper
and while he unfolded it he said  sir
it being the case that no one of us is
ready with his tongue it has been
thought best to put our heads together
and compose on paper a statement
which stands for our opinion

  he cleared his throat

  marston waited grave pale with sud-
den pallor and plainly ill at ease his
quick apprehension told him that the
old soldiers of the statehouse had as-
sembled to rebuke him for having bro-
ken precedent by stepping into an office
which had always been the reward of
a civil war veteran

general hart marston

  str  it so happens that all these men here
present took their colors from the hands of
governor aaron marston when they marched
away to war it s happens that more than
half these men were in the old seventeenth
when general henry marston was its colonel
commanding that governor and that
colonel honored the state which honored
them and in these days when the country
is waking up again to what is needed for its
defense it is a gtand thing that a third mar-
ston has been put in charge of state mili-
tary matters by the foresight of governor
thornton we have assembled here to say
the dictator



that you honor the position and we humbly
pledge our devotion and respectfully thank
you

  the affair had so suddenly developed
into something so wholly outside mar-
stons first startled calculations that he
was swept out of his usual calm the
marston family had never been accused
of being phlegmatic nor yet had it been
wont to display its emotions to the
crowd but in hart marstons case
the reverence he entertained for his
grandfather and the love growing out
of sweet comradeship with his soldier
father had become sentiments which he
enshrined as holy those old men who
had come to him had touched the
magic key and had reverently swung
open that shrine

  they were gazing at him wistfully
and he opened his mouth to reply to
them but he found no words to voice
what he felt formal response he
knew would leave his deeper feelings
inarticulate

  he allowed the tears to trickle
frankly down his cheeks he went
among them his hands outstretched

  its no use he sobbed i cant
stand up here and reply in words give
me your hands

  corporal candage called for three
cheers and marston thanked him with
grateful glance the cheers relieved the
tension of the occasion then they sat
down around him and pulled off their
white gloves and accepted cigars and
were unconventionally sociable for the
few minutes of their stay

  were going on from here and thank
the governor for making this appoint-
ment stated corporal candage it
shows that he isnt playing politics the
way most folks accuse him of doing-
its going to help him with the folks at
large-and its only right that he should
be told and thanked when he has done
a good job

  i hardly dare to comment favorably
on your plan smiled the general
that would not be exactly modest
but i hope governor thornton will be
given credit for all the good things he
has done for the state

  a grizzled veiteran spoke out with
intrepidity

 when a politician loosens up
enough to do something for his state
and his country out of pure patriotism
instead of figuring merely for himself
and his party hes due to get thanks
general but you know how it is even
in washington its time for some of
those fellows to wake up and remem-
ber that weve got such a thing as a
country as a whole instead of just a
lot of states and two or three political
parties

  marston nodded indorsement

  your grandfather made us a speech
the day we started off for the front-
we boys said corporal candage i
cut it out of the paper and saved it
liza has it laid away in her rosewood
box i wish i had thought to bring it
he talked to us about courage i wont
try to tell over what he said i wont
presume to i havent got the educa-
tion to remember his words sir

  i can remember one point he did
make said the grizzled veteran who
seemed to be surer of his vocabulary
he said that it took just as much
courage to do right as it did to grab
a gun and go howling and cantering
in a charge against the enemy-not his
words but thats the gist and he said
he believed it took more courage to do
right against our own personal interests
than it did to go up against an enemy
with fixed bayonets

  i believe so too agreed marston
gravely he remembered when he had
stood his ground and had paid the score
when his associates in a certain busi-
ness venture had taken advantage of a
chance to duck and leave him alone

  and he was to remember that con-
ference of this day with its sentiments
in a bitter hour later

  there are all sorts of courage de-
clared old sergeant copp of the state-
house elevator corps one day at mal-
vern hill a johnny reb came charging
at us out of a piece of woods we had
been shelling he was all alone we
let him come on for he interested us
he ran right through our lines past
hundreds of us his eyes were set and


the popular magazine

his face didnt have any more expres-
sion than a block of wood but he
kept yelling and stabbing the air with
his bayonet

  crazy said candage

  but if a regiment was doing the
same thing it would be called bravery
anyway he run himself to death-
frothed at the mouth and fell down and
died i suppose a lot of men have got
promoted for bravery when they didnt
know what they were doing any more
than that johnny reb did

  the old men were silent for some
time they sat and smoked and nar-
rowed their eyes beholding certain
visions

  i reckon ill have to tell of a kind
of courage i saw said corporal can-
dage he spoke softly as if he were
approaching a sacred subject t have
an idea that we were all thinking of
the same thing just now when a sol-
dier gets to talking about courage he
thinks of the first time he was under
fire human beings have always fought
and probably they always will fight
but when god put life into human
beings he put in the hankering to stay
alive and when youre out in the open
and hear guns and know for the first
time in your life that the stuff theyre
vomiting is headed in your direction
theres an awful sickness inside you
i was nineteen-thats all most of
my company right around that age-
boys who had grown up together and
gone to school together and played to-
gether most of em there was the
delano twins-fine boys old rever-
end delano was their father we all
had been wondering what a battle was
like we had only seen pictures and
you know what pictures are

  our first one wasntlike pictures
we heard cannons all the morning but
we didnt know what was going on
then they told us to march-and we
marched and marched then they
stopped us on the side of a hill and
we sat there and waited-hours we
waited it looked like they had for-
gotten us the cannons were still going
and i was finding myself feeling glad
they had forgottejn us if thinking of

us meant getting any nearer to the can-
nons i drank all the water out of my
canteen my mouth was so parched it
was awful to wait and wait then all
at once it was worse cannons started
in right near by-just over the hill
and patches of ground began to fly up
they told us to dig holes and we dug
that gave us something to do but the
ground was hard and we couldnt dig
much and then they told us to stop
digging because wre were going to move
ill never forget how ugly i kept grow-
ing all the time why didnt somebody
come and tell us to go one wray or
tother i kept muttering over and
over that fools must be running the
thing i didnt see any sense in a bat-
tle like that and we looked at each
other and pretty soon we began to say
things-like a pack of scared boys will
scold about all we had ever done was
milk the cows and do the chores we
were all country boys off the farms

  then a shell dropped and busted
right near one of the delano twins
was on his back when the dust settled--
and his heart was torn out and laid on
his face-and his brother was looking
at him

  and then we were all ready to run
we didnt see any sense in that kind
of a battle i say that wasnt fight-
ing we were only poor boys from
the country we were ready to run and
be disgraced we had bragged a whole
lot about what the seventeenth would
do-how we would show em all we
had made songs about it we didnt
sing any of them then oh my god
whined one boy and he put handfuls
of dirt on the delano twins face so as
to hide it

   i aint going to stay said another
boy he whimpered just like a young
one wtho had been told to stop after
school i aint going to hang around
here where ive been forgotten

  we were all hugging the ground
flat on our faces

   weve been forgotten-thats wrhat
all the rest have run away-all the rest
of the army  im going 

   no wye havent been forgotten
said somebody so loud that we could
the dictator



all hear were the reserves were
the mainstay boys were going in
and do the big job just as soon as
theyre ready for us

  he walked right out in front of the
lines and sat down on a tussock and
lighted a cigar he didnt scooch down
on his belly he turned his back to
the balls-he looked at us-and its a
mighty good man who can turn his
back on the danger thats coming from
behind

   ive just thought of a story he
said its rather tedious waiting here
and if you dont mind ill tell you the
story

  it was a good story almost before
we realized what we were doing while
he talked on we were sitting up on our
haunches listening to that story and
then he told some more the first
thing we knew we were just as cool
as he was

  if he had run out tfrere and slished
his sword and made a speech and told
us to remember our dutr and not dis-
grace our state and all that we would
have only felt that the case was mighty
desperate like as not we wouldnt
have had the courage to stay no matter
how much he talked to us and while
he was telling stories the order came
for us to go into the fight and we did
and we rushed their lines being mighty
fresh and mighty ugly after being their
targets so long-and thats how the
seventeenth got a reputation that lasted
it all through the war we werent
scared boys any longer we were good
soldiers we had learned our lesson

  corporal candage rose to his feet
looked up at the ceiling and saluted

  and the man who taught that lesson
to us-by showing courage of a kind
that aint set forth in make-believe war
pictures-was our colonel henry
marston he didnt insult his boys by
pleading with em to be brave and he
didnt let his boys make fools of them-
selves

  marstons emotion was choking him
once more

  gentlemen he declared i realize
my responsibilities now more than i
ever did in my life please do not mis-

understand me in my poor way i can
add nothing to my familys record but

what has been left to me- he

paused unable to proceed

  general marston volunteered one
of the group we know you better than
you know us perhaps my sister who
is a widow got back all of her money
out of that corporation which was
ruined by other men than you-and i
know that the money came out of your
pocket thats all i need to know
about a man

  i callate that we have bothered the
general enough for one day said cor-
poral candage briskly again relieving
the situation we will now go and
pay our respects to governor thorn-
ton tention

  they all came to their feet as nimbly
as they could

   bout face  march 

the new adjutant general was left
alone with his thoughts and his duties

chapter x

  half an hour after the old soldiers
had marched out of his office general
marston received a call from buttrick
the governors secretary buttrick
brought a note-a square of paper
headed executive chamber folded
carelessly without envelope with lead
pencil his excellency had scrawled an
invitation to dinner that evening at the
executive mansion no fuss and
feathers family party come as a
friend of the family he added under
his signature

  marston studying the note reflected
whimsically that the social aphorism
required at least two amendments in
his case

  we invite our enemies to breakfast
our acquaintances to dinner but our
friends to lunch

  marstons obedience to the code in
the case of breakfast had been invol-
untary-and his enemies had been
technical ones merely eating colonel
barnabys food

  the luncheon two days before had
been a hurried affair because the gov-
ernor had business on his mind the


the vovulatr magazine

new adjutant general was certainly not
there as a friend he was presented to
mrs thornton who received him with
the tolerance expected from the wife of
a public man who is forever bringing
somebody home with him as for miss
aileen she seemed to find the plane of
the formal meeting much more to her
taste than the mild freedom of the
unconventional first acquaintance she
made no reference to the first meeting
and seemed to be entirely willing to let
her father do all the talking for the
luncheon party

 as to dinner-

  marston took up his pen

  no need to make it formal general
the governor said word of mouth
would be all right

  my respects and thanks to the gov-
ernor i accept with pleasure

  mr buttrick relaxed his official de-
meanor he was a young man with a
brisk manner a pompadour eyes close-
pinched at the top of a big nose and
one corner of his mouth had an upward
twist which showed that mr buttrick
was inore or less sure of himself when
he relaxed he propped himself on one
corner of the generals desk

  you probably dont remember me
general but i used to do newspaper
work-political end-and it was my
business to know everybody and i
have bumped into you a few times
here and there oh just casually he
broke in on marstons polite apology
never had to interview you want
to add my little mite to the general
congratulations im mighty glad the
old man is waking up and weeding out
some of the mossbacks and dubs he
has been lugging too much of the old
gang i have told him so something
has been happening to him hes will-
ing to take a little good advice once in
a while hell take it from you all
right let me tell you youre stand-
ing in mighty clever with him

  fm not in the political game at all
protested the general

  whas at  demanded the brisk
mr buttrick with a profound wink
dont put pepper in nunkys tea
the secretary was very affable and

plainly felt on easy terms of familiarity
with his fellow lieutenant t have just
drum-majored that battle-scarred vet-
eran procession into the executive
chamber and i heard what they said
about your appointment and about you
and about the governors political good-
ness and general wisdom and be-
lieve me the old man is some tickled
why six of those hornbeams are voters
with the other side-hold their jobs
though because we cant kick out
grand army men youre a tidy op-
erator general take it from me

 i assure you-

  its all right its in the family
we dont talk outside i thought id
let you know that you have delighted
the old man

  mr buttrick went on his way

  i wonder if a politician thinks
everything in this world between men
is figured on a political basis mused
marston not wholly pleased by the
commendation he bad received nev-
ertheless putting his personal case to
one side he decided that if the gov-
ernors new progressiveness was viewed
with favor even by the opposition fur-
ther efforts could not be condemned as
mere political activity appreciation in
high quarters was not displeasing if
the governor thought well of him so
much the better for the adjutant gen-
erals department

  he finished his days work went to
his hotel and dressed for dinner with
a contented sense that the world was
going very well with him

  at the executive mansion he was
shown in to the governor evidently by
special direction in a sort of den where
his excellency was busy with a lapful
of newspapers his excellency was in
his usual garb marston a bit discon-
certed wondered whether the phrase
no fuss no feathers was equivalent
to a command from the throne for
mufti but the governor paid no more
attention to the attire of his guest than
he regularly did to his own

  i wanted to have a word with you
marston before we sit down with the
folks i have been afraid of what the
grand army boys might do or think in
the dictator



regard to dumping wade you know
theyre pretty stuffy about their privi-
leges and their precedents but a dele-
gation waited on- me to-day to thank
me for appointing you-think its time
to be modern in our military plans-
think the country generally needs to
wake up

  as for my part faltered marston
as for me being-i think it was sim-
ply a little personal--

  thats exactly it sir it was per-
sonal thats why i am so grateful
to you you have tact and a follow-
ing

  but the political--

  the political part of it will take care
of itself when a man has a following
the grand army isnt in politics of
course but the local post in this city
is going to send out some kind of a let-
ter-something that will help me so
enough about that were coming along
fine im glad to have you here in the
family to-night i want you to meet
lesbitt maybe im a little previous in
placing him in the family his excel-
lency chatted on plainly in high good
humor but it looks much that way
young lesbitt you know-burton les-
bitt the son of lesbitt of the paper
trust i own the lands where the pulp
wood grows and lesbitt has the paper
mills the combination is all right
eh the governor chuckled but
for heavens sake dont let on i ever
told you im letting the womenfolks
run the matrimonial department guess
wed better be moving on marston
he hobbled toward the door kicking
the scattered newspapers in his prog-
ress and speaking of matrimony

  he halted and nudged his guest with
a rude elbow and marston discovered
that rutillus thorntons humor was of
a grain to match his demeanor

  speaking of matrimony we have
somebody for you to be nice to this
evening-somebody around your age
general mrs trueworthy folks met
up with her when they were in florida
last winter prancing it in society
widow of jarvis trueworthy the
steamship man and she is rich hand-

some and has fallen in love with this
state eh marston 

  and again he nudged his guest and
led the way

  the edge was gone from marstons
sense of contented good humor when he
followed to the drawing-room he did
not know exactly why he knew that
he did not relish the brand of facetious-
ness handled by the governor he was
not ready to admit to himself that being
ticketed as fitting consort for a middle-
aged widow had wounded the ever-ver-
dant and masculine idea that the right
man is never too old to be a maidens
suitor whether he resented the pres-
ence of a young and eligible gallant as
accepted escort for aileen thornton he
certainly did not argue with himself

  he entered the drawing-room was
greeted was presented and responded
without displaying special enthusiasm in
the social amenities he took in the
governors lady when dinner was an-
nounced she was scarcely older than
himself as strikingly handsome as her
daughter he felt more of that strange
discontent when he looked at the mother
and found her so much of a girl some-
how he did not feel his natural and
manly impulse of pleasure at coming in
contact with wholesome young man-
hood when he had chatted for a mo-
ment with young lesbitt in the draw-
ing-room when the governor had first
spoken of the rich mans son marston
had mentally pictured a vapid young
cub sicklied oer with metropolitan de-
generacies but now across the table
young lesbitt his tan set off by the
expanse of linen beneath his chin his
strong brown hands in silhouette
against the napkin he was unfolding
was explaining his regret at missing
the spectacle of the war game to which
he had been invited as a member of the
governors party he had been in direct
charge of the installation of turbines
at their canadian mill and a treacher-
ous cofferdam had delayed the work
men who could build great works had
always been admired by marston this
young engineer who mentioned his
exploits so modestly stirred something
like jealous envy


the	magazine

  he found himself studying the atti-
tude of aileen thornton toward this-
so family favor and fortunes presaged
-complement of herself but the
young lady was demurely sphinxlike
and he was conscious that he was rather
irritated because she was so noncom-
mittal he would have liked to know
-then he damned his mental intrusion
into matters which wrere none of his
business

  he turned to mrs trueworthy-and
found her charming

  she had heard the stedmans-the
stedmans of washington-speak of
him so many times and of his father
colonel stedman was such an admirer
and their work in organizing the loyal
legion had brought them so close to-
gether

  marston beamed on her

  yes and her grandfather had also
known his father

  might he be allowed to ask--- he
marked her pretty flush of pride when
she answered and understood the ca-
ressing tone with which she voiced her
reverent affection

  my grandfather was general cav-
anor-i was born leila cavanor

  i know he said warmly of course
i know llis book autographed to my
father is one of my dearest posses-
sions he turned to mrs thornton in
order that he might include her in a
three-cornered conversation after he
had uttered his commonplaces he had
been at a bit of a loss for further mate-
rial in her case there was no longer
any paucity of topic-and the gover-
nors lady displayed appreciative inter-
est even the younger folks across the
table seemed to find this conversation
of more account than their own ex-
changes and listened

  the governor took the lead in conver-
sation after he had vigorously cleared
his dishes and while the others ate
rather he discoursed in a monologue on
politics he continued that monologue
after they had retired from the table
and they listened meekly and when
he had said his say he excused himself
and retired abruptly on the plea that
he had matters to attend to

  lesbitt had noted marstons respect-
ful attention

  of course you are interested in poli-
tics general he remarked he chuck-
led boyishly ill say frankly the sub-
ject bores me i had not the least idea
of what the governor was talking about
i suppose i ought to know but i have
been in business but you politicians

  i am not in politics mr lesbitt

  but your position-a state office

  i simply have charge of the military
department

  i fear you are speaking too softly
about your abilities said aileen
thornton with a smile father tells
me everything and he says you are his
best bower from his choice of lan-
guage i fear my father has whiled away
evenings in lumber camps playing
euchre

  i value your fathers good will
miss thornton stated marston rather
coldly but i dont think i deserve
his compliments if he refers to my
activity in politics i dont know the
game

  i figure it is more or less a game
suggested lesbitt a boardful of
checkers and everybody trying to get up
into the king row all i can see is a
scramble toward that king row-trying
to get into office perhaps after they
get there they all become statesmen and
do a lot for the country but they seem
to be only using their left hand once
in a while for the country while their
right hand is busy all the time keeping
themselves in office

  i fear that you also are decrying
your political shrewdness expostu-
lated mrs true worthy you have
just showed a great deal of knowledge
of the subject

  oh i am only quoting dad dad
is the bright thinker in our family
dad was expressing the business mans
view

  he turned to marston and spoke in-
genuously 

  i wanted to be a soldier general
but dad wouldnt hear to it you have
the job id like
the dictator



  and i was just thinking a little
while ago that if i could design a tur-
bine pit and install the wheels id be
sure i had done something worth while
in the world confessed marston

  mrs thornton had subsided into
frank boredom when the governor be-
gan his monologue this persistence in
the matter of fact seemed to prove a
bit irritating

  and if the mutual-admiration soci-
ety will now take a recess of a few min-
utes we may be able to clear the atmos-
phere of politics with a little music
she suggested aileen please

  the girl turned to marston after she
had seated herself at the piano mis-
chief sparkled in her eyes she touched
the keys lightly phrasing an undertone
of melody which was barely audible
it was apparently mere careless pref-
ace a running of the scales

  i hope you have a favorite com-
poser general do ask me to play what
you like ill consider it an honor

  he searched his thoughts trying to
remember desiring to please her then
he became conscious that there was a
little lilt threading among the soft
notes he recognized it as my hero
she smiled with even more arch mis-
chief when his countenance told her
that he knew what she was playing

  remember that my debt of gratitude
is still unpaid general marston may
we not exchange music for bravery

  somehow he could not command the
smart wit he had displayed in their first
meeting he stammered when he at-
tempted to reply he was conscious
that he was just a bit nettled because
she was teasing him it seemed like a
childs playfulness toward an elder in-
stead of the more charming liberty on
the plane of intimacy between friends
he wondered why he was allowing this
young woman to provoke discomposure
in him

  while the general is thinking you
might play my favorite suggested
lesbitt

  yes chopins funeral march
im not in the mood for it burton
really for a man who would a soldier
be your ideas in music are depressing

  she turned to the piano and began
to play without waiting for further
suggestions

  mrs trueworthy sang later sang
so wonderfully with such thrilling con-
tralto that marston stared at her with
frank admiration his eyes were low-
ered and he felt a little guilty when
aileen thornton intercepted his stare

  there were guests after a time in-
formal callers members of the state
capitals official corps miss thorn-
ton found opportunity to talk apart with
marston

 shes wonderful i think-our
friend she told him the direction of
her gaze marking whom she meant
and i am so glad you like her so
much

 but-

  i have ears to hear and eyes to see
general marston and it is natural-
for both of you you have so much
in common im glad we are to have
so much of you in the capital city
leila is to be with us for a long time
we hope and its nice to be able to bring
companionable folks to her

  there was no hint of mischief in her
eyes then there was no suggestion of
mental reservation in her tones she
was manifestly in sincere-earnest her
next words convinced him and touched
him

  i have no illusions in regard to our-
selves-myself and my father and
mother general marston i know ex-
actly how the really refined and polite
folks like yourself-the folks with

real ancestry-- no no i am not to

be put down sir  she spiritedly over-
rode his protests of course its rude
for me to talk to you in this fashion
i know it is i suppose im only the
daughter of my father when i do it
i know leila cares for us very much
-for just ourselves and we love her
so much and are so proud of her im
saying it all awkwardly i know but
i do hope that youll come often to this
house we want her to meet folks of
her own kind and you-

  miss thornton please-please he
pleaded gently this outburst aston-
ished him but her ingenuousness and


the cpotpulatr magazine

her pride in her avowal appealed to his
most generous sympathies and absolved
her in his estimation i know you do
not mean to classify me as a snob i
am honored by an invitation to this
house i say that to you with all the
sincerity of my soul and ill be de-
lighted to come whenever i am invited
not because of the guests but because
of my hosts

  i believe you are sincere enough
yourself to understand my father 

  i do understand him he has opened
his heart to me a bit

  and i know him of course he has
always told me everything i used to be
silly-i am silly now every once in a
while i have been a traitor to my fa-
ther in my thoughts i used to give my
dream father the best place in my
heart and i know that you understand
what i mean by my dream father she
added wistfully

  i believe i do he returned with
comforting smile

  she regarded him with strange in-
tentness i-i- she faltered do

you know when i saw you first-

she stopped in confusion

  well he queried gently but in
spite of himself his smile faded he
guessed at her meaning and was a bit
shocked it was certainly flattering to
be selected as aileen thorntons ideal
in any relationship-but as father his
expression hinted that something very
like consternation had taken possession
of him and consternation in the ex-
treme did overwhelm aileen thornton
at that moment

  i did not mean that- you have

misunderstood it was the ideal-no
of course not you you are too young

  he was smiling again

  she stamped her foot furious at her-
self

  theres no mistaking me general
marston i am rutillus thorntons
own daughter as little tact-as little

  believe me he said earnestly if
i have inspired any interest-the slight-
est-for any reason--in you it delights
me it is like a precious gift

  forgive my folly she entreated
getting control of herself her tones
cold and now perhaps i shall show
more of the thornton tactlessness but
i cant help  it its choking me it
must come out general marston my
father talks to me-i have told you-he
tells me everything i help him all i
can with the knowledge his money has
paid for he has been generous with me
in everything he is worrying he
wants to be elected again he is an old
man and an old mans heart is easily
broken he doesnt show to the world
what he shows to me its almost piti-
ful the way he depends on you to help
him the idea seems to have come
over him suddenly he is wise in poli-
tics  it must be true that you can help
him

  i shall do all in my power to help
your father miss thornton of course
it must be after my own fashion for i
do not understand the sort of game
which politicians play i have modest
notions of my own ability i have
promised your father to help him
promise me too i shall feel that
you are forgiving me

  rather allow me to make the prom-
ise so that i can be giving you gratitude
instead of forgiveness i do promise
i pledge you my word

  she took his hand in both of her
own pressed it fervently and hurried
away

  general marston had a little of the
cynics tougher fiber mingled with the
softer elements of his abundant good
nature he took account of stock be-
fore he went to sleep that night and
realized that he was harnessed to the
thornton chariot in a manner which
made him the wheel horse of the out-
fit  and he did not exactly relish the
position any more than he relished hav-
ing been selected by an impulsive young
lady as her dream father

chapter xi

  the next day the honorable stedman
sawtelle walked in on general hart
marston propped himself on his palms
leaned over the desk and said with
the dictator



a convincing air of finality marston
youre a devilish poor politician 

  the young man had been reviewing
his promises of the night before had
been taking account of his modest stock
of political perspicacity and had not
been cheered by the prospect

  he looked up meekly at mr saw-
telle

  mr sawtelle was attorney general of
the state and was a man whose judg-
ment was unquestionably good

  i agree with you sir admitted
marston

  your insulation against political
currents seems to be perfect absolutely
perfect

  marston did not welcome a verbal
duel with the attorney general whose
tartncss of rejoinder was one of the
well-known features of the states pub-
lic life

  i have always been on the outside
of politics mr sawtelle

  what if you have if you were
 the outside of a circus tent and
heard a brass band and the crack of the
ringmasters whip you could under-
stand more or less of what was going
on inside couldnt you

  i dont see the analogy sir

  deaf dumb and blind eh now
dont give me that marston optic cold
bath protested sawtelle drawing back
from the generals stare and taking a
scat beside the desk i mean what i
say for the best i havent any dele-
gated right to bawl you out but i must
say that you have spilled the beans
marston queried with his eyes in dig-
nified silence

  if anybody had told me that youd
either be picked for a state office by
rute thornton and would take one
from him id never have believed it
thats the reason why you have slipped
one over  us

  i protest sir

  so do i so do the boys we
werent expecting anything of the sort
to happen we were lying low wait-
ing to spring the surprise it had to
be a surprise we were not letting in
outsiders because outsiders dont al-
ways understand the importance of

keeping their mouths shut but at the
same time we did think-even though
you are a rank outsider in politics-
that some inkling of the thing must get
to you we were figuring on you for
a safe proposition because we didnt
think youd possibly get into the mess
youre in now

  what mess

  office holder by the gift of rute
thornton perfect insulation i say
again marston didnt you ever get
one little spark

  i think youll have to be explicit
sir

  i reckon so with diagrams  with
full and complete rules for self-meas-
urement with footnotes marston
listen here didnt you know that you
were going to be put into the primaries
as a candidate for the nomination
against rute thornton 

  i certainly did not know it

  well ill admit it wasnt planned
to hit you over the head with the fact
and then explain all details after you
recovered your senses it was a touchy
proposition and we were handling it
carefullv we--

  mr sawtelle you must know that
i would not have considered any such
action

  oh yes you would stated the em-
issary forget for one moment that
you are tied up to thornton by this
state jot suppose you are free ana
im putting the matter up to you now
what 

  my finances would not----

  all looked out for marston in
these new days of primaries it isnt
the bunch of boodle which wins

  i couldnt take money from any-
body

  look here my dear fellow presi-
dents of the united states-honorable
and high-minded men-are elected by
contributions from their friends and
supporters you are not assuming any
title to saintship are you

  governor thornton has the office

and the power-

  thornton was nominated by the old
convention system-by the party ma-
chine this year we have the pri-


the popular magazine

maries the people are having the say
the people of this state never wanted
thornton-they dont want him now
they are sick of the old sore-paw po-
litical hounds

 and i am not a man who would

  you are just the man who would
you havent any perspective on your-
self and on the peculiar situation the
boys have been studying it and we
know what were talking about this
psychological-moment talk has been
much overworked but thats exactly
what this moment is the name of
marston is one to conjure with right
now were having a flareback of the
old war spirit the country is wak-
ing up to needs of defense we want
to mix into this situation some of the
blood of our old war governor hold
on dont try to tell me about political
exigencies marston dont undertake
to give me lessons on the manner of
managing political stampedes  i know
the moment is ripe for a stampede
and youre the one to head it-the only
one i insist your grandfather was
our war governor your father was our
greatest soldier you are as clean as
a hounds tooth have no political rag-
tags hanging to you will appeal to the
people as a marston and more espe-
cially as an opportunity to kick loose
from all machine harness in this first
exercise of their primary rights they
are anxious to make an object lesson of
the job

  marston shook his head

  what do you mean by that de-
manded mr sawtelle sharply dont
you believe that i know what im talk-
ing about when i talk politics

  i am certainly not going to dispute
your knowledge in that field sir

  by gad you dont mean that youre
going to refuse the governorship of this
state do you  handed to you on a
silver platter

  with all due respect to you sir i
think that you are exaggerating the
situation a bit i am not vain enough
to presume that the people will give me
the great honor merely because i reach

out my hand i am not qualified to

yj

  come down to cases with me mar-
ston youre an honest man just now
youre only beating around the bush
whether youre trying to fool me or
yourself with such talk i dont care
i demand candor because i have been
candid myself youre holding back
because you have accepted an office
from rute thornton well resign
no i shall not resign

  but its only a pancake position
compared with the governorship

  i can do a great deal for the mili-
tary forces of the state

  but you can do a blamed sight more
as commander in chief come across
-come across marston cried the at-
torney general with impatience im
over seven i dont like this stalling

  i dont want to be governor-thats
sufficient

  no its not when your party needs
you-makes a call on you only once
in a generation does a call like this
come to a man who is outside the game
as it is usually played you owe it to
the memory of your father and grand-
father to accept its their party thats
calling you

  marston had been objecting with a
stiffness in which there was a tinge of
embarrassment his astonishment had
not wholly left him the result of his
conflicting emotions was to surround
him with an air which seemed to lack
ingenuousness he realized that him-
self both the rebuke and the appeal
from the attorney general had touched
him in tender spots

  i dont mean to assume either airs
or virtues sir he replied his de-
meanor softened and there was no
doubt as to his sincerity if i have
appeared awkward you must remember
that you have jumped me bear with
me a moment please i want to under-
stand hasnt it been party politics to
give a governor a complimentary sec-
ond term

  it has been machine politics but
now the people are going to run mat-
ters

  but governor thornton has-
the dictator



  has trampled with cowhide boots
over all the sensibilities in this state
marston oh im not going to discuss
his manners at table dont think im
that sort of a critic we elect gover-
nors instead of dancing masters and
professors of deportment in this state
but his type of man is no longer the
type which should govern us the old
gang needs an object lesson and thats
why we want to turn him down for
renomination when we lick rute
thornton in the primaries we are serv-
ing notice on the old bosses to keep out
of our politics

  and yet governor thornton has
done effective work in straightening
out the finances he is honest in his
administration

  the attorney general gave the adju-
tant general a quick glance of examina-
tion and appraisal

  you understand that i myself am
not saying that he would pick pockets
or loot the state treasury marston
but how does it happen that thornton
has taken a man of your stamp into
camp there has been some gossiping
and wondering since you took this
office

  again did marston under the keen
scrutiny of the lawyer exhibit signs of
his peculiar embarrassment

  i dont think that i have been taken
into camp- as you put it sir but i
will admit that a little association with
governor thornton has given me a new
and different idea of him i am going
to be frank and say that i would like
to see him renominated

 youre a devil of an encouraging
proposition as the opposition candi-
date  growled the attorney general

  i am not the opposition candidate
and i dont intend to be

  marston were going to draft you
you must serve we dont want thorn-
ton he has been a ruler during his
first term in his second term with no
further need to smooth down folks he
will be an unbearable tyrant and
theres no telling what harm he will do
the interests in this state working with
that bunch of officeholders who believe
that to - the victors belong the spoils

they may be honest enough men in
private affairs but in the public mat-
ters they employ the old discredited
tactics all the business interests m
this state are banded together to make
progress faster during the next few
years than ever before just now the
times are ripe for establishing new en-
terprises coaxing in new investors and
settlers thornton and his bunch will
surely keep such folks and such capital
out resign this position take whats
coming to you

  but there are hundreds of men in
this state better qualified better known
equally--

  no sir the situation is extraor-
dinary thornton can win in a regular
political contest i have told you that
this must be a surprise-a stampede
the others you talk about are merely
politicians-or men who havent the
right name behind them i tell you
marston your name is one to conjure
by you are the one man who can
defeat rute thornton in the pri-
maries

  do you absolutely believe that
speaking as a politician asked mar-
ston showing a more lively interest
than he had displayed before

  absolutely theres no time to
groom and work out a regular political
candidate in the ordinary way

  mr sawtelle you have asked me
for candor you shall have it i want
to state my side in this thing before
you intrust any more political secrets
to me what you have imparted i have
not asked for except the last and that
was to fortify me in my decision i
most certainly will not stand in the pri-
maries i shall come out to-day with a
declaration that i intend to support
governor thornton

  but thats lugging this office into
politics

  i hope not furthermore you have
already informed me that im a devilish
poor politician

  marston whats the matter with
you why are you perpetrating this
folly

  because i have pledged myself to
support and help governor thornton


the popular magazine

with all my power sir until you came
in just now i was wondering how on
earth i could help him knowing as well
as you do that im a poor politician
now i see a way to keep my promise
i know you and your race too well
marston to believe for one moment
that this dinky job has influenced you
in this stand youre taking what has
rute thornton done to you anyway 
id like to know so that i can play a
little better game in politics

  he has neither bribed nor hypno-
tized me-i can avouch that returned
the general with a smile by which he
tried to placate the sullen agent of the
opposition

  by the gods this comes pretty near
to betrayal of your party marston
blazed the attorney general refusing to
be placated i dont believe thornton
can be reelected you are turning the
state over to the other political party
making an innocent man the scape-
goat in politics is quite the usual plan
i believe sir i have heard so i say
again i think you are exaggerating my
importance however i am going to
carry out my pledges made as a man
rather than undertake any wild-goose
chase in politics

  rute thornton has one pet thats
properly trained-ill say that mr
sawtelle picked up his hat

  general marston bowed

  thank you sir politics i believe
has a language to go with its prac-
tices

  mr sawtelle got as far as the door
then he whirled and came back he
was thoroughly visibly cruelly angry
this anger indicated how important he
considered his mission-how vital to
the success of the plot he estimated the
cooperation of hart marston

  im going up to see the governor
marston if we have got to have him
for two years more i prefer to tell him
my side of this thing before anybody

else gets to him i shall-

  the generals composure left him
suddenly

  the other insults i have taken in
the course of politics mr sawtelle but
this insinuation that i shall run to the

governor with a tale is a damnable out-
rage on my decency

  i shall arrange for a few conditions
to cover my personal interests pro-
ceeded sawtelle calmly all of us
state officers may as well get all the
protection we can and in order that
the governor may know how faithful
to him you are marston i shall tell
him at once that he can owe his re-
nomination to you hold  lm an-
gry  i admit it you have given me
a devil of a flop but when i tell rute
thornton the truth i shall be making
up for some nasty talk i have made to
you

  will you kindly omit all mention
of me mr sawtelle

  but that callous gentleman was not
influenced by the freezing tones

  i must insist marston youre
making a big sacrifice and i dont want
you to lose one mite of the advantage
that ought to come to you he started
again for the door im afraid youre
too backward to do much talking in
your own behalf thats why youll
never get very far in politics unless
your friends turn to and help a bit

  curse politics cried general mar-
ston soulfully

  exactly my own state of mind at
this moment declared the attorney
general and he banged the door behind
him

  in spite of the fact that he appeared
to have fulfilled his pledge to the father
and his promise to the daughter in sud-
den and amazing fashion marston did
not sit down to his duties wearing the
air of a successful diplomat he
scowled and slatted his papers about his
desk that insufferable and sarcastic
politician had called him rute thorn-
tons pet he began to wonder how
the men of the state at large would
view this new devotion of his he
understood well that in this selfish
world folks are apt to interpret deeds
according to their own prejudices and
to misjttdge motives as spite or envy
prompts

  it occurred to him that at least one
attitude was enjoined on him if he
wished to escape further malice his
the dictator



duties as a dream father must needs
be circumspect and circumscribed he
had no appetite for any reputation as
a fortune hunter in his own heart he
knew how far he was removed from
any such activity he found himself
wishing that miss aileen thornton
would soon and publicly be ticketed as
the fiancee of young mr lesbitt then
he ascribed his sudden melancholy to
the irritating new problems which pub-
lic life had forced on him

chapter xii

  the governor was affable the next
time he came in contact with his adju-
tant general but he was by no means
effusive he took an entirely matter-
of-fact view of the affair

  so sted sawtelle had a dream did
he  he chuckled he came to me and
snapped that whiplash tongue-but we
have got so in this state that we dont
pay much attention to what sawtelle
says

  nor did i stated marston nev-
ertheless in his heart-and he was dis-
tinctly ashamed of the wounded vanity
he felt-he was a bit disappointed be-
cause his excellency did not express
more lively sense of gratitude he was
not realizing that potentates too often
lack perspective on their weaknesses
that the possession of power blinds a
man to the possibilities of reverses

  of course  sted didnt understand
how closely you and i are tied up de-
clared his excellency his air was that
of condescending proprietorship and
marston winced he was finding
fresh evidence of what his new part-
nership meant he wondered whether
his natural good humor smoothed the
situation for him and he warned him-
self that pride may easily become prig-
gishness

  when sted saw that he had got one
foot wet he went and jumped in all
over the governor went on thats
characteristic hes impulsive im glad
because he had a chance to see that the
men i pick are loyal he slapped
marstons shoulder and i appreciate
loyalty dont let anybody fool you
b p

  and outside of loyalty said mar-
ston wishing to minimize the affair
sawtelles project was a silly one
absolutely crazy agreed the gov-
ernor with serenity

  i would not like to be nominated
as governor under any such circum-
stances

  you couldnt have been i had the
thing right here stated his excellency
pinching thumb and forefinger a lit-
tle while back some of the kid-glove
fellows tried to throw a scare into me
they said the young chaps of the state
were out for my scalp but here you
are most representative one of em
all my first lieutenant again he
clapped marstons shoulder now let
em talk they cant say much he
limped away chuckling he left his
adjutant general wrestling with some
rather large thoughts

  those thoughts were further ampli-
fied a few days later

  a limousine swung to the curb ahead
of him as he was marching briskly
downtown from the statehouse the
governors daughter leaned out and
waited for his approach with her in
the car was mrs trueworthy and both
of them gave him unaffectedly warm
greeting

  we are told that you are most won-
drously busy these days said aileen
but does that excuse you for jour
total neglect of us 

  can it be that somebody is slander-
ing my life of dreamy leisure miss
thornton 

  oh we know that you are busy sir
and important in these days too
additional and more malicious slan-
der  he declared with a smile

  you shall do penance by being sen-
tenced to the companionship of your
chief slanderers general the girl
opened the door of the car into your
cell sir

  he remembered certain resolutions
he had made after the tempestuous
departure of the honorable stedman
sawtelle he had resolved to starve
gossip if possible when aileen looked
at him and smiled he fell to wonder-
ing just how much he was willing to al-


the popular magazine

low his own pride and other folks
tongues to command his acts

  and while he was wondering he fal-
tered some sort of banality concerning
office confinement and need of exercise
the girl stared at him with frank won-
derment and was equally frank in her
speech with some of the paternal blunt-
ness which amused and disconcerted
marston on occasions

  general marston if you do not care
to ride with us or have important busi-
ness for goodness sake say so

  aileen protested mrs true-
worthy gently

  marston raised his hat and entered
the car mumbling apology for his hesi-
tation he was irritated to find him-
self awkward and ill at ease in the pres-
ence of this explosive young person

  i wish to thank you for important
services rendered she went on i do
not wish to expose political secrets by
shouting those thanks to you across a
curbstone now wait do not bother
me with the obvious dont say what
they always say when they try to be
polite dont say it was a mere noth-
ing-glad to oblige and all that you
promised to help my old father you
went right away and did more single-
handed than all the rest of those flub-
dub politicians

 my dear aileen more of her
companions gentle protest

  you smoothed everything so that
he will be renominated without opposi-
tion

  honestly i cant claim for myself

  i know you did my father says
you did whatever other faults the
thorntons have they dont lie to each
other

  i too have heard your praises
chanted by those in high places af-
firmed the widow with a charming
smile

  i do hope youll overlook my awk-
wardness in discussing the value of my
services said marston manfully be-
cause i have placed no value on them
but as for the spirit-well my whole
heart went into the thing in your fa-
thers service

  i have a most insane hankering to
clap my hands and shout atta boy 
confessed miss thornton with a laugh
of reckless mischief

  its a rebuke and i accept it said
the general

  no no its not a rebuke sir
she was instantly grave

  yes it was miss thornton i feel
myself propped on stilts in language
every now and then when i am in the
presence of ladies that may be be-
cause i lack experience in the usual
chatter of drawing-rooms

  intimating that i am a mistress of
chatter sir

  not for one moment i mean that
you are deliciously natural and honest
and open and unaffected-a real girl-
and i like it and i like you for it he
declared boldly i told you id help
your father all i possibly could-and i
did so in my own way and if i have
pleased you and him im mighty glad
there

  there she echoed now we are
getting comfy and social and you are
coming right along with us up to the
house to have tea and leila will sing
your favorite song you can be thinking
it up

  while she was brewing the tea he
asked politely for mr lesbitt

  i was hoping he was still in the city
-that i might meet him here to-day
i admired his ways and his views

  he eyed her a bit intently telling
himself that he hoped she would betray
by look or word that the romance was
nearly ready to blossom for the public
gaze to note-the vulgar gaze which
might persist in ascribing mean motives
to those on whom aileen thornton cast
an occasional glance

  oh burton has gone back into the
woods with a new paper mill in his
pocket or in his mind or in a shawl
strap or somewhere she said de-
murely after the election we are all
going up hunting i shall stand on a
limb and boo at him like an owl well
all live in a lodge in the vast wilder-
ness-fathers wilderness all blocked
ofimay timber cruisers posts will you
come up with us mister general will
the dictator



you come and bring your sword apd kill
the wild animals who threaten us will
you come if leila comes to sing to you
under the hunters moon 

  yes he agreed

  you shall have a summons served
on you it will be on birch bark and
sealed with spruce gum but you shall
not receive that invitation unless you
are more neighborly here in the city
-no matter if you have grown so busy
and important will you come to din-
ner to-morrow evening

  yes with pleasure

  he was ashamed of thdse past pon-
derings of his when he had pared rules
of conduct like a snob

  from that time on his welcome in
the executive mansion was an assured
and grateful relief from the loneliness
of his hotel his excellency harness-
ing his willing aid with new responsi-
bilities demanded his presence at fre-
quent conferences in the paper-littered
den he was the ever-dependable and
desirable guest at table he was the
tactful and unobtrusive master of cere-
monies bridging the gap left by the
host who was usually contemptuously
absent from social festivities

  and the politicians who relished and
quoted the questionable sarcasms from
stedman sawtelles tongue called him
-without malice but with a grin-
rute thorntons pet

  governor thornton was unanimously
renominated in the primaries but the
vote for him represented but little more
than half of the regular party strength
as gauged by the regular elections in
past years

  in the campaign the qpposition made
much of this as indicating a party
slump

  but the governor was serenely in-
different to any possibilities of portent
in the figures nor did the opposition
believe half the claims it made the
governor was the only candidate for
the nomination and in most of the
legislative districts there were few con-
tests busy voters stayed at their jobs
and let the politicians do the nominat-
ing the party was in no wise alarmed
and the election which followed the

primaries justified their faith in the
endurance of natural majorities

  governor thornton was reelected
as the head of the ticket he even ran
ahead of the regular party vote in that
election 

  however in other directions there
was trouble which threatened the whole
fabric of his administration

  he had persistently clamored at the
state committee for work in the legis-
lative districts he had received only
lukewarm support only indifferent
service he was not of the sort who
could rally workers on the face of
the returns the complexion of the in-
coming legislature was uncertain the
two parties were so nearly balanced that-
a working majority for either was in
doubt until recounts and hearings
should settle contests

  and the legislature was to elect most
of the profitable state offices control
the state budget distribute state pat-
ronage and in general do service for
the deserving patriots of the political
brigade

  that prospect of being a king without
a realm stirred rutillus thornton more
profoundly than any setback in his tem-
pestuous life

  the members of the state committee
met in executive session after the elec-
tion in order to receive final bills of ex-
pense and wind up campaign affairs

  upon the committee came bursting
his excellency profane belligerent
caustic accusatory and wholly careless
of the privacy of the executive ses-
sion which had been imposed by the
cautious for the express purpose of
keeping the governor away from them

  you listen to me first and then get
into your holes and go on with your
executive session you confounded
woodchucks what has happened is
what i predicted would happen if you
didnt get out and hustle you there
stokes-adams-blake-the whole of
you  what did i tell you 

  nobody seemed to have memory or
sufficiently luminous language to state

  i told you that i didnt worry about
myself i knew i could and would be
elected i told you to look after the


the populatr magazine

legislative districts i did what work
i was able to myself districts in my
own native county have come along all
right because i gave them my own at-
tention and i personally ran ahead
of my ticket but as for the rest of
you weve got to wait till after the
legislature meets to make sure that we
have a working majority thats a
nice situation for me to be in-for our
party to be in not sure of my execu-
tive council not sure of being able to
handle finances or elect our state of-
ficers but let me tell you my vote
shows that the people of this state
want me to be at the head of affairs
if that is so then im going to run mat-
ters according to my best judgment
fm going to have a council arjd state
officers of my own party and by the
gods the critters who get under my
feet when im acting for the state will
get stepped on anybody got anything
to say

  a committeeman ventured on defense
of his fellows

  i think your excellency that an
analysis of conditions in the legislative
districts will show that personalities of
the candidates-

  to blazes with your personalities
talk shouted the governor dont
you think i fully realize what my own
personality is you may think i fool
myself about it but that isnt so he
glared at them and no man had the
hardihood to reply to that amazing con-
fession i got out and worked for
myself-and i am not ashamed of my
figures the rest of you didnt work
let me add that i am not done work-
ing i dont propose to see state pat-
ronage handled by the opposition while
i am governor

  the votes have been cast there
isnt much we can do about it now
suggested one of the group

  the governor banged his fist on the
table

  perhaps there isnt much you can
do he sneered but theres a whole
lot i can do if i am forced to do it
ill give the politicians of this state an
object lesson in results now go ahead
and add up figures and pay bills if

you need more money call on me he
looked them over with the supercilious-
ness of an employer viewing inefficient
clerks and then stamped out

  personally i have reached the point
where rute thorntons bellowings im-
press me about as much as the mooings
of a durham steer stated a committee-
man but he is the head of our ticket
and when he threatens to do this and
do that on his own account-just as if
we didnt have courts and election laws
in this state-he is in a way to put us
in mighty bad gentlemen does any-
body here have any idea of what he
means to do or attempt

  yes said a man i say yes speak-
ing from what i can guess after know-
ing rute thornton all my life

  well what do you guess de-
manded the chairman testily

  that he will run over his own party
law and all to get to where he wants
to go and if we holler whoa too
loud he will back up and run over us
again about the only sensible thing
to do is to keep still and stay out of the
road until we see which way he is head-
ing

  and in that apprehensive state of
mind the state committee went on with
its labors

chapter xiii

  hart marston walked forth with
rutillus thornton

 they climbed a ledgy eminence
which thrust its bare poll above the
forest and gave them view of a vast
domain

  november rains and lashing winds
had stripped the leaves from the hard
growth the beeches birches and the
maples and the magnificent evergreens
dominated the landscape as far as
vision reached they crowned the undu-
lating hills crowded the valleys and
framed the lakes whose white-capped
waters flashed under the brilliant au-
tumn sun here and there were moun-
tains on whose peaks the first snows
gleamed

  all mine said rutillus thornton

  but he said it simply almost humbly
the dictator



if that word may be made to fit the
tone of his voice the rude arrogance
with which he so often addressed men
was gone marston looked at his host
and felt that he was meeting up with a
man he had not known before the
slouchy formal garb which he wore in
town in deference to his high office-
the silk hat and the manners which he
assumed with them-had been laid
aside it was as if an actor had doffed
a grotesque stage attire and appeared
as himself the lumbermans belted
jacket and high-laced boots fitted his
real personality

  from telos to the enchanted range
its mine he said more than a mil-
lion acres i love it every foot of it

  marston felt a sudden and strange
sense of humility in the presence of
the lord of this majestic barony

  this mans honors as chief magis-
trate of the state seemed tawdry as
marston surveyed him outside this
noble domain the man subjected himself
to sneers behind his back to the con-
tempt of sticklers for societys forms
to misunderstanding and malice

  i have beat em said rutillus
thornton they didnt want me the
first time i was elected theyll want
me less this time now that im re-
elected im going to do things to em
marston they deserve it they have
spoiled my taste for this here he
waved his cane i cant come back
here and be contented i have been
here two days and now i must hurry
to the statehouse the rest of you are
going to stay here you can enjoy it
i cant

  at the foot of the ledgy eminence
wras the land barons estate he called
his buildings camps but the struc-
tures were made of carefully chosen
logs their bark smoothed and var-
nished their interiors furnished with
luxury there were more than a dozen
of these buildings affording privacy
for groups of guests or for families
he called this house party a hunting
trip but it was a convocation of
some twoscore of the notables of the
state with their wives and daughters
they were served lavishly by a little

army of retainers the chef had been
imported from the metropolis the din-
ners in the great dining hall were daily
exhibitions of prodigality a horseman
galloped twenty miles every day across
the barony of thornton to fetch hot-
house flowers for the table

  even as marston found rutillus
thornton a more consistent and impos-
ing figure in the midst of his forests
so did he realize something which had
not occurred to him so vividly in the
tamer surroundings of the executive
mansion for compared with all this
even the executive mansion was ordi-
nary he saw aileen thornton in
truer light so far as his affairs were
concerned in realizing that he had
nothing to offer her he also awoke to
the truth that he loved her

  the conviction rather shocked him

  it was the bitter yearning tender
jealous passion which so often seizes
upon a man who has suddenly found
maidenhood compelling after he has lost
his youth

  she came up the hill to them scam-
pering with the zest and strength of
athletic girlhood she was in hunting
garb gaitered to the knees a red cap
with single upright feather cocked
smartly on her unruly curls

  i am going into the woods there
may be dragons i need a brave sol-
dier to protect me general marston
do you volunteer

  most certainly

  then its forward march i told
leila and the others to go on ahead
down the brook road we shall overtake
them

  where is burton demanded her
father

  in his camp drawing plans i think
theyre for a dam on the river styx
burton always looks well ahead into
the future

  that boy ought to forget his work
for a little while grumbled the gov-
ernor tell him he must go along
with you	

  it would be like telling you to for-
get your politics or to stop adoring this
beautiful stretch of saw logs standing


the populjr magazine

up on end we will leave you to your
devotions father

  you neednt bother to wait for me
blurted his excellency noting that the
adjutant general was lingering politely
that harum-scarum wants to race me
down this hill and i dont want to
break a leg at my time of life youd
better call on burton and insist aileen
no ill not trouble him burton
does not like folks who trouble him-
and i know you want him to like me
real well dad on mister general
on she set a brisk pace and marston
hurried away at her side

  i suppose you think im very saucy
toward my elders sir i fear that i
am but a rude tongue is a thornton
failing i am going to be very saucy
to you very saucy indeed why
havent you proposed to dear leila
he felt as if he had collided with a
hitching post in the dark he stared
at her without speech

  there must be some wonderfully
good reason sir why you havent she
is handsome and has lots of money and
you are han-you are not in love with
anybody else i know for i have asked
questions of all the folks who know
you

  his love newly discovered made him
timorous in her presence his stupe-
faction made him dumb

  i have really jumped you havent
i mister general one must be very
forward and bold and rude to be able
to jump you and yet you need to be
jumped else youd never come out
of yourself have you never thought
of proposing to leila-or to anybody
no i have not miss thornton
now please dont put all that acid
into your tone sir you mustnt think
im merely trying to tease you im
not making game of you

  he was silent

  oh im sorry you misunderstand
me i know what you think you
think im a very presuming vulgar

young woman who-

  now i protest miss thornton-i
really do he said with some heat
you know nothing about my thoughts
and they are certainly not-

  and its none of my business any-
way eh 

  no he snapped since you will
persist

  there she cried with real relief
im glad youre nicely provoked this
genteel iciness always awes me it
seems sort of superhuman when any-
body gets real cross and answers me
back i feel right on the same comfort-
able level with that person i think
id honestly enjoy a spat with you
im at your service anything to
give you pleasure

  yes youre truly annoyed she
said appraising him and i wonder
if its wholly because im pecking into
your own private affairs

  no i think its because you make
me feel that youre mocking me as if
i were some bald-headed old patri-
arch

  goodness gracious now really you
dont think that she opened her eyes
wide there was honest concern in her
demeanor and tones

  yes i do when a man is about so

old he-

 general hart marston thats
enough of that sort of talk no girl-
no one i mean thinks anything about
your age you are one of that kind
who doesnt seem to have any age i
mean-well im getting all snarled up
and i guess thats because im meddling
in your business forgive me ill keep
out of it

  i apologize for my silly sensitive-
ness miss thornton i should have
known that it was only good-natured
fun

  i dont know she returned gravely
as i think it over it doesnt seem at
all funny-asking you about proposals
asking you about leila but i wanted
-well no matter id better confine
myself strictly to my own business
she paused for a moment

  then her next words of declaration
about her own affairs took him off his
feet as completely as had the question
she plumped at him in the beginning

  i have just had a proposal of mar-
riage she said perhaps thats why
the dictator



i had the subject on the brain when we
started out just now

  again he was speechless

  it was burton she explained
and thats why he has penned himself
up in his camp drawing plans for that
windwill in purgatory-or whatever it
is he positively wouldnt be sensible
and come along

  he did not dare to ask her questions
and there was a pinching of his throat
in his dizziness he did not grasp the
import of her comment he had only
heard that she had received a proposal
of marriage

  he is a charming boy she declared
  i agree with you miss thornton
  i think the world of him

  it is quite natural

  but of course i said no and thats
why he wouldnt come along

 do you mean-

  why i said no she looked at him
with some surprise for he had dis-
played sudden tumult of emotions
that is i said no for the time being
maybe it will be final maybe-well
how is one to know very much about
the future little things which one
never reckons on change all our lives
for us somehow i felt that burton
was proposing to me because his father
wished him to do so-or because my
father did my father is positively
reckless about the manner in which he
throws hints around there might have
been something about paper mills and
pulp timber and all such in the affair
-marrying the mill to the timber and
throwing in the boy and the girl i
dont know business deals are getting
to be perfectly horrible in these days
of money mania i asked burton all
about it-questioned him very sharply
and it made him very indignant

  i can understand that miss thorn-
ton in his love he--

  do you think he really loves me
how could anybody-how could he
help loving you

  thats a very nice compliment you
pay me sir

  i was not trying to pay compli-
ments miss thornton you asked me

  a question and i answered to the best
of my ability

  we have become quite confidential
havent we we are running on to
each other about our private affairs-
oh well i do believe you havent told
me so very much about yourself but
perhaps you are going to do so maybe
and that will even up matters

  she paused but he did not take ad-
vantage of her silence to even matters

  any time youd like to confide in
me to find out what viewpoint a girl
takes i hope youll do so ill consider
it a compliment id like to ask you
for the man-side views now what
do you think about burton do you
think id better marry him providing
he hasnt already changed his mind
you must excuse me he said with
a pitiful attempt to smile

  but just a little hint sir

  he shook his head

  dont be selfish  he flushed un-
der her earnest gaze i mean dont
be stingy with advice perhaps you
dont understand how much i need it
and now i feel again as if you were
mocking me theres your mother

your father-

  oh i know exactly what they will
say that would not be asking advice
that would be getting orders

  my advice is to marry the one you
love he said firmly i realize per-
fectly that that is a banal and obvious
remark it means nothing

  yes it does she affirmed

  her declaration was so positive that
marston regarded her with fresh in-
tentness

  it may mean a great deal miss
thornton ill admit providing it is
possible to know absolutely when one
is in love

  my distinguished father says that
considerably more than half the folks
in this world dont know beans when
the bag is open now in this love mat-
ter which you have insisted on making

a topic of conversation-

  she glanced sideways at him and
found him gasping and open-mouthed

i say in this matter of love isnt it
probably true that only the especially


the tpovulacr magazine

favored ones are able to know what
love really is or to feel real love
just as only persons specially capable
or specially trained can detect real gems
or tell wool from cotton or something
like that you have lived longer than
i have and i rather hoped you were
specially trained

  i am not he said curtly i insist
that i am completely ignorant

  i am sorry do you know any ex-
pert who can develop intuition in such
matters just as physical trainers can
develop muscle

  no of course not they were
crossing a rustic bridge further-
more i am convinced that your present
spirit of mischief would prompt you
to stop and throw stones at frogs in
this brook if they were not luckily in
winter quarters just now

  you are very suspicious sir-and
also you are growing saucy im afraid
i have set you a poor example you
feel that lacking frogs for target im
throwing pebbles at you eh

  fie held his peace

  ahead of them in the forest aisles
they heard the chatter of voices and
knew that they were overtaking the
loitering guests

  the training of girls in these days
at institutes of learning does not lead
them to think of matrimony as the ulti-
mate object of their existence she
said in stilted tones that sounds
like an essay doesnt it  it is its
from a paper i prepared for our girls
club i think i was about fifteen years
old its strange how good advice may
lead us to change the settled convictions
of a lifetime-up to the age of fifteen 
i think ill take your advice

  but i have given you no advice
  oh yes you have

  i dropped some silly commonplaces
thats all

  you advised me to marry the one
i love it now becomes necessary to
study symptoms examine conditions
and analyze the psychological side of
the thingbeing very careful not to mis-
take mere upheavals of sentiment for
real love i wish youd canvass the
matter a bit among your married

  friends mister general in order that
i may get light on all sides its not a
matter to be treated carelessly or
hastily i think you agree with me
there

  yes i do agree

  we can confer occasionally

  i must ask you to excuse me miss
thornton

  if it would embarrass you to talk
to me directly i can delegate leila to
represent me

  he was glad because a turn of the
road brought them in sight of their
party at that moment this incompre-
hensible girl had brought him to the
limit of his patience he was divided
between hankering to cuff her ears in
the belief that she was mischievously
impertinent and desire to take her in
his arms-nay rather to kneel and beg
her love for he knew that the grand
passion of his life had seized upon him

  it was not merely that she was beau-
tiful he had met many beautiful girls

  but the puzzle of her piquant per-
sonality her zest in life and living her
constantly changing moods kept his in-
terest in her ever on the alert made
her with every day that passed a new
person with whom he enjoyed fresh
delights in the struggle to form ac-
quaintance and the full and despairing
conviction that she was unattainable
made of his emotions such a vivid min-
gling of pain and pleasure that his love
became obsession

  he went to the side of leila true-
worthy when they had overtaken the
strollers in her presence and listen-
ing to her he felt a saner sense of what
his pride and condition demanded from
him

  he determined to return to town
with the governor the next day and
he told her so making lame explanation
to account for this sudden change in
his plans she offered no remonstrance
or comment at the time

but before he left her to join others
of the party she asked have you
told anybody else general marston
that you are leaving here to-morrow
no

  then im going to say something
the dictator



to you as a soldiers daughter to a sol-
dier if the battle is inevitable and
you cannot expect to be any stronger
in the future why run away in order
to fight another day

  he gazed at her for a long time
before he replied

  you dont think im either coward
or knave do you he entreated

  you are neither if you stay here
you can win

  yes over myself i will stay

  she smiled and patted his arm

    

chapter xiv

  general marston neither avoided
aileen thornton nor did he seek her
during the remainder of the sojourn in
the forest on her part she preserved
as careful indifference there was no
more raillery no more of that indis-
cretion in speech furthermore young
mr lesbitt concealed his feelings and
squired the daughter of the domain on
occasions and the ladies of the party
beamed graciously on the young couple
commending a budding romance

  the governor came again and the
thanksgiving feast was spread in the
great hall as final festivity of the house
party

  there were venison pasties smoking
joints of bear meat partridges browned
in the roasting pans-all the spoil of
the forest from the acres of thornton

  a state senator garbed as a herald
read the published thanksgiving proc-
lamation signed by governor thornton
and i ask the people of this state to
look forward to blessings to come with
as lively sense of gratitude as they may
survey blessings which they have en-
joyed was the concluding sentiment
of the proclamation

  his excellency knew that he was safe
in the society of his political intimates

  there wont be many blessings to
come not for our party unless we can
control that legislature he stated
across the table to all who cared to lis-
ten the devils are trying to steal it
from us

  we are advised to fight the devil
with fire squeaked a bromidic diner

  the governor banged his fist on the
board

 i shall fight them with the law
ladies and gentlemen the councilors
and myself have been sitting as a re-
turning board canvassing the election
returns in the legislative districts for
once in this state the law will be
strictly observed

 they applauded him

  returns that were not made up in
open town meeting that were not cer-
tified to by the clerk in proper fashion
that were not signed by all the select-
men will be thrown out they have
been getting too careless in the country
towns if any of you gentlemen when
you get back into the heart of things in
your communities hear criticism of this
plan of action speak out and say tljat
its the law that im following theyll
be howling that im trying to negative
the expressed will of the voters theyll
claim that im figuring to our own ad-
vantage but point to the law gentle-
men and back me up and tell your
friends to back me up that legislature
belongs to us and were going to have
it

 lots of towns have ignoramuses
running their affairs said a guest it
seems too bad to have men lose their
votes because of mere technical errors
you are not criticizing my attitude
in regard to the law are you  de-
manded the governor sharply i didnt
make the law im carrying it out
no but some allowances have al-
ways been made when the intent of
the voters has been made clear

  dont you realize sir that every al-
lowance viewed through the strict in-
terpretation of the law is illegal
but i say-

  i say it is shouted the governor
again banging his fist

 please please urged the first
lady of the state plaintively

 his excellency dragged his fingers
through his hair and grunted

 we are assembled here under a
thanksgiving proclamation not a dec-
laration of war said his excellencys
daughter with considerable tartness
if you dont behave father ill be


the popular magazine

obliged to send you away from the
table

  politics has spoiled me acknowl-
edged the governor i guess thats
why politicians make me so mad for
give the outburst aileen shake your
head at me if i start the subject again
after the dinner general marston
walked forth again with governor
thornton and they ascended the ledgy
eminence the governor had asked
marston to accompany him

  the day was overcast the wind was
chill the distant lakes were like gray
medallions set in the framing black
growth

  of course you heard what he said
marston-that fellow at table

  yes sir

  youre no politician and you dont
understand the whole idea said his
excellency rudely i dont expect you
to be a politician but you can under-
stand that something is brewing in this
state even men in my own party may
turn against me now id like to have
something of a line on you right out
of your own mouth you are adjutant
general of this state there may come
a time when ill need you and need you
devilish bad what do you understand
your duties are

  to obey the orders of the com-
mander in chief-yourself

  exactly  and how much conversa-
tion are you going to have about it
you know what kind of trouble i had
with wade

  my understanding of my position is
that a soldier obeys the orders of his
superior without asking questions or
offering any comments sir

  you heard what i had to say about
the law marston i want it to be
known that i am for the law down to
the finest point naturally you under-
stand that my orders to you will not
include picking pockets or burning
buildings in the night but how about
your loyalty to me theres quite a
lot of difference between us youre
pretty high-toned

  jif i had any doubt about my loyalty
to you i should resign this moment
governor thornton please dont make

me feel any smaller than i feel this
moment standing here with you in the
midst of this

  he swept his arm to include the vast
reaches of forests and mountains

  the governor gave his adjutant gen-
eral shrewd survey one might guess
from his expression that he had not
brought marston to this eminence
merely for air and exercise

  it is something eh  something to
match against blue blood we cant
all have thfe same things to brag about
in this world i started with a pair of
oxen i took a job to haul logs when
i wanted another pair and gave a bill
of sale due in thirty days the man was
willing to extend the time for he knew
i was honest i lacked two dollars
when i counted my money i went into
the house and took two dollars in old-
fashioned copper cents away from my
wife--my first wife-and made up the
amount i wouldnt accept any exten-
sion she had been collecting them
ever since she was a baby bungdown
cents they were called she cut her
teeth on one of them she thought a
lot of them but i wouldnt take an
extension because that writing said that
i would pay in thirty days i have
kept all my promises marston thats
something i promise to hold the state
offices in our party as long as im gov-
ernor i stand for my party you
are with me eh very well remem-
ber it i value loyalty-a promise
now lets go down its cold here

  when they turned to descend they
saw aileen thornton coming up

  thus does history repeat itself she
called but it is not a coincidence i
knew you were here and i have fol-
lowed deliberately they are deadly
dull down below the dinner has made
them torpid i hope you are talking
about something thats interesting

  we have finished talking said the
governor were going where its
warmer

  but im not cold she protested
im up here to have the cobwebs
blown away wont you stay a few
moments general marston even if fa-
ther must get back to the fireplace
the dictltor



  the two of you will get enough of
it in short order commented his ex-
cellency going on his way

  i hope you wont think that the
thornton family is working your pa-
tience in double shift she said but
i did want to come up here and say
good night-good-by to it and i think
theres going to be a sunset after all
she pointed to the west there was a
slash of red light at the horizon

  to-morrow we must go back and be
tamed by the town she went on i
know that you have your emotions
under better control than i sir but
havent you grown to feel a little primi-
tive and wild and all that since you
have been up here in the woods

  i think i have miss thornton he
returned gravely i cannot account
for certain wild thoughts otherwise
and i suppose youre glad that you
are going back to town where you can
become normal again

  i think its best for me to be in town
at my work

  lie lowered his eyes under her steady
gaze

  its a wonderful ability-to be able
to decide what is best to do and then
do it no matter how much one longs
to do the other thing sir im afraid
i lack that ability its a natural defect
its a temperamental failing havent
you noticed that i need to be repressed
to be guided to be kept from doing and
saying foolish things

  no he lied bravely

  im sorry i hoped you had noticed
that much about me ill go a bit fur-
ther and inform you that you have no-
ticed it however ill excuse your
falsehood you are merely trying to be
polite id like it better if you were
entirely frank now out here on this
bare hill with the woods and moun-
tains all around-two folks held up
against the sky you can be merely
polite when you get back to town i
can be the meek little slave of rule and
custom when i get back to town you
admit dont you that you didnt tell
me the exact truth about myself just
now 

  yes

  you see im a rather keen observer
where you arc concerned i have been
watching you very closely up here
where folks allow themselves to get
back to the primitive more or less and
show what they really think so i
have found out that you are in love
with me

  he opened his mouth but she hur-
ried along checking him

  no no-dont say anything in your
present state of mind youd simply
tell me another falsehood natural and
human impulse to protect yourself im
saying all this to-day out here on this
hill because if i waited till we were in
town id never be able to say it im
taking advantage of my last opportu-
nity  i have been waiting till the last
day thats why i came up here i
should have sent father away if he
hadnt gone willingly of his own ac-
count because i want to ask you if
you wont marry me

  he fairly staggered but this as-
tounding young woman who seemed
determined to deal him blow after blow
surveyed him with great calmness

  youd better not speak yet she
warned him you are not in condi-
tion  youd be incoherent listen to
me naturally id much rather youd
ask me to marry you thats the usual
custom so far as word of mouth goes
but in reality the girl is the one who
asks by eyes and actions but its only
a minor matter just now when folks
are in love with each other as we are
i knew youd never ask me partly
because of that

  she swept her arm with indifferent
gesture to indicate the barony of
thornton

  but mostly just because you are
yourself a gentleman whose pride
forces him to do just the right thing as
he sees the right i need to have my
actions governed by just such a person
thats why i have proposed to you
wait dont speak yet i want to
say what i have nerved myself to say
else i never shall be able to say it later
i have written it all out beforehand so
as to have it run right i spent a lot
of time on planning what to say bur-


the pocpulflcr magazine

ton lesbitt is a dear boy but he would
not make the right husband for me i
wouldnt mind the least bit what he
told me to do he is too young to carry
authority and young men are always
selfish when i was floundering around
in my feelings after meeting you  when
i was trying to class you knowing full
well that you were meant for me in
some way i called you my dream fa-
ther you didnt like that notion a
bit nor did i so we have fallen in

love with each other and i-

  i love you i love you he cried
choking he put out his arms and
started toward her but she stepped
back quickly and stopped him with
voice and gesture

  i am glad you said that just at this
time it helps me along ever so much
but of course i have known it for some
time but wait  if you are not posi-
tively certain that you are giving me
much more than i am giving you i do
not want you to marry me

  i can only give you myself my life

my love-

  yourself-thats what i want she
said gently gold is not love and land
is not love-and what is life without
love i have talked strangely to you
hart i have talked as if i were en-
gaging a preceptor but what i have
meant is that i love you so much that
i have put aside modesty sanity every-
thing that could stand between us
you have shamed me he con-
fessed i was a fool in my pride it
was not merely that in his turn he
pointed to the vast landscape it was
consciousness of my age my unworthi-
ness aileen again he put out his
arms to her but she eluded them

  i want to go to my father first it
is not settled as yet

  you must let me go to your father
i insist i am now awake at least
i can do that much

  no  you must leave the thorntons
to deal with each other they under-
stand each others peculiarities i know
what to say to my father

  i feel- he blurted

  i hope you feel warm enough to stay
outdoors until i can come to you she

broke in with a smile ill be gone
only a few minutes the thorntons do
not make long prefaces it will be a
short and a lively session

  can i be cold with all this radiance
of joy within me ill wait here aileen
this hill is a sacred altar now

  she ran away

  the dusk came slowly and the red
glow faded and lie paced to and fro
trying to settle the chaos of his emo-
tions

  to himself he seemed particularly
little and cowardly but he was obliged
to admit the good sense of her deter-
mination to intercede with her father
marston had seen in the past that
aileen thornton had a way of assert-
ing herself in matters which concerned
the family he could talk with rutillus
thornton in manly fashion when op-
portunity presented itself now his
love for her blazed into passion more
vivid than ever her generous bravery
in coming to him as she had done was
exalted by his thoughts and blessed by
his gratitude

  when she came running back to him
the glory of victory shining on her face
in the gloom he took her into his arms
and held her for a long time his speech
no longer fettered his love pouring
forth

  then they went down the hill to-
gether hand in hand so supremely
happy that they found no alloy in the
present and no problem for the future

  i have been bold and forward she
whispered but you will not remem-
ber it will you

  only to love you the more for sav-
ing me from myself my sweetheart

  its like a story she declared

  a story whose end is and they
lived happy ever after

chapter xv

  society hazarded a few guesses of
course but society was not at all cer-
tain about the situation

  the lovers were discreetly circum-
spect when they returned to town

  we opened our hearts to each other
up in the clouds on the hilltop where
the dictator



there were none to hear said the girl
lets stay in the clouds a little while
its a precious secret just for our-
selves

  he agreed gratefully

  as for rutillus thornton let the
womenfolks run it marston the mar-
riage question ought to be turned over
to the management of the womenfolks
thats why i told aileen to go and suit
herself my mind was on young les-
bitt i didnt think of you youre alt
right if she likes you i have plenty
of money for the whole of us-and i
shouldnt wonder if i owed the mar-
ston family something in a business
way we used to cut sharp corners
in the old days when we were doing
business

  it was a rude speech but marston
was accustomed to thorntons rude-
ness and this new happiness had made
him tractable

  the governors lady smoothed any
hurt he may have felt

  i am glad that aileen has grown to
love you she told him i am proud
that you have honored us by loving her
you have so much to give us general
marston youll forgive me for saying
that im sure but im so anxious to
have you put aside all those thoughts
which bothered you when you first
knew aileen

  he thanked her with emotion

  as the days went on his affection
for this quiet patient self-deprecatory
woman increased

  really aileen told him in mis-
chievous mood we are overturning all
the practices and conventions in matri-
mony i deliberately proposed to you -
hart and here you are falling deeply
in love with your mother-in-law-to be
perhaps the venture will be a wonder-
ful success after all it is all so dif-
ferent

  he drew her to him and kissed her

i dont know how to talk to you any
more he confessed i can only show
you how much i love you by deed and
act

  i believe im growing to understand
that language perfectly

  when it came to deciding on the date

for the formal announcement of their
engagement they deferred to aileens
mother

  it shall be at dinner the night before
the assembling of the legislature she
told them i want everybody to know
how happy my dear girl is to be-and
all the folks from all over the state
will be near at hand we will have our
close friends at the dinner-only our
chosen few

  but the governor will be held so
closely at the statehouse that evening

- protested marston

  i think you know fully that one of
my husbands peculiarities is that he
leaves all family affairs to the women-
folks as he puts it i think he would
manage to stay away from such a din-
ner no matter what date we select
no on the contrary i know that
mamma-sly mamma laughed the
daughter has chosen a day and hour
when she is absolutely sure that dad
cannot be on hand she wants to be
happy on that occasion-and she
couldnt be with dads lamentable table
etiquette

  thats not kind aileen protested
the governors lady your father will
be thankful for an excuse to stay away
ill admit that if you insist on a fur-
ther motive on my part he loathes
social affairs i hope you will as care-
fully consult your own husbands tastes
when you get one

 bravo mamma

  but the mother did not smile at this
raillery she turned to marston

  i want you to know this before you
come into our family general i know
all that the gossips in this state have
said about my marriage to rutillus
thornton they say that i married him
for his money that is not true i
married him because i understood him
and i still ldve him because i under-
stand him now when he speaks rudely
to me i know that under it all are the
dearest truth and loyalty and tender-
ness i have ever known we have had
none of the quarrels which take place
between young folks who have not
learned to control their jealousies and
their passions i know that in my case


the vofulatr magazine

i was fortunate when i married a man
older than myself by so many years
thats my dearest reason for being so
glad that aileen has choserr you of
course i am glad that she has chosen
so wisely in other respects but my own
my dearest reason is that i believe her
mothers good fortune will be hers

  her cheeks were pink her voice
trembled in all the time he had known
her marston had never heard her speak
so much at one time and declare so
bravely her opinion

  he crossed to her and took her hand
and kissed it he knew that any words
from him would profane that wromanly
outburst

  then came the night when he could
proudly hold up his prize of utter joy
for all the world to behold

  it was the night biore the conven-
ing of the legislature

  it was a crackling snappy frosty
night-a hard crystalline white elec-
tric winter night with vivid shuttlings
and flutterings of the northern lights in
the starry heavens

  it was a night which seemed to ac-
cord with the crackling tempers of the
men who came from north east and
south and west hiving into the hotels
of the state capital

  there were both reticence and tense-
ness in the groups which formed in lob-
bies mumbled in undertones and then
dissolved to form new groups an ob-
server received an impression of bode-
ful accumulation of hidden and poten-
tial trouble

  isolated and serene thrust high
against the stars on the shoulder of a
hill looming above all other roofs of
the city the statehouse loomed majesti-
cally  the hard light of the winter night
flashed from its golden dome the
lights within the structure were dim
and scattered the preliminary caucuses
had been held and the throngs had re-
turned to the hotels

  the executive mansion at the foot of
the hill shed a glory of illumination
from all its windows feast and fes-
tival were in evidence there even
though the master of the mansion was
absent

  he was in his canopied chair on the
dais in the council chamber the ten
desks of his councilors faced him in
a half circle and all the desks were
occupied

  the great center chandelier was
dark the side lights gave dim illumina-
tion the canopy of the big chair
partly shaded the governors face and
its deep grooves gave it the appearance
of a study in arabesque he sat there
so quietly that he might have been a
carved idol  a throne

  a man stood before him in front of
the desks of the councilors-a man
who was speaking with vigor he had
been declaiming for some time his
voice was hoarse

  the orator argued fervidly and shook
passionate fist and thudded indignant
heel into the nap of the thick carpet
but not one line or wrinkle was shifted
in the broad face under the canopy
the countenance displayed no emotion
either commendation or disapproba-
tion its expression marked utter in-
difference

  but i have said enough your ex-
cellency and members of the council
you knew it all before i began to speak
however it was necessary to speak-
to put the matter in words i stand
here in the person as the peoples pro-
test you have heard me the people
dont believe that you will try to do
will dare to do what they are whisper-
ing you intend to do do i need to
remind you that you are governor of
all the people not simply a member of
the political party which has elected you
to high office i am a member of your
party i am not simply one of the polit-
ical opposition seeking selfishly fight-
ing the ordinary political fight i have
resigned my position as attorney gen-
eral of this state so that i could come
here and protest as a citizen uninflu-
enced by politics thats my sacrifice
for the best interests of our old state
what shall be your sacrifice gentle-
men  i stand here and for the people
i say-he lifted both arms above his
head and screamed with the passion of
an inspired prophet-you shall not be
allowed to steal this state
the dictmor



  he stopped he stood panting for
breath after his mighty effort

  fully half a minute of profound si-
lence followed

  then governor thornton spoke his
lips did not appear to move his voice
seemed rather a sort of nasal trumpet-
ing in harsh monotone

  the council will go into executive
session 

  it was formal dismissal and the an-
gry man ex-attorney general sted-
man sawtelle bowed and retired his
fingers inside his limp collar easing
the swollen veins of his neck

  governor thornton moved for the
first time in many minutes

  he raised a gnarled hand from the
chair arm and beckoned to the mes-
senger of the executive department
whispering bill saunders gov-
ernor thornton made no secret of his
command he said for all to hear

  go to my house and tell general
marston to report to me here-at
once

  saunders started on tiptoe for the
door

  no matter what anybody says to
you insist on seeing him and tell him
to hurry

  the governor picked up papers which
lay beside him on his table

  now gentlemen having patiently
listened to the squeaking of that in-
fernal windmill we will proceed with
sensible business

  the governors mansion was offer-
ing more cheer than the big house on
the hill nevertheless there were tears
in the eyes of the first lady of the state
when she looked down the table and
gazed on marston and his fiancee in
her heart she was calling them her chil-
dren and was offering up an honest little
prayer for their happiness and so her
tears were happy tears

  burton lesbitt rose to give the toast
of the evening he had asked that he be
allowed that privilege it was an inti-
mate little party- a gathering of close
friends and he chose to be frank
though his smile was just a bit wistful

  i have been adopted as a brother
he said and so i am permitted to be-
speak happiness and all good things for
my dear sister and the true gentleman
who has won her

  their eyes invited the general after
they had risen to do honor to the senti-
ment which lesbitt had manfully pro-
posed

  marston came to his feet and gazed
down into the brimming eyes of the
girl

  constancy and love and faith sin-
cerity devotion and abiding trust-all
these i pledge then he bent down
and reverently kissed her forehead

  pearls of words on a golden
thread declared leila trueworthy

  under cover of the gayety a servant
passed unobtrusively to the side of the
mistress of the mansion

  tell the messenger to go away
commanded mrs thornton she dis-
played a flash of indignation

   but he says he is from the governor
madam

  general marston cannot be dis-
turbed tell him

  but he says it is very urgent

  mrs thornton looked on politics and
the men and the movements of politics
with rather indifferent toleration so
long as she was not especially disturbed
the persons who consorted with her
husband in his library and littered the
floor with cigar ashes were creatures
from whom she fled she knew the
political game as a sort of necessary
evil to be embraced providing a man
wished to gain office

  but now the evil was treading too
closely on her own affairs

  this seemed to be particularly impo-
lite thoughtlessness on her husbands
part she dared to break her rules of
usual obedience and to show her resent-
ment

  she rose from her place and went
into the hall her departure unnoticed
by those at table

  the tall clock in the reception room
was striking the hour of ten on a mel-
low gong

  go back to the governor and inform
him that under no circumstances must


the popular magazine

general marston be disturbed this eve-
ning

   mr saunders shook his head slowly
he put his palm at the side of his mouth
and prepared to speak

  the governor knows very well why
general marston cannot come to the
statehouse this evening she insisted

in her thoughts she added but its
just like him to forget all about it

   be that as it may purred whisper-
ing bill behind his palm i have orders
and theyre strict theres something
frizzling up there maam

   she blinked thoughtfully her little
rebellion ending as she pondered on her
husbands methods of dealing with dis-
obedience she returned to the table
and leaned over marston

   theres a messenger from the state-
house in the hall

  the adjutant general rose hastily
patted aileens hand and went out

   what is it mamma asked the girl
her brow wrinkling with annoyance
your father has sent for him

   my father is absolutely ridiculously
impossible sometimes

  too impatient even to apologize to
the guests she hurried out into the
hall

   my compliments to his excellency
marston was saying i will come at
once

   but you cannot leave like this ex-
postulated the girl at his elbow my
father is--

  is my commander in chief he re-
turned with a smile i will follow
you at once he informed the waiting
mr saunders in a tone which hinted
that mr saunders had better be on his
way the messenger gave the two a
prolonged and understanding stare and -
retired

   she nested her hands in his palm de-
taining him he smiled down on her
with more gentleness

  oh why did not you string one
more word on that golden thread
and that word dear heart
obedience

  but i am obeying

  yes but every time a man says i
obey it seems as if he must push some

woman aside and leave her behind oh
you look at me-i know what is in
your mind you think i am a foolish
girl and have no right to hold you back
for the sake of my own happiness

  no i am glad because you want
me to stay with you but-

  she had been speaking with girlish
petulance now she put her hands on
his shoulders and looked up at him
with such wide-eyed seriousness that
he ceased speaking and returned her
gaze

  it sounds silly what i have been
saying i know it does it sounds as
if i were making much out of a small
matter but something came over me
when i saw you go out just now i
dont know what it was i was fright-
ened i am frightened now i am
confessing it to you just as i shall con-
fess all my feelings to you i know i
risk having you think i am silly why
should i be frightened hart she
went closer to him and trembled

   i think you mistake your feelings
you are a bit nervous-the evening

  no i am frightened i dont un-
derstand its not like me to be this
way

   she put her arms about his neck and
on tiptoe held her face close to his lips

  good-by my own sweetheart i
know you must go thats the womans
part-to smile and say go forgive
me and forget my folly thank god
this is america and soldiers are not
going away to fight

  he kissed her but she did not re-
lease him

  why am i afraid she quavered
i dont understand what is the mat-
ter with me has love taken away all
my good sense 

   the sincerity of her distress puzzled
him

   she took her arms from his neck and
stepped back and stamped her foot with
thornton determination

  im a fool she cried hurry
along hart or father will take you
across his knee remember please
that i became sane before you left me
the dictator



  i have sweeter things to remem-
ber

  if it is not too late when you finish
your business come home with father
and say another good night

  ill do it make my apologies in
there please he nodded toward the
door of the dining room i must
hurry

  the wistfulness of her parting smile
pained him more than ever was he
puzzled by this strange emotion which
seemed to come from feminine premo-
nition he had always found her free
from whims and weakness

  he wrondered what wtas happening
at the statehouse and what was wanted
of him

chapter xvi

  he went up the hill at a brisk gait
his heels creaking on the crisp snow

  the big building looked especially
and majestically calm

  although he wondered at receiving
a summons at that hour he did not re-
sent the governors curt command for
a good many years he had practiced
for himself and had imposed on others
a soldiers unquestioning obedience

  since election marston had been
keeping politics out of his mind as care-
fully as he kept politics out of his office
the governor had not talked politics
to him on the contrary seemed de-
termined to keep off the topic

  they who had broached any topic
of politics to the adjutant general found
him an inattentive and impatient lis-
tener therefore he had kept the news
of politics out of his ears when he
was out of his office he had dearer con-
cerns to engross his attention he had
heard without especial interest that the
opposition claimed the legislature and
therefore contended that it could swing
the state offices and patronage to it-
self but marston had usually found
all brands of officeholders to be very
much alike and his own position was
appointive derived from the governors
favor therefore in the matter of ex-
ecutive-department concerns he had
been dwelling apart in the serenity of
indifference

  he entered the statehouse by one of
the side doors

  when he passed the watch room old
corporal john candage struggled up
from his chair and saluted

  is all quiet on the potomac john
inquired the general amiably

  all quiet sir to date

  sergeant tarr was asleep in his chair
beside the elevator door and marston
went past him on tiptoe unwilling to
disturb the old man he ran up the
main stairway two steps at a leap ex-
ulting in his vivid sense of well-being
he traversed dim corridors to the ante-
room of the executive chamber in
the anteroom he found the honorable
stedman sawtelle tramping to and
fro easing a damp collar away from
his neck with irritable jerks he
scowled at the big fellow who came
bustling in radiating his joy in life and
love

  all the best of a happy new year
to you sir was the generals exuber-
antly cordial greeting

  unf grunted the other so you
are here are you

  yes im here sir marston did
not moderate his smile

  seem to think youre going to have
a good time doing it eh 

  perhaps so whatever it is youre
talking about

  you know perfectly well what im
talking about so he has decided to
commit the crime has he youre here
to do it for him hey

  really mr sawtelle i have not the
least knowledge of why im here

  do you take me for a fool 

  i dont understand why you should
ask me such a question as that saw-
telle retorted the general his smile
fading

  because you do know why youre
here i say you do know what those
buccaneers behind that door are plan-
ning on youre in with em in their
damnable scheme he shook his fist
at the massive door which had been
closed to mask the executive session

  mr sawtelle i do not know  the
adjutant generals tone was acrid i
say i do not know wthy im here


the wular magazine

  the lawyer halted in his nervous and
angry pacing he straddled his short
legs stuck his hands under his coat
tails and squinted up at marston
venom in his gaze deliberate insult in
his tones when he spoke

  the whole state knows that rute
thornton expects demands and gets
one service from all his pets you are
specially qualified you are his chief
pet

  you have called me that before
sawelle and i serve notice on you that
i dont relish the name

  as little men often do the lawyer
took advantage of his puny size

  he continued to stare up at the big
fellow who towered over him

  i say youre specially qualified for
that service

  may i ask why

  youre a good liar

  general marston stiffened narrowed
his eyes he brought up his hand sud-
denly his fist clenched but he un-
closed the hand and began to stroke
the gray hair at his temples then
much to mr sawtelles astonishment
and considerably to that gentlemans
discomfiture he laughed with real
whole-souled fervor

  my dear sir now i understand that
youre trying to talk politics with me
i always refuse to discuss politics i
lack all inclination i also lack the
proper vocabulary

  he turned his back on his provoking
antagonist went to the big door and
rapped whispering bill opened the
portal slightly and cautiously and
shoved out his head he admitted the
adjutant general and closed the door
with no sound but the clicking of the
latch

  marston crossed the chamber and
stood before the grim figure in the big
chair he saluted

  general marston how soon can you
place a company of militia in this state-
house demanded the governor speak-
ing sharply and loudly

  within fifteen minutes your excel-
lency

  his excellency exhibited frank sur-
prise

  it happens that the local company
of the national guard is giving an ex-
hibition drill in the armory this eve-
ning sir i can call them by tele-
phone

  go call em

  with what equipment sir  mar-
ston was concealing his emotions be-
hind the mask of soldier discipline

  rifles ammunition blankets ra-
tions and a machine gun

  very well sir

  i will give you further directions
after you have called the soldiers
the adjutant general bowed and went
out of the chamber

  in the anteroom sawtelle seized his
arm jabbering in his excitement

  i had my ear to the door i heard
the old devil and now do you tell me
you dont know why youre here

i have received orders from my
commander in chief mr sawtelle
yes orders to steal this state
godsake man dont you know what
this means

  i only know that i have received
orders which i shall obey

  he took the lawyers fingers in a firm
clutch and freed his arm

  its political-

  i have nothing to do with politics
i am not interested in your politics
but this is knavery its theft and
youre helping it its robbing the peo-
ple of their victory at the polls those
men in there have turned into black-
legs

  marston started away and again the
lawyer grabbed the generals arm

  they have counted men out of this
legislature-men who have been elected
its a scheme to hang onto the state
offices

  marston roughly shook off the mans
grasp

  its not a matter which concerns
me i tell you sawtelle there are
courts in this state and their duties
are laid down for them keep your
hands off me i shall forget to be
patient

  when you call soldiers into this

statehouse-

  even as there are judges mr saw-
the dictator



telle so there are state troops and
their duties are laid down for them
when orders come from the commander
in chief

  he went to the telephone which
was inside the inclosure of the private
secretary and called his number

  then while he was waiting for re-
sponse the big door of the executive
chamber was thrown open the session
was ended

  so youre going to put soldiers in
here are you demanded sawtelle in
strident tones beside himself with pas-
sion youre going to hold the peo-
ples own against the people are you 
he went to the threshold of the cham-
ber and stood there and shook his fists
by the gods governer its a state steal
and our party will get the cussing i
beg i urge i protest

  how much money are you getting
for this job sawtelle inquired the
governor sarcastically youre a paid
attorney for the bunch that wants
offices thats what rou are

  my legal practice is--

  you resigned as attorney general
because you saw a chance to grab off
more boodle in the lobby his ex-
cellency had descended from the dais
as soon as the door was opened now
he walked across the chamber his
hands in his trousers pockets

  i am speaking for the people de-
clared the lawyer

  at so much per speak scoffed the
governor i know all about it saw-
telle remember that im president of
one bank and a director in several more
i have seen the checks which have paid
for this outflow of patriotism

  he pushed past the lawyer giving
him a contemptuous grin

  marston came away from the tele-
phone and listened with interest

i am entitled to honest wages in
my profession and its no reason why
my protest against this state steal--
the governor was on his way to his
private chamber he turned

  enough of that sawtelle  messen-
ger call men from the watch and put
that man out of the statehouse

  you neednt bother im going i

have business outside this statehouse
right now-business with honest men
when i come back with em look out
for yourselves

  he went away muttering oaths
they have paid him well he is try-
ing to earn the money observed
thornton come along in gentlemen
you too marston

  he led the way and set out a box
of cigars on his desk the councilors
helped themselves they were grave
and did not seem to care to talk

  the governor tramped to and fro
his hands in his pockets

  general marston he inquired do
you know just what the situation is
no sir

  i was afraid not youre not much
of a politician

  the general stood at attention with
a soldiers impassivity

  this is a political exigency and we
must use a political expedient i hope
you can put some dependence on those
tin soldiers of yours theyll realize
wont they that writh their uniforms on
they are soldiers and not voters
the state troops are well disci-
plined sir

  in a few words marston im go-
ing to give you a primary lesson in
politics so that youll understand what
your responsibilities are my council-
ors and i according to the state con-
stitution have canvassed the returns
we have found irregularities in certain
legislative districts we have decided
that certain representatives have not
been legally elected we shall not al-
low those men to take their seats in
the house to-morrow and vote on the
election of state officers a legisla-
tive body has the right to decide on
the eligibility of its members the
house will later take up the matter of
contests for seats we do not propose
to allow men who have no right to seats
to assist in organization thats wthy
i want this statehouse guarded against
a mob

  the general bowed

  you understand that we are uphold-
ing the law strictly interpreted sawr-
telle has been making a lot of cheap


the cpopuljlcr magazine

talk because it happens that the irreg-
ularities we have discovered affect
mostly the men of the other party
thats their misfortune not our fault
we cant go behind the ballot law of
this state you understand the situa-
tion now eh

  im quite sure i do governor
thornton in any event your com-
mands constitute my authority

  exactly i assume all responsibil-
ity here are your instructions  guard
the doors of the statehouse at ten
oclock to-morrow forenoon the mem-
bers of the council will attend you at
the main entrance and you will admit
only those men whom they vouch for
the councilors and i will stay here
all night between now and ten oclock
to-morrow admit nobody except by or-
ders from me personally thats all
the adjutant general saluted and left
the chamber he hurried down the
stairs and went straight to the door
of the watch room

  john he informed candage im
obliged to be your boss for a time the
governor has ordered troops into the
statehouse

  i heard there was a prospect of it
sir mr sawtelle just went out cuss-
ing about it

  only a bit o precaution i take it
but i wish theyd make a cleaner busi-
ness of their politics

  i dont know what the row is about
sir but it doesnt look good to me when
its necessary to guard the peoples
house against the people

  still a soldier mustnt ask ques-
tions john you know that

  i do sir

  marston went out and stood under
the carriage porch of the side door
after a time he heard far away the
measured screeching of many boot heels
on the hard-packed snow of the street
his men were coming he reviewed
them as they marched past him into
the statehouse the captain obeyed
marstons finger signal and stepped to
the generals side

  post sentries outside the doors re-
lieving them every hour captain holt

no admittance for anybody except by
orders from the governor the men
on guard duty may be at ease and catch
what sleep they can on their blankets
eager curiosity flamed in the cap-
tains eyes though he asked no ques-
tions

  war has not been declared cap-
tain and i do not expect war to be
declared but they seem to be playing
a little politics up on the hill here to-
night explained the general with a
smile we are only to see to it that
some grabbing politican doesnt carry
off the statehouse in a shawl strap
the machine gun came last drawn
by men its wheels squalling on the
snow

  leave it on the terrace here com-
manded marston have the men
throw a few blankets over it its not
a pretty exhibit in front of a state-
house

  he followed the soldiers indoors in-
spected the arrangement of the troops
and then kept vigil pacing the dim
rotunda

chapter xvii

  corporal candage returning from
his hourly visit to his time clocks found
general marston standing before the
great cases which protected the returned
battle flags relics of the civil war

  i always stop in front of em my-
self this time o night sir said the old
soldier they seem to talk to me when
its nigh onto midnight-to whisper to
me as you might say i wish they
could talk to everybody the same as
they talk to me-and make em under-
stand thered be more love of coun-
try and thered be less war

  they have just been talking to me
confessed marston i understand
what they say john

  once i saw a girl break away from
a sight-seeing party and run over in
front of this case sir whats in the
case mabel they asked her when she
went back to the party pooh  noth-
ing worth looking at she told em
only some old flags  oh she didnt
know sir there are so many of em
who dont know
the dicttocr



  at that moment faintly audible they
heard something

  marston was honestly startled for an
instant it almost seemed as if the
sounds came from within the cases
they heard fifes and drums

  god help us  gasped the old cor-
poral are we hearing ghosts 
marston listened intently and under-
stood

  its outdoors john

  halfway across the lobby on his way
to the door he was intercepted by cap-
tain holt who saluted

  there was a lot of excitement down-
town when we marched through the
streets he reported some talk of a
demonstration i think theyre com-
ing

  double the guard at the doors
commanded marston

  while the words were on his lips
aileen thornton came hurrying to him
across the rotunda mrs trueworthy
followed her more leisurely

  what is it-what are they going to
do-what is it all about  the girl cried
they threw stones at our windows
the police came and drove them away
they are shouting in the streets they
are making threats

its only political excitement you
should not have come up here aileen
but theres danger father would
not answer on the telephone i could
not stay away

  you ought not to be here did not

the guard-

oh hes only the shoe-store clerk at
lords she said with impatience
what is the danger llart tell me
but he turned from her to captain
holt

  bring that fellow here

  the captain saluted  and hurried on
his errand

  hart what is the matter with yo
you look at me as if you do not know
me  amazement at his apparent in-
difference was mingled with her fears

  i am sorry you came up here aileen
nothing serious can happen but its
no place for you ill send you home
with an escort the fifes and drums
were nearer

  ill not go  ill not go

  captain holt arrived with the delin-
quent soldier

  what were your orders when you
were placed at that door demanded
the general

  but i knew miss thornton and

  what were your orders sir

  to admit nobody general mar-
ston confessed the soldier red-faced
and shifting his gaze but the gov-
ernors daughter-

  captain holt place this man under
arrest

  hart it was my own fault dont
punish him please dont

 he took her arm and drew her
away

  aileen he said gravely in low
tones i am doing my best to make
soldiers out of these boys its a hard
job you are making it harder thac
fellow disobeyed orders and fifty men
were watching and listening to find out
what id do they know now you
must go up to your father you and
mrs trueworthy if you will not go
home he led her to the elevator

forgive me if i am a little hasty
with you he pleaded but i must go
out and ask that crowd what it wants
but you cannot go out there hart
she insisted i have heard their

threats i have-

 mrs trueworthy he gave
aileens hand into the keeping of her
companion and smiled at both of them
when the elevators grille clashed shut

  i dont know just what this all
means captain holt he said hurry-
ing toward the side door but we must
be ready for most anything have
your men fall in and await orders
when the general stepped outside 
the fifes and drums were clamoring un-
der the carriage porch he stood at
the head of the granite steps his sen-
tries behind him the big light above
the door showed him plainly to the
throng there were many hundreds of
men marston recognized some as
members of the incoming legislature
but the others and the majority were
the ready-and-rough adventurers who


the populatr magazine

fiock to any cause which promises ex-
citement

  many carried torches  others burned
red fire they shouted and sang

  general marston discovered the hon-
orable stedman sawtelle in the throng
that gentleman was in the center of a
group of men who were serious silent
and respectable looking

  after a time sawtelle succeeded in
silencing the noise of his camp fol-
lowers

  i am not responsible for a great part
of this gathering or its methods gen-
eral marston i have come here with
members of the legislature and in be-
half of the people of this state and
those who have been elected by the
people i demand the privilege of free
entrance into our statehouse

  i take my orders from our governor
sir i have been commanded to keep
all persons out until the convening of
the legislature

  t question the authority of the gov-
ernor to keep respectable citizens out of
the statehouse

  i cannot argue that question-i
shall obey orders as a soldier

  the orders of rutillus thornton
eh

  the orders of our governor i re-
peat

  sawtelle unbuttoned his overcoat and
pulled out his watch he looked at the
time and then held the watch high above
his head

  take note everybody  he shouted
with all the power of his voice it is
now eleven minutes of midnight on
the stroke of midnight rutillus thorn-
ton ceases to be governor of this state
thus says our constitution he will
not be governor after midnight until he
takes the oath of office to-morrow at
ten of the clock in the forenoon you
know that dont you general mar-
ston

  i do know that its the law though
ill confess i hadnt thought of it until
this moment confessed marston in-
genuously

  when you said just now that you
are not a lawyer i reckon you told the
truth said the attorney dryly even

though you studied to be one well
general marston you are now obey-
ing the orders of our governor very
well your commander in chief is
governor thornton he dwelt on the
title but in about ten minutes he will
be rute thornton will you continue
to obey the orders of rute thornton
a rascally politician 

  just one moment before you an-
swer that question or try to answer it
general marston

  it was the governors well-known
rasping voice behind marston and his
excellency spoke in clarion tones he
had appeared suddenly and stood in
the doorway between the soldiers who
guarded the portal

  so you have come here with a mob
have you sawttelle

  i am here with members of the
legislature demanding free entrance
sir

  i see men down there with clubs
in their hands i see men holding
rocks i have been informed by tele-
phone that stones have been thrown at
my house this night i say that you
have come here with a mob

  it is not a mob now-but things
can happen to make it a mob before to-
morrow morning declared the lawyer
with venom

  state property is now threatened by
mob violence bellowed the governor
under the circumstances i have de-
cided to declare this state under the
rule of martial law from midnight
to-night until i take my oath of office
to-morrow

  he waved a paper above his head
this is the official proclamation
duly signed and sealed by the great seal
of state-its the last official act of my
closing administration i delegate to
adjutant general hart marston full
power to guard state property and ad-
minister affairs and if you will look
at your watch again sawtelle youll
see im well inside the time limit good
night gentlemen

  he went in and slammed the door
behind him

  we have with us still general
marston perpetuating the dynasty
-the dictator



sneered sawtelle let me ask you sir
if you inherit the opinions of rute
thornton in regard to political de-
cency 

  i refuse to discuss politics mr
sawtelle

  youve got to discuss em enough
to tell me whether you propose to help
that crowd steal this state

  the general was silent

  are you afraid to tell me what you
intend to do 

  not at all mr sawtelle i shall
not open the doors of the statehouse
to you or any of this gathering to-
night i agree with the governor that
it closely resembles a mob

  furious howls greeted his statement
he surveyed the noise makers with
serenity until they had finished

  you are fast proving the thing
he told them id deserve to be court-
martialed for criminal negligence if i
opened these doors

  youre a coward of a tin soldier
yelled somebody

  marston smiled tolerantly

  look what theyve got here-look
what they want to do to us  cried a
shrill voice

  they had discovered the blanketed
machine gun and had stripped off its
coverings its gray metal gleamed
coldly and bodingly under the light of
the stars

  its ours-it belongs to the people
turn it around and blow that door off
the hinges advised a rioter

  hands off state property cried
marston starting down the steps
send a squad of men captain holt
to fetch this gun in

  but when the soldiers appeared the
rowdies in the crowd began to throw
stones and fragments of ice

  a big fellow was doing the most to
make trouble he had constituted him-
self leader of the gangsters in the
crowd he leaped upon the limber of
the gun

  dont let the little tin soldiers scare
you boys he shouted slap their
wrists and theyll run and cry i told
that tin officer he was a coward i
tell him so again

  he fired a chunk of ice at marston
and the elevation was so commanding
and the aim so true that the generals
face began to bleed

  call him thorntons pet-he likes
that name best advised the intractable
sawtelle

  all right youre thorntons pet
you are also a coward you need
guns to fight with you dont know
how to fight man fashion

  marston had vivid and instant con-
ception of what that situation meant
to his boys they had halted and were
shielding their heads as best they could
against the missiles crooking their arms
across their faces to order them to
charge meant the use of bayonets to
allow them to be driven meant the loss
of morale he had been cultivating so
earnestly in his citizen soldiers he
knew that only something desperate in
the way of diversion could save him-
self and his men from present shame
and future ridicule he rushed straight
at the man on the gun limber knock-
ing others out of his way he resolved
to make an example of the ringleader
if grit and muscle could do it

  it was immediately evident that in
spite of his size the fellow did not
propose to give man-fashion battle he
kicked viciously at the general and this
assault was so unexpected that marston
was knocked off his feet and fell on
his back

 the crowd voiced protest the
husky brute was losing the sympathy
of his adherents they even cheered
the general when he rose

  come down off that perch yelled
somebody else well yank you
down

  marston put up his hand in protest

  stand back men  he urged this
is my affair

  again he ran at the fellow and when
another kick was launched he grabbed
the mans leg and yanked him off the
limber the chap staggered when he
came to the ground and fell heavily

  get up im waiting for you
stated marston

  thats the talk thats the square
way commended the bystanders


the popular magazine

  the general met the mans onslaught
calmly and with a certain sense of con-
tented confidence he had been box-
ing instructor for his naval militia
boys too long to fear any such an-
tagonist as this fellow plainly was-
making his rush blindly bellowing his
oaths with the chinese spirit of intimi-
dation flailing his arms marston held
his head aslant presented his body
edgewise and drove his fist under the
mans ear with a forceful hook the
fellow went down on his knees

  get up advised the general
thats for calling me a coward you
called me another name get up 

  be a man get up shouted the
crowd

  the chap obeyed and made another
rush

 marstons next blow was more
vicious and brutal

  it was plain that the object lesson
had served sufficiently for the onlookers
as well as the victim the latter rose
after a time and staggered away and
the men in the crowd were silent

  if theres anybody else here who
thinks that national guardsmen are
cowards let him speak up and ill have
one of my boys attend to his case  none
of us is afraid declared the general

  the silence continued

  listen to me one moment its time
for certain persons in this country to
wake up and encourage our soldiery in-
stead of handing out insults and abuse
you are going to find out all of a sud-
den that you need soldiers and a lot
of em

  he turned to his squad

  run this gun into the statehouse

  lie followed and on the steps turned
and faced the throng

  you all ought to be ashamed of
yourselves he said with indignation

  general marston when you wake up
-when you come to a realizing sense
of what youre doing to-night youll be
the one to be ashamed shouted wsaw-
telle

  i am maintaining the law against
a mob sir

  you are maintaining the scheme of
a gang of crooks i say and youre

too pig-headed to listen to the word of
men who know  marston your grand-
father and your father are turning in
their graves to-night its a wonder
they dont appear to you and let me
tell you that by making a plug-ugly of
yourself just now you havent settled
this question the trouble is just be-
ginning

      chapter xviii
whispering saunders caught step
with general marston after the latter
had paced for a time in the rotunda

  i saw it it was good work purred
the confidential agent of the executive
i went up and told the governor and
his party

  that wasnt necessary objected the
general i am not proud of the affair
i told the governor there wasnt any
doubt about his being able to depend
on you after this he thinks so him-
self

  it isnt a matter of the governor and
myself saunders i am guarding state
property thats all

  to be sure and i want to con-
gratulate you general marston i
have just heard the news about your
engagement its a fine thing all
round

  i thank you returned marston
coldly

  now i can talk to you knowing
that youre in with us they are ugly
outside youre going to keep a stiff
backbone arent you

  im going to keep this statehouse
out of the hands of a mob

  to be sure just right its all
working slick chuckled the messen-
ger sted sawtelle is a keen sniffer
light on his feet and good on the trail
but heres a fox he aint going to dig
out with you to depend on were all
right we can do a little bragging
blast a new election law anyway
those country boneheads never can get
used to it just think of it there
were fourteen legislative districts-our
own-carried strong by our men-
where we had to do tinkering to make
the election legal and seat our repre-
sentatives
the dictator



  you had to do what demanded
marston

  tinker of course the governor
has told you about it but probably you
didnt pay much attention not being
specially interested in politics i am
you know and thats why i had so
much fun out of the job they gave me
i put on false whiskers and felt like
the king of detectives i went to those
districts and had the technical errors
fixed up by the town officers our re-
turns are as right as a trivet-it was all
done very nicely under cover

  but how about the errors on the
other side

  we are not helping the other party
to run its business the chap who said
that possession is nine points of the
law said a whole lot we have pos-
session with you in chsrge and if
there is any more law needed the gov-
ernor has it on his side he interprets
the law strictly he throws out those
returns on account of errors

  supposing they were not thrown
out what would be the situation
oh on the face of things they would
have about five members to the good
confessed mr saunders with serenity
and some indifference but they have
been thrown out because the law says
they must be the returns speak for
themselves-there are the documents
with the errors

  then sawtelle was right

  in what way 

  governor thornton and his council
propose to steal the state

  no such thing general as party
men they are only seeing to it that the
party vote is properly credited

  but they are not allowing the other
party to count its full vote

  they are simply letting it stand as
it shows on the face thats law i
have never heard of one party work-
ing to put the opposition party into
control that would be a fine brand
of politics to hand out to party sup-
porters 

  captain holt intercepted them and
saluted

  compliments of mr sawtelle sir

he asks if he may be admitted alone
he has important messages

  escort him in

  hold on there protested saun-
ders i heard the governor give you
strict orders to let nobody in here

  i heard him sir that was when
he was governor he pointed to the
rotundas big clock it marked twenty
minutes past midnight now he is
not the governor i am in charge
its only temporary general mar-
ston you mustnt takei chances you
are responsible you are only holding
this thing over for the party

  captain holt why are you waiting
bring in mr sawtelle

  the lawyer had telegrams in his
hands

  general marston you have assumed
control of affairs under the late gover-
nors proclamation therefore i have
come to you direct early in the
evening i foresaw what was going to
happen as i have told you i wired to
five of the justices of the supreme court
of this state i asked them for a snap
judgment i explained that the unoffi-
cial opinion might prevent the blood-
shed of citizens and the disgrace of
the state in each case they have re-
plied that their opinion is that prob-
ably the new election law will be broadly
interpreted so that mere technical er-
rors will not be allowed to negative re-
turns where the wishes of the voters
have been clearly shown here are
the messages i have just received

  he placed them in marstons hands
the general read them

  mr sawtelle i see that each jus-
tice expressly warns you that the opin-
ion is purely personal and unofficial
and he speaks only because it is rep-
resented that there is an exigency and
he wishes to prevent bloodshed do
you look for any such crisis as that
i do sir unless the people get what
belongs to them a military coup
detat was never in fashion in this coun-
try general their own statehouse is
being held by force against the people
the people will take it by force if theres
no other way i realize that you think
the crowd outside there is a pretty


the ppuljr magazine

feeble proposition it is but some-
thing else is on the way one of the
members whom thornton is keeping
out of his seat owns the avon granite
quarry he has wired and has two
hundred men on the way they are
bringing their sledge hammers and
dynamite another man has routed
about a hundred ice cutters from the
river boarding houses they are all
rough and rowdy men its bad busi-
ness  but stealing this state is worse 
mr sawtelle declared marston
firmly these telegrams contain no au-
thority

  i have admitted it already take
them for what they are worth

  you assert that there is a rough
and ugly mob on its way are you
its spokesman do you demand that
i shall give up this statehouse to that
mob

  i do not i demand that the state-
house shall be given up to the people
so that the representatives whom the
people have elected to office shall be
able to take their seats to-morrow

  i advise you to call off your mob
sir

  it is not my mob the matter has
gone so far that my authority is noth-
ing now

  i am trying to be patient and just
sawtelle i ask you to note that
you are too blamed patient broke
in saunders youve got the law and
your orders and a machine gun  what
are you standing here and dickering
with the enemy for 

  mr saunders you are the messen-
ger for the governor and council you
belong upstairs in the executive de-
partment go up there

  im going to stay here and see
whether youre proposing to betray
your party or not

  captain holt detail a guard and re-
move this man to the department where
he belongs	t

  saunders started for the elevator
muttering oaths

  general marston turned again to the
lawyer

  you say you have no authority if

that is so we are simply wasting time
you will please step outside sir
you say its dangerous to let a mob
inside here general let me tell you
it will damage state property a devilish
lot more if you keep that mob out-
side

  marston did not reply

  what shall i tell em demanded
sawtelle

  do you insist that you have no au-
thority 

i cant stop em unless you quit
then you tell the crowd outside that
i shall stand for the good name of our
state and shall not allow a mob to run
things in defiance of law and order
its civil war then 

  thats for you fellows outside to
say unless you can wait for the law to
prevail	

  a harsh voice broke in

  drive that man out of this state-
house even if you have to brad him
along with bayonets

  governor thornton had come down
a part of the main stairway and stood
at the break of the first terrace of
steps

  behind him were members of the
council beside him were his daughter
and mrs trueworthy

  i do not need bayonets sir re-
torted the lawyer beginning his re-
treat i am going it isnt safe in-
side here any longer

 general marston walked up the
stairs after the lawyer had withdrawn

  that was good talk i heard from
you just now marston called his ex-
cellency but saunders told me you
were quitting

  mr saunders has just told me
something also governor thornton
may i speak with you in private
isnt this private enough  were
among friends-all standing for the
same thing

  marston shook his head

  the governor turned and led the
way

  aileen slipped her hand into mar-
stons when he started to follow and
went along by his side

  it is so wonderful she whispered
the tictator



when i asked you so long ago to help
my father i didnt know you would
save him when the time came hart
his lips were set close and he did not
answer her

  it is all on your shoulders i un-
derstand now i was wrong to worry
you with my poor questions i shall
not trouble you any more dear heart
but when they came to the door of
the governors chamber she did not re-
lease his hand

  it cannot be so private that i can-
not be present she protested when
he tried to free himself lifting her
hand gently

  its best for me to see the governor
alone

  father she appealed you dont
care do you

  let the girl come in marston its
all in the family whatever it is bad
idea to start in having secrets from the
womenfolks their guessing is worse
than the truth

  he laughed but he did not appear to
be wholly at ease in his attitude toward
marston he seemed to welcome the
presence of his daughter at their inter-
view

  when the door was shut and the
three were closeted his excellency
walked to and fro

  speed up marston if they pro-
pose to try their fool tricks youll be
needed below the responsibility is on
you just now

  i realize that sir i still insist that
you and i should have our talk in pri-
vate

  he bowed to aileen and caught an
indignant flash from her eyes

  i have never had to hide anything
from my own daughter marston
and why should you have secrets
that i should not know hart

  he looked from one to the other
very well he agreed here is
the situation they are going to send
an ugly gang of irresponsibles against
the statehouse

only threats and hoorah marston
bribed rowdies will do almost any-
thing under cover of darkness sir it
means a nasty fight it means the dis-

grace of this state here are a few
messages from justices of the supreme
court

  the governor gave them hasty in-
spection

  only unofficial guesswork they say
so

  however i have other information
that isnt guesswork-unless saunders
lies he tells me that our own party
returns were sent back for rectifica-
tion

  the governor walked for a few mo-
ments then he came and stood in
front of the adjutant general

  look here marston im coming
frankly into the open wdth you id
insult you if i didnt you are in our
party youre an officeholder under me
youre in my family youre closer to
me than anybody except my wife and
daughter im merely playing politics
as they all play it when theyre forced
you talk about disgrace puh the
only disgrace is being licked in the
game

  i dont agree with you sir

  the governor stared scruffed his
mane and bristled

  i havent picked up a traitor have
i 

  it is a fact then that all the elec-
tion technicalities were used against the
other party

  we only played the game if the
other crowd had been in control the
same thing would have been done

  i havent had much training in pol-
itics sir but i did get certain things
from my grandfather and my father
and on that account i am not the right
man for the service you demand i
am sorry

  marston you have your orders
youre a soldier youre in command
your duty is clear

  it might be clear in a monarchy
sir but this is america where a good
citizen must subscribe to right instead
of might

  the governors temper was on the
hair trigger it was evident that he
felt too sure of this ally who was bound
to him by so many ties


the vovulatr magazine

  look here marston youre talking
like a damnation prig and snob

  i know it sounds like spread-eagle
buncombe sir i have heard stump
speakers get off the same stuff but i
dont know how to say itany other way
-for it happens that i mean it
mean what

  that i absolutely refuse to be a
party to any such tricks

you know as little about politics
as your folks did about their business
possibly the general bowed

  if you dont mean to help me and
your party what do you mean to do
to hurt us 

  hart you must listen to my father
he is older and wiser than you in po-
litical matters urged the girl just
think what you are to him-to me-to
all of us

  i have thought it all over aileen
the matter doesnt admit argument
from my standpoint

  he went to the desk and wrote for
a few moments and they looked at him
in silence he rose and gave the paper
to the governor

  there is my resignation sir

  i cannot accept it i am not the
governor of this state at this moment
if you will glance at it sir you
will notice that it goes into effect the
moment you take your oath of office
to-day i intend to serve until you are
once more governor

  serve how

  by handling this situation as best i
know how so as to prevent blood spill-
ing there cant be war unless there
are two sides to a fight i shall im-
mediately march the troops out of this
statehouse

 by the gods of gomorrah you
dont dare to betray me in any such
manner roared thornton

  those troops invite attack their
presence here will bring on attack i
shall clear the statehouse sir

  even if your condemned idiocy
leads you to betray your interests and
your party and me you dont mean to
tell me that you propose to betray your
promised wife to the mob you will let
in here

  i shall look after her safety sir
aileens eyes were big and round with
amazement and anger

  you do not mean it you cant
mean it she cried

  i am obliged to mean it

  then i do not require any of your
kind of protection

  the trouble wtith you is youre a
devilish coward raged his excellency

  i have been called a coward once
to-night i think i disproved it

  i say you are a coward you dont
dare to stay here and protect your party
interests and this state property you
hear theres going to be a fight and you
run away

  there will be no fight an-d i shall
not run away sir

  look at that cur aileen by the
gods i run my family even if i am
not running the state just now i break
the engagement

  i can attend to that for myself 
father general marston do you for-
get all you have said and do you de-
sert my father and myself in this
fashion

  lie had been holding himself under
control with all the power of the mar-
ston will-that same will which had
enabled his father to forget himself and
hold his raw troops in the line of bat-
tle though love and personal inter-
ests and all that might win a mans
selfish inclination were strong within
him those considerations could not bat-
tle against that single-hearted and sim-
ple spirit of the right which had come
to him as a heritage from the men
whom he had enshrined as his models
and his mentors in the holy sanctuary
of his love

  his devotion was as completely in-
grained in his nature as the rectitude
which guards the honest man against
the sin of premeditated murder he
did not even pause to argue the mat-
ter

  but his self-possession left him when
he looked at her

  his shoulders drooped and he gave
her piteous regard seeking her forgive-
ness but she stood close to her father
the dictt



and her eyes were hard with the thorn-
ton resentment

  ill not marry a cur she cried

  i would not have you do so thats
why i refuse to assist in stealing this
state

  you insult my father

  i havent any words left for an-
swer i will not answer

 his face was white and he was
trembling

  you are a coward i would never
have believed it but you are

  i have dropped from a heaven into
a hell in a few hours and i am what
i am he returned

  then he left them hastily

  in the rotunda he found corporal
candage

  take what force you need from the
watchmen and post them at the doors
of the executive department let no
one leave the chambers until i give
orders

  he strode across to the soldiers who
were grouped at ease

  captain holt assemble equipment
and have your men fall in and remain
at parade rest when i give the word
you will march out and return to your
armory and disband

  before marston was halfway to the
door the bugle was pealing its orders

chapter xix

  there were more of them outside-
many more of them

  he noted that at least a part of the
hired bravos had arrived

  sledge hammers gleamed in the light
from the torches and men were lifting
joists to their shoulders arranging bat-
tering-rams

  counselors of violence were circulat-
ing in the mob

  the tin soldiers wont dafe to fire
break in the doors  the statehouse is
ours

  marston climbed to the pedestal of
one of the pillars supporting the car-
riage porch he stood revealed to all
of them they looked up at him and
became silent

 listen to me he shouted let

 me tell you that if you come up against
 this statehouse with weapons the sol-
 diers will fire and by my orders they
 will fire to kill some of you know
 me and those who do know me know
 that im not much of a liar

   but you are backing up thieves

   i am not i am out here to declare
 to all listeners that i am not saw-
 telle i see you back there will you
 come forward and bring the more re-
 sponsible men in this crowd 

   they came promptly and lined up in
 front of the speaker

   i am ready to march my troops out
 of the statehouse you have heard that
 bugle it means that the men are in
 marching order they will come out
 of that door when i give the word and
 will proceed to the armory and dis-
 band if they do not remain in the
 statehouse there can be no fight here
 to-night

   but how about morning-and that
 legislature 

   i am in control until the legislature
 has been seated and organized and
 i want to say here publicly that every
 citizen of this state who comes to these
 doors in orderly fashion will find the
 way into the peoples house made clear
 for him thats on my honor as a man

the law will decide who are entitled
 to sit in these chambers i shall march
 out my troops but first i want a pledge
 from you men outside here that when
 the soldiers come out they will be
 treated with the respect due to men
 who are serving their state truly and
 well i also want a pledge that this
 crowd will about face and follow the
 soldiers down the hill and away i
 want a pledge that you will all respect
 this statehouse even as i respect it do
 i get that pledge

   i will answer shouted sawtelle
 i realize fully what general marston
 has done for this state to-night i
 know the sacrifices he must be making
 i ask his forgiveness for what i have
 said it isnt the first time the mar-
 ston blood has blessed this state of
 ours in behalf of all here i will
 say that we will respect our fellow cit-
 izens when they come out and that i


the tpovulatr magazine

will lead the march away behind them
and if there is a man in this crowd
mean enough or cheap enough to for-
get himself i call on the man nearest
to him to beat him up and i will pay
for all damages

  the voices of the throng indorsed
that sentiment

  captain holt was framed in the door
the crowd was cheering so loudly
for general marston that the latter
could not make his voice heard he
signaled with his hand and immedi-
ately the march of the troops began
when the soldiers appeared cheers
greeted them and the fifes and drums
which had led rebellion up the hill now
led amalgamated citizenry down and
away

 do you need any further pledge
that this statehouse will be opened to
all in the morning the general asked
sawtelle

  i do not sir good night

  after the door was closed marston
went up to the executive department

 he dismissed the watchmen and
walked in

  governor thornton his councilors
and the ladies surveyed him with frigid
silence which was more bitterly ac-
cusatory than angry words

  his excellency broke the silence
how long am i to be a prisoner
the doors are open for all to come
and go sir the troops are out the
mob has dispersed

  then we will no longer intrude on
your majestys privacy said thorn-
ton with stiff sarcasm he offered his
arms to the ladies and led the retreat

 leila trueworthy gave marston a
glance of sympathy as she passed the
others did not look at him

  he was left alone in the deserted
chamber of the chief executive master
of the situation master of the state for
a few hours but no longer master of
his emotions he turned off all the
lights except the one at the governors
desk sat down in the big chair and
allowed the tears to roll down his
cheeks when the reaction overwhelmed
him the hush in the great building

 was supreme the distant bells of the
 city clanged two oclock but he was
 not interested in time then he had re-
 solved to keep vigil until the law again
 placed responsibility in other hands

   old john candage came at last on
 his rounds flashing his electric torch
 he gazed at the silent figure in the big
 chair sighed and passed on he
 searched his soul for words to give to
 the son of his old colonel but he was
 afraid to speak even to express the
 sympathy that quivered within him

    the boy is up there fighting it out
 he told sergeant tarr hell is shell-
 ing him with all kinds of ammunition
 but he wont run any more than his
 old father wrould have run that day
 he told us stories on the hillside hell
 stand his  ground he has the same
 kind of courage to do right no matter
 what price he pays

   then came the newspaper men
 general marston knew they would
 come he had been waiting for them
 he had seen them outside in the mob
 giving close attention to the exciting
 developments of the evening

   he received them in the executive
 chamber

   we have come to you for a state-
ment the spokesman informed him
p the governor refuses to see us-will
 not be interviewed

    i can explain the situation gentle-
 men the generals face was pale
 and his jaw muscles were ridged with
 resolution governor thornton called
 troops to the statehouse because it was
 reported to him that irresponsible men
 were gathering to do damage to state
 prqperty when his excellency saw
 that his attitude was misunderstood he
 sent the troops away it was a chiv-
 alrous lie but the face of aileen thorn-
 ton was before him and her fathers
 reputation was at stake he had de-
 termined to protect her and her family

   but the opposition claims that a
 state steal was attempted

   we know that all kinds of wild
 charges are made in the heat of politi-
 cal talk gentlemen i wrould think
 twice before i put any such charges in
 print guard the reputation of our
the dictjltor



state you will be libeling men in high
positions it will be dangerous

  well admit its mostly gossip-and

now that the statehouse is open-

  it is open it will stay open

  but we need the governors state-
ment

  i think i can arrange for it wait
a moment

  he turned to the telephone

  he gave the number

  they do not answer stated central
after a time

  its urgent ring until they do an-
swer

  finally he got grudging acknowledg-
ment and he recognized the servants
voice

  this is adjutant general marston
at the statehouse joseph tell the gov-
ernor that i must talk with him

  he has given strict orders sir that
he-

  you go tell him what i have said
broke in marston sharply tell him
he must talke with me its the states
business he must

  he waited and at last the governors
rasping voice grated in his ear 

  well

  governor thornton i have just
issued a statement to the newspaper
men it is absolutely essential that
you indorse it

  ill indorse nothing sir

  wait a moment i have told them
that you ordered the troops to leave the
statehouse because you found that pol-
iticians were taking advantage of the
situation and that rowdies were misun-
derstanding it i am sending the news-
paper men to your residence they will
read to you my statement of course
you will corroborate what i say

  there was a long pause marston
detected a dull muttering-whether the
soliloquy was composed of oaths or ex-
pressed amazement he could not de-
termine

  tell the newspaper men to come
down here said the governor after a
time

  theres one thing about my lie and
the one i expect thornton to tell mut-
tered marston when he was alone

again the actual conditions are back-
ing us-sawtelles props of proofs have
been knocked out from under him
but as he sat in the big chair and
pondered on his pitiable case he un-
derstood that the wreck of his own
hopeswas complete the spirit of tyr-
anny was as thoroughly ingrained in
rutillus thornton as the finer sense of
honor wtas a part of the marston na-
ture in the estimation of the man
who had won fortune and power merely
because he could captain men disobe-
dience was the sin unforgivable and
marston knew the girls nature un-
questioning loyalty served her as the
touchstone to prove the man

  it had happened so suddenly  the
disaster was so complete

  he was like a man benumbed by
shock-he had not begun to have full
understanding of the cruelty of his
wounds he set his forehead into his
cupped hands and found himself un-
able to steady his thoughts there in
the silence in the big room he found
unreality when after a time he heard
footsteps and raised his head and saw
aileen thornton he did not show any
surprise he did not speak to her
he did not rise to greet her she
too seemed a part of the unreality

  general marston she said coldly
you certainly have kept your word to
our political enemies the statehouse is
open i j ust came in and nobody no-
ticed me

  he crossed his arms on the desk and
looked up at her without speaking

  i realize perfectly that its a most
unheard-of thing-my coming here in
fact the most of our acquaintanceship
has been made up of peculiar actions
on my part we may as well end that
acqtiaintance by the most singular per-
formance of all so i am here i
think i have the right to ask you why
you have allowed a perfectly idiotic
political row to ruin our love to sep-
arate us forever why did you do it 
he shook his head slowly staring
vacantly ahead of him

  you must realize perfectly that all
is over between us you deliberately
ruined my fathers plans when you had


the popular magazine

the power to do so your love for me
must have been a pretense

  it was not he spoke without
emotion his strange torpor still con-
trolled him it was the only precious
thing which ever came into my life

  i cant believe that sir i am a
woman love can be proved to a
woman only by sacrifice

  there are some sacrifices a man
cannot make

  listen sir do you still love me
  more than my life

  i have been talking with my father
it is not too late to save this situation
if you will act with us you have
powrer to close the statehouse until my
father is inaugurated and can take over
the authority you need not use
troops

  i have given my word that the state-
house shall remain open

  i have sacrificed my pride-my
modesty-to come here because- it
would have embarrassed my father to
come the affair is simply politics
anyway men change their minds in
politics and nobody blames them ex-
cept the rogues who were trying to play
their own tricks think what it means
to you and to me if you help now  it
will undo what has been done by you
it will prove that you do love me
hart help my father

  she sat down at the desk and put
out her hands across it to him

  but he did not reach and take them
im sure you do not look at the
thing in the right light she insisted
you have coddled family pride too
much you cant expect everybody to
understand it and make a fetish of it
these are new days and there are new
ways

  but a mans word of honor-

  dont be priggish

 and a lie-

  she broke in again she looked
straight at him a strange light in her
eyes

  you lied only a little while ago sir
  it was a sacred lie i did it for

your- i believed it was right

  it made father think you had come
back to your right senses so i am

here are you going to spoil it all

again 

  in herself she was temptation su-
preme her eyes were vivid her
cheeks framed by her furs had been
painted in rosy colors by the touch of
the frost outside and by the excitement
of the interview

  she drew a folded paper from the
pocket of her cloak-

  father has sent it back let me
tear it up she pleaded you are
mine

  he rose and drove his fist down on
the desk

  yes i am yours body brain
heart and soul i am yours my love
for you has been so wonderful that i
am afraid of it

  hart again i beg you her
eyes were more brilliant her lips were
apart be ours-not theirs be
mine-you are mine i say

  but when others say and you come
to know that they say that i sold my-
self my word of honor to men my
pride my self-respect my good name
and all that goes with manhood you
will feel that you own a cur aileen
youd despise me though i gave
you everything it would not buy hap-
piness for either of us i will not do
it

  you are sure of it nothing can
influence you-our future-having me
through all the years ahead of us
nothing can influence me to betray
my word and this state 

  she stood up and faced him

  hart what happened here a few
hours ago happened very suddenly
there was no time for reflection then
i hardly understood what had hap-
pened i didnt understand my own
self i went home and pondered and
while i was trying to see all more
clearly those men came to my father
with your statement and i overheard
-and i understood what you were i
came here to make sure of it i have
made sure i would not have you any-
thing else for i have found a man
who is honest and true and whom i
can worship as well as love
the ictator



  she hastened to him before he could
shake his amazement from him she
clasped her arms about his neck

  i am your own my love life every-
thing teach me how to live to be
worthy of you

  after a long time she drew herself
gently out of his arms in the ecstasy
of their passion he had forgotten all
serious matters but when she picked
up the paper which held his resignation
he became grave

  there is something important i have
to say to you hart my father and i
sat down together and talked after we
got home  he is an old man he lived
in the old days he was chosen by a
political party to high office which sat-
isfied all his ambitions he has felt
under obligations to that party he
almost forgot that he was governor
of a state instead of a party the men
who were closest to him expected him
to control affairs for their profit he
did the best he could to satisfy them
but you have grown to know more
about my father than most men know
you have seen under the surface he
is not a rascal he found out suddenly
to-night that there is something beside
political tricks needed in the game oh
we have had a good long talk and
while we were talking those men came
and he found that you had saved his
honor and his reputation for him and

in his old age he has grown to prize
his good name among men though he
does forget himself occasionally

  she smiled at her lover

  he knows now that when he walks
into the statehouse within a few hours
he can come and take oath as the gov-
ernor of the people not as the tool of
a few selfish politicians he woke up
all at once he is thankful hart so
thankful but remember that old men
are slow to swerve from their obsti-
nacy he asked me to tell you that he
is sorry he asked me to do this
she slowly tore the resignation into
shreds

  and he asked me to put my arm in
yours and lead you down to him after
my trial of you so that he can sleep
better knowing that all is forgiven and
that alls right with us come

  they went down the stairs together
and old john candage saluted as they
passed the watch-room door

  and when he saw the happiness on
their faces he winked at sergeant tarr

 i reckon love cant be dammed
when it gets to flowing full tide he
said itll bust down even the kind
of a dam rute thornton puts up step
here to the door sergeant tarr
look they make a pretty picture
dont they going down the hill in that
white light from the stars 

  he was right they did

peace with connor

by h c witwer
author of ye gods pie etc

   concerning two interesting warriors who play the war game on and off
the baseball diamond one of them a proally a left-hander with more curves
than venus and the speed of a frightened bullet the other a pro-teuton who
came along with the usual spring bunch of reservists from the mulberry
circuit they loved the rough-house in europe and if it hadnt been for
connor-

 dont know who started that melee
over in the old country and to get
real confidential with you i dont
care also my sympathies in the
thing is with hawaii in other words i
aint gonna take no bichloride no mat-
ter who wins it i never get mixed up
in none of them bulletin-board parties
and the only thing a war extra means
to me is a plot to get a nickel for the
evening annoyance or the morning
bunk

  of course i got private opinions-
i wouldnt be neutral if i didnt-but
i would no more think of speakin em
in public than i would of keepin my
cousins divorce suit alive ive tucked
my dope on the war away in the back
of my dome with the most scandalous
secrets i was ever let in on and nothin
will ever get it out of me but an opera-
tion

  i figure itll be time enough to worry
over the thing when we get declared in
on it and i have to go down and get
my teeth examined sos the recruitin
sergeant will be sure i can bean some
guy with a bullet at a mile i hope
when that time comes im in the hands
of some good union embalmer and the
insurance people aint welshed on the
missus i aint exactly yellah under-
stand but i cant see that war stuff

when i die i dont want to kiss off like
a clay pipe in a shootin gallery and if
give a choice between pneumonia and
shrapnel ill take the first one myself
its neater if nothin else

  the thing that makes the biggest hit
with me about the war is the fact that
we aint in it im simply infatuated
with dear old peace thats one reason
why im a great fan of grants he
was a big-league fighter but he knew
when to call it a day and when he had
the other guy hangin on the ropes
primed for the morphine wallop some-
body hollers whatll you have

  let us have peace says grant
whats yours

  thats me my favorite army is the
salvation

  i cant figure them birds that get all
worked up over the box score from the
other side every day they either hope
the kaiser stops one with his chin or
the alleys lose everything but their
back hair to hear them guys arguin
with each other youd think they was
fresh from the trenches and as a mat-
ter of fact if a call for volunteers
should go out from washington most
of them birds would have to be run
down with bloodhounds and william j
burns

  i had two of em with me last year
peace with connor



bill altberg and shorty journot im
twistin their names about a bit be-
cause both of them are in there tryin
with different clubs this year and whats
the use of startin somethin but them
guys put on in the clubhouse every bat-
tle that was fought in france and if
it hadnt been for mike connor wed
never of got in the worlds series on
account of the way they loved this
rough-house in europe the funny
part of it was that neither of them had
come to washingtons favorite country
by way of ellis island or had ever got
nearer europe than coney both of
them was born on this side of the big
drink and was as much american as the
star-spangled banner but that didnt
make no difference to them altbergs
grandfather had started life in berlin
and joumots mother had married a
viva la france and that settled it

  journot was with the club the year
before and come near bein the best
thing i had on the pitchin staff he
was a left-hander with more curves
than venus and the speed of a fright-
ened bullet every club in the league
had made him a proposition but i had
him tied up with a contract that did
everything but gimme leave to shoot
him if he run out altberg come along
with the usual spring bunch of reserv-
ists from the mulberry circuits

  this bird was as big as jess willard
and when they was givin out brains he
must of been around the corner playin
pinochle when he got back there was
nothin left but concrete and he got a
headful of that at least thats the way
he checked up to me after the first flash
i got at him but i wasnt runnin no
bank i was lookin for some  hit-
ters and after viewin this guy with
a bat in his hand i wouldnt of cared
if he thought twice six was nineteen
and grammar was a disease

  i put a uneyform on him the second
day he was at the spring trainin camp
and took him out on the lot with the
rest of the bunch journot happens to
come along just then and after gettin
an eyeful of altberg he sneers and
stands there within easy kiddin dis-
tance

  lets see i says to altberg wtiat
club was that you was with out there in
the wild west

  barnum and bailey ill bet butts
in journot eh stupid

  altberg blinks at him for a second

  i seen you tryin to pitch a minute
ago he remarks and if youre as wild
at everything else as you are at that
they must of grabbed you from a now
zoo

  i stepped between em

  on your way i tells journot be-
fore he can come back dont let these
guys kid you i goes on turnin to
altberg you got to expect a little
of that stuff but dont let em get your
goat

  i aint got no goat pipes altberg
and besides i dont have to take 
kiddin from a little fathead like that
which if hes in the now american
league ty cobb would laugh himself
sick

  all right all right i shuts him off
as journot reaches for a bat and steps
closer now what position do you
play 

  i play in a stooping position pipes
altberg bend in down to show me

  oh boy yells journot droppin
the bat and holdin his sides did you
get that one he shrieks he plays in
a stoopin position hey say if this
bird is a ball player i can walk a tight
rope

  well i says suppose you try him
out

  i grabs up a catchers mitt and tells
altberg to get a bat while me and jour-
not walks out to the diamond the
bunch is out there chasin flies that some
of the regulars is knockin out and i
shooed em aside as journot breezes
over to the box and starts to limber up
i put on a mask because i knew this
bird was gonna uncork everything he
had for the benefit of mister altberg
and i only hoped he wouldnt start by
beanin him he looks at the big feller
with the same passionate affection a
motor-cycle cop watches a guy tryin
out a twelve-cylinder gazoopis on fifth
avenue and before altberg can get
set with the wagon tongue in his hand


the populzir magazine

he shoots one over that would make a
telegram look like third-class mail

  plunnnnnk it socks into my mitt
missin altbergs nose by a stitch of
the cover altberg blinks and gets pale

  how was that mac sings out
journot windin up again

  keep em over a little i says
theyre still hangin em for murder
in this state

  lowlife hisses altberg regardin
journot with manslaughter in one eye
and mayhem in the other the next

one ill betcha ill-

 he turns around to me and-

zaaaam  the reason we paid jour-
not seven thousand a year shot past
him cuttin the plate as clean as a
knife

  where did you get this tramp
yells journot get the position will
you he looks like he was playin this
golf thing

  go on leff says altberg the color
of any fifteen-cent catsup always the
first two i dont bother with but the
next one-well ill betcha it comes
down in el paso for the first bounce if
ill hit it

  it just took two of them babies to
make you yell for the cops eh square-
head hollers journot well take a
swing at this boy and then go back to
the sticks

  altberg took a swing at it and the
first time it touched grass it was passin
the left-field bleachers it may have
finally stopped in chicago but if i had
money up on it id of picked denver

  journot hops around on one foot and
yells that the ball slipped out of his
hand

  ill bet you five bucks you cant do
that again he screams grabbin up
another ball you big stiff thats the
first hit you ever got in your life
thats because i been now battin
against pitchers which they had some-
thin more basides a uneyform says
altberg reachin in his hip pocket i
dont want i should take your money
and basides i aint got five dollars
but-

  i knew youd crawl bellers jour-

not youre as yellah as the rest of

them lemons west of ohio and-

 - aint got five dollars in

change goes on altberg but this ill
do if theyll stand for gembling here
ill betcha twenty you couldnt make
me fan on six pitched balls

  where dye get that stuff sneers
journot do i look like a sucker 
i suppose youll also lay me eight to
five gasoline will burn hey you
western birds are certainly game it
must be a gift manys the pot you
come near openin on three aces hey
recklebs 

  ill betcha on the ball then low-
life yells altberg gettin sore and
wavin the bill in his hand twenty
dollars i could hit safely out of the
first two youll put over now whos
a sucker

  listen canfield says journot
winkin at me put up your twenty
and ill cover it heres the bet you
cant get four safe hits out of six
pitched halls fouls to count as strikes
what dye say 

  suits me snarls altberg handin
me the money

  journot gives me two tens and walks
back to the box with his cap over his
face sos altberg wont see him laugh-
in i didnt go out of the way to hide
my feelins from the big boob though
i thought the thing would do him good
and help him develop his brain here
he was layin one of the best hurlers
in the league even money that he can
hit four out of six balls all he had
to do was miss three and he was
through

  by this time the bunch havin heard
the argument is gathered around the
plate and the remarks bein made about
altberg would never of made his par-
ents stuck up instead of botherin him
though it only makes him cool off and
clout the dirt in front of the plate with
his bat but the gang standin there put
mister journot about twenty-three
miles up in the air somebody told
him that altberg was simply usin that
name to cover up his record of twenty
hits in twenty times at bat which he
made in the american league back in
peace with connor



 and joe weil runs out with a
box of baseballs sayin he can get more
when them give out

  by the time journot got ready to
wind up he was as cool and collected
as a guy with st vitus dance drivin
a fire engine through the shoppin dis-
trict

  the first one he put over would of
made speaker get hysterics and alt-
berg missed it from here to virginia
i dont know whether he pulled that
swing or not but i do know that he
put the next one on the clubhouse roof
the next bounced off the center-field
fence and the next wtent over third
base to the railroad tracks by this
time all journot had left was his blond
hair and altberg takes a cigar out of
his pocket lights it and stands waitin
for the next leanin on his bat

  that was a plenty for friend journot
he discovered a kink in his arm and
beats it for the showers wrhile the gang
yells things about his family and so
forth that ill bet they wasnt braggin
about

  that started it

  of course after the exhibition of
swat the pill that altberg had put up
i wouldnt of let him go for a schedule
callin for all games with the cincinnati
reds i dragged him over to the hotel
and made him use a fountain pen on
a contract that would of brbke abe
lincolns heart he was to be mine
body and soul for one year and two
thousand bucks dont get the idea that
i got hysterical over this bird simply
because he was handy with a bat ive
sent enough of them kind back to the
dear old farm to bust up a convention
with bellers for roosevelt no--alt-
berg had a couple of more tricks he
was a circus fielder and had one of the
greatest throwin arms i ever seen ill
bet that bird could of stood in the club-
house and nailed guys goin from third
to home

  i put him in at left field and he got
three hits against charleston in one of
them exhibition things on the way up
journot had come back to life and
pitched shut-out ball not one of them
birds got an inch past first base for the

whole nine frames and the outfielders
could of started a crap game and got
away with it

  after the melee were dressin to
catch a train when journot comes in
with a newspaper he sits down on a
bench near the lockers right opposite
altberg and opens the thing out

  well he says i see theyre still
gettin the worst of it

  who-the athletics asks weil
no the germans says journot
the alleys are chasm em all over
europe and makin em like it

  altberg looks up and growls

  dont make me leff he says you
mean the alleys is pacin them ger-
mans not chasin em

  yeh barks journot well ac-
cordin to this here paper the english
alone took three miles of trenches four
towns and two thousand prisoners in
one drive yesterday

  puh sneers altberg ill betcha
i could tell you the name from that
paper

  what is it asks journot

  natural its the now london daily
mail says altberg

  this is the new york blooie pipes
journot and that stuff is as level as a
pool table you dont think them ger-
mans have a chance do you

  all i wish says altberg is that
ill have it the same chance of battin
four hundred this year thats all
heres them now germans which
theyre fightin the world and give a
look from the battle theyre puttin it
up all them lowlifes in europe is try-
in they should sock the kaiser and in-
stead of gettin beat hes got them al-
leys yellin for the police

  youre crazy you big stiff hollers
journot the alleys can win any
time they want theyre simply lettin
the germans stay sos them wall street
birds can grab a piece of money when
the right time comes the germans will
be all over

  you betcha theyll be all over yells
altberg theyll be all over france
england and russia i only hope they
wipe them sure-thing players like this
now italy and like that off the map


the vocpulatr magazine

im for the neuterals myself but if i
was gonna help any of them out you
could take my word for it id go to
bat for the kaiser

  ha ha ha laughs journot you
guys are a riot to me you wouldnt
climb in no trench if the mexicans
landed at the fort lee ferry i bet
you was the bird that fainted away dead
at the six-day race when the starter
fired off the revolver

  say why dont you guys stop that
stuff butts in mike connor if
youre so strong for that set-to m eu-
rope go on over and get in it they
been at it now for two years and here
you simps get moanin about it like the
thing just broke out last night lay
off will you

  whos askin from you snarls
altberg

  mind your own business stupid
says journot dont be always buttin
in somethin that dont concern you
he turns to altberg again i suppose
youre gonna claim the alleys started
the war hey

  well and why not asks altberg
is it a secaret from you  they was
all jealous from germanys now doin
all the business on the block  my fa-
ther had it the same trouble on sixth
avenue with some lowlifes-but thats
neither here and there did you ever
see them words on the bottom from a
plate made in germany  

  i never look at the bottoms of no
plates snarls journot

  well sometimes you couldnt help
it says altberg especial when a fel-
ler is sittin across the table from you
when youre drinkin soup yknow
that habit you got -of sayin heres
how and tossin off the consomme like
it was a high ball

  dont kid me you big hick yells
journot gettin feverish or ill bust
you in the nose

  if youll so much as make a face
from me roars altberg youll think
you was belgium

  aw shut up you fatheads hollers
connor

  i know where that made in ger-
many thing belongs  snarls journot

  where asks altberg

  on the war snaps journot and
not on no soup plates how bout it
hey he turns to connor

  youre both wrong says connor
i know what started the war but i
dont go round blowin about it it was
the same thing that starts all wars 

  and whats that asks altberg

  bullets hollers connor thats
what started the war how can you
start one without em

  i chased em all over to the train
before there was any further battles

  they get in an argument in the
smoker at washington and at balti-
more they gotta be dragged apart
journot climbs up on a seat in back
of altberg and dropped a suit case full
of bats on his head in order to show
him how a zeppelin bombs innocent
people and altberg comes back the
minute he could see by crawlin on the
floor under where journet is sittin and
buryin half a dozen pins in him which
he claimed was the way the u-boats
worked

  now i didnt mind this stuff so
much because they was both playin
good baseball but mike connor lost his
goat every time they got together and
opened up with the latest news from
the front he swore hed cure them
birds if it was the last thing he ever
did because the thing was drivin him
nutty theyd be up at daybreak every
mornin and race each other to the news
stands to get first crack at the papers
they hung around the tickers until din-
ner time and as soon as they got
through for the day at the ball park
theyd beat it for the nearest bulletin
board

  if the germans took a trench alt-
berg would go outside journots room
and warble the wacht am rhein
through the keyhole he was one of
them adenoid tenors and he was always
blowin about bein able to take e
sharps i guess he was right at that
because journot claimed his voice went
through him like a knife on the other
hand if the alleys had a good day with
the bayonets journot would stand out
peace with connor



in the hotel corridor murderin the
marseillaise on a mouth organ

  we opened the pennant scramble
with brooklyn and journot pitched
such a wonderful game for eight innins
that as far as hits was concerned we
could of been playin a team of arm-
less wonders our infielders could of
read novels for all the exercise they
got until the ninth in that frame alt-
berg comes runnin over to journot just
as were takin the field and shows him
an extra which says the germans has
gone through rumania like a hot poker
through a can of lard

  what of it snaps journot they
probably was a reason for it and them
rumans let em through 

  oi hollers altberg them ru-
mans then he busts out laughin
ha ha ha he hollers you could
believe it i seen a lot of now igrant
fellers in my time but you got em all
lookin like professors from harvard
you must of been brought up for luck
what is it then stupid snarls
journot commencin to aviate

  rumaniacs you boob howls alt-
berg if i had it a three-year-old son
and he didnt know that id shoot
him

  if you had a kid you wouldnt have
to bawls journot because the first
time he got a good flash at his father
hed drop dead

  connor pushed em apart but jour-
not was through for the day as far as
throwin baseballs was concerned the
first guy up for brooklyn got a double
and he could of had two moreonly he
was so surprised at the clout he hit the
pill that he stopped to watch it the
next man singled and then some left-
handed bird goes in and put the first
thing journot thro wed up against the
scoreboard at that point i give him
the bums rush and sent in harmon
he held em safe for the rest of the
innin and we was lucky to cop three
to two

  of course journot blames altberg
for his blowup and they was lovers
before compared to what they was after
that the next mornin theres a pic-
ture of one of them german generals

that was hittin about six hundred on
the front page of the papers we was
all lookin at it and connor says
humph he dont look much like
a german at that does he 

  i dont blame him pipes journot
dye see what it says underneath that
boobs picture he reads it out
 french plan new offensive 

  you could believe it them french
is offensive enough to me already
pipes altberg and as for the eng-
lish they admit theyre gonna lose
what dye mean they admit it 
sneers journot

  ill leave it to anybody answers
altberg aint they got a now song
called god save the king

  will you guys shut up bawls
connor throwin the paper on the floor

  who do you think will win it sim-
ple hollers journot you know so
much about it

  im bettin on samoa you big stiff
yells connor slammin out of the room

  well thats the way the thing went
all season altberg and journot scrap-
pin about the war and connor tryin
to make em forget it we took the
lead in the middle of august which is
the time the real ball clubs begin to
show what they got and we kept out
in front till they rung the bell on us in
october but if mike connor hadnt
come through with a lulu of a scheme
wed of watched the worlds series from
the tickers

  the last three weeks of the season
we was so far ahead of the others that
all we had to do was win four games
out of the bunch that was left and we
was in there was no way any of the
others could lap us and as usual with
that soft worlds series money in sight
the gang begins to ease up a bit i had
my hands full keepin the supply of pep
evenly distributed and i hung fines on
the ale hounds until the sight of a bar-
tender made em faint

  everything would of been peaches if
it hadnt been for them two stiffs alt-
berg and journot and that fracas in
europe ill bet many a guy with the
rent money up  us to cop the gon-
falon as a boston sport writer with


 the popular magazine

a bun on once called the pennant had
a stroke of paralysis before them last
three weeks was over we won them
four games all right but they was the
last four we played we lost all the
others from here to missouri before
crowds that would make the russian
army look like the rush in a butchers
on a rainy friday

  every time journot was pitching alt-
berg would pull some trick out there in
left field that let somebody get on a
base when they come at him with
anything like speed hed stand there
and wave at em and if they was long
flies altberg let em bounce before he
put a glove on em journot did his bit
whenever altberg come to bat hed
sit in the dugout and kid the big guy
till he had him swingin at wild pitches
and if altberg got on first journot
would beat it to the coachin line and
tell him that berlin had just fell captive
to the alleys and the kaiser was last
seen passin ceylon in a racin car

  now neither of them boobs realized
what they was doin on account of bein
so sore at each other they figured we
had a good safe lead and bein the last
days of the schedule what was a couple
of ball games to them

  it took me a long time to get wise
at first i thought their punko playin
was due to the strain wed been under
since we went out in front but that
sixteen-innin thing with the cubs was
the tip-off we got a run apiece at
the end of fifteen frames and the cubs
grabbed another in their half of the
sixteenth if we lost this one it meant
that the braves would only be two
games behind us and they was to be
entertained by the reds for the rest of
the week while we had to play base-
ball with hans wagner and his play-
mates from pittsburgh

  we got two out when weil doubles
on the first ball shown him then big
mason singles puttin weil on third
and the crowd in hysterics up steps
altberg and all the canfields in the -
grand stand offers three to one we cop

i sent journot who wasnt pitchin that
day down to the third-base coachin
line and he slows up as hes passin

the plate the cubs pitcher shoots one
over and both the base runners gets
under way altberg fouls the pill into
the grand stand and the crowd yells like
hed tripled then journot calls some-
thin to him and he looks around when
he looked back again there was two
strikes on him and the mob is yellin
murder i run down to shoo journot
away and the umpire pulls a watch on
him as he shuffles along

  sos the fans will realize hes still in
the game mason tries to rubber heel
us way to second and only by doin an
annette kellermann into the bag was
he able to get there neck and neck with
the ball the umpire gazes at the ma-
niacs in the bleachers and calls it safe
the pitcher winds up again the base
runners get goin-and this little tramp
journot yanks a newspaper from his
hip pocket

  hey listen stupid he bellers at
altberg the kaiser says hes got
enough and is beggin the alleys for
peace he waves the paper

  i wouldnt believe it if you swore it
from a stack of bibles yells altberg
lookin over his shoulder and be-
sides--

  zipp the best outshoot i ever seen
cuts the plate and altberg fans

  the crowd goes crazy and i plas-
tered a hundred-buck fine on both them
birds after givin them a bawlin out
that theyll remember when they have
forgot their names if it wasnt that
they meant big money to me id of
shipped em so far back to the bushes
that peary would of had to get em out
mike connor grabs my arm as we start
for the showers

  leave them babies to me he hisses
in my ear ill have em kissin each
other in a week 

  now there was a movie outfit that
had been botherin the owners for
weeks to let em take a picture at the
ball park while a sure-enough game was
in full swing finally the magnets give
in and said go ahead and shoot pro-
vided none of the advertisin signs in
left field appears in the thing because
in that case they would have to shake
down the tobacco people and so forth
peace with connor



for some extra money for puttin em
in the movies

  the next day we take on the pirates
and between the third and fourth innin
theres a commotion in the boxes back
of first base three guys with them
trick cameras tears out on the field and
in another minute a guy with a wart
on his nose and a megaphone joins em
yellin that all he desires is a little
speed because they cant hold up the
ball game while the crowd is standin
on each others necks to get an eyeful
a handsome devil with ravin black
curly hair a baseball uneyform and
more curves than a scenic railway
dashes out on the diamond and up to
the plate he gets about twenty feet
away from the thing when the bird with
the megaphone bawls ready there
-cameras-shoot

  with that the dashin young thing
runs like a nervous rabbit along the line
from third to home dives headfirst into
the plate and the crowd yells its head
off old megaphone mike hops around
on one foot barkin at the boxes and a
lot of enter with others which was
sittin there begins to ad lib they
jumped in the air waved their hats
soaked each other on the back and
yelled murder while them birdswith
the cameras worked like waiters at a
newsboys banquet takin pictures of it

  then the high diver gets up brushes
off his uneyform and dashes over to
the dugout where what pirates that
aint standin there with their lower lip
touchin their shoes is pushin each
other out of the way to get in the thing
the best-lookin dame i ever seen at a
ball park suddenly appears and bawls
harold the while rollin her eyes to
heaven like a kid eatin pie

  rotten-but itll have to do hol-
lers the bird with the megaphone

  you said somethin yells one of
the umpires cornin out of his trance
and gazin at his watch git this
troupe of hicks outa here will you
we got a little baseball to play and its
gittin late

  this dame and the guy that did the
slide for life into the plate pulls a all-
is-forgiven-come-to-my-manly-arms act

and if tfiat bird could play ball like he
made love hed of had ty cobb lookin
like a busher he looked like sweet
spirits of niter but boy-he was there

  they beat it then and as they was
goin out the rriovie queen asks alt-
berg if he is matty johnson and which
one is alexander speaker the great
fourth batsman the big stiff falls off
the bench laughin and she gets as red
as a four-alarm fire journot butts in
and smiles

  dont mind this here roughneck
lady he says hed laugh in church
you know how stupid them germans
is

  is that so she snaps at him
well i happen to be german you big
stiff do you mean to insinuate that
im stupid

  this dare-devil dave that was with
her presents each of them with a sneer
and they blow while journot sits down
on the bench tryin to laugh it off

  ha ha ha roars altberg oi
ill betcha ill break at least a rib from
leffing every time you open your
mouth somebody puts it their foot in
it you and the now czar of russia
should ought to shake hands from each
other only this morning the germans
throwed half his army in the lake

  yeh snarls journot well the
alleys will run that lucky stiff hinden-
burg ragged before he gets out of dear
old russia you can gamble on that

  hey listen guy pipes the umpire
grabbin his arm lets have a piece
of baseball here this afternoon will
you i just got rid of them other nuts
and you guys git goin what dye
think this is here to-day-new years
eve

  well we went in then and helped
make it a close race by droppin another
one

  that night while altberg and jour-
not are fightin the days battles out at
the hotel mike connor comes over to
me and says hes got his peace plan all
doped out and if he gets the breaks
the war will be over as far as were
concerned by the end of the week i
asked him what he was gonna do and
he closed up like a foldin bed when the


the cpocpuljlcr magazine

company sleeps in it all he would give
out was that he got the idea from the
war itself he claims the alleys would
be like altberg and journot fightin
among themselves if they wasnt
banded together for the time bein to
wallop somebody else and what could
be done in europe could be done here

  about two days later connor comes
around with the press agent for the
movie company that had pulled off the
picture in the ball park this guy says
that the annual ball and dinner of the
st vitus film company will be pulled
off the followin night and all the movie
stars male and female will be on hand
to meet their admirers and thank
heaven they are gettin away with it
he claims the evenin will be practically
spoiled if i dont bring my ball team
up as guests and an added attraction
theyre all dyin to meet what looks like
the pennant winners and he trusts i
wont cheat em of their desires and
stay away he adds that the idea of
invitin us up was give him by mike
connor and he had jumped at the
change hopin wed do the same

  i thought the thing over and the
more i figured the better it looked 
with all them dames there and so
forth the chances was that the thing
wouldnt turn out to be an alcohol bee
and the excitement might do the bunch
good i told this guy that wed be
there and connor jumps up and blows
to cigars

  the next mornin im tryin to get a
safety razor to make good when i hear
altberg and journot at it out in the
corridor

  well stupid pipes journot i
suppose youre goin to the racket to-
night hey

  a hundred and six girls theres
gonna be there and he asks me if im

noise with his nose

  yeh pipes altberg there was

only one pitcher could throw it it was
now a combination of an inshoot with

  cease says connor while journot
gives himself up to laughin im
talkin about a dance where everybody

berg your own father wouldnt know

  i didnt ask him no more

  at eight oclock thafnight we all left
for the hotel askmore that is all
except altberg and journot they had
peace with connor



blowed in different directions after the
game that day and nobody had seen em
since the minute we got in the ban-
quet hall among all them white shirts
and evenin gowns everybody starts to
ask for them to tell the truth them
birds was pretty near the biggest thing
in the league just then and to show up
without em was like a parade without
no bands i remembered hearin con-
nor tell em to show up at nine so i
said nothin but when they wasnt in
sight at ten i grabbed connor aside
and demanded him to come through
with his scheme he said it was so
harmless a child could use it and that
the idea run somethin like this when
altberg and journot come there all
dressed up like halloween and seen
that everybody else was in citizens
clothes theyd get so sore at him that
theyd forget about the war and pull
together to put somethin over on him
that he said was about what would
happen to all the peacemakers which
was tryin to make em cease on the
other side i asked him where he fig-
ured to come out on it and he said
he was irish and any irishman that
couldnt handle two men at a time was
lyin about his place of birth

  i didnt get no chance to ask him any
more because we start into the main
dinin hall for the assault and battery
on the eats there must of been five
hundred of us all told and all dressed
to the last notch some of them dames
would of made the follies quit and
they was all fresh-air fiends when it
come to clothes believe me up on the
galleries i seen guys with cameras
grabbin movies of the mob

  connor and me are on the same side
of the table with a dame on each side
and likewise in between the one on
my left asks me am i havin a nice
time

  if it was any better i says i
wouldnt be able to stand it

  im afraid youre a jollier she
laughs all you ball players are great
kidders we had several work in a
picture last week and-

  what was their names i butts in

  i forget now she says passin the
rolls i meet so many people

  you must be a traffic cop heh i
says

  ha ha ha she giggles i must
tell that at the screen club to-morrow
all right i says you can use
it if you mention my name when you
get your laugh but what about these
ball tossers

  oh yes she says they appeared
on the scene in full uniform it was
horribly funny  their-their-er-
trousers only came to their knees and
they didnt wear any stockings dont
you boys get cold playing out in the
open like that

  wed get pinched i tells her if
we played like that what club was
them guys with 

  i think it was the clan macqueens
she says isnt that who the great ty
cobb plays avith

 i dont know what he does at
nights i says stuffin a roll in my
mouth to keep from laughin in her
face i think youre a little twisted
them birds must of been soccer-foot-
ball players and not ball tossers

  why is there a difference she
asks me without battin an eye

  a little i says y see in base-
ball the nets are farther apart and-

  thats as far as i got with it

  there was a noise at the doors away
down at the end of the room and
without bein no sherlock holmes i
figured that the russian army was try-
in to get in and join the festive board
this dame jumps tip and grabs my arm

  this will be great she says
thats why i love to come to these
dinners-they always have something

unexpected like this and-

  crash  zam 

  the doors called it a day and quit
cold goin down as three waiters comes
in the room on third speed they hit
that polished floor and in tryin to
keep their feet they give an exhibition
that would of made charlie chaplin cut
his throat if he had seen it on top of
the waiters comes a couple of hat boys
and some more noise

  then a guy made up like a devil and


the pocpulacr magazine

another one rigged up like an indian
chief busts into the room standin in
the middle of the floor kinda dazed
while the movie crowd shrieks with
laughter

  thats what you call art pipes this
dame in my ear that must be them
two big plandome comedy stars who

  the devil rushes over to the table
and he only beat the indian chief by a
foot they stopped right in back of
me and the devil grabs connor by the
shoulder

 whats this-a frame-up he
hisses

  are you tryin you should make a
now monkey from me snarls the
indian

  now listen says connor gettin
pale at the last minute they decided
not to have a masquerade ball and i
couldnt get in touch with you guys to
tip you off

  ill betcha ill get in touch with you
lowlife yells the indian tearin off
the mask ill-

  why its the ball players shrieks
a guy sittin opposite in a high soprano
voice my word  how ridiculous 

  in a minute the whole room is wise
that this is altberg and journot the
diamond stars and somethin has been
put over on em one of the movie
heroes slaps journot on the back and
laughs while another one asks altberg
if he can do any tricks then them
actors starts pushin em from one place
to the other laughin themselves sick

  altberg slips on that glass floor and
in tryin to get up he stabs out at the
table with his hand and hits a bowl of
consomme with noodles slidin it off
on his head i thought the bunch would
go crazy and altberg did he springs
up and takes a healthy wallop at the
first guy he sees which happens to be
harold heavenly a big feature star
harold calls for volunteers and drew
about eighty at the first draft includin
a dozen waiters which went to the
front journot gets in it with a chair

and all the wronged wives vampires
bankers daughters and sweet country
lasses screams them that featured
faintin went the limit and pretty soon
there was a mob scene under way that
would make a lynchin bee look like a
chess tourney

  it only lasted about twenty minutes
because some traitor to the films put
out the lights when- the movie gang
rung in a squad of waiters from another
floor with the help of mike connor
who looked like a guy that has struck a
match and seen the singer building go
up in flames i got altberg and journot
from under a table and rushed them to
a side entrance just as the cops and
reporters rushed up in answer to the
third alarm i give a guy a dollar to
call a taxi quick and while were wait-
in a kid comes along with a war extra
connor kicks me in the shins and buys
one

  the big stiffs mumbles altberg
lettin three teeth fall ill betcha they
wont give it no more of them dinners
for ten years he turns to journot
who looks like hed been sparrin with
a buzz saw that was a great wallop
which you handed it to that rat whos
playin the now kansas city blues
on my head from a plate he says

  journot nods

  its a good thing you give that red-
headed murderer the knee he says
he liked to choked me to death

  i see the germans have took three
miles of trenches in france says con-
nor pointin to the paper

  i should worry about the germans
snarls journot i did more flghtin to-
night than them birds in europe will
ever see

  yeh says altberg let them fel-
lers have it the war over there why
should we interfere with their pleasure
basides he goes on slappin journot
on the back if theyre now crazy
enough they should fight with each
other i wouldnt interfere he looks
at journot just as the taxi skids up
hoch der france he yells

  viva le kaiser bellers journot

by victor maxwell

author of  when little things count  why arabia kissed me etc

    insured for twelve million dollars-a unique little consignment from europe in which
    arabia marston and the secret-service agents pf several countries were interested

before the stalwart twelve wtas
put on the market i drove the
car for more than half a year
making a tour of the country and
writing up my adventures afterward
under the title of six stalwart
months which jerry koven head of
the koven motors company was good
enough to say was the best piece of
publicity work he had seen and worth
the money it cost him and it was
while i was pulling this stunt that i
ran in with arabia marston again and
had the fun of helping kelly more or
less in a battle of wits with her you
may remember that ive told you of
kelly before-one of uncle sams
sleuths who occasionally got something
less prosaic than seeking counterfeits
in the line of his duty and arabia
marston-well she was the little girl
who smuggled thirty thousand dollars
worth of pearls into new york just
because she cried

  it was along in the latter part of the
summer when i was touring up the
atlantic coast in the last lap of my
swing around the compass in the stal-
wart that my little adventure started
i was lolling lazily along a road near
washington about a hundred miles
from the national capital when the
roaring exhausts of a high-powered car
behind me warned me that i was to
have another opportunity of testing the
speed of the stalwart twelve up to
that time i had enjoyed probably about
two hundred impromptu races with am-
bitious drivers of other cars and the
stalwart was still clean of the other
fellows dust so i advanced the spark

opened the throttle and hunched my-
self low in the seat behind the wdieel
as the big car picked up its gait

  to my surprise the stalwart didnt
pull away at once from the pursuing
roar of the car behind in fact the
staccato reports of the other machines
exhausts grew louder and nearer and
presently the weird screech of its siren
burst impudently upon my ear that
was too much for me and stepping
firmly on the accelerator i gave the old
girl all she would stand with a shiver
of power the big machine under me
leaped ahead and the noise of the other
fellows exhausts grew fainter in the
distance but just as i was smiling
to myself at another victory for the
stalwart the roar behind me increased
in volume and with the incessant
whining of its siren maddening me my
rival rapidly drew up

  we were on a superb road full forty
feet wide and there was no danger of
a collision favoring the stalwart as
much as i could i used every grain
of auto sense that i had but in spite
of that the other car slowly gained
and though my speedometer showed
better than seventy i was shocked pres-
ently to note out of the corner of my
eye that the front wheels and sloping
radiator of my rivals machine were
drawing even with me for over a
mile we were neck and neck and then
the other car slowly drew ahead until
i could catch a hazy glimpse of its
driver-a diminutive figure swrathed in
fur afid with goggles hiding the face

  desperate i pressed the red button
on the dash that controlled the stal-


the popular magazine

warts emergency manifold and almost
instantly regretted it i had never
given my machine the limit of its great
power before and i had all i could do
to hold it to the road so great was
its squirming thrust of power as its
mighty engine drove it madly along the
highway so much of my attention
was taken up by the wheel which
writhed in my grasp that for the mo-
ment i forgot my audacious rival and
when i realized at last that i was alone
on the road the needle on the speedom-
eter was quivering over against the
pin beyond the ninety-five mark and
the stalwart twelve was shooting along
likfe the ghost of fear

  knowing that i had given the other
fellow plenty i snapped off the gas and
spark and pulled in to the side of the
road to wait for my pursuer the
other machine a rakishly lined foreign
car drew up alongside a few minutes
later and the fur-clad driver descended
to look the stalwart over as they al-
ways did i was just going to talk
up the merits of the new model when
i was stricken dumb for the fur-clad
driver tossing aside cap and goggles
revealed a mass of tawny hair falling
in wind-torn ringlets about her laugh-
ing face arabia marston faced me
the last person in the world i expected
to see and loosed her mirth at my con-
fusion

  well well smith she gurgled
gasping for breath that was the first
time you beat me wasnt it whered
you get the boat and what are you do-
ing with it 

  i told her all about it there was
never any use in my trying to keep
things from arabia anyway and in
this case it was part of my job to tell
people about the stalwart she lis-
tened occasionally throwing in a ban-
tering comment and when i had fin-
ished my tale she reached over and
jerked open the hood of the big ma-
chine and ran an expertly appraising
eye over its engine

  ill give you this foreign devil of
mine and five thousand to boot foryour
car smith she said after her exami-
nation was complete i want to boast

that ive got the fastest thing on wheels
in this part of the world and i cant
do it unless youll trade

  the stalwart isnt on the market
yet arabia i said but ill be glad
to take your order and ill promise
you one of our first deliveries

  she shook her head and gurgled out
a laugh no smith we trade now or
never but never mind-drive down
the road a way with me theres a
decent place about five miles on where
we can get a bite for lunch and a chance
to talk over old times hop in and
follow me

  the decent place that she men-
tioned proved on our arrival to be a
lavish sort of combination of country
club and road house a resort just far
enough from washington to be reached
by an enjoyable run and gorgeous
enough in its equipment to attract the
spenders that make the national capital
their headquarters during sessions of
congress arabia seemed to be well
known at the place for the liveried
attendants who greeted us and took our
cars to the garage welcomed her with
that special brand of attention that is
only won by frequent and ample tip-
ping

  after brushing off my clothes- in a
dressing room just off the entrance i
joined arabia in the spacious lobby be-
yond and she led me through a vista
of doorways and corridors to a shaded
pergola somewhere in the rear of the
resort where tables covered with white
linen sparkling glass and gleaming sil-
ver lined a railing that separated the
tiled floor from a perfect lawn

  well have lunch she said to the
waiter who drew out our chairs and
then turning to me continued

  one of the beauties of rhohans is
that you dont have to order things
you just tell the waiter whether you
want breakfast lunch tea or dinner
and the chef sees to it that you get just
what you ought to have its a lovely
scheme

  and mr rhohan looks after the
bill too i take it i said with a laugh
i had a liberal expense account with
ovals are unlucky



the koven people and i wasnt worry-
ing very much

  you guessed right the very first
time smith arabia replied with a
laugh youre improving arent
you  by the way seen kelly lately 
i had been expecting some such ques-
tion from my fair companion but from
the tone in which she asked it i couldnt
make out whether she was interested in
my friends whereabouts or his pres-
ent mission i shook my head

  i havent seen kelly since the time
you gave us the slip at pott townsend
you remember that time	

  i ought to remember it smith it
was the first time i kissed you

  her retort made me blush for it
was my surprise over that kiss that
enabled her to dodge away from kelly
and me just as we were closing a net
about her in connection with the at-
tempted smuggling of a boatload of
chinese into the united states from the
north arabia laughed at my discom-
fiture and said

  well if you go on to washington
youll probably see him that is if
you look for him hes working on
some war stuff-i dont know just what
it is i saw him at the white house
last week

  you saw him at the white house
i gasped

  uh-huh went there with a friend
of mine to try and get a chance to
shake hands with the president but
he was busy and no callers were ad-
mitted just as we turned away kelly
dashed out of the executive offices and
made a run for an automobile thats
what makes me think hes working on
war stuff otherwise hed hardly have
been at a white house session

  ill look him up to-night i expect
to spend the night in the capital and
maybe longer what are you doing
arabia 

  she laughed at me and nibbled at a
stuffed olive you wont believe me
smith but ill tell you the truth-im
not doing a single solitary thing im
just enjoying myself loafing around
rhohans here and flirting with the men
who come here evenings

  she was right i didnt believe her
and i as much as said so in my next
question

  why the big car then arabia
and why did you offer me five thou-
sand to boot for a trade with my stal-
wart 

  i knew you wouldnt take my word
for it smith yet its true im just
loafing around as for the car ive
got the fastest one around here-or i
had till you came along and now
like a spoiled child i want yours be
reasonable and let me have it

  our luncheon was served just then-
a deliciously cooked and perfectly
served meal as we ate we bantered
about the stalwart about our former
adventures together and about incon-
sequential things arabia gave me no
more information about herself per-
sisted that she was simply having a good
time while she could and urged me to
run out from washington again and
see her before i continued on my tour
with the new koven masterpiece this
i promised to do and we parted when
our meal was finished i charging up
luncheon for two twelve dollars as
i climbed into my car and gave the
liveried attendant a dollar for bringing
it around from the garage as arabia
said mr rhohan surely looked after
the bill as well as the comfort of his
guests

  after i got settled in my room at
the hotel in washington i called up
the treasury department and got in
touch with kelly it took a few mo-
ments to get him on the telephone but
the warmth in his voice as he greeted
me more than repaid for the waiting
and he assured me that he was excep-
tionally glad that i had arrived at such
an opportune time that he had some-
thing in hand that he thought would
interest me and that hed be right over
a few minutes later he was shaking
hands with me heartily and in less time
than it takes to tell it we were seated
in armchairs mingling the smoke of
our cigars in friendship

 he wanted to know what had
brought me to washington and after
i outlined the stalwart trip and the


the popular magazine

publicity scheme behind it i told him
that i had run across arabia on the
road and had lunched with her at rho-
hans

  you interest me extremely said
kelly laughing at me

  then you knew arabia was there 
i asked somewhat disappointedly for i
had hoped to bring him news

  one of the boys has been watching
her for two weeks he answered but
he hasnt uncovered anything i have
often wished you would turn up
smith you have such a taking way
with arabia in fact i was thinking
of wiring for you

  dont be sarcastic kelly lord
knows i realize how i bungled things
every time you let me in on any of
your cases concerning her is she up
to her old tricks again

  kelly reached out a hand- and patted
me on the back you didnt bungle
things smith you helped a lot per-
haps you didnt do just what you al-
ways expected to do but you helped
just the same if you hadnt i should
not have continued to ask you to work
with me as to arabia she isnt up
to any old tricks her tricks are never
old she has a new one each time and
maybe you can help me find out what
shes doing this time-if you want to
you know id be glad to kelly
i replied but if youre after arabia
again im afraid i wont be much use
to you she told me you were in wash-
ington and i told her id look you up
so you see if you put me to watch-
ing her shell already be on her guard
shes always on her guard an-
swered kelly and the fact that she
told you i was in washington shows
that she hopes ill get you to work
on her with me i think it would be
a good plan to let her have her way
did she tell you what i was doing
she said you were on war busi-

  she knows better than that smith
snapped my friend and ill tell you
this when -there is any war business
for the department to worry over ara-
bia marston will be working for her

uncle samuel just like the rest of us
dont look surprised i mean it and
for two reasons in the first place it
would pay us to have arabia working
for us shed be safer and so would
we and in the second place in spite
of her adventuresome disposition youll
find that she is a patriotic little girl at
heart i wouldnt hesitate to recom-
mend her to the chief to-morrow if
we should get into any real interna-
tional trouble

  i hope youre right kelly and i
suppose you are for you know her
pretty well but just the same id want
to be awfully sure what is it you
want me to do to help you

  the usual thing smith stick as
close to her as you can for a few days
and find out what shes doing at rho-
hans

  i laughed she told me she wasnt
doing a thing aside from having a good
time what sort of a place is rhohans
anyway kelly  it strikes me as being
queer in some way

  my friend smiled as he answered
it is and its more than that too
this fellow rhohan who is running it
was formerly a secret agent of the aus-
trian government just before the war
broke out we heard that he had gotten
in bad at home and a few weeks later
he came over here plentifully supplied
with money and opened up this resort
near washington of course it at-
tracted all kinds of people at first but
as the prices were high and the morals
almost as high it soon rid itself of the
rougher crowd and became the haunt
of the well to do and idle element it
also attracted a group from official
washington-secretaries and lesser offi-
cers from the legations army and navy
men and some federal-bureau heads
-those who could afford the sort of
entertainment offered i fancy the
place has already paid good returns on
the capital invested

  charging six dollars a plate for
lunch it ought tcf i interjected with
a laugh

  i dont mean that way said kelly
smiling at my allusion to the high cost
of living there i mean as a clearing
ovals are unlucky



house for information you see
smith the people that go there know
a number of things and it is safe to
presume that they gossip more or less
about what they know discreet wait-
ers overhearing their talk should be
able to put two and two together and
make four-or perhaps more and a
person like arabia for instance ought
to be able to pick up quite a good deal
of interesting news in the course of a
pleasant evening with the distinguished
guests of mr rhohan and i think one
of the reasons that arabia is there is
to find out all she can-possibly for
rhohan and possibly for somebody
else thats one reason why id like
to have you cultivate arabia a bit
maybe we can get a line on who shes
working for weve got a couple of
men at rhohans now but aside from
giving us a list of whos there each
night they dont seem to be finding out
very much

  if rhohans bothers you i should
think you could close it up i am sure
there is gambling going on there among
other things

  rhohans doesnt bother your uncle
sam a bit replied kelly and while
we could close the place in a minute
on half a dozen different excuses wed
rather let it run it may give us some
information as well as the other fel-
lows in fact smith theres something
coming off right now that i am con-
vinced will break at rhohans and i
wouldnt for worlds have the place shut
up before then it might spoil our
chances

  what is it kelly tell me and
perhaps i can get arabia to give me a
lead on the matter without knowing
that im pumping her

  my friend looked at me silently for
some time evfdently trying to decide
on the advisability of taking me en-
tirely into his confidence i did not
in the least resent this for i knew that
kelly dealt largely in government
secrets and i also knew that in times
past i had permitted arabia marston
to find out from me things which i
was not supposed to reveal very
shortly however kelly made up his
b p

mind and drawing his chair closer to
mine he began to talk

  ill tell you part of it anyway
smith over in that strip of europe
that separates the old world from the
older world-the balkans-there is a
certain very rich province or kingdom
that is directly in the path of the war
torrent if the central powers capture
it they capture vast stores of supplies
and more particularly the crown jewels
these jewels are almost priceless
smith they comprise a collection that
is barbaric in its reckless selection and
in splendor and that is probably worth
five or six million dollars  possibly
more in the present-day market if
the central powers get these jewels it
will be equivalent to giving them a
pretty considerable windfall of capital
and if they get them we have reason
to believe that the entire collection will
be sent to rhohan to dispose of he
will receive instructions either to sell
them or to negotiate a loan upon them
hed get more on a loan just at pres-
ent and quite naturally the allies are
anxious to prevent the jewels from fall-
ing into the hands of the central powers

or any of their agents so--

  but how could the jewels be sent
to america i interrupted every
day we read of british warships stop-
ping vessels at sea and searching-

  kelly laughed at my interruption
you reason just like a congressman
smith you forget that submarines
armed and unarmed are making suc-
cessful voyages to this country appar-
ently at will and the allies knowing
that and also knowing the value of
these crown jewels have politely sug-
gested that the state department do
what it can to prevent the disposal of
the jewels here basing their action on
the allegation that if the central powers
get hold of the jewels and try to sell
them they will be disposing of stolen
property and as disposal of stolen
property is dealt with in our treaties
the matter of the jewels becomes a
question of ordinary criminal law in-
stead of international diplomacy do
you see the point

  i nodded my head to show that i ap-


the popular magazine

predated the fine distinction and kelly
resumed

   of course i dont profess to know
 what may or may not be legally termed
 spoils of war-where commandeer-
 mg stops and theft begins person-
 ally i believe a nation that conquers
 another has a right to grab everything
 in sight but theres been lots of new
 turns to the laws since the war began
 and the u s government in its strug-
 gle to keep neutral has tacitly agreed
 to corral the jewels and let the courts
 say who is the owner

   but why dont the idiots turn the
crown jewels over to the allies for
safe-keeping

   i guess thats been planned but you

 know theres many a slip- and with

 europe teeming with secret agents
 theres no telling what may become
 of his majestys knickknacks with
 some of the other boys ive been fuss-
 ing around on this for quite a little
 while weve been ably assisted by
 scotland yard by the surete bureau
 and by various military-intelligence bu-
 reaus but owing to war conditions in
 the balkans nobody really knows
 where the jewels are i look for them
 ultimately to turn up at rhohans or
 at iome place where he can dispose
 of them and im strengthened in this
 belief by the fact that arabia marston
 has been at rhohans for several weeks
 arabia by reason of her past successes
 in matters concerning the transporta-
 tion of jewelry is just the person theyd
 pick up to engineer the deal over here
 you know this bunch has used her be-
 fore in fact when you first met her
 smith she was working for baron
 honsloff who in turn was working
 for--

   but she double-crossed the baron
 kelly i objected she threw him
 down when she found that we were too
 near her trail

   true smith but the baron didnt
 know it all he ever knew about the
 deal was that arabia saved him from
 arrest and gave him a chance to get
 safely out of the country when his mis-
 sion failed he has no reason to dis-
 trust her and he is still active in the

secret councils of his government
hence i claim that i am justified in
connection with all the information to
which i have had access in believing
that arabia is engineering this crown-
jewels deal now you can see what i
want smith and what it is necessary
for you to do at rhohans watch
arabia and see with whom she talks
and try and find out if any of the peo-
ple who see her at rhohans would be
the sort to be interested in the propo-
sition ive outlined

  before kelly left me i had accepted
his commission but i didnt hold out
any great hopes that id be able to
accomplish much he said he was will-
ing to have me do the best i could left
a small fortune with me for expenses
and gave me a telephone number at
which i could communicate with him
directly or at least leave word for him
when i tumbled into bed i went almost
at once to sleep and though i had
jumbled dreams about arabia and our
former adventures i felt refreshed
when i woke the next morning and
went down to the hotel dining room for
breakfast as i ate i glanced over the
morning paper and saw in the war
news that the advance of the central
armies was carrying them across the
border of the little kingdom whose
crown jewels were just then of so much
interest to the other nations of the
world

  it was about nine oclock or a little
after that i had the stalwart brought
around from the garage and took the
road into the hills toward rhohans
it was a beautiful peaceful southern
morning and i was congratulating my-
self on the contentment i was actually
absorbing from the surrounding air and
country when the sound of a smothered
explosion on the road ahead of me
brought me back sharply from my day-
dreaming automatically i stepped on
the accelerator of the stalwart and as
the car shot around a curve in the
roadway i beheld just ahead of me the
blazing wreck of an automobile
crawling across the road from it and
apparently barely escaping the shooting
flames was a woman
ovals are unlucky



  i jammed on my brakes and leap-
ing from the car rushed to her assist-
ance only to recognize her as arabia
marston she scrambled to her feet
and tottered toward me

  oh im so glad somebody came
she said and then recognizing me she
added with a laugh for the second
time you are my preserver smith
how shall i reward you

  what happened i asked looking
at the blazing wreck which by now was
burning too fiercely to leave any hope
of saving the machine

  i dont know arabia answered
with a sort of a frightened sob you
never can tell about these foreign cars
i just opened her up a bit to see if
she wouldnt run better-the valves had
been balking all morning and she
went up with a bang must have back-
fired i guess i was thrown out and
i was just crawling away when you
came

  i heard the explosion i said and
together we stood and watched the
flames leap and play over the wrecked
roadster devouring the upholstery and
woodwork and leaving but a twisted
mass of metal for the frames the
tires exploded with four loud reports
and the smell of burning rubber added
to the unpleasant odors that were al-
ready defiling the sweet morning air

  i was going in to washington on
an errand said arabia finally but
now i guess ill have to throw myself
on your mercy smith and ask you to
take me back to rhohans where i can
get another car you wont mind doing
that 

  ill do better than that arabia ill
take you in to washington i was just
on my way out to hunt you up you
know you urged me to come otit again
before i continued my tour in the stal-
wart ive got nothing to do for the
day let me be your chauffeur and take
you for a ride in a real car

  arabia gave me one of her most be-
witching smiles and her dull brown
eyes glowed with golden lights that iad
turned my head in the past

  youre a dear smith she said
youll really save me a lot of time

  and brushing the dust from her cloak
and skirt she climbed into the seat be-
side me in the stalwart which i at once
turned about and headed for washing-
ton as we sped away we left the blaz-
ing car behind us for the next passing
automobile party to marvel at and to
make a mystery for the afternoon news-
papers the accident and possible
narrow escape from death or serious
injury seemed to have affected arabia
but little for she was soon chatting in
her usual gay manner making no fur-
ther allusions to her mishap in the
course of time she asked me if id seen
kelly and if hed told me what he was
working on

  i saw him last night i answered
he came to the hotel and we had
quite a talk but you know he wouldnt
be apt to tell me what case he was on
unless he wanted my help

  youre a poor liar smith an-
swered arabia with her gurgling laugh
what youve just said means that
youre trying to hide from me the fact
that kelly told you he was watching
me again and that hes put you on
the trail too with orders to hunt me
up this morning and stick to me as long
as id let you i suppose he told you
all about the crown jewels and how
hes had a gang of s s men watching
rhohans to see that the precious bau-
bles arent smuggled in hidden in cab-
bages and squashes

  accustomed as i was to arabias di-
rectness of attack her words so sur-
prised me that for a moment i forgot
the speed at which the stalwart was
rushing along and we would have gone
into the ditch had not arabia jerked
the wheel sharply and kept us in the
road

  come smith get over it she said
when i accepted you as a chauffeur
i at least thought youd be careful of
my life one escape from a wreck to-
day is enough for me

  i pulled myself together recovering
my driving nerve and my wits by a
considerable effort

  you did surprise me but ill try to
bear up under future shocks i said

  i tell you what well do smith


the <POV>ular magazine

said arabia apparently in all serious-
ness lets be perfectly frank then
well get along better you think you
know what im doing and i know what
youre trying to do so lets make it
easier for both of us by acting sensible
and not like a dime-novel sleuth and
adventuress you can tell kelly all
about it when you see him again and
in the meantime lets be friends and
pals now ill tell you about those
jewels theyre what im going to
washington about this morning cer-
tain people have already got hold of
them and they are on their way here
you know by that what i mean so
theres no use naming names i dont
know when theyll arrive but it will
be soon im going to find that out
this morning-when theyll reach this
country and where theyll be put ashore
then im going to arrange to have
them shipped here and im going to
plaster them all over with insurance
when they get here you can see them
and you can bring kelly along too to
the show if you like the jewels are
nothing to me im just doing this er-
rand for mr rhohan whos been a
good friend to me if he is getting
in bad by monkeying with the stuff
thats his lookout not mine

  arabias statement seemed frank
enough and it jibed fairly well with
what kelly had told me so i could
do nothing but accept it at its face
value yet i could not help marveling
at it and feeling that there was a trick
being planned somewhere then i re-
called what kelly had said about ara-
bias patriotism in spite of her former
adventures and i decided that she was
giving me proof of it

  im glad to hear you say that youve
got nothing to do with the jewels i
said for i dont think the deal is as
simple as it looks to you

  arabia shrugged her shoulders
that will be for kelly to fuss over
she replied you can go with me
wherever i stop in washington and
then youll be convinced that im tell-
ing you the truth

  she dismissed the subject with that
and i learned nothing further about the

jewels until at arabias direction i
drove to the patent qffice near which
we parked the stalwart while she led
the way to a dingy office in an old-
fashioned building across the street
the door we entered bore the legend
abner dooberry counselor and
opened into a suite of two rooms the
first a dirty and poorly lighted recep-
tion chamber furnished only with three
decrepit chairs and a bookcase filled
with law tomes beyond this was a
smaller room in which seated at a
desk was a wizened old man with a
fringe of white hair bordering the bald
dome of his head and hanging down
over a collar that sadly needed launder-
ing his clothes were several seasons
out of style and were shiny with wear
he looked up at our entrance but did
not rise

  mr dooberry asked arabia

  he nodded and motioned to an old-
fashioned horsehair sofa upon which
arabia and i both found eats

  i am arabia marston mr doo-
berry she said and this is my friend
mr smith of denver my car broke
down on the road-in fact it burned
up-and mr smith was kind enough
to bring me in to town in his machine
im from mr rhohan mr dooberry
he asked me to call and find out if
youd had any word yet regarding an
express shipment from denmark that
was consigned to you and him to-
gether

  the little old man nodded his head
again and searched through the untidy
pile of papers on his desk presently
he found a yellow telegram blank
which he passed to axabia

  came this morning he said in a
cracked cackling voice

  arabia held the message so that i
could read it also it ran as follows

abner dooberry washington d c

  twelve packing cases consigned you
and maximillian rhoahn shipped eighteenth
instant on steamship olaf hcglund due fall
river massachusetts twenty-ninth total
weight nineteen hundred fifty insurance
prepaid lloyds to port of debarkation
please make arrangements bonding to wash-
ington to avoid customhouse delay

tudor osea ex new york
ovals acre unlucky

ioj

  thank you very much mr doo-
berry said arabia folding the tele-
gram and putting it in her purse if
youll let me keep this a little while
it will be easier for me to attend to
the bonding mr rhohan asked me to
do that ill call at the local office of
the oversea express company and
have things fixed up perhaps youd
better call up mr rhohan and get his
sanction you can describe me to him

  mr dooberry smiled and shook his
head it is unnecessary he said
you look honest and besides nobody
but mr rhohan knows about this ship-
ment so you must be from him if i
am not here when you get back you
can slip the telegram under my door
good morning

  when we were in the stalwart again
arabia passed me the telegram youd
better copy this smith she said
kelly will be interested in it and
dont forget to copy those funny sigrs
and hieroglyphics at the top they tell
where it was sent from and all that sort
of stuff

  thank you for your thoughtfulness
arabia i answered i had the mes-
sage pretty well memorized already but
perhaps it would be better to cppy it
and pulling out a notebook i diligently
transcribed everything that was on the
yellow sheet while arabia sat beside
me and laughed when i handed her
the message again she asked me to
drive to the most modern of wash-
ingtons business structures where the
oversea express company had its
offices there as at dooberrys she
took me with her and after a little
parleying in the outer office we were
ushered into the private room of the
manager an office in marked contrast
to the dirty cubby-hole we had just left
and seated in a magnificently sumptu-
ous leather armchair i listened to the
amazing business which arabia trans-
acted with mr jellison the washington
representative of the big shipping con-
cern

  mr jellison said she i am ara-
bia marston a friend of mr rhohans
and of mr dooberry they have asked
me to see you about a shipment your

company is handling for them here is
a telegram concerning it from your mr
tudor in new york which will ex-
plain the matter i want to have you
make arrangements to bond the ship-
ment to washington and i also want
to have it insured for twelve million
dollars it is almost entirely jewelry
and plate

  the washington manager of the ex-
press firm must have been accustomed
to receiving unusual requests in con-
nection with his business but the ex-
pression on his face as he took the tele-
gram from arabia showed plainly that
he was in the midst of one of his most
surprising and novel adventures he
controlled himself by a visible effort
and made no comment as he read the
telegram then he placed it before him
on his desk and reaching for the tele-
phone demanded to be put into com-
munication with the new york offices
immediately the rapidity with which
he got his connection showed that the
telephone service is sometimes-as ad-
vertised-instantaneous

  hello oversea new york this
is jellison washington give me mr
tudor please    hello tudor
   this is jellison you got a ship-
ment coming on the olaf heglund to
fall river consigned dooberry and
rhohan here nineteen hundred and
fifty pounds due about the end of the
month    well what about it
theres a party here wants to have it
bonded and insured for twelve million
  yes twelve    oh-oh is that
it yes i remember now yes all
right thank you good-by

  as he turned from the telephone and
faced arabia again his expression was
entirely different in fact it was def-
erential

  yes yes miss marston he said
pardon me for not recognizing the
matter at first but to tell you the truth
it had slipped my mind i have been
informed about this-only i wasnt ex-
pecting the shipment so soon you
know this war has shot our business
all to-er-i mean it has complicated
things tremendously and its been all
i could do to keep each days affairs


the pcpjljcr magazine

straightened out let alone figuring on
the future now lets see you say you
want us to attend to bonding this ship-
ment to washington and you want it

insured also--

  for twelve million dollars mr jel-
lison said arabia calmly that is
slightly more than the intrinsic value
of the shipment but as the contents
could not be replaced if lost mr rho-
han feels that such a sum is justified
and will gladly pay the premiums the
insurance is to cover the shipment from
the moment itleaves the boat until it
reaches mr rhohans place on the vir-
ginia road you can arrange it for
me cant you

  that is a very large sum to place
just now miss marston but still as
it is all domestic perhaps i can ar-
range it if i split it up between two
or three companies that will be all
right i suppose

  arabia nodded her head and get
action mr jellison she added mr
rhohan desires that all these matters
be arranged before the arrival of the
shipment if you will call him up when
you have the papers prepared and all
that sort of thing he will come in and
sign the bonds and pay the premiums
it shall have my personal attention
said the manager and favoring him
with one of her rarest smiles arabia
led the way down to the stalwart again

  lets go out to rhohans for lunch
she said you can say that you picked
me up after my accident but i
wouldnt teil rhohan if i were you
that i let you know all about his busi-
ness affairs and of course you wont
tell him about kellys interest in him
i willingly agreed with arabia as to
the wisdom of not confiding too much
in rhohan and we were well on the
way out from washington before i
happened to think that we had not re-
turned dooberrys telegram i men-
tioned this to arabia

  oh bother she said petulantly
well i guess he wont die if he doesnt
get it till to-morrow ill mail it to
him or no better yet you take it in to
him to-night smith here it is and
she passed the yellow blank over to me

  it was early in the evening when i
returned to my hotel in washington
after having spent the afternoon with
arabia at rhohans where i had been
introduced to the proprietor of the re-
sort and a number of his guests i
telephoned kelly at once and asked him
to come over and join me at dinner
and shortly afterward over soup and
olives i was recounting to him my ad-
ventures of the day and as evidence
of my accomplishments i passed him
the telegram dooberry had given ara-
bia and which i was supposed to re-
turn

  you had a fine time didnt you
smith  laughed my friend but cheer
up the telegram is something and the
order to jellison to bond and insure
the stuff is something more well
look into those things after dinner
aside from that though smith youve
been beautifully bunked

  bunked what do you mean  i
demanded flushing in spite of myself

  youve been framed just to what
extent i dont know but arabia evi-
dently wanted you with her to-day
smith all that stuff about her car
exploding and burning up was pure
moonshine and so was your rescue

  but i heard the explosion and i
saw the machine burn----

  kelly laughed dryly so did two of
the boys smith they have been shad-
owing arabia ever since i found out
she was at rhohans this morning
before nine oclock she and rhohan
left out there together in her car the
one she raced you with yesterday be-
hind it they were towing a faked-up
machine that looked pretty much like
it they had a flunky steering it
when they got to the turn in the road
they put the make-believe car at one
side of the highway and then rhohan
and the flunky went down a side road
in the real car from where they were
they could see the main route from
washington arabia waited beside the
faked machine until the signaled you
were coming she was evidently ex-
pecting id send you out just as she
told you when she got their signal
she lighted a fuse under the machine
ovals are unlucky



they had fixed up and the thing went
off the boys were in a clump of brush
beside the road a little way back and
they saw it all just as your machine
came round the corner they saw arabia
throw herself in the dust and start to
crawl away and they heard her tell
you that for the second time youd been
her preserver when you and she drove
off toward the city rhohan and his
flunky came out from the side road
heaved the burned machine into the
dileh and then went home now the
thing for us to do is to find out why
all this elaborate plant was made for
your benefit and what there is to this
stuff about a shipment on a danish ves-
sel as for me i dont get it at all

  i was silent through the rest of the
meal not because i was enjoying my
dinner too much to talk but because i
was so humiliated to think how arabia
had made a fool out of me again i
really should have known better than
to think that mass of twisted metal and
burning stuff in the road was her high-
powered car-by the frame by the en-
gine by half a dozen things but to
tell the truth i was so tickled at the
time at having reached arabia just
when she was in distress that doubt
never entered my head as it was i
had been glad way down in my heart
that she hadnt been hurt in her acci-
dent and now kelly was laughing at me
and telling me that two other govern-
ment operatives had witnessed my fool-
ishness how arabia must have
laughed to herself at me throughout
the entire day we had been together
by the time we finished dinner my self-
pity and chagrin had turned to anger
and i was anxious to get out with kelly
and commence work on the riddle that
had been so carefully arranged for us
kelly appreciated my mental condition
for he was good enough to say i might
go with him and to slap me on the
back as we left the dining room
cheer up old man he said well
be revenged yet and he laughed boy-
ishly

  a taxicab took us to the residence of
manager jellison of the oversea ex-
press company the butler who opened

the door saitl that mr jellison was at
dinner with some friends and doubted
if he would see us

  you tell him mike kelly wants his
ear for a moment said my friend and
the butler had hardly left us to de-
liver the message when jellison came
out into the hall and ushered us into
a small reception room he looked at
me with some surprise evidently rer
calling my face from the mornings
visit with arabia kelly he greeted
warmly

  sorry to disturb you jellison said
my friend but smith here tells me
he sat in with you to-day when a miss
marston asked you to do certain rather
unusual things for rhohan and doo-
berry heres the telegram concerning
the matter from your man tudor in
new york now whats all this about
-your uncle sam wants to know

  jellison favored me with a smile
evidently he thought from kellys
words that i was a full-fledged gov-
ernment man and that id put over
something pretty clever by getting my-
self into arabias company

  all i know about it kelly is this
he said about a month ago i got a
letter from the london office of the
company telling me that some jewels
of surpassing value were coming across
pretty soon and that we were to handle
the shipment as if our salvation de-
pended upon it later i got a message
from the president of the company tell-
ing me that the shipment would soon
be on its way and that it would pass
through my territory and urging me to
do whatever i could for the consignees
i was given to understand that it was
diplomatic business in a way and that
it had to be handled with gloves that
was all i heard about it until to-day
when this marston woman came in with
this telegram i called up tudor and
he said everything was o k since
miss marston left me ive been break-
ing my neck to place the insurance for
her in fact ive got a couple of cas-
ualty men in at dinner now but some
way they dont seem to be crazy to take
the business however i think i shall


the vovular magazine

be able to fix it up all right nothing
wrong is there

  as far as you know then there
really is a valuable shipment on the
heglund asked kelly ignoring the
others question

  im sure of it mike after miss
marston and your man went out i
called up tudor again and he told me
hed been advised of the shipment in a
letter he got a day or two ago from our
agents in denmark the stuff was
turned over to the oversea company
from hamburg and was shipped on the
heglund because she wasnt a boat that
would ordinarily attract attention shes
under charter to our shipping division
and its understood shes going to fall
river to load refugee materials for
europe-clothes shoes and so forth
for the belgians whats your interest
in the stuff kelly 

  cant tell you jellison im just
inquisitive i guess much obliged to
you for seeing me so quickly now run
on back to your dinner and forget it
only you might make a note to let me
know when the heglund gets to fall
river some of the boys would like
to look her over and they might miss
her

  jellison laughed swell chance of
your bunch missing a ship that size
he said

  when we were back in the taxi again
kelly told the bandit on the front seat
to drive to the patent office and there
we dismissed the cab

  lets turn burglars and take a look
at this fellow dooberrys place said
kelly and following his suggestion i
led him to the old-fashioned building
across the street where the wizened
counselor had his offices kelly looked
the place over and drawing a bunch
of keys from his pocket approached
the door placing his hand on the
knob he gave it a test twist and sud-
denly put his other hand to his lips
signaling me caution then he care-
fully released the knob put the keys
back in his pocket and drew me close
to him

  go get a cop he said speaking
scarcely above a whisper and when

you bring him back tell him to walk
as if he was traveling on eggs

  thrilled by my friends manner i
tiptoed away around the corner and
half a block away i found a patrol-
man and cautioning him to make no
noise bade him follow me he evi-
dently took me for a stray maniac but
he was willing to humor me and he
followed me quietly enough back to
the doorway where he showed an in-
creasing interest in the proceedings on
seeing that i had a companion

  kelly buttonholed him and speaking
softly said

  im a treasury detective officer
whats-your name

  jamieson sir

  well jamieson ive got a job for
you you stand in front of this door
and dont let anybody come out till i
return remember dont let anybody
leave the building-not even the pres-
ident should he come downstairs get
me 

  yes sir answered the patrolman
touching his helmet in salute as kelly
flipped back the lapel of his coat for
a moment showing some sort of a
badge

  my friend then cautiously and noise-
lessly opened the door before which
we were standing and motioned to me
to follow him once within the vesti-
bule he shut the door again as care-
fully as he had opened it and motioned
to me to take off my shoes at the
same time he removed his own foot-
wear carefully took off his coat and
placed it beside our shoes and reach-
ing into one of his pockets slipped me
an automatic revolver which gleamed
dully blue in the light that filtered in
through the dusty panes from the street
lamps

  you lead the way to dooberrys
office he said

  wondering what kelly had suspected
because the outside door of the build-
ing was unlocked i crept silently up
the stairs to the narrow corridor on
the second floor and like a thief with
the automatic before me piloted my
friend to the door that bore dooberrys
name there was no light save a half
pjls are unlucky



gloom from the dirty windows at the
end of the hall and the place seemed
to be deserted

  kelly shoved past me and bent be-
fore the door with his ear against the
panels a warning touch from his hand
told me that he had heard something
within and i leaned forward and
strained my ears very faintly i made
out the rumble of voices but i could
distinguish no words a moment later
i felt rather than heard or saw that
one of kellys hands was caressing the
doorknob that it had gripped it softly
that the door was slowly noiselessly
but steadily opening little by little
then the sound of voices was plainer
and i could occasionally catch a word
spoken in english but with a foreign
accent

  when the door was opened perhaps
a third of the way kelly nudged me
and crept like a ghost into the little
reception room outside of dooberrys
private office i followed him well
across this room and then we both
stood up close to the door that led to
the chamber from which the voices
were coming a faint fringe of light
around the doorcasing showed that the
next room was illuminated and i had
barely time to notice this when kelly
threw the inner door open flashed on
an electric torch and shoving his own
automatic into the glare called sternly

  dont make a move

  sitting beside dooberrys desk on
which was a shaded student lamp
turned down so low that it smelled
vilely were two men-dooberry and a
tall gaunt bearded stranger who wore
a long cloak of european design and
cut both glanced as if fascinated at
the glare of the electric torch and at
the menacing automatic in kellys hand

  step in behind me smith and turn
up that lamp said my friend

  at the mention of my name i noted
a flicker of surprise in the squinting
eyes of the wizened dooberry the
next moment i had flooded the room
with the subdued green-tinged light
from the student lamp the tall
bearded man who had been watching
me turned his eyes toward the door-

way and a smile broke out over his
features

  ach meester kelly he said did
you tink itt wass a couple of burglars
you had found no i did not know
such mundane affairs interested you
kelly kicked the door of the inner
office shut behind him but otherwise
made no movement

  many things interest me colonel
he said pray do not attempt to move
for a few minutes im nervous to-
night smith reach under the colonels
arms and see if hes wearing a shoulder
holster

  as i stepped forward to obey the
man kelly had addressed as colonel
frowned slightly

  this is too much meester kelly
he said you haf no right you know

i am a member of-

  in this case colonel might gives
right i have the advantage over you
and im just mean enough to use it
go ahead smith get his artillery
reaching under the mans arms i
found a holster containing a lugar pis-
tol this i transferred to my coat
pocket then i slid my hand down
his side and found a small automatic
of american design in a leather pocket
at his belt this i also confiscated

  frisk the other one too smith
said kelly i did but the frail form
of mr dooberry was innocent of shoot-
ing irons

  now smith continued kelly you
take my place here at the door and
keep these gentlemen covered if either
of them makes any move that your
nervous mind construes as being im-
proper or dangerous shoot-and ask
questions afterward

  kelly and i changed places and my
friend then took up the business he had
in view

  dump out your pockets colonel
he said i want to take a look at what
youve got

  a flush of rage spread over the
bearded mans features and he raised
his voice in protest

  dis you dare not do he exclaimed
the embassy to your chief shall com-


the popular magazine

plain of dis you forget that i am
immune from arrest or search

  do as i tell you colonel said
kelly dump your papers out or ill
just naturally tear the clothes off your
back you can complain to the chief
about it afterward come on jump
out your stuff or ill help you

 the colonels manner suddenly
changed and with a shrug of his shoul-
ders he forced a smile reaching into
first one pocket and then another he
placed a mass of papers a wallet two
bunches of keys a penknife and some
coins on the table

  dere mein friendt i yield to you
he said

  kelly pawed over the papers on the
desk glanced into the wallet counted
the coins and then with a lightning-
like move pounced upon the seated
colonel jerked him backward from his
chair and slammed him roughly against
the wall where he held him with one
hand at his throat while the other hand
slid here and there like a snake about
the pinioned mans clothes i had seen
exhibitions of kellys strength and
quickness before but i was as surprised
as the colonel at the onrush that
kelly had good cause for his actions
became presently apparent for he drew
from some secret and concealed pocket
in the colonels clothes a long narrow
thin wallet which he tossed on doo-
berrys desk then he released the
wizened counselors evening caller

  you can pick up your stuff and go
now colonel he said turning and
selecting a legal-size envelope from
dooberrys stock

  the tall bearded man rubbed his
throat stretched his neck a couple of
times and took a long breath

  mein gott meester kelly he said
you near killedt me

  im liable to do the whole job some
day colonel responded my friend
writing an address on the envelope he
had taken now you and dooberry
get out smith and i will follow you
in a second let em out smith and
shut the door after them

  dooberry hastened out at once but
the colonel stopped to gather up his

papers while he was doing this kelly
slipped the long thin wallet into the
addressed envelope and sealed it
when the colonel had departed he
gave this envelope to me

  well go down now smith he said
therell be a fuss at the door when
the cop refuses to let them out never
mind that you run right out on the
corner theres a letter box you drop
that envelope in it and be sure it goes
down into the box below the receiving
tray then come back and put your
shoes on but make that mail box
if its the last thing you do in this
world

  kelly was right about there being a
fuss at the door the colonel was hav-
ing a heated argument with patrolman
jamieson and i caught the words mil-
itary attache of the embassy as we
went down the stairs

  i dont care if youre the ambassa-
dor himself replied jamieson i
have my orders and you dont leave
this buildiug till im ready get back
in the doorway there or ill bust you
one 

  the washington police are to be
relied upon colonel said kelly a
we reached the bottom of the stairs
dont blame the patrolman i asked
him to hold the fort here just as
soon as smith here has skipped over
to the corner in his stocking feet you
can go colonel jamieson let this man
out

  kelly pushed me out onto the pav-
ing and then turned back to pacify
the colonel while i ran to the corner
shoved the envelope kelly had given
me into the slot snapped the tray back
and forth two or three times to be sure
it was clear and then returned to the
door of the building where we had
found our adventure

  all right jamieson said kelly as
i approached you can let these gen-
tlemen go now much obliged to you
for your good work you wont lose
anything by it and if this bearded
man here tries to make any trouble for
you just tell your captain to call on
mike kelly at the treasury department
good night colonel ill send your ar-
ovals atre unlucky



tillery to you at the embassy in the
morning

  with a hearty teutonic oath the
colonel took dooberrys arm and hur-
ried away patrolman jamieson
thoughtfully held his flash light while
we put on and laced up our shoes
and then bade us a cheerful good night
as lie left us stuffing three of kellys
best cigars in his helmet

  wasnt it a bit risky to mail that
thing i asked kelly as we turned
toward my hotel i dont know what
it is but you evidently thought it was
valuable

  not a bit of risk in the world
smith answered my friend it is
true that you can break a mail box
open with a medium-sized ax but that
sort of thing isnt done even our
friend the colonel wouldnt think of
doing it and once in the hands of the
collector that envelope is as safe as
if it was in the treasury vaults uncle
sams postmen smith are the most
trustworthy and faithful men in the
world that envelope will be in the
state department twenty minutes after
it is collected and then well see if
there is anything of real value in it
i rather fancy that there is because
it is the one thing the colonel didnt
throw on the table anyway its safer
where it is now than if you or i had
it and were safer too

  the next morning kelly was at my
hotel when i went down to breakfast
and he sat with me in the dining room

  theyve got those jewels he said
found that much out from the papers
in the colonels wallet seems some
special agent promised to smuggle
them away to the allies for safe-keep-
ing and then turned them over to the
central powers its the old story of
the double cross maybe the jewels
are coming over here on the heglund
as arabia told you but somehow i
doubt it you stick around with her
anyway for a while and well see what
ave can find out

  for the next three weeks i spent
much of my time at rhohans or driv-

ing about the country near washing-
ton with arabia in the stalwart and
as a matter of course practically every
one of the more wealthy patrons of
rhohans peculiar resort came to ad-
mire my car and asked me to place
orders for them when the new model
should be put upon the market i wired
the kovens of the hit their machine
was making and they answered with
congratulations and with permission for
me to remain in the capital as long as
i found orders plentiful my com-
missions from this later amounted to
several thousand dollars so you can
see i really was not wasting time

  as for arabia though she must have
known of the encounter kelly and i 
had with the colonel there was never
a suggestion in her conversation with
me during our long hours of compan-
ionship that she regarded me other-
wise than as a friend she was a most
charming person to while away the
time with and i fancied as the days
rolled by that i was really getting to
know her thoroughly however now
that i look back at things i dont be-
lieve anybody knows arabia marston
thoroughly-unless it be my friend
kelly

  one morning toward the end of the
month arabia met me with her eyes
sparkling with enthusiasm and even
before she spoke i knew that a new
chapter in the adventure of the jewels
was about to open

  can you get hold of kelly right
away she asked me as i alighted
from the stalwart in front of rho-
hans

  i can get him from washington
i replied

  meaning that you could telephone
him from here only you dont want
us to find out the private number he
gave you she replied with a laugh
well hop into the car then and drive
me to town i want to see kelly right
away i have news for him

  in less than two hours we were in
the capital and i left arabia in the
car while i entered a drug store and
called up kelly from the public booth
i told him arabia wanted to see him


the popuur magazine

and he said hed been expecting some-
thing like that

  the heglund docked at fall river
yesterday morning he added and the
shipment is now en route here in bond
it ought to arrive this morning ill
meet you at noon at the b  o depot
promptly on the hour arabia and i
rolled up in the stalwart and found
kelly waiting for us in a big touring
car that bore the governments shield
on its radiator

  hello he called out i suppose
arabia you want to take me down to
see that express shipment that youre
so interested in its in the yards ive
brought along the big car so we could
all travel together better leave your
prize roadster here smith and pile
into my machine

  arabia was laughing and as she
shook hands with kelly i saw him
blush

  youre always so thoughtful of me
kelly she bantered of course well
climb into your car smiths machine
is a lovely little thing for two but it
wont do for a crowd at all

  once transferred to kellys car
which was driven by a neatly uni-
formed chauffeur we gossiped and
joked in the tonneau while the big ma-
chine made its way swiftly through the
city to the freight yards there i was
surprised to see rhohan waiting in one
of the machines from his resort while
standing about an express car on one
of the sidings were a number of cus-
toms inspectors and several quietly
dressed men who i presumed were
aids of kellys rhohan waved a greet-
ing to us and acknowledged arabias
introduction of kelly as one of my
dearest friends and most persistent en-
emies

  kelly laughed at this characteriza-
tion of himself and turning to rhohan
said well mr rhohan what is
your pleasure do you want this stuff
taken to the government warehouses
for examination or shall we proceed
with the formalities here

  if it can be done here it will save
a good deal of cartage answered rho-
han but i am at a loss to under-

stand mr kelly why the government
should take such an interest in this lit-
tle shipment i have already made a
declaration as to its contents under
oath

  just a customhouse formality mr
rhohan replied my friend the
government doesnt doubt your word
but-all jewelry has to be formally ap-
praised so the duty can be definitely
fixed lets get a look at it

  at a nod from kelly several of the
customs inspectors mounted the plat-
form of the car and entered its narrow
door and we all followed within two
guards heavily armed rose from a
bench and stepped to one side they
wore caps bearing the name of the
oversea express company and seemed
glad that their vigil was near its end
in the middle of the car was a row
of twelve packing cases each heavily
banded with metal hoops and con-
structed of substantial timber they
bore the marks of considerable wear
and travel and were chalked on all
sides with numbers and shipping direc-
tions and signs

  lets start with the first one said
the customs inspector in charge and
two of his assistants stepped forward
carrying nail pullers and attacked the
foremost box as one of them started
prying at the stiff metal band that
bound the heavy boards together the
packing case slid across the car floor
and the inspector fell sprawling on his
stomach

  youre a strong man said rhohan
laughing

  not so strong as you think replied
the inspector rising and brushing the
dirt from his uniform that box was
a lot lighter than i expected

  it ought to weigh at least a hundred
and fifty but i suppose youre used to
little things like that offered rhohan

  the customs inspector looked at him
oddly for a moment and then reached
out one hand and gripping a corner
of the packing case dragged it back
to the center of the car if it weighs
over thirty pounds ill eat it he said
and again began working with the nail
puller
pls are unlucky



  rhohan as if doubting the man
stepped forward and took hold of the
ease lifting it easily

  thats queer he said with a puz-
zled expression on his face thats
very queer

  then he stepped down the car to the
next box and kicked it it toppled over
on its side with a hollow noise

 good lord somethings wrong
here he cried and in a frenzy he
rushed down along the line of packing
cases throwing his weight against each
one and in turn sending each skidding
across the floor and against the side
of the car

  open them quick he shouted
get an ax break them open-never
mind how the man was as pale as
a ghost and looked excitedly from one
face to another in the small group that
filled the car

  the two express guards also i no-
ticed seemed much disturbed they
hefted the boxes and looked blankly
at each other kelly the first to get
into action reached up to the cars
emergency kit and tearing the heavy
fire ax from its cleats attacked the
boxes one after another he knocked
in the top of each with but slight effort
and every box was empty save for a
mass of excelsior packing and many
crumpled german and austrian news-
papers

  i turned to see what arabia was do-
ing she was standing apparently un-
concerned at one side of the car watch-
ing the proceedings the minute she
noted that my eyes were upon her
however she jumped forward and
peered into one of the battered pack-
ing cases

  why its empty  she exclaimed
with well-simulated surprise

  rhohan in the meantime had be-
come as a man possessed he ran
back and forth the length of the car
his hands gripping his temples

 robbed robbed he shouted
ive been tricked oh this is unbe-
lievable 

  kelly swung sharply to the two ex-
press guards how about this he
demanded

  they were as heavy as lead when
they were put into the car that ill
swear to one of the men answered

  and have you been with them all
the time kelly snapped

  yes sir all the time that is except
on the transfer barge at new york
there was nobody outside on the boat
-couldnt possibly have been sir-but
the crew and the trainmen we stepped
out then to get a breath of air you
see sir the car came through on the
express and mail train-no passengers
sir and we figured it was all right
when we got back there was no sign
that anything had been disturbed sir

  kelly looked at the men sharply and
then turned away and upended one
of the broken packing cases turning
it about so that the bottom was in full
view he examined it closely the
metal straps that seemed to go entirely
around the cases did not cross the bot-
tom boards instead they ended about
four inches from the edge this left
unprotected a board about five inches
wide in the middle of the lower side
of the box gripping one end of this
board with his fingers kelly pulled
the board came away from its place
easily only two small nails holding each
end

  my friend looked at the customs in-
spector in charge of the little force and
nodded his head then he turned to
arabia get your excited friend there
and lets go and have lunch he said

  rhohan overheard him and raved
lunch who wants lunch he
shouted i have been robbed-robbed
of-

  youre insured arent you asked
kelly calmly come on and get a
bite to eat with us then you can think
more calmly in the meantime you can
trust the express company and the in-
surance and casualty men to make
every effort to locate your property

  but i could not eat protested rho-
han who by this time was trembling
all over like a man with the ague

  arabia took him by the arm and led
him to the door of the car and kelly
and i followed outside the quietly
dressed men who were standing around
the popular magazine

looked at us curiously but none of
them followed as we made our way
to kellys car and climbed into the ton-
neau at a word the driver threw in
the gears and we sped away back to
the city rhohan sat like one in a
trance muttering to himself and look-
ing from one to the other of our faces
arabia with an inscrutable smile on
her lips watched kelly steadily but if
he knew this he gave no sign

  in half an hour our car drew up be-
fore the entrance of a restaurant lo-
cated just off one of the circles and
kelly led the way within while we
were checking our wraps i noticed he
was holding a whispered conversation
with the head waiter and a moment
later we were ushered to seats at a table
near a window at one side of the large
dining rootai

  ive taken the liberty of ordering
said kelly as he setled himself in his
chair rhohan nodded as if he didnt
care what happened  arabia smiled and
leisurely drew off her gloves on her
right hand flashed a magnificent ring
-two heart-shaped opals of unusual
size and fire bound together by a
band of twisted gold and platinum it
fairly dazzled my eyes as it reflected
the rays from the candle lamps at our
places and i thought how out of place
such a ring would be on any other
womns hand but arabias dash and
daring beauty enabled her to carry it
off kelly appeared not to have noticed
it and at once began a bantering line
of small talk in an effort to remove the
strain under which we were all of us
more or less laboring

  luncheon had progressed to dessert
and we were enjoying a delicious pine-
apple ice before kelly alluded to the
matter that was foremost in our minds

  feel better rhohan he asked

  the foreigner sighed yes friend
kelly the man is better but the mind
-ah that is different just think-
how could they have been stolen 

  very easily replied kelly very
easily granting in advance that the thief
knew about those bottom boards a
strong man or two strong men could
have upended those packing cases taken

off the boards removed the heavy stuff
inside and put the boards back again
in not more than fifteen minutes and
the two express guards were probably
on the deck of the transfer barge at
least half an hour there was plenty
of time

  but even supposing they knew about
the boards how could they get the con-
tents away asked rhohan they

were on a boat-

  all they had to do was to throw it
overboard answered kelly to my sur-
prise they didnt even have to do
that they could have dumped it off
the end of the car between the tracks
and let it lie there till the train was
pulled off the barge then they could

have-

  but you talk as if the contents were
of no value protested rhohan his
voice rising why should the rob-
bers supposing they did as you say
throw such valuable loot away 

  they might have been paid to do
it somebody might have rather seen
the stuff at the bottom of the east
river than in your hands

  rhohan looked at kelly and seemed
about to make a reply but thought bet-
ter of it and just then my friend for
the first time appeared to notice the
blazing ring on arabias hand

  what a ring arabia  he exclaimed
let me see it

  she smilingly drew the gems from
her finger and passed the jewel across
the table to kelly he examined it at-
tentively and then handed it back to
her

  its a beautiful thing he said but
im surprised that you wear it dont
you know that opals are unlucky
arabia fondled the ring between her
fingers and laughed i didnt know
you were superstitious kelly do you
really think opals are unlucky

  he nodded his head some of them
my dear are very unlucky he an-
swered and those two you are wear-
ing are fairly dripping with misfortune
do you know their history  they
caused a queen to kill her husband once
and they have brought woe to a whole
ovals acre unlucky

iii

kingdom since that time they are

         j f

  kelly stopped abruptly and reached
across the table with a lunge but he
was not quick enough arabias eyes
had grown big and glistening fiery as
he began speaking and with a catlike
movement she had reached out and
grasped a pair of heavy silver nut-
crackers from a cut-glass tray in the
center of the table she brought the
solid metal down with a resounding
blow upon the almost priceless ring
which she held against the table with
her left hand as kellys outreaching
hand gripped her wrist the two heart-
shaped opals flew in a scintillating
shower of iridescent sparks over the
white damask cloth and fell as gleam-
ing bits of dust over the dishes and
silverware

  if theyre as unlucky as that i dont
want tb have anything more to do with
them she said with a catchy laugh

  startled as i was by her actions my
emotion was no match for rhohans
he jumped up in his place and leaned
far over the table his snarling face
close to arabias you fool you
he almost shrieked those were
worth-

  arabia leaned back in her chair and
laughed-the unpleasant laugh that was
in her repertoire and that always re-
minded me of the rattle of the pebbles
on the shingle as the surfs undertow
dragged them out to sea

  ive got my fingers crossed any-
way she said and flashed a look at
kelly

  kelly pushed rhohan back into his
chair rather roughly that isnt your
loss he said sternly so dont beef
about it and the people who will
have to bear the loss will think its
cheap the jig is up rhohan now it
depends on you whether you get into
real trouble or not

  rhohan sank back into his chair and
looked from arabia to kelly

  what do you mean he asked in
a faint voice

  try to collect your insurance and
see answered kelly

  arabia was smiling happily and un-

concernedly rhohan had turned pale
and was breathing heavily to me it
was all a mystery and my face must
have shown this for arabia after a
glance at me turned to kelly

  rhohan and i understand kelly
she said but for heavens sake tell
poor smith here or hell go insane
and anyway i guess rhohan would
like to hear how you did it

  i didnt do it arabia it was mostly
luck said my friend it was luck
and smith it was smith who led me
to dooberrys office the night of the day
you took him there we happened to
find the colonel-you know the gentle-
man-there in secret conference with
mr dooberry i had a hunch and i
took a chance-stood him up and got
a wallet from his clothes over at the
state department they have a collection
of foreign ciphers and we were able
to read the latest news he had from
his stuff i learned what i was already
beginning to feel sure would happen
or had happened-that your people
rhohan had got hold of these crown
jewels and were shipping them over
here by submarine then i saw that
this scheme of having a shipment come
over by a mysterious neutral ship was
only a fake to throw the secret agents
off the scent and you took advantage
of it to plan for the collection of in-
surance if the submarine didnt arrive
however the submarine had gool luck
and arrived all right-put the jewrels
ashore on the florida coast from where
they were shipped up to rhohans in
orange and grapefruit boxes-with a
layer of fruit on the outside our
agents found that out since then
weve been lying low to see what youd
do with this other shipment the fake
one

  our men never left that shipment
for a moment after it got to fall river
on the olaf heglund the whole train
crew on the special that brought your
car down was composed of government
men the whole crew on the barge was
made up of our men and we wanted
to see what your frame was so we
gave you every chance we got the
express guards out of the cars on the


the popular magazine

barge and that gave rhohans men
their chance theyd been riding on
top and we knew it as soon as they
saw the coast was clear they dropped
down got into that car and ripped the
bottom of those boxes open and dumped
the scrap iron that was in them out
on the barge between the tracks weve
got the scrap iron and the two crooks
in jersey city right now we had
rhohan lined up from the start and
the only thing that connected you wtith
it arabia as far as evidence went
was that ring you were fool enough
to wear i wish-

  maybe you do interrupted arabia
but wishing is futile now kelly and
you know it i defy you to try to
prove in any court of law that this
twisted bit of gold and platinum was
ever in any way connected with the
crown jewels of the kingdom of--

  kelly broke in youre right ara-
bia as you said youve got your fin-
gers crossed and really im glad of
that but your friend here isnt so
lucky

  rhohan laughed unpleasantly very
clever mr kelly he said miss
marston was right when she told me
you were clever but you admit your-
self that i received the jewels

  you received them all right kelly
answered with his dry smile but
while you were play acting down here
to-day rhohan and framing what you
thought was the support of customs
men and government operatives for
your claim for twelve million dollars
worth of insurance the police and the
high sheriff along with some of our

boys raided your place on the virginia
pike it was raided on a warrant
charging you with conducting a gam-
bling house the government has the
jewels by this time and the state de-
partment will hold them in trust until
the case is adjudicated its up to the
courts to decide whether the jewels
are legitimate spoils of wrar or whether
they must be returned at the close of
the conflict to the kingdom to which
they originally belonged my advice to
you rhohan is to beat it while the
beating is good the raiding party may
be back any minute and start looking
for you personally id like to hold
you but a certain embassy has sug-
gested to the government that youre
hardly worth fussing with and as we
are theoretically friendly with the
power the embassy represents you will
be allowed to get a flying start

  rhohan turned a shade paler does
the-does the embassy know of the-
of the insurance matter he asked
throatily

  not yet answered kelly

  maximillian rhohan rose and bowed
formally i thank you mr kelly
and you will permit me to pay for this
little hincheon too  i would like in
some small measure to express my
appreciation and now i trust you will
excuse me

  kelly bowed and rhohan hastily
left the table we saw him pause and
hand the waiter a yellow-backed bill
just before he vanished

  lets have some champagne said
kelly with a smile at arabia jus-
tice is done again

synopsis of opening chapters

    dare devil gun-runner and recruiting agent for the mexican army of liberation beanie bogan
finds in bruce whittle likely material for his business whittle is in a condition bordering on suicide
because he has lost the one girl in all the world she had married a flabby fool named pedley on
grounds of honor rather than of love also strangely enough she and her husband had seemingly
followed whittle down to the mexican border beanie bogan persuades the lorn lover to forget the
lady in the service of mars so whittle becomes a member of the foreign legion enlisted under general
montano by his courage and recklessness in skirmishes bruce whittle wins the fighting heart of
beanie bogan and a singular friendship is forged in the important attack on fronteras bogan and
whittle agree for ten thousand dollars to burn bridges and destroy railroad communications a most
desperate undertaking to help them in the venture general montano and his master of strategy
gambolier promise to surround the city of fronteras to cut off federal pursuit the dynamiting is
accomplished successfully but bogan and whittle discover themselves without the promised assistance
they are pursued by federal cavalry but in their flight come upon a good natural defensive position
advantage is taken of it and beanie shoots with telling effect into the besieging ranks but night
is falling and beanie informs whittle that the federals will probably get them in the darkness

chapter vii

a reckoning

an hour wore on miserably and
beating up against the wind a
pair of ravens came over from
the distant mountains to hover
above the unburied dead bogan be-
came moody and irritable whittle de-
spondent and oblivious and as the
morning passed and even the scouts
disappeared they slept turn about in
the dirt at last the sun set and rous-
ing up from his apathy beanie once
more took command the horses were
released from their bonds and saddled
the pack was reduced to almost noth-
ing and as the darkness gathered and
no mexicans appeared bogan slipped
away downthe draw some time that
night when they least expected it their
enemies would come tumbling into their
hole and then of course there would
be nothing to it but a running fight in
the dark so they waited worn and
nerve-racked until at last bogan came

back and stripped the pack horse of his
load

  lets get action he said and lash-
ing the animal with his quirt he sent
him at a gallop across the plain the
wind had gone down and they could
hear him clearly as he clattered along
over the flat but no guns spat fire
no lurking troopers charged nothing
checked him as he raced away

  well whats the answer de-
manded bogan and then leading out
his horse he tightened the girth and
mounted

  im tired of this he said do
you want to make a run for it  and
whittle followed willingly behind

  he had no nerves now no fears no
hopes jiist a wearied acceptance of his
fate they rode out slowly heading
for the mountains to the west but no-
where about them in the echoing dark-
ness could they see a single movement
of life they rode a mile across the
barren flat and as his horse found

  this story began in tfie april th popular

b p


the vovular magazine

some bunch grass by a sand hill bogan
stopped and let him eat

  dont see nothing he muttered as
whittle came alongside and while
their famished animals grazed they
sat in silence and listened for the sound
of pursuit well lets take a chance
said bogan at last and reining up his
mount he spurred him into action and
went dashing away toward the hills
they gained them unchallenged and
at the entrance to a canon bogan
turned in his saddle and cursed

  well dang a mexican he burst
out incredulously where in hades
do you think they are

  they all went back to the train
answered whittle at last this morn-
ing when the bugle gave the call

  all right then boasted bogan
according to that i cleaned the whole
outfit you have to hand it to me
and yet he added it aint like them
federals they could have got us like
shooting fish he rode up the draw
where the bunch grass grew rank and
dismounted to let his horse feed but
still he muttered on to himself it
aint right he declared theres some
trick here somewhere they dont let
no bridge burners get away they
rode up the valley and then into a
narrow canon and on until the trail
forked at the divide and the cold dawn
found them far up in the mountains
without a single soldier in pursuit i
got it cried beanie when he realized
his good fortune montano has made
his raid on fronteras

  that was his last word on the enigma
with which he had wrestled all night
and whittle had no theory to advance
all they knew was that the cavalry
which had surprised them in such num-
bers had disappeared as suddenly as
it had come and three days later when
they rode into their old camp they
found beanies guess was good mon-
tanos soldiers were gone their camp
fires were dead and the tracks all
pointed toward fronteras

  why the lazy mexican dastards
cried bogan in a passion when he per-
ceived that the tracks were still fresh
they aint been gone two days we

had about one chance in a hundred
thousand of getting out of that jack
pot alive and here montano and his
pot-licking greasers have been bum-
ming around camp all the time you
wait till i find im i dont care what
he says i dont care if hes taken the
town im going to cuss him out for
a palavering coward and then im go-
ing to quit him i wont work for
no man thatll lie to me like that cant
you see it sticking out well its easy
for me they dont want to let go of
that ten thousand

  yes certainly he exploded i
know thats why they did it its just
some more of gamboliers strategy
we go down there first and burn all
the bridges-that cuts off the troops
from chulia-and then by grab they
let the cavalry go down after us and
that cuts off two hundred more and
-by getting us killed that saves the
ten thousand dollars and they win both
ways from the jack thats the way
they do all of us americans-they work
us for suckers-but you watch em
when i stage my come-back theyll
be surprised and take it from me they
wont dare to look me in the eye a
man cant do it if hes plotted to mur-
 der you he cant look you straight in
the eye

  their journey toward fronteras was
filled with threats and mutterings for
beanie was in a villainous mood on
their long ride north they had encoun-
tered few houses and those of the
poorest class and bogans stomach had
turned against jerked beef yet so
poor and miserable were the mountain
dwellers that they could offer them lit-
tle else and now as they rode in on
their half-starved mounts with the
strain on their tense nerves let down
they paid without knowing it for those
nights of excitement when they had
burned the central bridges they were
nervous and twitchy impatient over
trifles and torn by contending moods
and as they encountered a camp of
montanos soldiers at the head of the
narrow canon they passed them with-
out a wrord

  the army of liberation was en-
the soldiers way

camped in a brushy valley that led up
from the rio grande and as bogan
saw visitors from the american side
moving about among the fires he ex-
ploded in heartfelt oaths if it had
been a fiesta on the streets of fron-
teras there could not have been more
tourists and kodaks there were no
outposts no guards no signs of army
discipline but each insurrecto band
was camped by itself as if there were
no enemy for miles guns and equip-
ment lay everywhere men rode about
at will and in the midst of it all-the
smoldering fires the bright serapes
the big-hatted mountaineer mexicans-
there eddied a throng of sight-seers
from del norte distributing tobacco
and food to the men as the two
haggard men came out of the box
canon and rode down through this as-
sembly beanie bogan became the ob-
ject of all eyes he was gaunt and
bearded with unwashed features and
his clothes torn and stained with dirt
and behind him no less travel worn
rode the wraith of the man whittle
who had stood off the rurales with a
shotgun

  he was changed now from the im-
maculate whittle who had done his
first fighting in decent black the sad
eyes that had once been so gentle were
bloodshot and defiant his clean shoul-
ders were bowed with fatigue and as
he followed after beanie he bore a
certain likeness to that ruthless master
of men the wild life was telling on
him he had been harried and hunted
and now suddenly he was a fighting
animal men gazed at him in silence
as they did at espinoso and others of
montanos famous outlaws and the
women drew together as he passed
and whittle was aware without know-
ing the fause that he was suddenly
set apart from other men he was a
bridge burner a wrecker a soldier of
fortune the partner of the fighting
beanie bogan

  they found the foreign legion en-
camped near the river in full view of
the other side and as they rode on
toward the whitewashed adobe before
which montano stood receiving his

  friends they were greeted by an amer-
ican cheer it came from big bill mc-
cafferty and jimmy sullivan the de-
serter and hulking helge whalgren
and from twenty more grinning re-
cruits

  three cheers for beanie bogan
shouted big bill with unction but
beanie regarded him coldly

  hello you big stiff he responded
with a sneer  what are you fellers
doing up here

  were preparing to attack fron-
teras replied sullivan joyously
whats the matter beanie you look
kinder sick

  yes and i feel kinder sick re-
turned bogan sarcastically what
have we got here-a sunday-school
picnic

  well its sunday admitted sul-
livan if thats what you mean but
were waiting for further reenforce-
ments

  aint surrounded the town yet eh
inquired bogan shortly and spurred
through the crowd toward montano

  ah my friend cried montano in
an ecstasy of excitement when he rec-
ognized bogan beneath his beard and
ran and caught him in his arms

  yes like hell returned bogan re-
leasing himself impatiently some-
thing like your other friend buck
odonnell

  buck odonnell repeated mon-
tano raising his eyebrows inquiringly

  yes answered beanie with brutal
directness only this friend didnt
happen to get killed 

  he tapped himself on the breast
which heaved with sudden anger and
then he burst into a tirade the crowd
became larger newspaper reporters
fought their way forward while mon-
tano strove in vain to check him

  just a moment he protested
only listen my dear bo-gan come
inside-it can all be explained

  yes sure it can be explained
agreed bogan irascibly but would
that bring me back to life i can ex-
plain to you why buck odonnell got
killed-and tell you whose fault it was
too
the cpocpular magazine

 come inside-and bring your 
friend suggested montano quietly
and they followed him into an inner
room

  it was a plain adobe house with
dirt floors and rawhide furniture but
in this the inner sanctuary there was
a great table strewn with maps and
on the opposite side of it immersed
in some problem sat gambolier the
military adviser he rose up slowly
and regarded them questioningly and
to the excited beanie his aloofness was
proof enough of guilt

  no i wont shake hands he grum-
bled morosely as gambolier stepped
forward to congratulate him i came
here to get my money

  what money  demanded gambo-
lier and bogan rushed at him threat-
eningly and wagged his finger in his
face

 you know what money he
shouted accusingly the ten thou-
sand dollars that was coming to us if
we went down and blew up that bridge
well we blowed her up and we burned
a lot of trestles and now by the lord
we want our money and were going
to get it too 

  he added this confidently turning
his keen eyes upon montano who had
ventured once more to intervene

  yes yes my dear bo-gan he pro-
tested smilingly but dont make a
scene with gambolier the agreement
was with me and you shall have the
money so sit down and make your
report

  ive made my report answered
beanie sharply the arroyo grande
bridge is a total wreck and we burned
seven trestles coming north and then
by grab when wed scrapped the whole
railroad and rode our horses to a stand-
still we come over a hill and heres
a whole troop train of cavalry thats
been sent down from fronteras to take
us now you can explain that all you
want to but theres nothing talks to me
like-ten-thousand-dollars-in my
hand

  he held out his hand and patted it
dramatically but montano still smiled
at him tolerantly

  ah yes he said you shall have
the money it is still there in escrow
at the bank when the two weeks are
up if no trains cross the bridge you
shall have it without a doubt we are
very sorry about that matter of the
cavalry but--

  it was a military necessity ex-
plained gambolier suavely and beanie
bogan nodded sneeringly

  yes he said i was listening for
that

  it was indeed exclaimed gambo-
lier warmly it was impracticable to
surround the town

  but what about me inquired bo-
gan meaningly where did i get off
in your military calculations it was
distinctly agreed before i started out
that on the twentieth of april i was to
blow up the bridges and you was to
surround fronteras but youve got
three thousand men camped up here
in the canon and you dont seem to
have surrounded it yet

  ah but you dont understand
cried gambolier excitedly we have no
effective artillery

  no and i dont want to under-
stand answered bogan roughly ive
quit and ive come for my pay

  oh no burst out montano and
rushed to restrain him but beanie
jerked violently away

  its a wonder he suggested that
some one dont ask me how i come to
get away from that cavalry

  well how did you  flattered mon-
tano patting him affectionately on the
shoulder by some foxy-quiller
trick 

  no i whipped em by gad re-
sponded bogan proudly and youse
guys afraid to surround fronteras
he put a world of scorn into the lash
of those words and montano shrank
back as from a whip

  perhaps we were waiting he sug-
gested coldly for you to come back
and show us how

  well im back replied bogan
and i could show you how but it
would be easier to recruit a hundred
fighting irish and go in and do it my-
self
the soldecrs way



  you are confident observed gam-
bolier with a thin-lipped smile and
montano ventured a scornful shrug

  im a soldier returned beanie
stoutly and fighting is my business
but how about that ten thousand dol-
lars 

  it is in the bank answered mon-
tano stiffly you will receive it when
the two weeks arp up

  no ill receive it now just write
me out an order before i begin to get
rough

  bogans beady terrier eyes glowed
red from beneath his eyebrows and
as silence fell upon the room he fin-
gered his pistol suggestively

  very well spoke up montano but
as he shook out his fountain pen he
gave way to a sigh of bitterness very
well sergeant bo-gan but according
to our agreement--

  our agreement  you broke it first
you was to protect me by surround-
ing fronteras

  -you were to wait till the two

weeks were up what assurance have
we that the bridge is destroyed none
at all but your own unsupported
word

  my word is good observed bo-
gan as he slipped the check into his
pocket and ill give you a little ad-
vice before i go you better get you
another military adviser

  he stuck out his chin at gambolier
and started for the door but montano
ran hastily after him

  just a moment sergeant bo-gan
he implored in a whisper would you
consider-bringing over some big
guns 

  nothing doing answered bogan
but his steps lagged a little and at the
outer door he stopped ill tell you
he said well see if this checks good
first and with a leering grin he was
gone

chapter viii

to cherish and protect

  on their return to del norte as on
his departure bruce whittle was no
more than a sad-eyed automaton a
patient shadow of beanie bogan he

followed him silently across the sway-
ing suspension bridge and past the rigid
and oblivious soldier who stood guard
at the american side he followed him
into the closed and waiting automobile
which had appeared so mysteriously to
receive them and with the admiring
murmurs of the crowd in his ears he
went flying with beanie into town it
was all a part of the terrifying death
machine to which he had committed his
poor self and which after whirling him
through the wilds of chihuahua and
back through a phantasmagoria of
flight now spewed him out at the end
of the journey safe as a child who
has dared to shoot the chutes

  he had gone out to die but now
that he had escaped his mind was
purged of petty hopes and fears and
he gave no thought to what was going
on if the people stared and pointed
if the barber refused his fee or high
officials smiled wisely and shook hands
it was no more personal to him than
the very evident fact that del norte
had gone war mad the city was
crowded with transcontinental tourists
who had taken stop-overs to wait for
the big fight the barrooms were
jammed with old soldiers and frontier
characters making prophecies on the
date of the battle and at every place
he went still the shadow of beanie
bogan he found himself lauded as a
hero

  the news of the dynamiting of the
central bridges had set the whole city
in an uproar and then hot upon it
had come the word that montano was
marching upon fronteras he had
come and the moment his high-hatted
insurrectos appeared del norte went
wild with excitement after lurking
for months in the mountains of chi-
huahua recruiting peons raiding
ranches and attacking towns montano
the master mind of the ever-spreading
revolution had come out into the open
to fight it would be a spectacle that
men would always speak of the attack
on the stronghold of fronteras-
within the town the trained federals
of reyes fully equipped with artillery
and machine guns without the swarm-


the poepular magazine

ing-hosts of half-savage insurrectos
clothed in rags and inspired with the
high valor of patriots

  a host of correspondents and special
writers descended upon del norte
overnight and as the army of libera-
tion dirty hungry and out of tobacco
came boldly down to the river they were
overwhelmed and astounded by the on-
rush of visitors and by the gifts that
followed in their wake in a day there
was tobacco for every insurgent and
presents of food and clothes peace offi-
cers and government officials felt the
influence of public opinion and winked
at the violations of neutrality and sud-
denly in a great burst of popular en-
thusiasm every man became a partisan
of montano

  but the great battle had not materi-
alized fronteras was not surrounded
and though the foreign legion had
been doubled in a week by a rush of
adventurous americans montano had
done nothing but delay hence the
riotous welcome to beanie bogan and
his bridge-burning partner whittle-
the man who never talked

  it was in the lounge of the exclusive
cholla club where with bogan he had
retired to escape the attention of the
crowd that bruce whittle suddenly
woke to his old life for two weeks
he had moved in a waking dream re-
sponding quickly to every reaction but
wrapped in a blessed oblivion the
sharp agony of his loss had produced
its own anodyne and he was drugged
by the contemplation of sudden death
but now in a moment as a face ap-
peared before him the curtain of ne-
penthe was torn while beanie always
the center of interest was replying in
guarded sentences to the jovial accu-
sations of his friends a man peered
in through the door his eyes met
whittles then were quickly averted
and in a moment broughton pedley
was gone then the old memories
rushed back and whittle sat tense and
staring while slowly as if moved by
some ponderous mechanism a wedding
scene passed before his eyes

  he saw the bridal hall the decorated
chancel the huddle of silent guests and

then down the stairway she came again
constance the woman that he loved
once more she met his glance then
moved on to the chancel and the old
irresolution came over him he heard
the words of the ceremony hurried
forward so precipitately he heard her
answer and pedleys and then the end
again he woke to the feeling of horror
to the sense that he had lost her for-
ever and too late he roused up from
his trance he was brave now that it
was too late his strength could move
mountains but what was there now to
win  nothing but a kiss to remember
always to cherish to the end of his
days he moved forward with the rest
he met her she rushed to his arms and
then-the kiss 

  it changed now and mingled the
slow-moving vision that had been burn-
ing on the tissues of his brain but
always it came back that appeal in her
eyes as she gazed after him and called
him by name she had called him
bruce and ever since in his dreams he
had thought of her as constance and
she loved him still though she had suf-
fered the martyrdom of marriage with
broughton pedley and he knew this
too she would always love him and re-
main faithful to his memory she was
there in del norte and he had come
back as from the dead perhaps-well
perhaps he might see her once more

  whittle had never forgotten the well-
meaning arguments with which beanie
had attacked his resolve and it did
seem unreasonable since she wished
to see him to deny her that moment
of grace it would be painful-for
when he looked at her now she was not
constance she was pedleys wife but
if it would make her any happier in
the years to come he must go through
with it for her sake and she would be
watching for him now she would read
in the papers of his desperate adven-
tures in mexico and would know that
he had sought death for her

  he rose up suddenly as a twisted bit
of paper was thrust into his hand from
behind but though he turned quickly
he saw only a call boy slipping deftly
away through the crowd beanie had
the soldierfs way



not seen it-he was busy telling stories
-and whittle glanced at the hasty
note it was written awkwardly in a
cramped left-handed fashion that was
obviously intended to disguise but at
the bottom was signed her name
constance

   am watched but must see you follow
man at club door

  whittle glanced over at beanie
then when his attention was diverted
he rose and started for the door but
despite his preoccupation beanie had
not missed the proceedings and he
grabbed him as he passed down the
hall

  here he said whats the big
idee  dont you know youre liable
to get pinched your names in the
paper-youre alleged to be a dynamiter
-but youre safe inside that door

   i-i was just going out for a little
walk began whittle lamely but bo-
gan was not to be deceived

  nothing doing he declared you
stay right here by me if you dont
youll get into trouble

  but i dont like it in here an-
swered whittle fretfully i want to
get some fresh air

   well it aint fresh believe me
returned bogan fervently the kind
they have in the jail i broke in there

once before i learned my business-

  well im going anyhow broke
in whittle sharply and bogans lip
curled in a smile

  all right he said give er my
regards and send for me when you
land on your ear

  you mind your own business
flashed back whittle and whipped out
the massive door

   it was dusk almost dark but as he
stepped into the street a man appeared
from a sheltering archway and beck-
oned him to follow he was not a man
that whittle had seen before and yet
in some way he seemed familiar
there was something about the set of
his heavy neck and the way he planted
-his feet and he was leading him down
toward the river the streets became
narrower and the houses lower and

at a bridge across the canal whittle
stopped below the canal as he knew
very well lay chihuahua town and the
mud huts of the mexicans it was
none too safe even in the middle of
the day and-what would constance
be doing there 

 come on called the man and as
whittle shook his head he turned back
impatiently to join him say listen
he said im a private detective in the
employ of a certain lady my client

wants to see you-

  well she isnt down there an-
swered whittle with decision per-
haps youve got the wrong man

  aint you mr whittle demanded
the detective coming closer didnt
you get her note at the club well
come on then shes crazy to see you
she said you was just to have faith
well where is she questioned
whittle following after him reluc-
tantly theres nothing but mexicans
down here

  ill tell you whispered the detec-
tive speaking hoarsely in his ear she
came down here to hide from her-hus-
band 

  he gave him a playful dig with his
elbow and strode on toward a lighted
house but at the entrance whittle
halted irresolutely the house stood
by itself onthe edge of the river and
it had a sinister air he recalled of
a sudden the warnings of beanie and
that other affair with a detective

  step in sir said the detective still
holding the door open youll find
her just inside

  well ask her to come out sug-
gested whittle at last and then sud-
denly the mans attitude changed

  say he blustered youre going
in that door or ill know the reason
why now-are you coming or must
i throw you in  he stepped out
swiftly as if to cut off whittles re-
treat and then he spoke more quietly
you dont need to be afraid he said
but she offered me a reward of sev-
eral hundred dollars and im sure go-
ing to deliver the goods

  he moved forward ponderously and
after facing him a moment whittle


the vovulacr magazine

turned and stepped through the door
what did it matter to him if the de-
tective was lying if she wished to see
him she would have to engage some
messenger and detectives were much of
a kind the fact that this ruffian im-
puted a dishonorable motive to her note
and his instant response to it should
not bar the way to those few precious
moments which he must snatch before
he went back to die and if he was
deceived-well what did it matter
what did anything matter after all

  he entered the room doubtfully and
a candle on the table guttered low
before the draft of air but when the
puny flame threw its light into the
shadows he saw broughton pedley
smiling

  well he said as he stepped out
from his hiding so ive caught you
have i at last 

  yes answered whittle but though
he said it quietly his chest began to
heave with excitement the sight of
this man whom he had so scrupulously
avoided released a gust of fierce pas-
sions in his breast and as he noticed
the smile his lips began to tremble and
his hands clutched and worked with
rage

  yes he said but you may live to
regret it you may wish you had let
me alone i warn you now-

  oh you warn me taunted ped-
ley and then he laughed unpleasantly
i may as well tell you he went on
that ive got you dead to rights he
raised his hand and from a darkened
doorway two men emerged with pis-
tols drawn just search him for
arms ordered pedley confidently and
whittle submitted in a daze and now
step outside continued pedley to his
men id like to talk with this gentle-
man alone

  the door closed behind them and as
whittle stood waiting pedley paced up
and down the room

  mr whittle he began at last you
have made me a lot of trouble and i
feel justified in using strong-arm meth-
ods in fact the way things have come
about i am greatly tempted to dispose
of you but i will give you another

chance in order not to disturb my
wife

  he paused and as whittle winced at
the word he looked him in the eyes

  yes my wife he repeated i
have sworn to love cherish and pro-
tect her and before god i will keep
my promise  if you wont listen to rea-
son if you wont go out of her life
and promise never to return ill throw
you into that river with as little com-
punction as i would the body of a dog
i know who you are-a cowardly
blackmailer-but you cant work your
game with me i might if i were easy
offer you a certain amount of money
to give up your designs on my home
but there are other methods and i have
chosen to employ them now-heres
the way matters stand

  he folded his arms and regarded
wrhittle sternly while he went on with
portentous calm

  by rights i should take you across
the river and deliver you to the fed-
eral commander there is a standing
reward for your apprehension and the
penalty of your crime is death but if
you will sign this paper which simply
states the truth that you were only
trying to marry her for her money

  i was not denied whittle in a
white heat of anger you lie you
dirty crook you have no understand-
ing of honor if you were only a gen-
tleman you might know that my mo-
tives-

  didnt you come here to-night
broke in pedley accusingly in re-
sponse to a fake note from her  didnt
you come sneaking down here think-
ing you would meet her alone  and
didnt you know that she was my wife
well no wonder you are ashamed i
think under the circumstances that i
have behaved very handsomely in not
resorting to absolute violence

  well i did come admitted whittle
at last but i thought she might need
my aid shes unhappy-i know it-
and id give my right hand-

  not necessary answered pedley
glibly just sign your name to this
statement
the soldiers way



  he whipped out a paper and spread
it on the table while he held out a
fountain pen but whittle struck it out
of his hand

  you poor ignorant fool he hissed
through his teeth do you think id
sign anything for you 

  you will threatened pedley or
be dragged across the river to be exe-
cuted as a self-confessed dynamiter
now you can take your choice but
ive notified the commander and hell

  go ahead challenged whittle if
you think you can do it just put me
across the river no you-you he
rushed at him impetuously as pedley
called for help and they went down to-
gether on the floor

  help help cried pedley and
an instinctive loathing made whittles
fingers close on his throat he hated
the very touch of his plump yielding
body the gasp of his breath against his
cheek and he shook him as a dog
shakes a snake they rose up strug-
gling the table crashed beneath them
and as they went down again in the
darkness whittle struck him with all
his strength in the face rough hands
laid hold upon him and wrenched him
away but the old animal hatred the
primordial savagery which bade him
kill the man who had stolen his mate
rose up in an instant and he jerked
himself free while he aimed one more
blow at his enemy he struck out in-
discriminately for they were all against
him until in the darkness a pistol
swung at random caught him fairly
across the head he went down half
stunned and in the silence that followed
the babble of spanish smote their ears
a crowd of mexicans was gathered
about the doorway gazing in but afraid
to enter until suddenly a fat man bear-
ing a lantern and a pistol came striding
into the room

  ouien viva he demanded throw-
ing his lantern upon their faces and
at sight of whittle he stopped ah
my frien he cried and looking up
from the ground whittle recognized
the purple visage of rico my frien
he cried again and raising his pistol

vindictively he felled a burly detective
to the floor socorro amigos he
shouted to his friends give me help
and viva montano

  viva montano yelled the crowd
and with a savage rush they came
tumbling in through the door

  hah my frien exclaimed rico
dragging whittle to a corner and pro-
tecting him with his body from the
rout i have save your life-like
mine

chapter ix

the soldiers way

  with rico to the fore the chances
were small that whittle would be de-
livered to the federal s though the
mexican was a drunken brute with a
black record as a smuggler ingratitude
could not be charged up against him
and so great was his anger at the assail-
ants of his friend that he flew at them
again in a fury the crowd followed
suit for in little chihuahua rico puga
was an uncrowned king and the com-
bat assumed the proportions of a riot
until at a signal the mob rushed away
carrying whittle bodily in their midst

  no be afraid panted rico in his
ear officers come-no want a fight
the darkness behind them was punc-
tuated by pistol shots as the officers
discharged their guns in the air and
the hurried slap of brogans marked the
precipitate flight of most of ricos mob
but enough remained to carry whittle
to the fonda and hide him in an up-
stairs room there while rico stayed
below and stoutly asserted that he had
no knowledge of the riot an old woman
bathed the cut on whittles head and
bound it up in a clean rag then as
the excitement subsided and the officers
left the quarter rico scurried up the
stairs to get the news

  what they fight you for he de-
manded eagerly as a bevy of staring
mexicans appeared behind you
smuggle guns you start one scrap
them men work for porfilio reyes 
no theyre private detectives an-
swered whittle unwillingly but they
were going to deliver me to reyes
ah i weesh i had keel them ex-


the popular magazine

claimed rico fiercely what for they
want to ketch you

  well began whittle and then he
hesitated for beanie had warned him
not to talk they said there was a
reward on my head

  on your head oh to geet you
but what for my frien what for
never mind well for burning
bridges

  a great light came into ricos star-
ing eyes as he rolled them wisely at
the crowd

  but you aint burn them bridges
hey he questioned laughing heartily
hah my frien we understand all
that and when you have troble when
them bad mans try ketch you you come
to my house understan  he made
some remark to the mexicans behind
him and they turned and tramped down
the stairs by gol he went on flash-
ing his teeth at whittle i hear all
about that bridge and my frien
beanie bo-gan he is sure one brave
man but montano i don know why
dont he march up and battle fron-
teras  all them people been move out
maybe one week maybe two they dont
like be in that town but now pretty
soon they all go back they go home
to keep bad men from steal

  the sorrows of el pueblo the poor
people of fronteras who had so ac-
commodatingly crossed over to del
norte to allow montano to take their
town wre very near to ricos heart
but as he was still in the midst of an
account of their flight there was a step
on the stairway below

  hah bo-gan cried rico but as
he rushed to welcome him beanie
shoved him rudely aside

  hey come on  he said to whit-
tle your friend has turned out the
guard

  what demanded whittle rising
up from his couch are the detec-
tives out after us again

  and the soldiers answered bogan
as he hustled him down the stairs
theyve given orders to prevent us
from crossing your friend came up-
town with his nose battered out of
shape and the first man he run into

was the united states marshal and the
commander of the provost guard
then he made a big holler about how
you had beat him and turned him over
to a mob of montanistas and of course
the marshal and the captain sent out
word to have you arrested but ill
get you across--large bodies move
slowly and well beat the captains or-
ders to the dam-but oh boy youre
a vindikitive cuss now come on up
the track-and take off that rag or
youll never get by in the world-but
oh lawzee im never going to speak
cross to you again the way you chopped
up mr pedley i seen it in your eye
when you left the club but i never
looked for nothing like this

  he set off up the track at a long sol-
diers trot still murmuring his admira-
tion and awe and whittle let it pass
in grim silence it was nothing to him
what bogan believed or disbelieved
and nothing mattered now he had lost
but beanie was so pleased at his sup-
posed act of vengeance that even after
they had started across the dam he
turned back to tell the joke to the sen-
try they are a clan by themselves
these soldiers of the line and love noth-
ing so much as a fight also they love
no man more than the top cutter the
father of the company the first ser-
geant is to them the leader of the clan
and they acknowledge a greater loyalty
to him than they do to the captain or
the colonel that was the reason why
beanie bogan turned back-and why
the sentry let him pass

  he waded across chuckling and
when he caught up with whittle he
slapped him on the back

  whit old boy he declared with
an oath you should have been a sol-
dier  thats the soldiers way-never
ask for help just step to im with
your own two hands i knew by your
eye you was thinking about that das-
tard-and oh lordy how i would love
tove been there-but you never said
a word just told me to hike and went
out and cleaned him yourself oh you
had some help did you well i heard
about that too but it was three to
one at the start and ricos compadre
the soldiers wry



said you kept em all busy until they
cracked you on the bean with a gun
lemme feel of the place aw thatll
get well come on lets go up to
camp

  i thought youd quit montano
suggested whittle the better to change
the subject you certainly talked that
way

  ahhr talk returned bogan i
always talk like that its the only
way to get your pay look at them
poor boobs in the foreign legion-
two hundred a month and pickings
do you ever see em get their pay 
not a dollar by grab theyre still
bumming their tobacco and will till we
take fronteras but say do you think
im going to lose out on the fireworks
after four-flushing around for months
ump-umm boy theres loot enough
in the customhouse alone to make
every man jack of us rich no im
going back to fight and if montano is
afraid to ill hop in and take fronteras
myself

  you cant do it challenged whit-
tle but bogan only grunted and kicked
at a rock in the trail

  gimme a hundred trained soldiers
he answered deliberately and id take
the town to-morrow and he added
i could go out to the fort and get that
many deserters them boys is crazy
to enlist but ive got too much respect
for the service but these mexicans
will fight if montano gives the word
and them federals are just dying to
quit ive talked with their deserters
--you remember that yaqui indian
with the big  burned on his face
well hes a deserter but they put their
mark on him first the major knew
he was going to quit him so he took
the battalion branding iron and stamped
a big  on his cheek well numero
tres says the men in his battalion had
to be locked up in the cuartel every
night and all their arms were locked
up somewhere else for fear theyd
start a mutiny a hundred fighting
irish could take the town

  well why dont we take it then
asked whittle impatiently and bogan
clucked his tongue

  when you get a mexican to fight
he said youre pulling off a miracle
but they will fight dad burn em if
you once get em started but its al-
ways  manana manana theyre
out of ammunition or theyre short of
guns or theyre waiting for somebody
else but the trouble with pepe mon-
tano as i found out to-day is that the
whole montano family has butted in
up to a week ago when he marched
on fronteras and the papers all took
up this hooraw they said he was crazy
and everything else but now they see
a chance to win it seems the south-
ern mexicans are starting a revolution
and reyes is so busy right near home
he cant send up any more reenforce-
ments we isolated chulita when we
blowed up that bridge and now heres
fronteras ripe and waiting to be
picked and then the montano family
butts in

  whats their graft well ill tell
you theyve formed a peace commit-
tee and theyre talking over the wire
with reyes do you ketch the idee
if hell come through with what they
want theyll call off little pepe whos
always been the family goat but if
reyes wont theyll tell pepe to turn
the bunch loose and mr reyes will
be left belly up because if we take
that town with public sentiment what
it is it wont be two weeks until the
united states will recognize montano
as a belligerent theyll have to rec-
ognize him because hell open up the
customhouse and begin to do business
anyway and say my boy it wont be
so bad to be a friend of montanos
then look at the guns hell be order-
ing and the ammunition and equip-
ment and the artillery and machine
guns to boot oh glory and i know
a man in town that would give ten
thousand dollars to land the first con-
tract for munitions

  but listen here whit he went on
confidentially as they paused on the
outskirts of the camp ive got a
scheme and ill split with you half
and half but it calls for a little rough
work now sit down here a minute
where we wont be observed and ill


the vovular magazine

tell you where you come in its all
to our interest to pull on this battle in
any way we can once we get it
started the mexicans will join in and
then all hell wouldnt stop it this
colonel bracamonte thats in command
of the town killed our wounded after
the battle of villa nueva and pedro
espinoso and the rest of those bandits
have sworn theyll have his blood
theyve got him bottled up and they
wont let him go no matter what any-
body says but all the same being
mexicans they will sit around and
wait

 now heres the proposition
theres two things against us-mon-
tanos family and this snaky gambo-
lier that guys a bad actor you take
it from me and hes got to be put out
of the way you heard that crack i
got off to montano about getting an-
other military adviser  well that was
just a starter weve got to undermine
him and turn the whole legion against
him now i cant do that because i
enlisted some of them boys for a bonus
of ten dollars a head and the irish
never forget but heres you now that
enlisted when they did and theyll lis-
ten to what you say just slip 
among em and give this one some to-
baccy and another a pleasant word and
then when they take to you just tell
em about gambolier and how he
ditched us to save paying that ten
thousand dollars thatll settle the
dastard because hes cold as a snake
and they hate him like the devil al-
ready

  but now to get rid of him youre
so kind of deceiving nobody would
think for a minute that youd fight
but some day in camp when gambolier
comes through you tax him with be-
ing a coward and with trying to get
you killed then beat the face off him
the way you did pedley and well laugh
him out of camp to get rid of him
thats the point anny way you can do
it and then well pull montano over
the fence we did it once at the bat-
tle of villa nueva but we got to get
rid of this strategical frenchman or
well never smell powder again as

for the montano family well just cut
the wires on them and trust to ltick
for the rest now will you do that
whit me boy or will i have to look
further

  youll have to look further an-
swered whittle after a silence but
ill be there when it comes to the bat-
tle

  ah still thinking of the lady ob-
served beanie sympathetically but
sure now yoiie entirely wrong
youve no cause to be downcast twill
all work out nicely so put all them
thoughts from your mind youve
come back a hero with your name in
the paper and your bold deeds on every-
bodys lips the dynamite devil
they called you in the tribune and sure
thats praise enough theyre all the
same i tell you whittle these women
all love a bold man and then to have
him come home with his face all dis-
figured from running against your fist
but theres one thing more youll have
to have to win the lady for sure and
thats the hard money in the bank
theyre all the same there too ye
must have the money and how else can
you get it but with me so come now
forget it and when i get to the loot
ill lay aside a gift like for her

  no thank you beanie answered
whittle from the darkness im afraid
you dont understand its no use try-
ing to help me the best thing i can
do is to get killed

  ah be a man reproached beanie
and then as his exhortations fell on
barren ground he muttered and went
on to camp

chapter x

the post of honor

  beanie bogans plans for a benevo-
lent mutiny led and fathered by the
turbulent legion were rudely disrupted
and brought to naught by the arrival
of pedro espinoso a fire-eating
gringo-hating bandit who had left mon-
tano the week before of all the mex-
ican leaders he was the only man who
refused to submit to delays prickly
pete as he was called was the embodi-
the soudlers way



ment of brutal courage and he had
wiped out the word mafiana from his
vocabulary having been a bandit for
years he was no dabbler in warfare
and like the fighting irish he believed
in direct action and results but that
was perhaps the only bond between
them for he hated the foreign legion
as he did the rurales of reyes

  he came riding into camp from one
of his wild forays with four hundred
high-hatted outlaws at his back and
without mincing words he notified
montano that he pedro espinoso in-
tended to attack fronteras immediately
with his men drawn up in military
order and a mob of clamoring insur-
rectos behind him he seemed for the
moment to hold the high card and the
foreign legion prudently withdrew
then they argued and debated and ban-
died hot accusations the bandits and
pepe montano until at last prickly
pete gained his point montano agreed
that espinosos cavalry should instantly
surround the town while he as soon
as his artillery was available would
batter it down from the west and
meanwhile the army which could no
longer be restrained was to engage the
first line of intrenchments and drive
the pclones back to town

  so the bugles were sounded the ad-
vance began precipitately and as the
eager insurrectos in a disorderly mob
went shooting and yelling to the fray
the foreign legion eclipsed and for-
gotten remained to bring up the artil-
lery this consisted of a single three-
inch fieldpiece bored out of a seven-
inch locomotive shaft and mounted on
ponderous wheels for months in the
machine shops of a captured mining
camp american mechanics under the
direction of gambolier had been labor-
ing on this masterpiece and now as
the mexicans rushed forward to take
the town they dragged it slowly up
the bluff gambolier who had served
in the french artillery took charge of
the emplacement of long tom but be-
fore they had more than got it on the
mesa the battle burst out below them

  from the brushy fiats there came vol-
leys and cheers as the insurrectos be-

gan their long-range attack and then
there was a boom from the cuartel at
fronteras and a shell burst above the
plain as the flying shrapnel struck
up a storm of dust the attacking horde
fell silent the reckless firing of their
-s was checked as if by magic
and then boom the gun spoke out
again bang crashed the shell as it
burst far above them and as the scrap
iron began to fall like rain in their
midst the insurgents broke for the hills
gambolier had been right with such
undisciplined troops it was impossible
to even menace the town there were
in fronteras both field guns and mor-
tars and experienced gunners as well
whereas montanos men had never seen
a cannon until they gazed ugpn the
handmade long tom

  a superior smile came over gambo-
liers face as with field glasses leveled
at the plain he watched the insurrectos
retreat

  very well he said if we are to
be coerced by every bandit let es-
pinoso take the town

  the panting chihuahuans their eyes
big with terror came crowding up to
watch long toms reply but though
montano and his men both implored
him to shoot it gambolier refused to
serve the gun

  no he declared the attack was
premature of what use is artillery
now 

  ah tira le begged the mexicans
making motions at the breechblock
but long tom was not fired that day
the attack came to nothing the fed-
eral s took heart and gambolier worked
on placidly at his emplacement as
military adviser he had objected most
strenuously when espinoso had clam-
ored for war and now jealous of his
authority and determined to make the
most of it he resolutely refused to be
hurried and there were other con-
siderations known only to the ameri-
cans which made it inadvisable to fire
it was a matter of doubt whether the
breechblock was safe the question had
been debated for days and beanie bo-
gan and other ex-soldiers insisted that
it would blow out the first shot so


the popular magazine

for various reasons the foreign legion
stood pat and let the mexicans rage

  but if gambolier the military ad-
viser refused to take the attack seri-
ously there were others more hot-
headed who had jeopardized their free-
dom in the belief that the great battle
was on the first wild charge had
proved too much for certain soldiers
still wearing the united states uniform
and when the fiasco was over the de-
spised foreign legion found itself re-
cruited up to forty-five men the new
recruits had come across the river with
their guns in their hands ready to fight
the whole mexican nation but when
that dayhad passed and the next and
the next with no move to advance upon
the town the hearts of the deserters
turnedick with disgust and then bit-
ter with hate and scorn pedro espi-
noso had subsided contenting himself
with tearing up the railroad track be-
low fronteras but if pedro in his an-
ger had chastised montano with whips
the foreign legion chastised him with
scorpions yet it all came to naught
for montano and his peace committee
were simply using their war ardor as
a club to intimidate reyes and at last
the word came that the dictator had
capitulated and all was arranged but
the terms

  then the deluge broke and the out-
raged foreign legion demanded an
immediate assault upon the town as
they gathered before the house where
montano and his relatives were barter-
ing away their last chance for a fight
it was beanie bogan still the father of
the company who put their hot anger
into words at another time their in-
vincible ardor would have won their
commanders heart but now montano
begged them to be patient a great
victory he said was almost in their
hands and it could be gained without
shedding blood whereas if they under-
took to assault the town many brave
comrades at arms would be killed so
he begged their indulgence while he
communicated still further with reyes
and the city of mexico and if the sur-
render was agreed to he would reward
them even greater than if they had

taken fronteras by force so he spoke
but a high howl of irish protest was
the only response that he got

  the foreign legion as now suddenly
constituted was composed almost en-
tirely of ex-soldiers some there were
who had bought out and others had
been honorably discharged but a large
number had deserted with their guns
in the wild rush that preceded the bat-
tle that was their business-to fight
-and yet for three enlistments there
had not been an echo of war in the
distant philippines perhaps a brush
with the ladrones or a clash with some
naked hill tribes but a real open bat-
tle such as young soldiers dream of
had not happened in all their world
and now with all the makings of a
battle before them they were being
balked by this man who talked peace

  nor was their protest unseconded by
the mountain mexicans who had gath-
ered for the assault of the town there
were  many arftong them who were
tainted with outlawry and proscribed
by this same porfilio reyes his ru-
rales and soldiers had been pursuing
them for years and wifh the return
of peace wrould pursue them again as
the rumor spread of a possible under-
standing of a peaceful surrender of all
mexico they came in droves led by
their fiery chiefs and registered a most
violent protest once more montano
the dreamer and pacifier appealed to
their loyalty but just as he had them
won over to be patient pedro espinoso
came dashing up he rode a sorrel
horse the color of burnished gold and
brandished an angry pistol to clear his
way and wthen he had confronted the
chief of the insurrectos he called him
a coward and a traitor it was not
peace they wanted but war-war
against old porfilio war against braca-
monte and the federals who had mur-
dered the villa nueva prisoners and
shot all the wounded where they lay
what good would peace bring it
would simply give reyes the oppor-
tunity to wipe-out such as he so raged
prickly pete the bandit chief of the
sierras and all the lesser bandits swung
their hats and yelled for war
the soldiers way



  but pepe montano though he was
not warlike was fearless and he re-
fused to be moved by their threats he
held out for peace and in the end they
had a conference which lasted two
days and resulted in a mexican procla-
mation montano read it to his as-
sembled army and won them over to a
man in it he set forth that by the
valor of his brave men he had struck
fear to the heart of the dictator but
that now he must ask a final sacrifice
of their devotion greater even than the
laying down of their lives for the
second time they had marched upon
fronteras and they now held it in their
power but because it lay across the
river from a friendly city whose in-
habitants might be killed by flying shots
he was going to ask all true lovers of
mexico to withhold for a time their
hands the prize was theirs but it
must be spared and their valor turned
to other exploits therefore he had
ordered an immediate advance upon the
capital city of chulita and in recogni-
tion of the services of the foreign
legion which had fought so bravely
at villa nueva he would give them the
position of honor as leaders of the van

  mere words of course and artfully
devised to produce a certain effect but
as the sun went down and the guns
of fronteras were shrouded in the pro-
tecting darkness the foreign legion
set forth they marched out grum-
bling for it was far to chulita and a
waterless desert lay between but that
word of tribute to buck odonnell and
the heroes of the vanished legion had
won them in spite of themselves even
beanie bogan who knew mexicans
well was disarmed by the reference to
his friend and beanie too had re-
ceived his meed of honor for he also
had fought at villa nueva he bared
his breast to show the new recruits the
three furrows the machine gun had
plowed and in the dramatic recital of
that battle in the night he forgot the
artful cunning of gambolier-

  gambolier stayed behind with his
gun crew intact to supervise the re-
moval of long tom but as the legion
marched off with bogan at its head

he smiled under cover of the darkness
a little hike as he had suggested to
montano might divert the restless en-
ergy of the americans and meanwhile
the peace committee could proceed with
its negotiations without the continual
menace of a mob and if for reasons
of military necessity it became advisa-
 ble to reconsider their plan a courier
could be sent to recall the legion in
ample time for the assault on fron-
teras

  there was always something deep
something looking far ahead and pro-
viding against all possible contingencies
in everything which gambolier sug-
gested this it was which won for the
colonel the regard of pepe montano
who was himself concerned only with
dreams he had conceived a great
dream of mexico freed and ruled by
justice alone of its people dwelling
in a communistic state wherein caste
and class were abolished but the nec-
essary details of the bloody business
which must precede such an ideal es-
tate those must be conceived by others
more apt having malice toward no
man how could he plot out the death
of the poor pelones who fought for
reyes  and heartily despising the
business of a soldier how could he be
interested in its inhuman strategy  no
he must leave that to gambolier and
it was at gamboliers suggestion that
he ordered the advance upon chulita

  the foreign legion marched out
bravely followed by the rag-tag of
montanos army which they soon left
far behind it was the pride of the
infantrymen that they could outwalk
a horse and now that the order to
advance had been given they swung
off in route step down the road bo-
gan rode at their head though not as
their commander for the new men
were beyond all control and for an
hour or more they hiked down the road
that led to the south and chulita in
vain the cowboys and civilian members
called out from the rear for a halt the
fever of long waiting was like fire in
their veins and the deserters pressed
on to the divide there with all chi-
huahua before them and fronteras far


the cpocpulacr magazine

behind they sat down to wait for the
army and let the stragglers catch up

  they came in limping and as no
army appeared the footsore ones took
off their boots a half hour passed
and the moon which was near its full
lit up the desolate desert like day one
man after another stretched out in the
road to snatch a little sleep-and still
no army appeared then beanie bo-
gan rose up and taking out his field
glasses gazed long in the direction of
the town it was almost midnight and
their position would be unenviable if
they were caught out on the desert at
dawn

  well what say boys  he ventured
at last lets go back down the road
and meet em

  what and walk clear back de-
manded jimmy sullivan lets go on
until we come to a town

  youd find it a long walk answered
beanie soberly come on boys
theys been some mistake

  what mistake asked big bill mc-
cafferty rousing up from an uneasy
sleep have them mexicans took the
wrong road

no thats just it replied bogan
theys only one road and were on it
then they havent started burst
out sullivan angrily they just packed
their horses for a bluff

  i dunno returned bogan but i
can tell you one thing-were a long
ways from water and grub

  well dang a mexican exclaimed
big bill in a passion rising up and
grabbing his gun lets go back and
kill the last one of them theyve sent
us with bags to ketch snipe

  you may be right bill said bo-
gan routing up the sleeping soldiers
and starting them back down the road
and if you are he added this is
no place for martin bogans son

chapter xi

and a pair of socks

  the advance upon chulita as gam-
bolier had surmised had done much
to abate the fighting fever of the legion
but the ignominious retreat after hav-

ing been tricked irito starting seemed
to reverse that favorable process as
several hours of travel brought forth
no signs of the following cavalry or
of any of montanos advance guard
the footsore americans extended their
revilings to include the entire mexican
nation even the gallant general in
whose name they invaded mexico was
not exempt from this universal execra-
tion and as daylight came on without
revealing a sign of his army beanie
bogan added his voice to the chorus
only one man remained silent and that
was the dynamite devil

  since he had crossed the river after
his battle with pedley bruce whittle
had gone into the silence he kept by
himself and the wrangling of his com-
panions fell unheeded upon his ears
he had a problem to solve and a de-
cision to make for it had become mani-
fest at last that constances love for
him was something more than a mem-
ory she had followed him to del
norte immediately after her marriage
she had sought him out in the plaza
and though she had acknowledged
pedleys authority as her husband she
had not yielded to him in everything
for certainly if he could command her
absolutely pedley would have hurried
his bride away and the very fact that
he himself remained argued the con-
tinued presence of constance the
question was whether she had separated
from her husband and if so what ac-
tion he whittle should take

  should he go back to del norte
braving officers and united states mar-
shals and the certainty of landing in
jail for the poor consolation of one
look into her eyes before he was de-
nounced by her husband  or should
he like a gentleman stay quietly where
he was and seek the ultimate solution
in death  there were ways of course
of sending her word but none of them
escaped the objection that he was in-
truding where he had no right had
he not bowed his head in voiceless
shame when pedley confronted him
with his acts  it was true he had
gone to that lone house by the river
in the hope of seeing constance and
the slders way



constance was pedleys wife how
much more then would he be humili-
ated if after all that had happened
he persisted in his efforts to see her
and how could he again protest if he
were confronted by pedley that his
motives were above reproach

  it was a long bitter struggle now
with hope rising high now with the cer-
titude of defeat until in the end he
had ridden off with the legion to ac-
cept whatever fate had in store for
him he would put it to the touch
this nice point of honor and if from
the dangers and uncertainties before
him he escaped as he had before then
the hand of god -or whatever molds
our destinies would seem to be saving
him-for her but if with all these
other misfits he should go out and be
mowed down by guns then the answer
was plain and apparent to every one
and he would trouble his loved one no
more he would be dead and for the
dead there is nothing but tears and a
forgetting it was better to pass on in
silence

  he had gone out grimly knowing
the desert before him and the dangers
that lurked for them all but as he
turned back toward the line and saw
death and dangers vanish he was filled
with an unutterable weariness so it
always came about-when he sought
heroic death it eluded him and left sor-
did hardship in its place he got down
from his horse and gave his place in
the saddle to a runaway texas boy
named jackson whose high boots tor-
tured his feet and at daybreak tired
and hungry and out of water he strag-
gled with the rest past fronteras
from the tracks in the dust it was now
a certainty that montanos army had
only started out and turned back and
to add the last drop to their cup of
bitterness the federal outposts opened
up on them they replied with a vol-
ley then as the artillery joined in they
turned and fled to camp

they came straggling in hot and
sweaty from running and faint for
something to eat but the mexican con-
tingent had turned sullen and inhos-
b p

pitable and one campo after another
refused them food

  no tengo hey snarled big bill
mccafferty as a black chihuahuan
showed his hands and said he had no
food then what you call this-he
hefted a flour sack-and thisf and
he picked up a strip of jerked beef

  not cooked returned the mexi-
can his eyes burning with resentment
and bill grunted and went off with the
beef

  but the poor camps of the insurrec-
tos could not furnish food to the whole
legion even if the sulking peons had
willed and led by helge wahlgren
they headed for the commissary while
bogan rode over to montanos quarters
there were certain things which he de-
sired to know and others which he
wished to impart but a hair-trigger
atmosphere seemed to pervade the
place and montano sent out word he
was busy

  well you tell him im hungry an-
swered bogan fretfully but fume as
he would he could get no audience
until at last gambolier appeared

  general montano he announced
is engaged with very important busi-
ness and must under no circumstances
be disturbed

  oh said beanie forgetting his
hunger to give vent to an accumulation
of spleen in connection with the ad-
vance on chulita 

  the advance lied gambolier has
been abandoned for the present and
by the way he spoke up hastily are
those your men over there go and
tell them to leave that commissary alone
or i will report them to general mon-
tano

  bogan looked over his shoulder to
where the foreign legion was surging
up against the door ojthe commissary
and then he turned to gambolier

  no he replied those are your
men mr gambolier and i thought
general montano was busy

  a crash from the adobe which
served as commissary was followed by
a rush through the doorway but as the
americans swarmed in the lazy mex-
ican camp became suddenly a seething


the vovulatr magazine

ants nest from every camp fire the
envious insurrectos who had been
watching the legion from afar leaped
up and ran toward them waving guns
and brandishing pistols while the
americans stood on the defensive as
beanie spurred over and tried to quell
the riot a fist fight broke out at the
door and only the arrival of espinosos
cavalry prevented a resort to arms
the americans starved and ugly were
in no mood to take dictation and even
after espinoso had dispersed the mob
they maintained their stand at the com-
missary gringo hater that he was
there was small hope indeed that
prickly pete could arrest them with-
out a battle and a war of words was
bringing them rapidly toward that goal
when montano himself appeared

  under ordinary circumstances he
was smiling and unruffled but now by
the look in his eyes as he shoved his
way through the crowd it was evident
that his patience was exhausted they
were blazing with anger and as the
troops opened before him he confronted
the sullen legion

  come out of that house he or-
dered tremulously come out of it
every one of you

 the americans slunk out some
dropping their loot others brazenly
tucking food inside their shirts and
montano regarded them sternly

  sergeant bo-gan he commanded
turning to the shamefaced beanie who
had joined his renegade followers you
will order your men to lay down their
arms and march under guard to their
quarters

 they aint my men answered
beanie disrespectfully and ill lay
down my arms for no man colonel
gambolier is in command of the for-
eign legion and you can give your or-
ders to him he hooked his thumb
in the slack of his belt and surveyed
espinoso and his bandits with scorn
ive resigned he declared and they
aint mexicans enough in mexico to
make me give up my gun

  as prickly pete and his band of
outlaws spoke only the pelado of the
sierras the boldness of this statement

escaped them and gambolier made
haste to intervene

  the foreign legion he announced
in formal tones is hereby disbanded
and dishonorably discharged for will-
ful insubordination you will stack
your arms and within one hour de-
part from the borders of mexico

  a murmur of dismay and then of
protest burst forth from the ranks of
the deserters and then big bill mc-
cafferty stepped forth

  id like to ask sir he said coming
to attention and saluting what act of
insubordination you mean ive a per-
sonal reason for not wishing to cross
and im sure ive meant no disre-
spect

  big bills personal reason was the
moral certainty of being arrested and
imprisoned as a deserter but gambolier
had suffered too much in the past to be
moved by pity now

  it was the order of general mon-
tano he answered stiffly that pend-
ing the peace negotiations no attack
should be made upon fronteras but
for the second time upon your return
to camp this morning the members of
the foreign legion have seen fit to
disobey this command and for that rea-
son you are dishonorably discharged
what youll bobtail us for fight-
ing demanded mccafferty in a fury
well to blazes with an outfit like
that i can take these byes here and
stand off the whole ahrrmy of you and
then to git a dis-honorable dis-charge 
he picked up his gun and started for
the river and the mexicans prudently
gave way but in an instant lie was
back again clamoring

 i want me pay he demanded
fiercely four hundred and fifty dol-
lars for the two months and more that
ive served

  yes and me bellowed a great
voice and helge wahlgren stepped
forward with his little eyes glinting
you pay me or i dont know what
i do 

  he wagged his huge head at every
word and the crowd stood clamoring
at his back but beanie bogan sat his
horse and smiled
the solvies way



  theyll never get it he muttered
to whittle and fixed his shrewd eyes
on gambolier ahr you rabbit-
footed coward he cursed under his
breath you slick mexicanized das-
tard  i know who framed this up
but god help poor pepe if he lets you
do the thinking for him prickly pete
will be chief in a week come on
whit weve got our ten thousand
what say if we skip across the bridge
and get arrested  inquired whit-
tle despondently

  well let em arrest responded
beanie ill get you out of jail come
ahead

  no i-id rather not replied
whittle and bogan looked him straight
in the eyes

  say lookee here he said be a
man or a mouse dont let that geezer
pedley worry you ill run him out of
town so danged quick and easy he wont
know wheres he at and then you jump
in and cop out the lady and get this
thing off your chest

  no ive decided not to go back
answered whittle firmly and beanies
argument was cut short by a yell from
iviccafferty that made the horses jump

  wan dollar he shouted starting
back from the doorway where mon-
tano stood surrounded by his guard
wan dollar you owe me four hun-
dred and fifty

  that is all i have now answered
montano firmly and you can take it
or nothing at ail you have engaged
in mutiny and refused to surrender
your arms and for that reason you
have forfeited your pay

  nah ye dont threatened mccaf-
ferty but as he whipped up his gun
twenty rifles were leveled at his breast
there was a tense anxious silence as
americans and mexicans cocked their
guns and stood waiting the attack but
no shot was fired and as big bill looked
around him he saw that the legion had
lost

  well gimme my money he grum-
bled sulkily and to blazes with you
mexicans anyhow

  very well replied montano now
quietly smiling you may march by and

receive your pay and in order to show
i have no hard feeling against you i
wtill throw in a nice pair of socks

  ahr yes thankee returned mc-
cafferty with a gleam in his eye i
wore out a pair last night

chapter xii

under the old flag

  badly shaken by their misfortune
which would mean a penal term for
some of them the dishonorably dis-
charged foreign legion took their dol-
lars and filed dolefully down to the
river it was a mystery to them still
how montano could dispense with them
the only trained fighting men he had-
and obtained at such a cost in prom-
ises-and the shock had left them
dumb but at the edge of the stream
big bill stopped

  what are you going to do bill 
asked sullivan as mccafferty sat down
on the bank and big bill thrust out his
lip

  im going to try on me new socks
he said that i won at the battle of
fronteras

  ill go you one better grinned sul-
livan sociably im going to wash me
feet

  sure theres no hurry at all re-
sponded big bill glumly its judge
duffy and the mill for us the moment
we cross the bridge why not take a
swim farther down the river away
from this crowd of rubbernecks and
maybe on the road we can think up
some way to kape from being rail-
roaded to leavenworth

  lets go down to the dam pro-
posed sullivan jumping up and soon
like a band of schoolboys the whole
legion was preparing for a swim they
went in by relays for pedro espinoso
was watching them with a jealous eye
and when they had eaten a few oranges
and apples that admiring americans
had thrown across the stream they sat
down to discuss ways and means the
situation was desperate for every one
of them for there were few indeed
who could safely cross the river and
their hour of grace was up already


the vovular magazine

prickly pete had deployed his cavalry
to prevent their return to camp and it
was an open question whether he would
not advance and force them to leave
mexican soil

  lets go down and join the fed-
erals suggested the impractical sulli-
van and come back and clean out the
bunch

  veil i tell you what i vill do
agreed helge despondently i kill that
feller espinoso if he comes

  yes thats right spoke up me-
cafferty weve took enough from
him im going to shoot him right
through the hat but look whos com-
ing with that american flag that we
went off and left at the house yeh
old beanie bogan he went on rais-
ing his voice insultingly that re-
cruited us for ten dollars a head
theys no troubles for him hes
squared himself already while we poor
divils must go to the mill

  ahr you talk too much retorted
beanie from the distance didnt i
warn youse guys not to shoot at them
outposts  well whats the use of
crabbing at me when you brought it all
on yourselves 

  he rode up before them with whit-
tle close behind and struck the shaft
of the flag into the dirt

  theres your flag he said that
those young ladies give you to place on
the cuartel of fronteras but now by
judas you aint got no flag nor coun-
try and montano sends you this thing
back he motioned toward the flag
which was a large american standard
with a mexican flag fastened across
its center thats a whale of a flag
he went on bitterly neither one
thing nor yet the other and we might
have made it famous but no you
shanty irish had to have the run of
everything and now youve got the
straight kick montano says to tell
you to get across that river or hell
come down and put you across
yes he will said mccafterty lay-
ing hold of his rifle and jacking up a
cartridge viciously

  i tried to make a talk boys con-
tinued bogan apologetically but gam-

bolier has got us in bad hes told
old pepe that therell never be any
peace as long as theres an irishman
in camp and im canned along with
the rest

  serves you right growled mc-
cafferty what you going to do now 
cant you work it for us to join the
federals 

  in the graveyard yes answered
beanie sarcastically aint we burned
all their bridges twice 

  well what can we do  demanded
big bill frankly i aint a-going
across until dark

  so ye say returned bogan but
look here whos coming like a bat out
of hell get behind the bank boys
and let me do the talking its nothing
but prickly pete

  he whirled his horse and swung in
behind his men as espinoso came dash-
ing toward them the bandit chief
was mounted upon a shining golden
sorrel that he had stolen from some
ranch injiis raids and as he reined in
before them a shower of gravel was
thrown out by its plowing hoofs

  pigs of gringos  he cursed in his
low pelado and swinging down from
his saddle he hurled their flag into
the dirt a torrent of threats and abu-
sive epithets accompanied this astound-
ing assault and then jimmy sullivan
leaped fearlessly out and caught the
flag from the ground

  you leave that alone you dirty
greaser  he shrieked as he planted it
on the bank and for a moment they
stood bristling both yelling at once like
a pair of fighting dogs

  oh you dont like it hey barked
sullivan you dont like it even with
this on it well how will that do
and with venomous swiftness he tore
off the mexican flag were ameri-
cans  he cried and theres the old
flag and well fight for it until we
die

  he waved it in the air and a rousing
cheer rose up from the downcast amer-
icans a moment before they had been
refugees and suppliants desiring noth-
ing more than to remain there on suf-
ferance until they could slink across
the soudiews way



the river in the dark but now in an
instant they were caught up by the con-
tagion and they cheered for the flag
they had served

  one caranibn shrilled espinoso
drawing his pistol in a fury and then
bogan rode in on him with his gun

  here none of that he said
jumping his horse against him and
holding his six-shooter upon him he
talked to him in spanish the wild
staring eyes of the bandit suddenly
widened and he slavered at the mouth
with rage then wheeling his horse
he thundered back to camp raising the
war cry to summon his band

   into the river yelled bogan grab-
bing sullivan by arm and leg and hurl-
ing him into the stream and swim
if you dont want to get shot

  sullivan came up sputtering then
cooled by the water he turned and
struck out across the river it was
narrow at this point just above the low
dam but hardly had he made a start
when lashing his horse at the head of
his troops espinoso came charging
back

  get under the bank ordered bo-
gan quickly and every man of the forty
americans dropped down and shoved
out his gun now hold your fire until
i give the word and beanie stood
erect behind them

   espinoso came up like a thunderbolt
and at sight of his menacing pistol
sullivan dived and was lost to sight
but there were others interested besides
the mexicans and the legion-there
were the american soldiers on the other
side of the river they had come out
in force at the first sign of trouble and
now as jimmy sullivan disappeared
beneath the waves they jerked up their
rifles and challenged

  dont you shoot they warned in
a chorus and espinoso lowered his gun
it was borne in upon him suddenly
that if he shot at the fugitive the
american soldiers would shoot at him
and even in his anger he was human
he knew that the americans could
shoot straight and he knew also that
he could not and so he curbed his rage
jimmy sullivan came to the surface and

ducked like a seal and the next time
he appeared he had floated to the dam
and was under the guns of his friends

  aha you dirty greaser he
screamed back at espinoso and then
turned and dodged behind the guard
but foiled though he was by the escape
of one recreant prickly pete still saw
a chance for revenge the insulter of
the mexican eagle had fled from his
just punishment but the foreign
legion was left he turned to where
they crouched beneath the stars and
stripes and demanded in a tantrum
that the flag be torn down and as the
men of the legion defied him to touch
it his battle rage seemed to pass all
bounds yet here again he was facing
americans the picked fighting men of
their kind and it needed but a glance
to convince the most confident that in
a clash it would go hard with the mexi-
cans they were out in the open
mounted upon prancing horses and sur-
rounded by a mad crowd from the
camp while the americans were under
cover with their guns at a rest and
commanded bv the iron-faced bogan

 j	o

so in the pinch his nerve cracked and
when montano himself arrived the
american flag still waved iabove the
soil of mexico

  what is the meaning of this dis-
turbance  he demanded impatiently
after he had spurred his big bay
through the throng sergeant bo-gan
you were ordered out of mexico

  so i was returned bogan whoce
fighting blood was up but no low-
browed mexican pelao can come down
and put me out

  he glanced hatefully at espinoso as
he spat out the word pelao and
prickly pete responded with a rush

  ye-es youre bad taunted bogan
when the rush had been stayed but
you can get anything you want out
cf me

  what about this flag inquired
montano more pacifically after he had
listened to a tirade from espinoso
dont you know you are on mexican
soil

  yes sure we are admitted beanie
but after the deal we got from yem


the popular magazine

its a cinch were none of us mexicans
were american soldiers and theres
our flag and you can go as far as you
like 

  there was another long and heated
colloquy in which gambolier took the
lead and then montano spoke again

  may i ask as a favor he began
quite pleasantly that you take this
american flag across the river 

 yes sure you can returned
beanie politely but will you kindly
request mr espinoso to withdraw  i
dont want that highbinder to get it into
his nut that we give a cuss for him
once more with great argument the
conference was on and in the end es-
pinoso withdrew with him went his
cavalry and to save his face he drove
all the mexicans before him

  now sergeant bo-gan said mon-
tano firmly i will ask you and your
men to leave mexico

  all right general montano re-
plied beanie saluting well do that-
when we get good and ready

  very well answered montano
after gazing at him intently and rode
away to his camp

  and now burst out beanie as soon
as he was gone ill take this amer-
ican flag across the river its been
disgraced enough god knows by our
cussedness without being wallowed in
the dirt by no mexicans

  he caught up the flag which the
combined forces of montanos army

had not been able to cast down and
strode off with it down to the dam

  hey he called across to the seeth-
ing mass of sight-seers who had been
watching the drama from afar is
there a u s marshal over there  well
tell him to vamose and send out your
ranking noncom to take charge of the
national colors

  there was a rumble of laughter at
this soldiers jest and the sergeant of
the guard after taking off his shoes
waded out and received the colors in
mid-stream the great crowd of
americans roused to a frenzy of pa-
triotism by the gallant defense of the
flag gave way to cheer after cheer but
as bogan and his men were staging a
salute to the colors there was a volley
from the federal trenches in front of
fronteras rrrr-rap went the guns
like tearing a blanket and then bullets
began to splash into the river

  now what exclaimed bogan and
glancing swiftly down the stream he
saw a lone man on the mexican sky
line it was his partner bruce whittle
standing erect like a soldier and firing
back at the federals and running
swiftly toward him yet tottering in
his tight boots was the sore-footed
texas boy jackson

  here come back here yelled
bogan as his soldiers started off on
the run then plunging back to the
shore he grabbed up his gun and went
splashing through the water after them

yne of the leading industries of the printing business since the national guard

author of  white men and red  the two terwilligers  etc

the story of an oil-made man-to use his own declaration a stammer-
ing hesitant fellow but the gods flung him into the whirlpool of high finance

moss gowan gauger for the
midland oil company could
calculate almost offhand with
a piece of line and a cubic-con-
tents table the amount of petroleum
stored in a tank but when it came to
gauging an abstract proposition moss
was lost for instance in spite of what
the little schoolmaam up at lebec had
been telling him concerning the intrinsic
value of all the old-fashioned copy-
book precepts here was jerry lynch
suggesting that gowan permit him to
draw more oil than he paid for make
a falsified gaugers report to the office
and split the profits fifty-fifty there
was not much doubt that the hoary
precepts in question were sound on
the other hand there was no doubt at
all that lynch was generally respected
and was getting rich fast on sixty
dollars a month moreover it was per-
fectly apparent that even an honest
sober and industrious oil gauger could
never mairy a little schoolmaam

  gowans hesitant speech a reproduc-
tion of which on paper it would be
difficult indeed to contrive was a stand-
ing joke in the field he drawled now
contemplatively how much do you
-figure-lynch my half of this-
would come to-say 

  lynch cat-eyed sleek and furtive
answered with a running calculation
if i make two hundred barrels y un-
derstand on n average and y measure
me hundred eighty thats twenty bar-
rels at ninety cents s eighteen dollars
youd get nine not much moss but
itd make y bettern a hundred a year
and ill be buying more later maybe
twice that

  then about all-id have to do is-
some poor guessing-on the tanks-is
that it  moss asked

  lynch laughed sure and y un-
derstand gowan if midland was little
one-horse-power concern id never
suggest it what difference twenty
thirty barrels of oil a monthd make
th company  puh  he snapped his
fingers eloquently

  moss stretched one long leg well
-ill tell you lynch-how it is im
probably about as-crooked as any-
body show me a chance to clean up
-a few thousand now-and i might
could see it but a hundred a year-
no i guess maybe i could do just as
well-passing up your-proposition
im no-piker thats the-size of it

  lynch grunted its up t you
moss he said carelessly guess
youll change your mind

  maybe so the gauger replied and
turned to his daily report blanks at
the moment he thought the incident
closed but it kept coming back to him
lynchs suggestion was an easy one to
accept with small risk of discovery
by the office when a storage tank
was low it was the gaugers business
to notify the superintendent who
would order a well or two hooked on
and the tank pumped full again oil
wells fluctuate very much and no one
but the gauger himself could possibly
know how many barrels were run in
if by any chance his figures should
be checked up from the office he could
plead a mistake in calculation what
was more moss knew very well that
other gaugers and even some superin-
tendents had their little arrangements

it for instance that he had heard about
a fellow who knew a gauger who had
been tempted by such an offer-to see
what she would say about this sort of
small graft piking he called it but
what with one thing and another the
day flew and it was almost stage time
before he was ready to approach the
subject

  he was clearing the way to mention
it when the little schoolmaam inter-
rupted there  she exclaimed im
letting you go now without asking you
the most important sort of question
about that oil land you bought a year
or so ago have you sold it 

  he laughed no miss ellen-i
havent sold it-not yet did you-
think you might-want to buy it
not to-night no but uncle bert
wrote me from los angeles this week
he said he had a buyer for oil land
he expects me to let him know if i hear
of anything and i thought of you
did you now  the gaugers face
beamed youre the kind of a friend
but that twenty-acre piece-no i guess
it wouldnt-hardly do-not for any
friend of your uncles no-i know
it wouldnt jerry lynch-worked that
piece off on me-bought it for sixty
and then-turned around and sold it
to me for-a hundred-an acre that
is three weeks in the year its pretty
good-sheep pasture the rest of the
time it isnt even that miss ellen

  she sighed and made a face i
was hoping it might do moss but

of course if theres no oil under it-

  there isnt-not a drop under the
whole twenty acres im afraid

  well i knew you would tell me the
truth about it if you werent the
squarest man i ever knew moss i
wouldnt-like you so much

  moss gowan took off his hat and

wiped his forehead which was sud-
denly hot im not any-squarer than
--anybody i guess he stammered
painfully but im no piker dog-
gone it-there comes the stage ive
had a good time-ellen

  they shook hands formally although
a carping critic might have maintained
that the form required rather too much
time and was a trifle ardent on his part
at least but he made connections with
the stage by hurrying and the little
schoolmaam went back to her room
and wrote her uncle in full and her
aunt in confidence

  moss communed with himself all the
way into the fields that night alter-
nately congratulating himself on his
narrow escape from jeopardizing his
standing as the squarest man and
shaking his fist at the fate which made
honesty such a matrimony-forbidding
policy and when he arrived at his
boarding house found a note from
headquarters requesting his attendance
the next morning on the pleasure of
the general manager with many in-
nocent speculations as to the reason
for this polite command the gauger
reported at eight-thirty monday and
was shown in the general manager
a shrewd and clear-eyed young man
of fifty or fifty-five smiled at moss
in greeting and moss grinned in re-
turn

  hello gowan the boss said i
notice that this man jerry lynch has
just signed up with us for crude you
made him his first delivery last thurs-
day didnt you

  why as near as i can-remember
it was-about thursday yes sir
take your time gowan the man-
ager laughed weve got all morn-
ing what would you do i avonder if
you had to answer yes or no in a
rush to save your life did you ever
think of it

  moss grinned again and colored
well now- mr thatcher he drawled
i cant say i ever did-think about it
-much i suppose if i ever had to-
do a thing like that-though-i might

be able to-

  the manager leaned back and roared
ao pike



gowan he said breathing hard the
next time we need an expert witness
to kill time for us im going to put
our lawyers on to you the very next
time it would be a regular party
he had to stop and laugh again but
all his merriment was of such nature
that it seemed to take moss in on the
joke instead of making him the jokee
and the gauger whose principal assets
were brawny strength sound common
sense and an imperturbable good na-
ture laughed with him this put them
immediately on a pleasant friendly
footing

  dont you mind me gowan mr
thatcher said then i was asking you
about lynchs delivery i see you
turned him two hundred barrels

  i havent got my books here mr
thatcher-but as near as i-can rec-

ollect-that was somewhere about-

  sure there you go the manager
interrupted i ought to have known
better than to give you the chance
lets try an experiment gowan if
youll answer yes or no nothing else
not a word to my next three questions
ill buy you a box of cigars what do
you say  wait a minute now  what
do you say-yes or 

  moss opened his mouth as a matter
of fact to say well but thought bet-
ter of it gulped and said yes
fine youre on two more ques-
tions did lynch say anything to you
about giving him more oil than he paid
for and splitting the graft with you-
or anything that sounded even remotely
like that

  moss leaned back in his chair and
pulled a barley beard from his pants
leg he rolled it between his thumb
and finger a minute blinking then
he flushed redder gulped again and
blurted yes

  the manager delayed the inquisition
to laugh for a while i thought he
might gowan weve had some deal-
ings with him before now just be-
tween you and me man to man did
you take him up 

  the gaugers head whirled but he
brought his eyes around until they
looked into those of the genial boss

and he answered uncomfortably
no

  great young man you win both
ways the manager pressed a but-
ton his chief clerk appeared in the
doorway billy want you to send a
boy over to the palace for a box of
those cigars i smoke-you know em
give them to gowan here hes just
won a bet from me

  his assistant nodded yes sir
  and billy

  the clerk reappeared yes sir
wish youd send a memorandum
over to the treasurers office for me
too beginning the first of the month
well pay our gauger seventy a month
not as a reward of merit or anything
like that billy you understand

  no sir the clerk grinned

  not a bit of it my boy but just
because weve been neglecting to do it
for two months or more thats all
billy

ii

  the increased wage satisfied moss
gowan momentarily but as the weeks
passed he found himself no nearer the
culmination of his cherished plans for
the little schoolmaam than before by
employing mental arithmetic he was
able to compute the number of months
which would be required to save and
bank a thousand dollars supposing that
every pay day found him with an ac-
cumulation of twenty or twenty-five
dollars and the net result of the com-
putation was not heartening no
scrimping and saving alone would not
do he must plunge somewhere and
come out in funds he was no piker
was not moss gowan he recognized
his own weakness

  just to tantalize him it seemed a
chance was thrown in his way in jan-
uary to try his hand at speculation he
overheard a conversation between two
officers of the fortuna company which
indicated that that corporation was
anxious to dispose of an old sump filled
two years before with the overflow
from a gusher they had tapped moss
knew to a barrel how much crude
petroleum there was in this old reser-


the vovijlar magazine

voir and he knew that the figure the
two men decided on was ridiculously
low but it might have been lower by
some two or three ciphers before the
gauger could benefit from their reck-
lessness and with a deep sigh he gave
up the opportunity himself and took
it instead to his friend and employer
general manager thatcher of the mid-
land thatcher seized it in two
months he had drawn off and sold at
a good profit all of the oil he could
handle conveniently and then he sent
for moss

  im about through with that old
fortuna sump gowan he said briskly
have you noticed it lately

  well-yes sir i have the gauger
drawled thats a nasty emulsion
thats-left there-id say mean to
sell-isnt it now 

  it is gowan in fact its so mean
to sell that im going to give it to you
want it 

  well now mr thatcher moss
stammered confused i want it-yes
-but why do you-figure on giving it
to-anybody 

  i owe you a commission dont i
you told me about the sump in the
first place i made a good clean-up
now you can have whats left-if youd
like to see what you can do with it
if not ill make you out a check for
bringing the deal to my attention what
do you say  he laughed good-na-
turedly come now gowan yes or
no

  why ill tell you mr- yes
all right mind if i make a sug-
gestion 

 mind say mr thatcher you
know there isnt-anything you could

- moss stopped and swallowed

yes he said blinking

  the manager laughed youll learn
gowan he chuckled what i was
going to say was that you better borrow
a few lengths of that old four-inch cas-
ing back of our warehouse-you can
string it yourself nights and sundays
--and connect the sump with that little
layout of jerry lynchs get him to
heat the emulsion for you and then split
with him

 moss nodded i was sort of-
thinking of that-yes sir

  but watch lynch the manager
snapped hes so crooked that spa-
ghetti is the only food he can eat com-
fortably watch him and good luck
to you

  the gauger thanked him with pain-
ful slowness and that evening sought
lynch now owner of a small refinery
below the midland plant

  hello there moss the cat-eyed
man said shortly made your fortune
yet 

  gowan fresh from his lesson in brev-
ity said not yet but his sudden
break in a lifelong habit of speech up-
set him and he was compelled to stop
there so lynch said encouragingly
oh you havent eh whats on
yr mind then

  you know the fortuna sump mr
thatcher has been-selling off dont
you 

  yeh

  well you see i just-made a-
deal to take over the oil thats left-
in it

  lynch snorted the oil thats left
you mean the b s thats left b s
and mud and water thats all thatch-
ers left

  in oil terminology b s stands for
base sediment and comprises sand
gravel and foreign matters from which
the oil itself can only be separated by
treatment in a topping or refining plant
the worthy mr lynch was intimating
in his vernacular that the old fortuna
sump wasnt worth a great deal to its
new owner moss gowan nodded

  ive been figuring that there isnt a
powerful sight of crude in the-sump
lynch he agreed but prices are-
going up-and i can make a little-
cleaning-if i can heat that emulsion
-somehow i wras wondering now-

if youd want to--

  tlow much is there in it lynch
interrupted according to your fig-
ures 

  why i was estimating-about a
thousand barrels

  lynch grunted xoure a good ol
scout moss he said pleasantly but
no piker



yr heads weak wouldnt be three
hundred net n the whole deal tell
y what ill do-heat it for y and give
y quarter of the clean-up

  moss rose i guess ill go over-
to-morrow night and see-if i can get
a chance to talk to the-kern county
refining company good night
lynch

  the oil jobber frowned whats
your proposition then moss if y dont
like mine 

  i was thinking probably that-
youd be willing to-divide half and
half lynch but i wouldnt stand
around here and-waste my time talk-
ing about any-less

  ill get stung lynch groaned i
always do how y going t move that
stuff down to th plant 

  well now i had a notion--
moss stopped recalling his coaching in
brevity id pipe it he barked

  buv pipe youre crazy wi the
heat

  no i wasnt counting on-buy-
ing- but ill get the pipe lynch

-and lav it

all right go ahead gowan its
robbery but ill treat the oil for half
thought you would moss replied
slowly ill be over again to-mor-
row

  he did return the next afternoon
presenting for mr jerry lynchs sig-
nature a carefully worded contract
drafted by a lawyer the refiner
squirmed a good deal at this further
proof of the gaugers astuteness but
he affixed his crabbed john henry in
the end and on saturday moss rented
a horse borrowed a wagon and strung
his pipe along the ground from the
sump to the refinery whenever he was
off duty thereafter he worked at laying
it with one helper and ten days later
his oil began running into lynchs
storage it was a disagreeable and very
slow task to coax the mixture of sand
water and oil out of the reservoir but
moss was resourceful manager
thatcher loaned him a wheezy old
pump good-humored fellows provided
slathers of advice and an occasional
valuable helping hand and at last the

old fortuna sump was as dry as a bone
the lynch refinery did its part as the
exigencies of other contracts permitted
moss checked the whole run closely
and the day came for a settlement

  jerry lynch was grouchy whatd
y make your share moss r he asked
when the account was tabulated in the
refinery office

  moss countered i figured that
youd-probably have it down lynch
he drawled

  well i have the other snapped
defensively our statement makes
your cut six-ninety-four

  much to his relief moss brightened
thats what i call-pretty good
lynch the gauger said i hadnt
expected-quite that much it pays-
well enough now i should say-for
what i did to-get it if i could make

money that easy-all the time-

  jerry lynch who had shaved quite
a neat little sum from gowans share
and had applied it to his own use and
profit began to regret that he had not
taken more with that regret was born
the idea of recouping even at this late
date there was no time to concoct
ways and means but in general a plan
mapped itself out for him

  trouble with you gowan he said
thereupon is that y keep yr nose to
th grindstone an dont look around
sharp fellow like you ought t make
three four hundred a month in this
field fact look at me-easy a thou-
sand twelve times a year

  moss gowan sighed i dont doubt
that lynch he drawled but if i
was to go-speculating around the way
you do it wouldnt be long before id
have a job making m own bed in the
-poorhouse i cant figure money in
-small chunks-and i never seem to
be-around vhen theres anything like
a-thousand or two-rolling uphill
im no piker-but all i ever have 
me-is small change

 piker lynch expostulated
thats the trouble with you moss
got no pep y want to mix around
more-meet people-spend a little
take this seven hundred now

  what do ou mean lynch 


the popular magazine

  mean roll it up in a bundle of
ones a twenty on th outside buy
yrself some class-clothes hat cigars
put on some dog that way any min-
ute-bump into a chance 

 you mean-you think i might run
across somebody maybe who would let
me in-on a good thing lynch if i
thought that-- 

  tell y what y do moss the clever
one interrupted hit with an inspiration
get satday off and come with me
well go int bakersfield buy some
clothes spread ourselves keep an
eye open and if we happen to hit
the right pace-bango right like
that

  saturday moss questioned slowly
i had been thinking maybe id-catch

the lebec stage- but come to think

of it again i suppose now lynch that
youve got about the right idea id
like to-sort of try it once we might
-ring the bel eh

  absolutely th lives ones re al-
ways loose satday nights kick in
with em play up to em show em
youre there ill introduce y-make
em believe youve got a million more
where this comes from all you got

  none o this cheap small-town stuff
y know if you only want t spent
twenty cents better stay out here n

sure i do moss drawled confi-
dently you dont need to worry about
that lynch if i go in to-make a
noise-ill make a regular noise you
leave it to me lynch-im no piker 

iii

   there are some bell boys who will
do anything for money probably there
are others who will not but it may
be asserted without successful fear of
contradiction as dick culver says that
no one of that sophisticated fraternity
will forgive you the supreme sin of for-
getting to fee them at all this pro-
found philosophical observation is es-
sential here because it was the revenge

of a mere bell hop on mr abel f
feather of erie pennsylvania for the
offense referred to that brings this new-
comer into the story mr feather was
not penurious nor was he poverty-
stricken  he merely failed to drop a
gratuity into the hands of one henry
of the staff of the malta hotel in
bakersfield mainly because he was
worried and anxious over his failure to
connect with an oil magnate he had
crossed the continent to meet not
knowing this henry was wroth

  having telegraphed and telephoned
and paced the floor and asked at the
desk innumerable times on this partic-
ular evening mr feather finally
snapped his fingers to attract the bell
boys attention and summoned him to
his side

  yes sir henry said suavely
thinking of his grievance but masking
it adroitly with a blank and babylike
stare

  son mr feather said crisply
ive come here from the east to do
some business with an oil man named
graham from los angeles havent
been able to locate him fie ought to
be here before i go to bed i wish
youd take one last look around ill
wait

  certainly sir the boy said and
scribbled the two names on a card ill
page him sir

  cruel as it may be to relate it henry
not only did not page mr graham but
he had no intention of doing so once
out of sight of mr feather he put the
card in his pocket twiddled his thumb
mockingly at the end of his nose and
ran down a corridor to the kitchen
where he knew that a friendly waiter
could be depended on to produce an
ownerless piece of pie on demand one-
half of the cut had already disappeared
when the bell boy asked casually

  whos poppin the joy corks in the
private dining room frenchy

 the waiter grinned meester
gowan-friends of meester leench
fife bottle zey haf open-tree more
is ice verr good sport meester
gowan

 gowan eh henry repeated
no piker



never heard of him any class
frenchy 

  but no he will have all ze waiter
drcenk wis zem he will have any
guests what come already zat two-
card sharp fellers feenck and joe
brown invite in bourgeois

  bushwah eh  all right frenchy
im not here much bliged the
bell boy finished the pie with a gulp
and strolled out in the corridor he
doubled back ran up a flight of stairs
and in a narrow hallway applied his
ear to the panels of the door of the
private dining room what he heard
were the voices of four men uplifted
in merry chatter over a well-wined
meal the smooth voice of one of the
gamblers broke in with a carefully
worded tale of a huge fortune made
at poker a few nights before by a nov-
ice henry the bell boy was more or
less familiar with the ways and wiles
of joe- brown and he was now in-
formed that the first steps were being
taken to interest a victim in a little
game having satisfied himself to
this extent he knocked softly and then
opened the door and called to jerry
lynch lynch rose and met him

  now what buttinsky the refiner
asked crossly

  excuse me mr lynch the boy
said winking one eye wisely you dont
happen to know if mr graham is here
in the house do you 

  lynch stepped outside and closed the
door whats up kid  he asked

  henry lowered his voice noth-
ing he said innocently enough
only theres a man downstairs whos
from erie pennsylvania and who
packs real alligator-skin bags he
came to fix up a deal with graham
the big oil man and graham hasnt
shown i thought maybe you might
know where mr grahamd be here
me  lynch demanded what

in----- but wait a minute come to

tlvink of it i guess i know this man
whats his name

  feather erie pennsylvania
yeh feather know him--slightly
tell him friend of grahamss up here
send him up and then forget it

  jerry lynch handed the clever bell
boy a silver dollar henry disappeared
satisfied with himself and lynch re-
turned to the dining table

  joe he said abruptly to the gam-
bler you mustnt forget that engage-
ment of yours sorry to see you n
finck leave us but busnesss busness
its ten clock now night

  brown rose scowling and finck fol-
lowed him lynch handed them their
hats smilingly see you to-morrow
anyhow he said mr gowans go-
ing to be in town sevral days so
long

  they went throwing black looks on
him but he paid no attention at all
when they were outside the door he
returned swiftly to moss gowan

  look here moss he snapped i
guess were in luck fellow here from
east to close some kind of oil deal i
expect with graham of los an-
geles graham isnt in bakersfield its
our chance you follow my lead see 
dont play till i kick yr shins get
me 

  moss gowan nodded i get you-
all right lynch he drawled but
i dont know-graham you dont
know-this man from the east-do
you whats the main-idea

  i dont know you poor simp wait
till he comes then play him if hes
got money to invest whats use giving
it to graham cn y tell me that well
invest it for him wont we  i should
say we would lay off-here he
comes

  mr feather entered on the word
looking somewhat puzzled but eager to
have news he extended a card to
jerry lynch who met him cordially
one glance at the strangers pasteboard
which was engraved and which bore
in one corner the legend lake shore
rolling mills heightened his cordiality
measurably

  well well mr feather lynch
said offering his hand youre just n
time meet mr gowan-friend of
grahams were mixed up with gra-
ham n business feather-all oil men
together y see have a chair

  lynchs wits were nimble and he


the popular magazine

was as nimble as his wits in a mo-
ment the stranger had shaken hands
with moss gowan had been seated and
had found a glass of sparkling wine
thrust in his hand in another moment
a clean place had been made for him
and there was food spread there in
another the first of the food was in his
mouth half a goblet of wine had
reached its destined internal recess
warming him and lynch was saying
cheerfully

  sorry y missed our friends brown
and finck they just left directors
meeting plaguey nuisance little more
wine  there  waiter a napkin
good well what d y think f cali-
fornia 

  mr feather replied when he could
that he had been too busy trying to
locate mr graham to think about the
glorious golden state as yet had no
doubt though that he would like it
if this was a fair sample of its hos-
pitality was sure he would wanted
to get into the oil game in fact had
come west to meet graham and ac-
complish that very purpose

  lynch filled the guests glass and
filled the glass of moss gowan gra-
ham s good man to tie to feather he
said breezily only one better thats
mr gowan here but if you get any
of gowans oil properties away from
him feather have to rise early and
stay up late no business now though
-pleasure first

  moss gowan chafing somewhat at
lynchs voluble fiction saw his first
opportunity to edge in he tried to
take it in his characteristic drawl i
guess mr feather you expected to
meet-mr graham-here he began
and didnt-do it now  did you-
ask around-

  lynch interrupted with a laugh of
course he did moss he said brusquely
seems t me graham said something
th other day bout you from erie
didnt you say

  yes having neglected in his
anxiety over his appointment to eat
supper mr feather was attacking the
viands placed before him with gusto
not unaware of the fact that they were

costly dishes ordered recklessly as re-
gards expense and quantity and at the
same time was consuming a rather
large amount of sparkling liquids of a
diversified and heady quality he had
answered with a full mouth yes-
from erie great town been there
mr gowan

  the gauger nodded ive been-
through there he drawled and then
grinned that was in the old-days
when all the freight cars had-brake
beams

  the easterner dropped knife and
fork and stared you dont mean
to say you came west that way
lynch interrupted mr feather
on yr right y have one of our most
self-made men-air moss gowan
born poor no education kicked out int
th world at age of seven tramped
wfest broke int oil busness-and now
look at him

  gowan nodded well yes he said
slowly coloring i guess oil has made
me-what i am all right but you

mustnt-get the notion-

  there jerry lynch broke in hur-
riedly now hes going to spoil it all
feather he leaned closed to the vis-
itor and lowered his voice tell y
avhat it is-theres the most modest man
n america beside moss gowan i
tell y colonel house of texas and
washington district of ccflumbia is a
regular notoriety seeker fact dont
pay any attention to him feather
he leaned still closer and this time
dropped to a whisper reglar clam
that man gowan he mumbled
couldnt get him to boost himself ny
more n y could to boost s own prop-
erties ask him about that twenty-acre
patent of his up in north end ask
him--see what lie says 

  mr feathers eyes brightened
twenty-acre patent he whispered
in return oil land 

  biggest piece of undeveloped oil
land in the fields but ask him

  moss had caught the purport of the
conversation he had also caught the
drift of jerry lynchs project

  when feather turned to him there-
fore with an abrupt request for in-
no piker



formation about the twenty-acre piece
of patented land moss owned the lat-
ter said characteristically  oh that 
well now mr feather-i dont know
as fd-advise anybody to-take that
piece up there may be-oil under it
-and there may not be

 jerry lynch slapped his knee
didnt i tell you he demanded of
feather see  modest--why moss
cowan makes a shrinking violet look
like it was yelling fr the spotlight dont
he ask him some more 

  the easterner whose sense of his
own limitations were half drowned in
a little sea of liquors complied readily
enough manipulated to a queens taste
by the adroit jerry lynch he found
himself first interested in this twenty
acres then wishful for it then greedy
to buy it and by midnight becoming
irascible and peevish at moss gowans
obstinate attitude of depreciation
lynch warmed to his work feather
warmed to his liquor the cat-eyed
promotor leaned over to moss gowan

  now boob  he growled sinking his
fingers into the gaugers knee get
busy get going heres yr chance
lets see if youre a piker

iv

  late in the afternoon of the next day
moss gowan sitting disconsolate and
remorseful in his hotel room his head
in his hands and a large roll of bills
lying accusingly on the floor under his
eyes was jerked out of a reverie by a
knock at the door

  well come in  he drawled wear-
ilv

  a bell boy opened the door lady
to see you in the parlor mr gowan
he said

a-what lady to see-me

  yes sir said she wouldnt send a
card

  moss picked up the greenbacks and
stuffed them into his pocket then he
took a long plaintive look at himself
in the mirror on the bureau and fol-
lowed the boy in the parlor trim and
neat and pretty sat the little school-
maam

  well now moss stammered com-
pletely taken aback this is a regular
sure-enough-surprise on me-miss
ellen how did you-manage to get
-this far from home 

  she laughed quite pleased with his
amazement this is teachers insti-
tute week moss ive come up to be
as gay as a schoolmaam can for seven
whole days i didnt expect to find you
in bakersfield though and moss
what is it-miss ellen 

  how stylish we are forevermore
turn around and a striped vest and
a necktie rivaling the rainbow  moss
gowan are you going to be married 
moss turned colors to shame his tie
oh now miss ellen he pleaded
just because i had to-have a few
new clothes-and things and went out

and-bought them- but theyre not

on my mind im not going to be-
married-not yet anyhow-but im in
trouble

  the capable young lady eyed him
shrewdly you look it moss lets
sit down there now  sit back and
take it easy thats better now
whats the trouble 

  i ought to be-ashamed to tell you
-i guess he began hesitatingly it
was all because i-let lynch fool me-
and i fooled myself-and between us
somehow last night we-fooled this
mr feather

  mr feather yes

  well ive got to let-some one
know about it-and ill give you the-
whole mess lynch and i cleaned up
on that sump of oil mr thatcher-
gave me-and my share was seven hun-
dred dollars lynch said-if id come
into bakersfield and-spend a little of
it i might meet some-some live ones
--he called them-and make easy
money-the way-he does he talked
me into it-i guess it wasnt very hard
work-because i thought i ought to
be-smart enough to make more than
-seventy a month

  she laughed again you werent
starving though moss-even on as lit-
tle as seventy dollars a month

  no he said gulping thats true
-too but you see-if i had a little


the populmz magazine

put away--i might-we might-that is
if you-well thats not the story
certainly not she smiled go
on 

  well i let moss-fit me up-this
way and we had a supper here in the
hotel last night had a private dining
room-things to eat id never heard
of-and wine and that sort of thing
i was wise to-that is i saw what
lynchs game was he introduced me
to a couple of gamblers first-i sup-
pose his idea must have been to-get
me into a game-and maybe win my
money but right in the middle of that
-here comes this mr feather

  another gambler  she interrupted
moss shook his head then grinned
not a regular-one he drawled
no he was from erie pennsylvania
-was looking for mr graham from
los angeles-theyd planned to meet
here lynch made out that we were
-friends of grahams-partners maybe
-i dont know mr feather-hes a
nice old gentleman too miss ellen-
well he had quite a little to-to drink
i did too-but my capacity sort of--
fooled lynch the point is though
that lynch worked feather-and
worked rne i sold him that no-account
twenty acres-of mine-for ten thou-
sand dollars-and he gave me two thou-
sand cash

  moss gowan the little school-
maam cried aghast

  i know he said weakly but that
isnt the worst as soon as i got up
this morning i-went to feather told
him it was all-a mistake-tried to
make him take his money back no
use-lynch had been there first
lynch  she snapped with infinite
disdain

  yes-hed been telling mr feather
that i-might regret selling and want to
-back out so feather wouldnt-talk
to me just laughed i cant find
lynch-and-the way i feel now
maybe its just as well-i cant

  she sat thinking for several minutes
then suddenly she brightened you
said this erie man had come to meet
some one-mr graham was it

  yes-s c graham-hes a big in-
dependent operator from los angeles
is mr graham here

  he wasnt here-last night mr

feather said but he might-

  certainly she interrupted deci-
sively he may have come to-day
he will come sooner or later prob-
ably the thing for you to do is to
go to him and tell him the whole story
fess up and get him to warn mr
feather and to make him take back his
money

  say miss ellen he blurted his
face lighting thats the-ticket ill
try-right now will you wait-here
a minute

  ell wait

  moss took the stairs in leaps his
agitation made his speech abrupt the
desk clerk nodded to his question

  mr graham just came in by ma-
chine-two or three hours ago shall
i send him a card

  moss scribbled his name on a blank
and waited impatiently the boy re-
turned shortly to say that mr gowan
was to come up to the oil kings room
moss went charging shown in he
stopped abruptly with his jaw drop-
ping for the first man he saw one
of two seated at a small table poring
over a map of the west-side fields was
his own boss general manager
thatcher of the midland oil com-
pany

  hello gowan thatcher said
smiling and putting out a hand come
in how did you know i wanted to see
you this is mr graham

  the oil baron nodded and shook
hands sit down gowan 

  the gauger gulped thanks he
said but i guess id better stand
maybe-because i could get out-
easier i played a-a joke on your
friend mr feather from pennsylvania
-last night-and i dont know how

  feather graham interrupted
what do you know about him  i
was afraid id missed him infernal
tangle in los angeles-delayed me two
days is feather still in bakersfield
general manager thatcher inter-
no piker



rupted with a laugh come come
gowan sit down and tell us about it
suppose i give you another box of
cigars to make it short can you win 
moss flushed swallowed hard arid
nodded ill try-yes he said ex-
plosively and proceeded to relate as
briefly as he could and as rapidly what
had developed at the personally con-
ducted party of the previous night and
he did not spare himself at all nor at-
tempt to incriminate jerry lynch

  so you see he concluded heavily
ive got feathers money and he says
-he dont care whether im-a partner
of s c grahams or of-j p mor-
gans-hes not going to let me out of
-my bargain

  to his utter amazement both the men
who had been holding themselves in
during his recital burst into a roar of
laughter as he finished the more they
laitghed the more difficult it appeared
to be for them to recover from their
merriment discomfited but hopeful
moss gowan watched them uncom-
prehending at last the oil baron so-
bered down wiping his eyes

  gowan he said if we were all
as much worried over taking other peo-
ples money as you are a lot of busi-
ness men would close up shop to ward
off melancholia ill tell you what
youve done for me without knowing
it-youve kept feather busy and
amused when he was on the verge of
leaving for san francisco this morning
he wired me that much last night hes
around somewhere now im sure give
me the money he paid you and dont
lose any more sleep about selling him
a gold brick is that all right

  is it moss cried diving into an
inner pocket for the bills its nearer
all right--mr graham-than anything
that ever happened to me he gave
me two thousand-down-and there it
is thats my-last promoting-be-
lieve me 

  good high finance dont seem to
be your main line for a fact but
theres another little matter mr
thatchers been telling me about you
and ive got a proposition sit down
again

  b p

  moss gowan sat down on the edge
of a chair and listened for five min-
utes gulping now and then when he
was dismissed he went out walking on
air on the stairs he met mr abel
frederick feather of erie pennsyl-
vania accompanied by mr jerry
lynch moss stopped

  hello mr feather he said as
steadily as he could mr graham just
got in from-los angeles and is up
there-room two-eleven he wants
to see you i thought youd like-to
know

  feather nodded thanks gowan 
thanks ill go right up ive just been
out with your friend mr lynch look-
ing at that piece of land you sold me
lynch has shown me the oil belt-
guess you cant talk me into backing
out now not now ill see you later

  the easterner hurried up the stairs
buoyantly jerry lynch watching him
out of sight turned to moss with an
elaborate wink well moss he said
with unmasked glee i told y wed
land em when we got out among the
live uns didnt i tell you now be-
fore he changes his mind how bout
splitting that little roll eh 

  moss gowan tried to answer but his
words came too slowly action came
much more easily he reached for the
coat collar of mr jerry lynch he
heaved the oil jobber from the floor
as though he had been a bag of meal
he swung him about nicely calculated
distance and speed and kicked mr
lynch hit the twelfth stair down
bounced to a landing rolled over twice
struck every fourth stair below as reg-
ularly as though he had practiced the
evolution and brought up at the bot-
tom with his head in a waste-paper bas-
ket and one foot in a bucket of mop
water

  gowan whistling contemplatively
turned up the stairs again toward the
parlor assistant superintendent he
said thoughtfully and slowly a hun-
dred and fifty-a month-to start with 
i wonder if miss ellen likes-this mis-
sion kind of-furniture-or what they
call-fumed oak ill have to ask her

aridity

there is every indication that the entire united states will be dry territory
within five years at the most with liquor as taboo nationally as cocaine

individual differences will not matter-the flood tide of prohibition has
        swept too far to be checked

    of the twenty-five hundred and forty-three counties in the whole country
twenty-three hundred and thirty are  the dry list leaving only two hundred and
thirteen counties where liquor can be bought openly these figures include in-
diana which will close its saloons in 

    bryans proposition of making prohibition the democratic battle cry in 
is logical of the twenty-three states dry at the last election seventeen went for
wilson two others ran close and four of the other states carried by woodrow
had practically been won over by the drys

    whisky was an inseparable part of the old west there it got its favorite
nicknarnes-hardware redeye nose paint and third rail sixteen of
the twenty-two western states are now dry as a covered bridge and the west
will be solid prohibition territory long before the east

    twenty-six states are now dry or pledged that way ten more in the dry
column will make possible the constitutional amendment threatened by the tem-
perance people

the credit problem

quick conversion of liabilities into assets has always been the main credit
problem of the american business man

some of the modern corporations are run on such a close margin
that their profits come mostly from discounting their bills when a busi-
ness takes two per cent off for ten days and then has to wait ninety days or
more before the customer sends his check a needless amount of capital must be
kept for juggling purposes or else the business man becomes embarrassed and
has to run to the bank and pay several times what a loan is actually worth

    in germany a merchant needing cash can take his books to the bank and
get cash on accounts due him the bank deducting a discount from the total amount
due as its commission the account then becomes payable to the bank instead of
the man from whom purchase was originally made
caught in the net



    germans money system for years has been so elastic that american fur
importers who purchase stocks in leipzig are given a whole year in which to pay
their bill

    it simmers down to the fact that the german business man can buy money
just as he would go to a store and buy flour or tacks

    our new federal reserve board is rapidly working into a similar func-
tion-by its discounting of commercial paper through member banks in sub-
stance it is much like the german system the person or business that owes
the money indorses a bill the same as if it were a note and the bank discounts and
advances on it this is not generally known for the working is limited to the
very few who have charge of handling credits in the various business concerns
the discounting and rediscounting of commercial paper is growing tremendously
in volume

    the immediate result will be that capital will be used three times where it
was used only once under the old system money is cheaper and more active
as a business dynamo no matter how eager people are to work there must be
money the medium of exchange to turn on the current that permits activities
to begin and go through to completion making money work three hours a day
instead of one is a mighty good proposition

   this process of discounting commercial paper is one of the features referred
to when bankers speak of the federal reserve banks making the money system
more elastic money panics appear to be ended for good while bankers can
still hoard the gold-circulating medium the banks are now working toward a
position where they can circulate credit in the absence of money-and with the
same results after all money is only the guarantee of payment in credit trans-
actions  poker chips or pants buttons would serve the same purpose if we all had
faith in them

recruiting

despite the lamentations of the army and navy and the deplorable col-
lapse of the recruiting drive made for the guard regiments on the border
two arms of the service have made excellent recruiting records the
coast-guard service almost doubled the results of the armys recruiters
man for man in greater new york since the increase throughout all branches
was authorized by congress last summer yet there is no more arduous service
and only men who have had sea service with either a deck or engine-room force
are accepted for the coast guard on the other hand the pay is double that of
the other services and the term of enlistment but a year by the same token
there is no higher physical standard required for uncle sam is not prone to
accept an applicant for this exacting service with its ice patrol salvage of life
and property in thick weather and its risky searches for derelicts unless he is
sound as the timber that we built into our old clipper ships

    the marine corps with its four-year enlistment and pay lower than the
navy engineers or coast guard is the other branch that has not complained of
the difficulty of recruiting men it has not only kept pace with its annual losses
from expiration of service and other causes but in one-third of the year added
to its rolls one-third of the authorized increase of five thousand a well-devised
recruiting system and a highly developed publicity campaign are the outstanding
features of the marine corps success the appeal it features in its recruiting
literature is the two-in-one service it does not scorn to hold out the lure


the popular magazine

in bold print on its recruiting posters from the spanish main to the orient
its posters are aflame with color showing marines hoisting the flag over a tropical
town and carry the neat phrase soldiers of the sea its tempting promise of
service both on land and sea is not held out by any other branch and the appli-
cant who passes its strict standards knows that he will barely be out of the
awkward squad before he is slinging a hammock on a modem sea fighter or
hiking out on a west indian trail after bandits

    the recruiting officers of the marine corps will have nothing to do with a
down-and-outer the pay is certainly not the magnet dissatisfaction with
humdrum civilian life the itch for adventure and strange lands appear to be
their best recruiters the successful drive of these two services would seem to
prove that their offer of adventure is more potent than playing them up as labor-
employment bureaus

starting the savings-bank account

americans are reputed to be a spending people they have been indeed
prodigal with their money and their natural resources but the dangers
of such a course are becoming more apparent every day we must check
the tendency to lavish expenditure one of the best correctives is in the
public-school savings bank whereby children are encouraged to save money and
realize its value recently we were in receipt of a report from a large school in
new york city which had established its savings bank in  and had met with
great success the following figures tell the story

    number of pupils on register january    number of depositors in school
bank january    average to credit of each account in school bank january 
i  number of school depositors in depository bank january    amount
on pupils accounts in depository bank january   

    the depository bank is the regular savings bank where the funds are kept
by the officials of the school bank from the little bank book given each thrifty
child we copy the excellent regulations

    deposits must be received every monday only at the morning session by the teacher of
each class these deposits will be entered by the teacher in the pupils bank book the
money thus received will be delivered to the bank manager who will deposit it the same day
in the metropolitan savings bank in the name of public school no 

    one cent upward will be received by the teacher when a pupil has a deposit of five
dollars or more a bank book will be given free of charge by the bank

    deposits may be withdrawn at any time but to withdraw the money the pupil will
require the presence of either father or mother and the signature of the principal during
the summer vacation of the school deposits may be made in and withdrawals may be made
from the bank direct the cashier acting during that time for the teacher but if the
applicant is unknown to the cashier he must be identified before receiving the money

    deposits of tive dollars or over will bear interest

the great american play

oscar hammerstein threatens to put uncle toms cabin into grand
opera

why not it is the only american play recording an epoch in our
history its power hastened the civil war by bringing the problems of
states rights and negro slavery to a head

    from a strictly dramatic standpoint uncle toms cabin is the greatest
american play ever written time ridicule and bad acting have failed to kill
caught in the net



it a year ago there died at the vermont soldiers home one daniel worcester
famed in the dramatic world of the old days as the original uncle tom he
played the part in the first production-at lowell massachusetts in 

    think of a show that has been running continuously for sixty-six years
compare it with other great hits of their day-floradora the wizard of
oz the prince of pilsen or kiralfys excelsior which toured the country
in  with three hundred and fifty people where are they now all the time
uncle toms cabin was running-and is still running strong this season
twenty-eight companies are out on the road with it all the way from tent shows
that travel by wagon to the big companies burlesquing it with two uncle
toms and two evas

    we have cried at this show laughed at it kidded it and still go to see it
what if it is melodramatic so is hamlet its situations are a byword-
eliza crossing the ice the death of little eva et cetera

    kin hubbard has a good line  uncle toms cabin played at melodeon
hall last night the dogs were good but they had poor support

    there is the answer that is why uncle toms cabin is not recognized as
the great american play it has never had a competent cast the melodrama
has been in the actors and a few crude lines not in the show itself what it
needs is an all-star cast

    the book was amateurish crudely written but the play shows vivid flashes
of dramatic genius and elemental psychology by all means put uncle toms
cabin in grand opera mr hammerstein caruso singing unde tom black
face wouldnt be half as funny as madam butterfly where the little japanese
girl sings in italian

the greatest game in the world

a theatrical man whose eccentricities of dress keep him lined up as
a lead for a good story at any time on any new york newspaper n   
his first stake as a salesman of railroad equipment notably cars  l
was years ago when railroad buying was nearly as crooked as railroad
financing

    i never got turned down he boasts they couldnt keep me out of
their offices sometimes my card came back with the nobody home that
didnt stop me id take a thousand-dollar bill tear it in two put half in an
envelope and write on the outside the other half is waiting outside to see you
it always worked of course i didnt send a thousand-dollar bill in to every
purchasing agent i called on-had to grade the denomination down to fit the
prospect but i never went lower than fifty dollars i figured that a railroad
buyer who wasnt worth fifty dollars to talk with wasnt worth talking to at all

    you couldnt get away with that line ofwork these days but thirty years
ago business was shady if not downright crooked and we had to fight fire with
fire other salesmen used to wonder how i got in to the prospects that were hard
to reach to-day id use different tactics but id get in somehow theres
always a loophole to crawl through its the matching of wits that makes sales-
manship the greatest game in the world its got stud poker knocked through
the ropes for real sport

 iil-the third party

the grooves were well oiled the
bolt made no sound in slipping
into place as the hawk entered
and closed the door of his room
behind him he had come up the nar-
row staircase nonchalantly he was
quick alert silent now as in the dark-
ness he crossed swiftly to the window
and crouched down against the wall
a minute two went by the fire es-
cape passing at any angle a short dis-
tance below the window sill and at
first nebulous in the blackness grad-
ually took on distinct and tangible
shape still the havvk held there mo-
tionless searching it with his eyes and
then abruptly satisfied that it sheltered
no lurking shadow he straightened up
thrust his automatic back into his
pocket pulled down the shade and
turning back into the room switched
on the light

  macvightie chief of the railroad de-
tective force it appeared still had lin-
gering suspicions of this room over the
somewhat disreputable saloon below
and still had lingering suspicions of
its occupant all that afternoon the
hawk was quite avell aware that he
had been shadowed but the result was
rather in his favor than in mac-
vighties from the moment he had
discovered that he was being followed
he had devoted his time to making ap-
plications for a job-for macvighties
benefit-that being the reason he had
given macvightie for his presence in
selkirk later on when it had grown
dark having business of his own he
had left macvighties satellite stand-
ing  a street corner somewhat puz-

zled just which way to turn that
however had no bearing on the watch
that had been or might be at the pres-
ent moment set upon this room

  the hawk in apparent abstraction
was flipping a coin up in the air and
catching it there was a slight frown
on the hawks face macvighties
suspicions wrere still lingering for the
simple reason that macvightie utterly
at sea was clutching at the only straw
in sight unless-the coin slipped
through the hawks fingers and fell be-
side his trunk he stooped to pick it
up-yes not only had the room been
searched but the trunk had been
opened the single strand of hair al-
most indiscernible against the brass and
quite innocently caught in the lock was
broken well he had not finished that
mental sentence unless-what

  he tucked the coin into his pocket
and standing up yawned and stretched
himself with the toe of his boot he
lazily pushed a chair out from the wall
the chair fell over the hawk picked
it up and quite casually set it down
-near the door he took off his coat
and flung it over the back of the chair

  the hawks face was grayer now
as it set in rigid lines but there was
no tremor in the hand that inserted the
key in the lock of the trunk he flung
back the lid and his eyes for an in-
stant searched the room again sharply
the window shade was securely drawn
the coat over the back of the chair com-
pletely screened the keyhole of the
door he laughed a little then-mirth-
lessly well the trunk had been

this series began in the march th popular
the wire vevils



opened had macvightie found all-
or nothing

  his fingers were working swiftly
deftly now around the inside edges
of the lid he was either caught here
cornered at bay or macvightie once
for all would be satisfied and as far
as macvightie was concerned the coast
would hereafter be clear the hawks
dark eyes narrowed the square under
jaw crept out and set doggedly it
had been a close call perilously close
that other night when he had taken the
ten thousand dollars from the pay-
masters safe and macvightie had fol-
lowed him here to this room he had
pulled the wool over macvighties eyes
for the moment but macvightie had
returned to the old trail again to-day
well the cards were on the table now
and it was a gamble that was grim
enough either he was quit of mac-
vightie coiild even count on mac-
vightie as a sort of sponsor for his
innocence or--

  ah an ingeniously fashioned
false top in the shape of a tray that
fitted innocently into the curvature of
the lid had come away in the hawks
hands he was safe  macvightie had
missed it in the tray untouched
where he had left them lay the pack-
ages of bank notes from the paymas-
ters safe in the tray still glittered the
magnificent diamond necklace whose
theft from the wife of his excellency
the governor of the state had already
furnished more than one of the big
dailies back in the east with attractive
copy for their sunday editions and
there undisturbed were the contents
of isaac kirschells cash box a trifling
matter of some three thousand dollars
and there too snugly tucked away in
one corner was the bundle of crisp
new counterfeit ten-dollar bills the
hawk grinned maliciously as his eyes
rested on the counterfeit notes he
had sent one o them inscribed with
the hawks compliments to mac-
vightie when he had returned the
otherwise empty paymasters bag to the
detective and it had not pleased mac-
vightie

  quite at his ease now the hawk

fitted the false top back into the lid
closed the trunk locked it drew a chair
up to the table and sat down with
macvightie removed as a possible fac-
tor of interruption there was another
and very pressing little matter to which
he was now at liberty to give his at-
tention he produced a folded sheet
of paper from his inside vest pocket
spread it out on the table before him
and inspected it with a sort of cynical
curiosity in each corner were tack
holes he had removed it less than
half an hour ago-not through any mis-
guided dislike to publicity but simply
because he had urgently required a
piece of paper-from a conspicuous
position on the wall of the railroad sta-
tion it was a police circular the
hawk had not before had an oppor-
tunity to absorb more than the large-
type captions he filled his pipe calmly
now as he read it in its entirety

 reward-for ex-sing sing
convict

  five thousand dollars reward will be
paid for information leading to the ar-
rest and conviction of the hawk alias
harry maul

  here followed a description tallying
with the one given by macvightie to
lanson the division superintendent
and which lanson had caustically re-
marked would not fit more than twenty-
five thousand men in selkirk city fol-
lowed after that resume of the crimes
recently committed on the railroad
among them the theft of the diamond
necklace and the robbery of the pay-
masters safe and at the end in bold-
faced type again 

 reward

  two thousand dollars reward will also
be paid for information leading to the
arrest and conviction of each and every
one of the hawks confederates

 the hawk smiled broadly as he held
the flame of a match to his pipe bowl
the last paragraph was exquisitely
ironical those whom macvightie so
blithely called the hawks confeder-
ates wtere vying with each other at
that exact moment and for the exact
amount of two thousand dollars offered


thb popular magazine

by the alaster spider of the gang for
the privilege of putting an even more
conclusive end-in the shape of a knife
thrust a bullet or a blackjack-to the
hawk

  and said the hawk softly as he
turned the circular over i guess theyd
make it a whole lot more if they knew
that i had-this

  the back of the circular was covered
with line after line of what seemingly
was but a meaningless jumble of scrib-
bled letters nor in this case were the
letters any too well formed the hawk
had labored under difficulties when the
telegraph sounder had  broke unex-
pectedly with the message he had
been listening-as he was always lis-
tening when within sound of a tele-
graph instrument-but he had never
known a message from the  ire devils
to come through at so early an hour
in the evening before he had shaken
macyighties man off the trail and had
gone down to the depot intending to
go up the line to the first small station
where with little chance of being dis-
covered he could spend the night
within earshot of the operators instru-
ment-in the hope that his vigil would
not as it sometimes did prove futile

  he had been standing under the dis-
patchers open window waiting for a
train when the police circular tacked
on the station wall had caught his eye
the large type was readily deciphera-
ble but the platform lights were poor
and he had stepped closer to read
the remainder and instead glancing
quickly about him to see that he was
not observed he snatched the circular
from the wall and whipping a pencil
from his pocket had scrawled on the
reverse side as best he could the mes-
sage that was rattling in over the dis-
patchers sounder from the room above
he had taken chances but he had
played in luck no one had noticed
him and-well he was here now with
the message and since it must sooner
or later have been put to the nroof in
any case he was back here too to find
that he wtas quit of macvightie

  yes confided the hawk to him-
self as he reached for a blank sheet

of paper in the drawer of the table i
guess i played in luck-both ways
wonder if theres another ripe little
melon here going to be slioved my way
on a gold platter by the butcher and
his crowd

  the hawk studied the cipher for a
moment

  lqrtvy    key letter    stroke
at six    two-three-one he mur-
mured

  he drew the fresh sheet of paper
toward him and began to work busily
occasionally he paused staring dubi-
ously at a letter he had taken the mes-
sage under far from ideal conditions
and a mistake here and there if not
fatal was annoying and confusing
finally however the hawk leaned
back in his chair and whistled low
under his breath the message de-
ciphered and arranged into words and
sentences ran 

  final orders number one three and
six hold up fast mail three miles east of
burkes siding to-night cut wires on ap-
proach express car next to engine un-
couple and proceed diamond shipment in
safe messenger drugged xo interfer-
ence with remainder of train deliver safe
five-mile crossing to number four and
seven number one three and six take
engine and car farther along the line re-
turn separately to selkirk

  again the hawk whistled low under
his breath and for the second time
reached into his inside vest pocket he
took out a letter that was addressed
care of general delivery to mr j p
carrister the hawk puffed pleasantly
at his pipe as he read it

  dear friend the folks are all well and
hope you are the same i havent had time
to write much lately i like my new job
fine say i felt like a fifth avenue dook
for about umpty seconds to-day one of the
fellows in the office let me hold a package
of diamonds in my hand just to see what it
felt like gee say you could almost
shove it in your vest pocket and it was in-
voiced through customs at twenty thousand
plunks they were unset stones and came
in from amsterdam it made me feel
queer i wouldnt like to be the fellow that
has to keep his eye on it any of the way
from here to san francisco where its going
to-morrow by express if you see any bright
lights flashing around your burg that you
cant account for about eleven-fifteen next
the wlre devils



wednesday night youll know its the dia-
monds going through in the express-car safe
im getting to he some joker eh we all
went down to coney last sunday its been
ferce and hot here say dont be a clam
write us a line weil i guess there aint
a in more news yrs truly	bud

  the hawk instead of folding up the
letter and returning it to his pocket
began meditatively to tear it into minute
shreds and with it the police circular
and the sheet of paper on which he
had worked out the cipher message
the fast mail scheduled selkirk at
eleven-fifteen-and this zcas jvednes-
dcy night

  twenty thousand dollars said the
hawk gently under his breath
thanks bud old boy you were
there with the goods all right but it
wasnt a one-man job and i didnt think
there was going to be anything doing
the hawk grinned at the ceiling and
just as i was about passing up the last
check here they go and fix it for me
to scoop the whole pot three miles
east of burkes siding eh

  the hawk relapsed into silence for
a moment then he spoke again

  yes said the hawk  guess that
ought to work she wont make the
three miles from the siding under five
or six minutes shes due at burkes
at ten-ten  can make it on the local
out of here at eight-thirty twenty
thousand dollars-in unset stones just
as good as cash and a lot easier to
carry 

  the hawk looked at his watch it
was five minutes of eight he rose
leisurely from his chair stooped for a
precautionary inspection of the trunk
lock put on his coat and moving to-
ward the door switched off the light

  if i get away with this observed
the hawk as he went down the stairs
and let himself out through the street
door itll be good night for keeps if
anv of the gang ever picks up my trail
and they wont quit until they do and
then theres macvightie and the police
i guess therell be some little side-step-
ping to do-what oh well-he
shrugged his shoulders-i guess ill
get a bite of supper anyway theres

no telling when til have a chance to
eat again

  it was not far to the station-down
through the lane from the palace
saloon-and close to the station he
remembered there was a little short-
order house that was generally patron-
ized by the railroad men old mother
barretts short-order house they called
it she was the wife of an engineer
who had been killed he had heard
and she had a boy working somewhere
on the railroad not that he was in-
terested in these details  in fact as he
walked along the hawk was not inter-
ested in old mother barrett in a per-
sonal sense at all but as he reached
the short-order house and entered his
eyes as though magnetically drawn in
that direction fixed instantly on the
little old woman behind the counter

  the hawk was suddenly very much
interested in old mother barrett it
was not that she made a somewhat
pathetic figure that she drooped a little
at the shoulders that her face under
her gray hair looked tired or that
though scrupulously neat her clothes
were a little threadbare it was none
of these things it was old mother
barretts hands that for the moment
concerned the hawk she was in the
act of adjusting her spectacles and pick-
ing up a very new and crisp ten-dollar
bill that a customer from the stool in
front of her had evidently tendered in
payment for his meal the hawk shot
a quick glance up and down the room
there were several other customers at
the long counter but the stool beside
the owner of the ten-dollar bill was
vacant and the hawk unostentatiously
straddled it

  he glanced casually at the man at his
elbow allowed his eyes to stray to the
kindly motherly old face with its gray
irish eyes that was puckered now in a
sort of hesitant indecision and glanced
a little more than casually at the bank
note she kept turning over and over in
her hands no he had not been mis-
taken it was one of those counterfeits
according to macvightie had flooded
the east and were now making their
appearance in selkirk and it was a


the cppulcr magazine

duplicate of those in the false tray of
his trunk his eyes perhaps were
sharper than old mother barretts in
any case his identification was the
quicker for his gaze had wandered to
the coffee urn and he was drumming
idly on the counter with his finger tips
before the little old woman finally
spoke

   i-im afraid i cant take this she
said slowly handing the bank note back
across the counter

  whats the matter with it de-
manded the man gruffly

  why-its-its counterfeit she
said a little anxiously as though she
were fearful of giving offense

  the hawks eyes with mild and
quite impersonal interest were on the
mans face now the man had picked
up the bill and was pretending to ex-
amine it critically

  counterfeit echoed the man
shortly say what are you giving us
its as good as wheat give me my
change and let me get out im in a
hurry  he pushed the bill toward her
again

  she did not pick it up from the
counter this time

  im sorry she seemed genuinely
disturbed and the sweet old face was
full of sympathy im sure you did
not know that it was not good and
ten dollars is a great deal to lose isnt
it its too bad do you remember
where you got it

  look here youre dippy  snapped
the man i tell you its not counter-
feit anyway its all ive got if you
want your pay take it

  you owe me thirty-five cents but i
cant take it out of this she shook
her head in a troubled way this is
a counterfeit

  you seem to be pretty well posted
-on counterfeits sneered the man
offensively how do you know its a
counterfeit eh

  because ive seen one like this be-
fore she said simply my son showed
me one the last time he was in from
his run and he warned me to be careful
about taking any

  oh your son eh  sneered the man

again some son wised you up
did he  carries it around with him
eh  and who does he shove it off on 
there was a queer little sound from
the old lady-like a quick hurt catch
of her breath the hawks eyes trav-
eled swiftly to her face she had
turned a little pale and her lips were
trembling but she was drawn up very
proudly and the thin shoulders were
squared back

  i love my boy she said in a low
voice and tears came suddenly into her
eyes i love him with all my heart
but i should a thousand times rather
see him dead than know him for a
thief and a man who attempts to pass
these things knowingly is a--thief i
have been very respectful to you sir
and i do not deserve what you have
said i assumed that you had been
swindled yourself and that you were
perfectly honest in offering the bill to
me but now from your--

  whats the trouble mother bar-
ret a big railroader farther up the
counter had laid down his knife and
fork and swung round on his stool

  with a hurried glance in that direc-
tion the man hastily thrust the counter-
feit note into his pocket laid down
thirty-five cents on the counter and
with a dive across the room disap-
peared through the door

  the hawk stared thoughtfully after
him

  i couldnt butt in on that and hand
him one said the hawk to himself
almost apologetically not with twenty
thousand in sight i couldnt afford
to get into a row and maybe miss the
local and spill the beans could i 

  he looked around again to find the
little old woman wiping her spectacles
and smiling at him a little wistfully

  im sorry that you had to listen to
any unpleasantness she said my lit-
tle place isnt very pretentious but i
would not like to have you a stranger
think that sort of thing wras customary
here what can i get you sir

  it was no wonder that the railroaders
evidently swore by old mother barrett
and that one of them had been quick to
shift her trouble to his own shoulders
the wire devils



  i guess he was a bad one all right
growled the hawk

  she shook her head regretfully
there was no resentment left it wras
as though indeed the man was a charge
upon her own conscience

  he meant to be dishonest i am
afraid she admitted reluctantly but
i am sure he cannot be thoroughly bad
for he wasnt ery old-just a young
man

  she was a very simple trusting little
old lad as well as a sweet little old
lady why should her illusions be dis-
pelled the hawk nodded gravely

  perhaps suggested the hawk
perhaps he hasnt had any one to keep
him straight perhaps he hasnt got
what keeps a good many chaps straight
-a good mother

  the mist was trjick in her eyes again
he had not meant to bring that he
had meant only to show her a genuine
admiration and respcct

  perhaps not she answered slowly
if he has i hope she will never know-
she shook her head again and then
but you have not told me yet what you
w ould tike sir

  the hawk gave his order he ate
mechanically back in his minu he was
reviewing a rather extensive acquaint-
anceship with certain gentry whose
morals were not wholly above reproach
failing however to identify the man
with the counterfeit note as one of this
select number he finally dismissed the
man somewhat contemptuously from
his mind

  just a piker crook i guess decided
the hawk id like to have found out
though how many more of those hes
got and who the fool was that let an
amateur skate like that loose with any
of the goods 

  he finished his meal paid his bill
smiled a good nigh to old mother bar-
rett walked out of the short-order
house and made his way over to the
station five minutes later having
purchased a magazine the haw k with
a ticket in his pocket for a station a
number of miles beyond burkes sid-
ing curled himself up with his pipe on
a seat in the smoker of the local

  the train started and the hawk ap-
parently became immersed in his maga-
zine the hawk however though he
turned a page from time to time was
concerned with matters very far re-
moved from the printed words before
him the game to-night was more
hazardous more difficult and for a
vastly greater stake than any in wrhich
he had before pitted his wits or played
his lone hand against the combined
brains of the butcher his fellows and
their unknown leader who collectively
were referred to by the papers as the
wire devils

  the hawk tamped down the ash in
the bowl of his pipe with a wary fore-
finger he the hawk according to
macvightie was the leader of this in-
genious criminal league it was very
complimentary of macvightie-very 
between macvightie and the wire
devils themselves he was a personage
much sought after macvightie how-
ever was not without grounds for his
assertion and belief the haw-k
grinned pleasantly he the hawk had
certainly and for some time back
helped himself to the leaders share of
the spoils and helped himself very gen-
erously

  the grin died away he had beaten
them so far appropriated from tinder
their very noses the loot they had so
carefully planned to obtain and he had
mocked and taunted them contemptu-
ously in the doing of it but the cold
fact remained that luck sometimes was
known to turn and that the pitcher that
went too often to the well ran the risk
of getting-smashed if they ever
caught him his life would not be worth
an instants purchase he knew some
of them and he knew them well for
what they were and he labored under
no delusions on that score the
butcher for example who wras the
number one of the message had al-
ready nearly done for him once and
the butcher had nothing on number
three who was the bantam or on
number seven who wras whitie jim
or it was safe to presume on any of
the others that he had not yet identified
-this number four and number six


the pocpular magazine

for instance who were mentioned in
the cipher message to-night and how
many more were there  he did not
know except that there wras the master
spider of them all

  the hawk had ceased now even to
turn cursorily the pages of the maga-
zine he was staring out of the win-
dow

 i wonder muttered the hawk
grimly when ill run up against him
and who he is  and where the head
office is 

  he nodded his head after a mo-
ment macvightie had called the turn
the wire devils formed as powerful
and dangerous a criminal organization
as had probably ever existed anywhere
and not for very long would they put
all their resources at work to pull off
some coup only to find that he the
hawk had made use of their prepara-
tions to snatch the prize away from
them they were much more likely to
put all their resources at work-with
the hawk as their sole objective

 the hawks lips tightened he
might underestimate but he could not
exaggerate his danger the man in the
seat behind him might be one of them
for all he knew somewhere hidden
away in his web at the end of a tele-
graph wire was the master spider di-
recting the operations and there must
be very many of them-the little spi-
ders-spread all over the division
where there avas a telegraph sounder
that sounder carried the messages the
plans the secret orders of the brain be-
hind the organization and the very
audaciousness with which they made
themselves free of the railroads tele-
graph system to communicate with each
other was in itself a guarantee of suc-
cess if one of their messages was in-
terfered writh they threatened to cut
the wires and that meant if luckily
it meant no more that train operating
was at an end until the break could be
located and repaired were they tap-
ping the wire somewhere what
chance was there to find out where 
there were hundreds of old splices on
the wires or if found what would
prevent them tapping the wire  the

next occasion many miles away also
the sources of information that they
tapped must be far flung how for in-
stance tmless they too had a bud
back there in new york did the- know
of this diamond shipment coming
through to-night 

  the hawks lips grew still a little
tighter his safety so far had de-
pended on the fact that he possessed
the key to their cipher messages which
not only enabled him to reap where
they had sown but warned him of any
move they might make against him
but it was becoming increasingly diffi-
cult to intercept those messages he
had macvightie to thank tor that
where before he had only to crawl into
some little way station where there was
no night operator macvightie now had
every one of those stations securely
guarded yes it had become exceed-
ingly more difficult if only he could
find out where those messages ema-
nated from or the system in force for
receiving them

  the hawk slid farther down in his
seat tossed the magazine to one side
pulled his hat over his eyes and ap-
peared to sleep all that was neither
here nor there-to-night he had the
message to-night but he had not yet
got that twenty thousand dollars in un-
set stones he would perhaps do well
now that he had the leisure to give
the details of that matter a little more
critical attention than the had received
when he had made up his mind that his
best chance lay in the three miles be-
tween burkes siding and the point
where the butcher and his men planned
to hold up the train according to the
message the implication was that there
would be nobody in the express car at
that time except a drugged messenger
and now somehow he did not quite
like the appearance of that it seemed
a little queer what was the object
of drugging the man i they did not
take immediate advantage of it he
pondered the problem for a long time
no after all it was logical enough
that was why they meant to remove
the safe bodily there evidently was
not a specialized cracksman among them
the wire devils



who had lifted his profession to the
plane of art no knob twirler such as
-well such as himself the hawk
opened his eyes sleepily to inspect the
tips of his carefully manicured fingers
otherwise with no one to interfere but
a drugged messenger they could have
opened the safe looted it and since
the fast mail carried only through ex-
press matter dropped off the car at the
first stop with no one being the wiser
until somewhere up the line the mes-
senger returned to life and gave the
alarm

  yes it was very craftily worked out
the master spider was far from a
fool they would have to soup the
safe and blow it open if they at-
tempted that while the train was en
route they ran the risk of being heard
and trapped like rats in the car and
if they were heard even if they man-
aged to stop the train and make their
escape they invited instant and definite
pursuit on the spot the reason for
drugging the express messenger became
quite evident now if the man were
already helpless when they held up the
train they at one and the same time
assured their access to an otherwise
guarded car without danger to them-
selves and without danger of being
balked at the last moment of their re-
ward which the messenger with a
small package like that might easily
have done if he were a game man he
could have opened the safe say the
instant the first alarm came as they
tried to force the car door taken out
the package and secreted it somewhere
it needed only the nerve after that to
defy them and they had evidently given
him credit for it whether he possessed
it or not

  yes decidedly the master spider was
no fool in the spinning of his web as
it was the safe which would only be a
small affair anyhow would disappear
bodily and between the point where the
train was held up and the point where
they finally left the engine and express
car there would be a distance of at least
ten miles even allowing that they ap-
proached no nearer than within two
miles of bradley the first station west

of burkes siding with the wires cut
and the coaches of the fast mail stalled
three miles out of burkes considerable
time must elapse before any one could
make a move against them and even
when the pursuit finally started mac-
vightie for instance would be con-
fronted with that somewhat illusive
stretch of ten miles in which to decide
where the pursuit should begin ten
miles was some little distance mac-
vightie would be quite at liberty to
make his guess and there was the
chance with the trifling odds of some
few odd thousand to one against it that
he might guess right-unless he guessed
that the safe had been removed at the
point where the engine and car were
finally left in which case macvightie
would guess wrong

  if the hawk was asleep he was per-
haps dreaming for the hawk smiled
the chances were just about those few
odd thousand to one that macvightie
would guess exactly that way-wrong
yes it was an exceedingly neat little
web that the master spider had spun
if he the hawk were permitted to
make a guess he would guess that the
safe would never be found 

  his mind reverted to the cipher mes-
sage the safe was to be delivered
at five-mile crossing where that
was the hawk did not know except
that it must necessarily be somewhere
between the point where the train was
held up and bradley however that
was a detail with which he need hardly
concern himself long before this
five-mile crossing was reached his
vest pocket if he played in luck would
be very comfortably lined he would
enter the express car as the fast mail
pulled out of burkes trust to certain
long and intimate experience to open
the safe and get off the train as it
slowed down at the butchers very
thoughtful request for the rest the
details-circumstances must govern
there in the main that would be his
plan

  the hawk slept on station after
station was passed his mind now
dealt in little snatches of thought
there was macvightie and the police


the cpocpular magazine

circular and the search of his room
that day and speculation as to how
they had managed to drug the express
messenger and the man with the coun-
terfeit ten-dollar bill in old mother bar-
retts short-order house and the little
old woman herself with her shabby
clothes and her tired gentle face and
finally the hawk stirred glanced at his
watch and as the train whistled picked
up his magazine and sauntered down
the car aisle to the door

  they were approaching burkes sid-
ing the hawk opened the door went
out on the platform and descended to
the lowest step the train slowed a
water tank loomed up receded and the
hawk dropped to the ground a min-
ute latei as the tail lights winked b
and came to a stop at the station a short
distance down the track he had made
his way back to the water tank crossed
to the opposite side of the track and
stretched himself out on the grass in
the hollow at the foot of the embank-
ment the fast mails sole excuse for
a stop at burkes was the water tank
which would bring the express car to a
halt directly in front of the spot where
he now lay

  the local pulled out and racketed
away into the night the tail lights
vanished silence fell there was
only the chirping of the insects now
and the strange queer indefinable med-
ley of little night sounds burkes sid-
ing was a lonely place there was a
faint yellow gleam from the station
windows and there was the twinkle of
the switch lights no other sign of life
it was pitch black-so black that he
could just barely distinguish the outline
of the water tank across the track

  its a nice night observed the
hawk pleasantly to himself a very
nice night its strange how some
people prefer a moon 

  the minutes went by-ten fifteen
twenty of them-a half hour-and
then from far down the track hoarse
through the night came the scream of
a whistle from his pocket the hawk
took out a diminutive flash light thin as
a pencil it might have been the wink-

ing of a firefly as he played it on the
dial of his watch

  on the dot murmured the hawk
some train-the fast mail i guess
though shell be a little late at that to-
night-when she pulls into selkirk

  a roar and rumble was in the night
again increasing steadily in volume
down the right of way in the distance
a flash of light stabbed through the
black it grew brighter and brighter
the hawk wrary of the spread of the
powerful electric headlight edged far-
ther away from the trackside and
now the rails gleamed like polished sil-
ver and the water tank stood up out
of the darkness a thing of monstrous
size there was the hiss of steam the
rasp and grind of the setting brakes
the glinting rays from the windows of
a long string of coaches that trailed
back to the station platform and a big
ten-wheeler like some human thirsty
thing was panting beside the water
tank

  the engineer with his torch swung
from the gangway for an oil around
there was the creak of the descending
spout the rush of water and sil-
houetted against the water tank the
hawk could make out the fireman
standing on the back of the tender
and now poking wkh his long-spouted
oil can weirdly swallowed up in the
darkness at intervals as he thrust the
torch far in under the big machine the
engineer moved slowly along the side
of the engine and finally disappeared
around the end of the pilot the hawk
stole forward closer to the track again
his eyes on the fireman who now that
the engineers torch was on the other
side was more sharply outlined than
before came then the swish and gush
of water as it overflowed the spout
banged back against the water tank and
the fireman scrambled back over the
tender into the cab it was the moment
the hawk had been waiting for
swiftly but still crawling as a safe-
guard against being seen by any of the
train crew in the rear he moved up the
embankment and in an instant had
swung up between the tender and the
forward door of the express car there
the vjfre devils



was no platform here of course but the
end beam of the car making a sort of
wide threshold gave him ample room
on which to stand

  the roar of escaping steam drowned
out all other sounds the back of the
tender hid him from any chance of ob-
servation from the cab he tried the
door cautiously it was locked of
course there were twenty thousand
dollars worth of stones in the safe in-
side  the hawk felt carefully over
the lock with his fingers classifying it
in the darkness as it were by the sense
of touch and produced from his pocket
a bunch of skeleton keys he inserted
one worked with it for a moment then
shook his head and selected another
this time he felt the bolt slide back
the train was jerking into motion now
he exchanged his keys for his auto-
matic turned the knob softly opened
the door an inch and listened even
the wire devils were not infallible
and if by any chance the messen-
ger-

  the hawk whistled low and con-
tentedly under his breath he had
caught a glimpse of the interior of the
carand now he slipped quickly through
the door closing the door behind him

  a quarter length down the car in
the aisle made by the express packages
which were piled high on either side
the messenger a young man of perhaps
twenty-two was huddled apparently
unconscious in his chair in a flash
the hawk was down the car and bend-
ing sharply over the other the man
sat in a helpless sagging attitude he
was breathing heavily and his head
hanging forward and a little to one side
swayed limply with the motion of the
car there was no question as to the
messengers condition  he was drugged
and well drugged from the man the
hawks eyes traveled to a sort of desk
or ledge built out from the side of the
car and topped by a pigeonholed rack
stuffed with express forms and official-
looking manila envelopes on the desk
was a small leather satchel containing
some lunch a bottle of what was evi-
dently cold tea though now but barely
a quarter full and as though to sup-

ply further evidence that the man had
succumbed in the midst of his meal a
little to one side lay a meat sandwich
half eaten

  the hawk nodded quietly to himself
as again his eyes shifted this time to a
small safe about three feet square that
stood beneath the desk it was quite
easy to understand now the wire
devils had only to ascertain the fact
that it was the messengers habit to
eat his lunch at a certain time choose
the point of attack on the line to cor-
respond therewith and see that a suffi-
cient quantity of knock-out drops was
introduced into the cold tea not a very
weighty undertaking for the wire
devils

  well it was a bit rough on the bov
- the hawk was kneeling now in front
of the safe-but he the hawk was
greatly indebted to the wire devils
twenty thousand dollars was a snug
little sum-quite a snug little sum 

  the figure in the chair with sway-
ing head breathed stertorously there
was the pound quick in its tempo of
the trucks beating at the rail joints
the give-and-take of the car in pro-
testing little creaks and over all a
muffled roar as the fast mail tore
through the night but the hawk heard
none of this his ear was pressed
close against the face of the safe lis-
tening for the tumblers fall as hio
fingers twirled the dial knob

  after a little while the hawk spoke
aloud

  left twenty-eight one quarter-
two right fourteen-two left eighteen
one-half he said

  he straightened up swung the han-
dle of the safe and a dismayed anx-
ious look flashed across his face
there was not much time very little
time and he had missed it iiow far
along those three miles from burkes
to where the butcher was waiting had
the train already come

  he tried again coolly methodically
and again he missed

  i guess im out of practice to fall
down on a tin box like this he mut-
tered grimlv but the first two are
right thats sure its the last turn thats


the popular magazine

wrong somewhere give me another
minute or two-he was twirling the
dial knob with deft quick fingers once
more-thats all i ask and-

  a sudden jolt flung him forward
against the safe came the scream of
the whistle the screech of the tight-set
brakes the bump and jerk and pound
and grind of the flying train coming
to an emergency stop the limp form
of the messenger sliding down was
almost doubled over the arm of the
chair

  in an instant the hawk had recov-
ered his balance and his face set like
iron his jaws clamped hard he
snatched at the knob and with desper-
ate haste now made another attempt
the re were a few seconds left a few
seconds before the train came finally
to a standstill and-no they were gone
now those seconds-and he had missed
again 

  his automatic was in his hand as he
stood up it was no longer a question
of twenty thousand dollars worth of
unset diamonds it was a question of
his life there was a bitter smile on
his lips as he ran for the forward door
it looked as though the pitcher had at
last gone once too often to the well
the train had stopped now he
reached the door and opened it cau-
tiously a little way a great red flare
from somewhere ahead lighted up the
night he heard and recognized the
butchers voice menacing raucous
punctuated with vicious oaths

  get out of that cab and get out
darned quick  down you come  jump
now now boys run em back and
keep firing down the length of the train
as you go and if these guys dont run
faster than you do let em have it in
the back beat it now beat it like
hell ill pull out the minute youre
uncoupled you two grab the rear end
as she moves-theres room enough for
you and you can bash in the door and

  a fusillade of shots rang out
flashes cut the black the butchers
two companions evidently driving the
engineer and fireman before them were
coming on the run along the trackside

from the cab the hawk retreated
back a step and closed the car door
he heard the men rush past outside
the fusillade seemed to redouble in
intensity and now added to it were
shouts and yells from the rear of the
train itself and-if he were not mis-
taken- answering shots

  his hand on the doorknob he stood
waiting tensely with the butcher 
guard out there in front it would have
been equivalent to suicide to have
opened the door again until he knew
the other was back in the cab against
the background of the lighted interior
he would have made a most excellent
mark for the butcher

  his eyes swept past the huddled form
of the young messenger in the chair
and fixed speculatively on the safe he
nodded suddenly grimly twenty
thousand dollars well he wasnt
beaten yet not till he threw down his
own hand of his own accord not till
he lost sight of the safe for keeps

  over the shouts and revolver shots
came the sharp vicious hiss of the air
hose as it was uncoupled and then
with a violent jerk the car started for-
ward as the butcher evidently whipped
the throttle open and coincidenuy
there was a smash upon the rear door
and the hawk opened the forward door
and slipped out again

  a din infernal was in his ears like
a maddened thing under the butchers
unscientific spur the big ten-wheeler
was coughing the sparks heavenward in
a volleying stream while the huge
drivers raced like pinwheels in another
shower of sparks as the tires sought to-
bite and hold and now the rear door
of the car crashed inward the shots
came fast as a gatling and shouts
screams and yells added their quota to
the uproar

  the hawk crouched by the door
moved suddenly to one side as he
caught the dull ominous spat of a bul-
let against one of the panels the train
crew and those of the passengers who
were armed were very obviously keep-
ing up a running fight from the stalled
section of the train and pumping their
bullets through the broken rear door
the wire devils



and up the aisle of the express car as
long as they could hold the range and
from within he could distinguish the
duller muffled reports of the butchers
confederates firing in return prevent-
ing any attempt being made to rush
the rear of the car

  and then the sounds began to recede
and die away the men inside ceased
firing and he could hear them now
moving the safe out from the side of
the car it seemed as though a very
long interval of time had been con-
sumed in the holdup but in reality he
knew it had been little more than a
matter of seconds-the time it had
taken the two men to run the length of
the car uncouple it and leap on the
rear end the fight afterward could
hardly count for once the express car
began to pull away the thing was done

  they were moving fast now and
with every instant the speed was in-
creasing the hawk clutched at the
handrail and lowered himself to the
iron foot rung which on the express
car served in lieu of steps here hav-
ing chosen the opposite side to that of
the butcher at the throttle in the cab
he ran no risk of being observed this
five-mile crossing wherever it was
promised to concern him a great deal
more than he had anticipated he
leaned out and clung there staring
ahead

  the big ten-wheeler was swaying and
staggering like a drunken thing the
rush of the wind whipped at his face
a deafening roar sang in his ears the
fast mail usually ran fast but the
butcher was running like a dare-devil
and the bark of the exhaust had quick-
ened now into a single full-toned note
deep as thunder

  with a sort of grim placidity the
hawk clung to the lurching- rail far
ahead along the right of way a shaft
of light riven through walls of black-
ness played the headlight shadowy
objects trees that loomed up for an
instant and were gone showed on the
edge of the wavering ray they tore
through a rock cut and in the con-
fined space and in the fraction of a
second it took to traverse it the roar
nb p

was metamorphosed into an explosion
and then suddenly as though by magic
the headlight shot off at a tangent and
the glistening lines of steel that were
always converging but never meeting
were gone and the ray fell full upon
a densely wooded tract where leaves
and foliage became a soft and wonder-
ful shade of green under the artificial
light the hawk braced himself and
just in time the ten-wheeler un-
checked swung the curve with a mighty
lurch off drivers fairly lifted from the
rails she seemed to hang there hesi-
tantly for a breathless instant then with
a crunch staggering settled back and
struck into her stride again

  the thunder of the exhaust ceased
abruptly and the speed began to
slacken the butcher had slammed the
throttle shut at the end of the head-
lights ray that was straight along the
track again a red light flashed up sud-
denly three times and vanished the
hawk leaned farther out tense now
straining his eyes ahead it was evi-
dently number four and number
seven signaling from five-mile cross-
ing

  the butcher began to check with the
air and now in the headlights
glare the distance shortened the hawk
could discern a large wagon drawn by
two horses that appeared to be backed
up close to the right-hand side of the
track two forms seemed to be tug-
ging at the horses which equally
seemed to be plunging restively and
then being on the wrong side of the
car the angle of vision narrowed and
he could see no more

  the hawk turned now his eyes on
the door of the car there was a pos-
sibility a little more than a possibility
that the men kiside knowing that they
had reached their destination would
come out this way no he had only
to keep hidden from the men out there
with the wagon until the car stepped
the men within were sliding back the
side door he swung himself farther
out on the foot rung then curving back
with the aid of the handrail flattened
himself against the side of the car

  they were close up to the wagon


the popular magazine

now and he could hear voices cursing
furiously at the horses as the fright-
ened animals stamped and pawed and
then the car bumped and jerked to a
standstill and the butcher was bawling
from the cab

  take the horses out you blamed
fools and tie em back there on the
road a bit till were gone wed have
a sweet time loading the wagon with
them doing the tango every second
take em out well back the wagon
up against the car

  the hawk lowered himself silently
to the ground to find that the car had
come to a stop directly over a road
crossing the men in the car had
joined their voices writh the butchers
and in the confusion now the hawk
slipped quickly along the side of the
car stole around the rearend and from
that point of vantage stood watching
the butcher and his men at work

  he could see quite plainly thanks
to the light from the cars wide-open
side door that flooded the scene the
horses had been unharnessed and were
being led away along the road one
of the men in the car jumped to the
ground as the butcher called out and
together they backed the wagon close
up against the car doorway  and then
presently the men who accompanied the
horses one carrying a lantern came
running back the hawks eyes from
a general and comprehensive survey of
the scene fixed on the man who until
now had not left the car but who had
now sprung down into the wagon and
was running a short plank to be used
as a skid evidently up to the threshold
of the car door which was a little
above the level of the wagon the
light shone full in the mans face

  number six-baldy kline con-
fided the hawk softly to himself im
glad to know that the last time i
chummed with baldy was back in little
old sing- sing guess he got out for
good behavior thought lie was elected
for five spaces yet

  baldy spoke now as he jumped back
into the car

  look here butcher im telling you

again this guy in heres in pretty bad
shape

  never mind about that replied the
butcher roughly get the safe out
all hands now weve got no time
to monkey with him hell come
around all right i guess anyway its
none of our lookout

 the men were bunched together
now three in the doorway of the car
and two in the wagon the safe between
them the hawk was studying one
of the two who stood in the wagon
one was whitie jim as he already
knew but the other had had his back
half turned and the llawk had not
been able to see his face the safe
slid down the plank and was levered
and pushed forward into the middle of
the wagon

  french pete said the hawk sud-
denly and as softly as before as the
man he had been watching straightened
up and turned around say i guess
sing sings gone out of business or
else somebody left the door open 

  but if the hawks words were indic-
ative of a facetious mood his actions
were not there was a sort of dawn-
ing inspiration in the dark narrowed
eyes and the strong jaw as it was out-
thrust drew his lips into a grim hard
smile they were spreading a huge
tarpaulin over the wagon anti safe and
abruptly the hawk drew back dropped
to his hands and knees crawled along
the trackside on the opposite side of the
car again until almost opposite the
wagon and there lay flat and motion-
less at the side of the road there
was a chance vet still a chance a very
good chance for that twenty thousand
dollars worth of unset stones

 all right now it was the
butchers voice pull her away a few
feet into the clear the wagon
creaked and rattled thats enough
now get a move on-everybody 

  steps crunched along the trackside
-the butcher and his two companions
obviously making for the cab and a
moment later came the cough of the
engines exhaust and the express car
began to glide past the spot where the
hawk lay
the wme devils



  the hawk raised himself cautiously
on his elbows two dark forms and
a bobbing lantern were already speed-
ing toward where the horses had been
left the hawk crawded forward
crossed the track and paused the
engine and express car were fast dis-
appearing in the distance the lantern
glimmered among the trees at the side
of the road a good hundred yards
away

  there was no shadow to fall across
the back of the wragon

  i said it was a nice night and that
it was strange how some people pre-
ferred a moon observed the hawk
cheerfully and lifting the end of the
tarpaulin he swung noiselessly under
it into the wagon and stretched him-
self out beside the safe

  the hawk felt upwtard with his hand
over the safe it was faced he found
toward the rear of the wagon this
necessitated a change in his own posi-
tion he listened tensely they were
coming back with the horses now but
they were still quite a little way off
he shifted quickly around until his
head and shoulders were in front of
the safe

  it was the last turn of the combi-
nation that i fluked up on though i
dont see how it happened muttered
the hawk

  he felt above his head again this
time rubbing his fingers critically over
the tarpaulin and then the diminutive
little flash light winked winked again
as it played around him and finally
held steadily on the nickel dial there
were no inadvertent openings and par-
ticularly no holes in the tarpaulin and
the texture of the tarpaulin was a guar-
antee that the tiny rays of light would
not show through

  they wereharnessing the horses into
the wagon now the hawk in a some-
what cramped position due to the
wagons narrow width his legs twisted
at right angles to his body as he lay on
his back reached up and began to twirl
the dial knob slowly and with pains-
taking care

  left twenty-eight one-quarter
murmured the hawk and a moment

later two right four- the

hawk swore earnestly under his breath
the jolt of the wagon coming unex-
pectedly as it started forward had
caused him to spin the knob too far
around

  it was hot stifling hot under the
heavy tarpaulin that slanting down-
ward from the little safe lay almost
against his face a bead of sweat had
-gathered on his forehead he brushed
it away and began again to work at
the dial it was more difficult now
the wagon bumped infernally and as
he worked he could hear the muffled
clatter of the horses hoofs and occa-
sionally the voices of the two men on
the seat

  and then suddenly the hawks fin-
gers traveled from the dial knob to
the handle had he got it this time
or-yes  the handle swung easily
there was a low metallic thud the bolt
had slipped back to the end of its
grooves the safe was unlocked

  twenty thousand dollars said the
hawk very softly and inch by inch
without the slightest sound he edged
his body backward to afford space for
the swing of the opening door
twenty thousand doll-

  the word died half uttered on the
hawks lips the flash light was illu-
minating the interior of the safe on
the bottom lay a single crisp ten-dol-
lar counterfeit note over the face of
which was scrawled in ink with the
hazvks compliments otherwise the
safe was empty

  for a moment like a man dazed he
stared at the counterfeit note he
could not seem to believe his eyes
empty-the safe was empty the dia-
monds were gone-gone  gone and
these poor fools were driving an empty
safe to the master spider and another
poor fool with dropped jaw was star-
ing gaping like an imbecile into one
and then a grip upon himself again
he laughed low grimly unpleasantly
with the hawks compliments lie
had sent a bill like that once to mac-
vightie inscribed with the hawks
compliments this was very neat
very clever of-somebody of some-


the popular magazine

body who must have known what the
wire devils were up to to-night there
would be no doubt in the minds of the
wire devils who would have heard of
that little episode with macvightie but
that the hawk had again forestalled
them and left them a ten-dollar coun-
terfeit bill in exchange for twenty
thousand dollars worth of unset dia-
monds  only it was this somebody
and not he the hawk who was twenty
thousand dollars the richer for it

  he reached in picked up the bill to
put it in his pocket and suddenly laid
it back again and closed and locked the
safe why deprive the master spider
of a little joy and besides it would
carry a message not perhaps so erro-
neous after all for in a flash logi-
cally indisputably apparently impossi-
ble though it appeared to be on the
surface he knew who that somebody
was the shelving of the theft to the
hawks shoulders would have defeated
its own object unless the theft were
committed and discovered on this par-
ticular division of the railroad where
the hawk and incidentally his sup-
posed gang of desperadoes were known
to be operating

  the messenger certainly had not been
in a drugged condition when he went
on duty and since it was only reason-
able to assume that he would have sat-
isfied himself everything was all right
at the time it was evident as he had
given no alarm that the contents of the
safe had been intact when he took
charge whether as a through man in
new york or at the eastern terminus
of the road or at the last divisional
point it did not matter which

  the robbery then had been com-
mitted while the messenger was pres-
ent in the car and it had been com-
mitted on this division the safe had
not been forced-it showed not the
slightest sign of violence-it had been
opened on the combination some one
then an expert safe worker in the first
stages of the messengers drugged con-
dition had happened into the car just
ahead of him the hawk and had done
exactly what he the hawk had in-
tended to do

  no said the hawk no i guess
not he was wriggling noiselessly
backward and his feet were hanging
out now over the end of the wagon
no coincidences like that dont hap-
pen-not very often the hawks
head and shoulders were still under
the tarpaulin but his feet now could
just feel the ground beneath them i
guess said the hawk as he suddenly
withdrew his head and crouching low
ran a few steps with the wagon then
dropped full length in the road i
guess its-the third party

  the wagon disappeared in the dark-
ness the hawk rose and turning
broke into a run back along the road
he had been longer in the wagon than
he had thought it took him ten minutes
to regain the railroad tracks

  here without pause still running
he kept on along the right of way but
there was a hard twist to his lips and
the clenching of his fists was not wholly
due to runners form how far had
the butcher taken the car before de-
serting it a mile two miles-
three he could not run three miles
under half an hour and that would be
fast over railroad ties how long
would it be before the train crew of
the stalled mail got back to burkes and
managed somehow in spite of the cut
wires to give the alarm or how long
before the dispatcher at selkirk with
the fast mail reported out at burkes
and no o s from bradley would
smell a rat it would take time after
that of course before anything could
be done but at best the margin left
for him was desperately narrow

  he ran on and on his eyes grow n
accustomed to the darkness enabling
him to pick out the ties with a fair de-
gree of accuracy there was not a
sound save that of his own footsteps
he stopped for breath again and again
and again and again ran on at top
speed it seemed as though he had run
not three miles but six when finally
far ahead he caught a glow of light
the butcher and his confederates had
evidently not taken the trouble to close
the side door of the car

  instinctively the hawk cautiously
the wib devils



slowed his pace and the next instant
smiling pityingly at himself for the act
ran on the faster the butcher and the
other two would long since have made
their get-away there was only the
messenger and the messenger was
drugged that was all that need con-
cern him now-the messenger-tofind
some way to rouse the man so that he
could talk

  the hawk reached the car ran along
the side to the open door and stood
suddenly still and then with a low
startled cry he swung himself up and
through the doorway and running for-
ward knelt beside a huddled form on
 
the floor it was the messenger
sprawled on his face now motionless
and it was no longer a case of being
drugged the man had been shot
there was a dark ugly pool on the
flooring and a thin red stream had
trickled away in a zigzag course along
one of the planks the hawks lips
were tight the butchers work  but
why why yes yes he under-
stood  the butcher too in some way
had discovered that the messenger was
-the third party 

  the boy-he was even more of a boy
now in appearance it seemed to the
hawk with his ashen face and color-
less lips-the boy moaned a little and
as the hawk lifted him tip opened
his eves the hawk produced a flask
and forced a few drops between the
others lips

  listen he said distinctly try
and understand what i am saying did
they get the diamonds from you after
they shot you 

  the boys eyes widened with a quick
sudcln fear perhaps the drug had
begun to wear off perhaps it was the
wound and the loss of blood that had
cleared his brain

  the diamonds he faltered

    es said the hawk grimly the
diamonds  you took them did you
tell those men where the- were

  its-its a lie the boy seemed
to shiver convulsively then- his voice
scarcely audible no its-its true
i --i did i-i guess im going out-
aint i  its-its true but i-i didnt

tell there werent any men-i--
he had fainted in the hawks arms

  my god whispered the hawk sol-
emnly its true the kids dying

  he held the flask to the others lips
again it wasnt the butcher then who
had shot the boy and besides he saw
now that the wound was in a strangely
curious place-in the back below the
shoulder blade the boy had been sit-
ting in his shirt sleeves and the back
of his vest was soaked with blood and
the hawk remembered the fusillade of
bullets that had swept up the interior
of the car and the spat upon the for-
ward door panel as he had crouched
there outside and he understood the
boy sitting in a stupor in his chair
facing the forward door had been di-
rectly in the line of fire and a stray
bullet had found its mark

  i-i dont know how you knew-
the boy had roused and was speaking
again-but-but im going out-and
-and its true two days ago a man
gave me a hundred dollars to stand
for-for knock-out drops on the run
to-night i-i couldnt get caught-i
-i was safe-whatever happened id
be found drugged-and-and no blame
coming to me-and---- he mo-
tioned weakly toward the flask in the
hawks hand give me-give me
some more of that

  he did not speak for a moment

  and instead prompted the hawk
quietly you double-crossed the game

  i--i had a counterfeit ten-dollar
bill the boy went on with an effort
sd heard about the hawk-and-and
macvightie i knew from what-the
fellow-said that the hawk--wasnt
one of them - i got to thinking all
i had to do was empty the safe--and
-and write what the hawk did on the
bill-and-and shove it in the safe-
and-and take the diamonds-and-
and then drink the tea that had the
drops in it t-i would be drugged
and lhey-theyd think the hawk did
it while i was drugged before the--
thev got here-and-and thats what i
did

  the boy was silent again it was still
outside very still-only the chirpings
	the popular magazine

of the insects and the night sounds the
hawk had listened to while he had lain
below the embankment waiting for the
train at burkes there was a set
strained look on the hawks face the
kid was paying the long price for
twenty thousand dollars worth of un-
set diamonds

  to make it look like-like the real
thing-the boys lips were moving
again-i-i cleaned out everything in
the safe-but-but of course there
mustnt any of that be found-and-
and i tied the stuff up-and-and
weighted it and dropped it-into-the
-river as we came over the bridge at
moosehead and then i had to-to
hide the diamonds so they wouldnt be
found on me and yet sos they-theyd
come along with me-and-and not be
left in the car i was afraid that when
some of the train crew found me
drugged-they-theyd undress me-
and-and put me to bed-and-and so
i didnt dare hide the diamonds in my

clothes theyre-theyre-in--

  he raised himself tip suddenly
clutched frantically at the hawks
shoulders and his voice rang wildly
through the car

 hold me tight-hold me tight-
dont let me go out yet-i-i got some-
thing more to say dont tell her
dont tell her ill tell you where the
stones are theyre in the lining of my
lunch satchel--but dont-oh for gods
sake dont tell her-dont let her know
that-that im a-thief  you dont
have to do you say you dont im
-im going out-i-ive got whats
coming to me and thats-enough-
isnt it-without her knowing too  it
-it would kill her she was a good
mother-do you hear  he was stiff-
ening back in the hawks arms and
this aint coming to her she was a
good mother-do you hear-everybody
called her mother but shes ray mother
-you know-old mother barrett-
short-order house-you know-old--

mother-barrett-good-

  the boy never spoke again

  the hawk laid the still form gently
back on the floor of the car and stood
up and there was a mist in the

hawks eyes that blotted out his imme-
diate surroundings and in the mist he
seemed to see another scene and it was
the picture of a gentle kindly-faced old
woman who had silver hair and who
wore clothes that were a little thread-
bare and whose gray irish eyes behind
the spectacles were filled with tears
and he seemed to see the thin shoulders
square proudly back and he seemed to
hear her speak again i love my boy
i love him with all my heart but i
should a thousand times rather see him
dead than know him for a thief

  mechanically the hawk moved over
to the desk where the lunch satchel still
lay and emptied out the remainder of
the food

  no said the hawk i guess shell
never know and i guess id have to
take the stuff now anyway whether
i wanted to or not-if shes not to
know

  he was examining the inside of the
satchel it was an old and well-worn
affair and a torn piece of the lining
stuck down with paste at the edges
would ordinarily have attracted no at-
tention the hawk loosened this and
felt inside at the bottom carefully
packed away were strips of cotton
wadding he took one out embedded
in this  were a number of diamonds
which as he drew the wadding apart
flashed brilliantly in the light of the oil
lamps above his head he wrapped the
stones up again and put them in his
pocket took out the remainder from
the satchel put these also in his pocket
and replaced the portion of the lunch
he had removed back in the satchel
it mattered little about the torn lining
now

  he kind of put it up to me said
the hawk slowly yes and she did
too-without knowing it-old mother
barrett its kind of queer she should
have said that kind of queer the
hawk pulled the drawer of the desk
open and nodded as he found and took
out the messengers revolver thought
hed have one and that it would most
likely be here he muttered

  he crossed the car and listened in-
thb wire devils



tently at the open side door there was
no sound-nothing for instance com-
ing from bradley yet he closed the
door and stood for an instant looking
down at the boys form on the floor

  i guess i can fix it for you kid
maybe he said simply i guess i
can

  in rapid succession he fired five of
the seven shots from the revolver
then stooping laid the weapon as
though it had dropped at last from
nerveless fingers just beside the boys
outstretched hand he straightened up
stepped to the side door and slid it
open again

  itll let the smoke out before any-
body gets here said the hawk the
butcher isnt coming forward with any
testimony and with all those shots fired

at the time of the holdup whos to know
the boy didnt fight till he went down
and out and now i guess ill make
my own get-away he dropped to
the trackside and started forward at a
brisk pace ill keep on a bit until i
hear something coming he decided
then ill lay low while theyre clean-
ing up the line and wait till i can
hop a freight east or west that will get
me out of this particular locality after
that theres nothing to it

  a hundred yards farther on the
hawk spoke again and there was a
twisted smile on the hawks lips

  itll break her heart anyway i
guess he said but itll help some
maybe to be proud of him yes i
guess theyll tell her that all right-
that he died a game kid

the late tim hurst one of baseballs most famous wielders of the indicator

    its a hard life me boys but where can ye beat thim hours

    not so long ago a youngster broke into the national league he was ambi-
tious he had read everything in the history of the game and particularly had
he followed the careers of hank oday billy evans silk oloughlin and
other well-known judges of play he was assigned to be a mate to rigler one
of the nationals veteran umpires

    the first day he got by without even a kick from john mcgraw whose
giants formed one end of the exhibition that night the recruit felt pretty
proud of himself and he proceeded to imbibe freely and unwisely he returned
to  the hotel looking for compliments from the older man instead he got
criticism

    rigler ended up his talk with

    you got by out there because you were lucky the giants won let me
tell you something though get a distinctive motion or veil so the spectators
will understand your decisions

    then rigler went to bed

    two hours afterward or to speak precisely at two oclock in the morning

             by max rittenberg

        middle-aged schoolboys in a financial game with a
        much-desired loast for the cleverest pirate among them

class of ninety-six declaimed
marvin standing by his toast-
masters seat at the center of the
big oval banqueting table we
are proud of one another we have all
made good you remember at our
first meeting how we all declared that
before we were forty we would be pull-
ing down our fifty thousand dollars a
year many of us have far exceeded
that modest estimate and to-night
gathered here around this festive board

  one moment piped mccloskie
one moment please  he merely
held a lectureship in social economics
at a bush university at a stipend equiv-
alent to pocket money among this gath-
ering of financial and mercantile nota-
bles

  prof has the floor conceded mar-
vin indulgently

  the diners rattled their spoons nois-
ily against their fruit plates now that
the waiters had departed and they had
the private banqueting room to them-
selves these men of forty felt and be-
haved like so many schoolboy-

  gentlemen piped mccloskie in
that reed voice of his and that ox-
ford accent so easily ridiculed by his
students i wish first to propose
a toast-to-er-the cleverest pirate
among us

  name  name  laughed the gath-
ering good for you prof at-a-
boy give him a name 

  that is my difficulty gentlemen
continued the professor among so
many great successes in finance and
commerce how shall i choose the one
to be toasted but i have a test to
propose a little game so to speak

  spoons and cups rattled appreci-
atively here was something out of
the routine of set banquets these
schoolboys of forty were eager for any
novelty

  i suggest that we each stake the
sum of a hundred dollars that would
mean-he looked around and counted
up rapidly-two thousand dollars alto-
gether for what my young students
would term-er-the kitty not a large
booty but still worth piratical atten-
tion we will then line ourselves
against the wall of the room extinguish
the lights and go for the money the
one who succeeds in annexing the larg-
est portion and getting outside the room
with it him we will adjudge the clever-
est financier of the class of ninety-six
and toast accordingly gentlemen do
you approve my test

  they roared good-humored approval
of his nerve in framing such an ironi-
cal test of financial ability in sober
daytime they would have frowned at
it or presented the frozen face but
to-night flushed celebrating among
friends only--

  marvin of the rector trust com-
pany put in a thoughtful caveat will
that prove your point the fellow
thats mappiest in a rough-and-tumble
will annex the cash he need not be
the cleverest

  orchardson munitions fleshly and
out of physical condition did not back
up the protest as might have been ex-
pected but supported the professor
with a burbling laugh you havent
got onto the game marvin prof
doesnt elect the man who grabs the
monev but the one who gets outside
with it me for holding a door
one moment cplemsef



  besides smiled little weissman
who passed half of his waking life in
elose proximity to a ticker tape we
shall combine we shall form our
pools

  the possibilities in the idea caught
the fancy of all these middle-aged
schoolboys the race need not be to
the swiftest or the strongest wits
ought to win they began to rise from
the table and whisper in clusters en-
deavoring to form alliances and blue
print their plans of campaign

  meanwhile mccloskie took up a fruit
bowl and went round from man to
man gathering in the stakes in tens
twenties fifties and hundreds

  watch him or hell skip out of the
room with it boomed orchardson
with his big burbling laugh

  trust me to see to that answered
a hard-bit mining engineer who bore
his years lightly

  no that would be against the rules
of high finance piped mccloskie
we must not do our pirating so bra-
zenly no one is to leave the room be-
fore the lights are extinguished

  he completed his collection and
placed the overflowing bowl of yellow-
backs in the center of the table then
a thought struck him and he frowned
and clicked his tongue irritably just as
he did over his students blunders

  we shall not be able to identify all
this pile of bills and prove who is the
winner will anybody change them for
two thousand-dollar notes

  there was a perfunctory searching
of pockets but men of commercial
standing and wordly-wise prudcnce do
not carry thousand-dollar bills about
with them to festive banquets in new
york they leave that brand of os-
tentation to roisterers from the rural
districts mccloskie ought to have
known it had he been a student of
human nature rather than a professor
of highly theoretical social economics

  in new york we carry checks
commented little weissman with his
knowing smile

  will some one give a check for the
pile inquired mccloskie

  there was an instant response eight

men thinking on similar lines flour-
ished blank checks at him

  orchardson exploded with noisy
laughter that game wont catch me
nothing but a certified check will take
the place of my good money

  the profferers found out in their
scheming joined in the general laugh
and melted back into their several
groups of alliance

  what is the best to do frowned
mccloskie as this flaw in his plan deep-
ened

  marvin man of decision pressed the
electric bell for a waiter change
them in the hotel and the waiter
can clear the table as well

  presently they had a bare table with
only a fruit bowl on it and in that
bowl two smoothly new thousand-dol-
lar bills

  marvin accustomed to the fifty-one
per cent which gives control in stock
operations tossed in a dollar bill so
that some one can grab a majority
vote he explained dryly

  delighted approval the game was
now set-an epitome in miniature of
the game which so many of these men
played in their business lives two
thousand dollars in the pool and the
man who could get his hands on one
thousand and one dollars of it and
carry it out of the room would prove
his right to the professors toast

  line up against the wall i boomed
orchardson 

  one moment interjected the pro-
fessor i think my first thought was
right the bills might get torn to
pieces we ought to have a token in-
stead of actual money in the-er-kitty
suppose one of us were to give his
i o u-for that two thousand and one
dollars i suggest-er-marvin
marvin looked around for agreement
found it nodded to him and wrote out
his paper promise gathering up the
notes lie stowed them very safely away

  they moved to the walls of the room
and stood in runners positions with
one hand touching the wall behind

  it was a large room overdecorated
according to the fashion of new york
hotels catering to revelers with two

central doors orchardson and his fol-
lowers gathered themselves about one
door weissman and his pool protected
the second marvin took up an appar-
ently chance position against a side
wall and the professor stationed him-
self by the electric-light switch

  click blackness

  instant schoolboy yells sounds of
wild scurrying

  at em boys tackle em low
throw em in the discard boomed
the voice of orchardson from his stra-
tegic post by the door

  sweep the bowl off eight-fif-
teen-two  yelled weissman to his fol-
lowers

  that isnt the bowl its my stom-
ach 

  its empty some ones got the
paper

  hold the doors

  sounds of scrapping near orchard-
sons guard post a wild rush to the
other door

  a thousand dollars if you let me
get out

  nothing doing

  then a groan oh my god im
hurt

  whats the matter 

 some one kicked me turn the
lights up it was marvins voice im-
perative

  the professor clicked on the lights
marvin was indeed lying crumpled on
the floor he twisted in agony hi
hands pressed about his groin his facc
white

  put me on the couch and phone for
the doctor

  there was no couch in the room

  we had better carry him into the
lobby suggested the professor so-
bered at this unfortunate outcome of
their joke the cfiners gathered up m r-
vin and bore him carefully out of the
room inro the adjoining lobby

  ill have them phone for a doctor
said mccloskie and sped away

  when he returned it was to find mar-
vin sitting up and chuckling delightedly
over the success of his ruse

  boys ive won heres the notes
and heres the i o u ive got em

both come back to the room and toast
me

  howrd you pull your grab asked
orchardson as they filed back to the
banqueting room

  i never grab explained marvin
i stayed quiet i merely picked out
the fastest-looking man in the bunch--
he patted the shoulder of the hard-bit
mining engineer who bore his years so
lightly-and -promised him five thou-
sand dollars if he could fetch me the
i o u out of the bowl thats the
principle of my success pick out the
right man for the job and pay him
well getting the paper was easy but
getting away with it getting it outside
the room boys that needed financial
genius

  he resumed his toastmasters seat
and rang for the waiter to reset the
glasses

  class of ninety-six he declaimed
i am asked to propose a toast to my-
self and unusual though the pro-
cedure may be-

  one moment piped mccloskie
one moment please

  prof has the floor conceded mar-
vin indulgently

  it is a principle of economics ex-
pounded the professor that paper
tokens take their value from the gold
standard which lies behind them

  we all know that

  the i o u is really valueless the
two thousand-dollar bills are also value-
less

  rubbish man 

  no fact they are-er--what my
young students would term phony
notes which i had previously placed
in the hands of the waiter for this very
purpose i reckoned that they would
be called for in the progress of the
game the only real money is here
-he displayed a roughly bunched pile
o the contributed yellowbacks-and
i think you will admit gentlemen that
i in the popular phrase got away with
it

  a moment of silent astonishment

  yes an epitome of how to succeed
in high finance-if one cares to tread
the path do i not deserve the toast 
the machine-gun man

         by henry herbert knibbs

author of  the forgotten land  slowdown  etc

     an eastern tenderfoot who wrote yarns and hardly knew
     one end of a cayuse from the other invades mexico with
     a typewriter he wrote well but as it happened his repu-
     tation was made on a machine gun not a typewriter

bantley came to the border town
of san felice bringing a suit
case a small compact type-
writer and a new england con-
science down on the border he found
a use for the suit case and the type-
writer he had read much about
brigandage on that same border he
knew that the newspaper versions of
conditions were exaggerated he
would see for himself-and then write
the story

  brom alberto pacheco he rented a
solitary thick-walled adobe house at
the extreme southern boundary of the
town from the walled roof of his
hermitage he could view the mexican
desert for many level miles

  the few americans in san felice
did not interest him as he didnt smoke
or drink and he was almost a stranger
to profanity his needs were as
simple as his equipment implied he
cooked his own meals carried firewood
and water and bargained for provender
in a kind of strinrdialt mexican the

                                      j

limp in his hvbrid conversation being
assisted over the rough spots by that
sturdy old crutch the sign language
me drifted about town accumulating
local color and registering smells he
sketched in these bits of color as a
background for his storv-and tried to
forget the smells despite his diligence
the out of the story-the theme-
eluded him

  there was a girl in san felice an
am-rican girl who was all that could
be desired in the way of a heroine she

was the daughter of bob davis cattle-
man and despiser of greasers but she
was more than that she was golden-
haired blue-eyed warm-hued and rode
an amazing pinto pony that never
seemed to have more than one foot
on the ground at a time bantley had
already sketched her in with a desert
background of gray-green chaparral
and blue spaces that made a really
effective picture but a picture without
action then came the inevitable inter-
ruption

  the interruption was welcome be-
cause hamilton rindee was first an

                         o

american secondly he had been a class-
mate of bantleys some not too many
years ago hamilton was alliteratively
huge wholesome and hearty he wore
a flannel shirt and stetson as though
erstwhile and ever entitled to do so
and he wore tailored whipcord riding
breeches as though born to the pants
as bantley told him hamilton laughed
recalling amusing incidents of their
school life and moved himself and his
few effects into the thick-walled adobe
with gusto laer recounting mild ad-
venture by land and sea-having jour-
neyed coastwise from xew york to the
gulf-while bantley rearranged his
own modest equipment that his big
friend might be comfortable

  the first glad tumult of meeting hav-
ing subsided bantley informed his
friend that his working hours were
from nine to twelve in the morning and
from two until four in the aliernoon
this he asserted would give hamilton


the vovular magazine

plenty of time to take in the local land-
scape without interruption

  hamilton smiled laid aside his coat
and unbuckled a heavy belt which he
hung on a chair back

  goodness ham did you carry
that tiling all the way from new
york 

  assuredly son why not

  well i consider firearms danger-
ous

  how about typewriters banty

  well in competent hands-

  exactly now iil hop along and
see things when do we eat

  at fifteen minutes to six i have

made it a rule-

  from infancy eh same here so
long old stocking see you later
bantley sighed sat down and struck
a key but the machine did not respond
easily the tang of life had evaporated
with the going of his breezy friend
after a period of slow tickings and
erasings he sat back and lazily watched
an alert lizard whisk back and forth
through the doorway he came to him-
self with a start and conned the written
page before him the heroine was just
bidding adieu to the hero farewell
if you must go richard  but remember
manuel is not to he trusted  to which
the printed hero doffing his broad som-
brero had replied via the stubborn type-
writer so long old stocking

  bantley rubbed his ear and carefully
erased the heros sprightly farewell
substituting something less boisterous
and literally more masculine

 with the coming of hamilton
rindge bantley sniffed romance from
afar things would now shape them-
selves to a satisfactory conclusion of
the hesitant story and he was un-
wittingly prophetic things shaped
themselves to a conclusion but whether
satisfactory to all concerned with the
story is still a matter of sore doubt to
certain mexicans along the wrong side
of the border who lived to tell of the
mad gringo of the lone adobe on the
san felice road and there were other
mexicans whose doubts never matured
to speech-at least on this side of the
great divide-which was just as well

for bantley and his romance the ora-
tory of a machine gun is compelling in-
disputable

  bantley blinkingly observed hamil-
ton rmdges love-making it became
robustly evident that ham would have
to be the hero of the border romance
seeping through bantleys typewriter
bantley would have sketched himself
in as the hero but physique diffidence
and eyeglasses forbade to be sure
he could have eliminated the glasses
but even then he would not have meas-
ured up to his own ideal of a live amer-
ican hero so hamilton was sketched
in unselfishly almost literally although
bantley did reduce his friends chest
measurement a few inches so tospeak
for ham was without doubt the least
bit chesty and bantley was a modest
man

  rindge became acquainted with the
girl he purchased a half-educated and
somewhat egotistical saddle horse of
her father davis shaped to the saddle
and judging men primarily through
their horsemanship admitted that the
young easterner could ride he told
his daughter that if rindge could stay
with that bronc long enough to get the
saddle warm he would take off his hat
to him hamilton rindge stayed with
that bronc through main strength and
grit davis took off his hat to him
incidentally inviting him to light down
and rest his saddle while lolita cooked
the supper

  rindge accepted the invitation and
later while rindse and the pirl rode the

	o	o

mesa trails bantley rode herd on his
typewriter with fair success he had
plotted an invasion of american terri-
tory iv the mexican bandits-a mere
skirmish just to give color and supply
action-and a swift spectacular rescue
of lolita by a hamiltonesque caballero
and then-little shriveled alberto pa-
checo straw sombrero in hand poked
his head through the doorway of bant-
leys adobe he had ccme to collect a
little rent in advance provisions were
high the seiicr had a big heart a
few pesos bantley proffered a chair
and the little old mexican sidled to it
and sat down on its edge there was
the machine-gun man

another matter-and albertos voice
became hoarse with whisperings for
the love which alberto and his mujer
bore the senor who made books he
would divulge a terrible secret a
cousin had ridden in that very day
from across the border bringing word
that san felice was to be invaded
sacked-burned to the ground the
attack would be within the week the
cousin thought on a saints day-the
fourteenth

  bantley asked questions alberto
shrugged his humped shoulders like one
who would shake off rain that could not
be avoided sehora pacheco had in-
sisted that the americano be told at
once the americano was a good man
prompt in paying his rent and courteous
to mexicans as for the other gringos
of san felice-again alberto shrugged
his shoulders expressively their fate
lay in bantleys hands

  bantley thanked the mexican who
straightway departed

  the rancher davis laughed when
bantley told him breathlesslv of the
threatened attack why they dont
dare try it asserted davis theres
too much flat open country between us
and them hills and he pointed to-
ward the south

  hamilton rindge in the seclusion of
their home that night admitted the pos-
sibility of an attack but made light of
the source of information old al-
berto has bad dreams so davis tells
me davis says that alberto swapped
his yarn for the pesos you gave him-
probably to ease his conscience if he
lias any-for every one here knows
that the pacheco outfit live off your
rent why davis says that san felice
is immune because it isnt worth shoot-
ing up theres no plunder here he
tells me that old alberto has warned
him six or seven times of an invasion
alberto has the habit and by the
way banty miss davis invites you to
chuck to-morrow night

  bantley accepted the invitation at
a distance his heroine was attractive
enough at short range she was irre-
sistible i-antley bloomed to speech in
the warmth of her smile amusing her

with bits of unexpected humor flatter-
ing her with an occasional glance of
admiration and withal evincing a sin-
cere quiet homage so unconsciously
that lolita asked him to come again
and named the evening

  the following day much to the sur-
prise of both rindge and bantley there
came a written invitation asking bant-
ley to supper but making no mention
of rindge hamilton chaffed his friend
good-naturedly declaring that it was
bantleys turn to bask in the sunshine
of lolitas gracious presence bantley
spent some time before his small hand
glass and wdth sudden vehemence
asked rindge to lend him his stetson
he would have asked for the pony
only it was pastured at the davis
rancho bantley determined to make
the most of the occasion-which he
did

  lolita greeted him with a hearty wel-
come and why dont you always
wear a stetson  it is becoming to
you

  bantley breathed deep do you
mean it that is are you fond of
stetsons miss davis

  lolita laughed i like mr rindges
hat-on you

  bantley seized opportunity by the
curl papers then i shall never wear
anything else

  lolita laughed again bantley in-
wardly condemned what he termed his
careless construction and wisely
pulled his foot out of it noiselessly

  their little joke brought them closer
together than heretofore after sup-
per lolita made a swift flank attack
on the dishes whistling the while and
later joined bantley and her father on
the veranda davis talked cattle and
politics for an hour and then retired
lolita shrugged closer to her guest
now i havent the least notion that
the greasers will attack san felice-
but they might you havent a horse
what would you do in case they did
come 

  well really miss davis i hadnt
thought of that i think i should bor-
row a horse from your father and ride
the other way


the popular magazine

  alone  but you dont know the
country

  not alone-if your father-er-and
you would accompany me

  yes but we might not have time
listen amigo i wanted to talk with
you alone i have tried to get i lam-
mr ringe-to be more careful he
laughs at me i have talked with dad
he doesnt laugh and he doesnt say
anything promise me that you will
come straight here if there is the least
sign of trouble we have horses i
am really worried the mexican
women tell me things that they would
not tell father two families left for
the north last night

  indeed i will tell hamilton at
once

  oh i think mr rindge is quite ca-
pable of taking care of himself he is
-well rather masterful

  inferring that i-er-need looking
after miss davis

  lolita was too whole-souled to take
offense at bantleys boyish seriousness
dont be silly she said smiling and
for some reason bantley was immedi-
ately elated i wont he declared
soul fully and i think you are the
most wonderful girl-er-in san fe-
lice miss davis

lolita studied bantley with half-
closed eyes suddenly she leaned for-
ward you pack a gun of course
no never dreamed of doing that
but you should now to-morrow

  down the dim road past the rancho
drifted an interruption in the shape of
a string of pack mules headed south
lolita sat forward finger on lips gun
runners  she whispered

  great exclaimed bantley the
real thing

  from gun runners their talk drifted
to other and less warlike subjects what
they said to each other in the dim light
of the southern stars had nothing in
common with the high cost of loving
nor with roman architecture bantley
departed buoyantly

  when he neared the adobe he was
startled by a shadowy something mov-
ing along the broken-down corral he

strode to the corral and discovered a
huge pack mule browsing along the
twisted cedar fence bantley thought
of lolitas exclamation one of the
pack animals had strayed some one
would come for it and soon he de-
cided to investigate approaching the
animal which seemed too tired and
hungry to resent his fumbling with the
pack rope unfamiliar with packs
bantley had recourse to his knife the
mule freed from its burden swung
away and disappeared in the darkness
bantley lugged the two heavy packs
into the old adobe stable covered them
with brushwood and strode to the
house rindge was asleep nodding
above an open book bantley roused
him and told of the mule and the packs
rindge grinned sleepily and made off
to bed

  next morning rindge was astir early
made coffee and departed to ride the
mesas he left a note for bantley
which was succinct my turn it read
bantley thought of rindges pony pas-
tured on the davis rancho atid he
sighed still last evening had been
pleasant decidedly pleasant

  late that night rindge returned he
seemed unusually subdued silent until
bantley invited him to climb to the roof
of the adobe

  more bad dreams bant

  yep  regular nightmare this time
come on up

  rindge rubbed his eyes as he stood
on the low walled roof in the light
of the lantern he saw a shimmering blue
something mounted on a tripod and
across the thing ran a white belt studded
with cylinders of glowing brass great
caesar where in hop did you capture
that its a machine gun

  correct ham it is it is a rindge
automatic-so the directions say i
had some difficulty in putting the thing
together although it was oiled and the
directions were simple enough then

i	studied the operation of the thing and
that belt affair with the cartridges
works beautifully-just as smoothly as
a cream separator when one gets the
hang of it i------

  you didnt turn it loose
the machine-gun man



  just twice-to see how it worked
bullets struck about a half mile out
there kicked up the dust lively made
a racket but its down behind this wall
and no one seemed to notice

  cut whats the idea

  simply this  in ease of an attack-
alberto said it might be pulled off the

fourteenth-

  rindge laughed why to-day is
the fourteenth old man thats about
all these yarns amount to

  thats right i was so interested in
getting the thing organized that i for-
got the date but see  i can command
all the open country for miles south of
town and a child could operate the
gun here are the ranges-one hun-
dred to four thousand yards one
could approximate the distance of an
enemy you know what do you think
of it

  why its all right banty-but it is
a joke you are some little tarantula
when you really get going a machine
gun and stolen at that

  beg pardon ham-confiscated
this gun was made in america and it
ought to be used in america i have
some feeling about that we make and
sell arms and ammunition to the mex-
icans and they use our inventions to
murder us

  hamilton rindge smiled perhaps
you didnt notice that it is a rindge
automatic the governor is the big
stockholder in the concern that makes
it and we sold a thousand of em to
the mexicans last year

  bantleys blue eyes hardened
thats not your fault ham but it
is an outrage  the man who sells arms
to the mexicans is a murderer

  oh come banty-thats putting it
pretty strong its all in the game we
arent supposed to know what the
cholas do with the rifles and stuff we
sell them thats not our business
our business is to sell

  bantley bit his lip i cant help it
hamilton and by the way t noticed
that you werent interested when i told
you about that pack mule last night
perhaps vott came down here to see
that the rindge automatics got across

  the border without interference id
hate to think that

  you come close to the mark old
man i came down here to collect im
no gun runner the mexicans can take
that risk and i take the dineros

  well if that is all this means to
you ham-why i want to tell you
straight that it means a whole lot more
to me

  you really mean it

  every word

  rindge turned and climbed down the
ladder bantley followed lantern dan-
gling in one hand in the adobe rindge
moved about whistling and packing his
effects bantley watched him silently
rindge strapped up a suit case and
stooped to pick up another better
wait till morning ham and bantley
smiled

  rindge shrugged his shoulders

  see here ham you arent sore
because i called on miss davis the other
night 

  rindge glared for a moment at bant-
ley and then laughed bantleys smile
faded for the laugh told all too plainly
what rindge thought of his compan-
ion as a rival

  bantley followed him to the doorway
sorry that you cant see it my way
he said in farewell

  ill send for the rest of my things
to-morrow said rindge

  alone in the adobe bantley awoke
next morning with an unpleasant pre-
monition that something was about to
happen his friend hamilton was gone
-but it was not that they had dis-
agreed in a quiet way evidently
rindge looked upon bantleys warlike
preparations as a huge joke and
rindge was taking money from mex-
icans across the border for arms and
ammunition well the threatened at-
tack was a false alarm bantley had
breakfast and turned to his story

toward noon he became drowsy the
day was biting hot he stretched and
strolled to the doorway then he
thought of the machine gun up on the
roof in the burning sun he wondered
if the heat would explode the cartridges
in the box beside the gun dragging a


the cpocpulacr magazine

blanket after him he climbed the ladder
and laid the blanket over gun and box
about to descend he caught a glimpse
of a cloud of dust on the southern hori-
zon he descended and secured his
field glasses again on the roof he fo-
cused the prisms and saw through them
a tiny band of horsemen spurring to-
ward san felice he knew there were
no cattle south of the town the riders
swung on now distinct now blurred by
the dust cloud the riders swung to-
ward the west then back again this
caused bentley to sweep the mesa with
his glass suddenly his ruddy face
went pale a scant half mile ahead
of the band rode a man and woman
spurring desperately an occasional
puff of thin smoke almost invisible
spurted from the pursuers its ham-
ilton-and miss davis he gasped

  whipping the blanket from the gun
he tried to signal the fugitives to ride
to one side frantically he waved the
blanket rindge must have seen for
he suddenly swung to the right crowd-
ing the girls horse with him

  bantley squatted sighting along the
shimmering barrel tiny figures bobbed
up and down beyond the front sight
he estimated the distance drew in his
breath offered a prayer and depress-
ing the gun as the riders drew nearer
began to press the trigger

  spurts of dust flickered in front of
the pursuers bantley elevated the muz-
zle a hair and kept on pressing the
trigger the riders were now within
a half mile of the adobe suddenly a
horse reared and fell backward then
another horse galloped off to one side
saddle empty the riders had swung
to the right following the man and the
girl bantley swung the gun round and
took them at an angle a horse lunged
and turned completely over he pressed
the trigger again but the gun did not
respond

  with shaking hands he refilled the
belt and ran it back at closer range
the hail of slugs ate into the horsemen
tearing a ragged hole through the troop
the man and the girl had had time to
gain a little bantley could now clearly
distinguish lolita davis on her pinto

  pony and rindge on the big sorrel
rindge was bent forward holding to
the horn

  then in the lull as bantley gazed
the attacking troop began to fire bant-
ley turned and saw the townsfolk scur-
rying from adobe to adobe lugging
packs of household things or standing
in the streets wringing their hands and
shrieking bullets began to tear up
streaks in the road near the adobe
down below a windowpane tinkled a
man running toward bantleys house
doubled up and lay in a black heap in
the road rindge and the girl were
riding for the davis rancho bantley
turned and depressed the gun he saw
davis run out and mount a horse he
held the rope of a led horse and the
three riders spurred toward bantleys
improvised fortress

  bantley began to press the trigger
again it seemed murderously easy to
wither the oncoming horsemen they
lunged from the saddle or wilted and
dragged horses rijderless broke from
the band and tore across the levels
bantley saw that he was overshooting
and closed the rear sight taking point-
blank aim just then a voice hailed
him from below for an instant he had
forgotten davis bantley ran to the
edge of the roof got a horse for
you  called davis come on

  thanks but ill stay if you get
through just write to mfolks-cam-
bridge-stuck it out-matter of prin-
ciple-american manufacturers ought
to see this-good-byand he ran
back to the gun and dragged it to the
west side of the roof the disorganized
horsemen had reformed bantley shot
a spray of lead among them melting
them to scattered groups again he
wras startled to feel a hand on his
shoulder

  i told lolita and rindge to ride for
it said davis rindge took the bet
but my girl-why she just led apache
through your big doorway and barri-
caded herself shes down there listen-
ing to the music

  bantley nodded still pressing the
trigger davis squatted and crawled
to the roof wall a sting of adobe
the machine-gun man



spattered in his face lie ducked and
wiped his eyes bantley moving to get
an angle on the raiders suddenly spun
round and sat down his face went
blank and he coughed almost apologeti-
cally as though to cover his seemingly
strange behavior slowly he got to his
feet and knelt behind the gun again
but his right arm hung dangling like
the grotesque arm of a motionless mari-
onette davis crawled to him did
they get you bad 

  i dont know arm feels funny but
my head is clear yet

  davis crawled back to the wall as
bantley worked the gun with his left
hand the raiders were in the street
now attempting to charge past that
withering storm of slugs a bullet
scattered dust on davis sombrero but
before he ducked his six-gun leaped
and barked a rider flung wide arms
and rocked from the saddle

  bantley white and rigid knelt be-
hind the stuttering automatic sweeping
the road as bunch after bunch of horse-
men attempted to spur past and enter
the town a final trill of explosions a
horrible maelstrom of plunging horses
and writhing shapes-and the gun be-
came silent

  belts empty again and bantleys
voice sounded almost musical

  davis refilled the belt working si-
lently so this was the eastern tender-
foot who wrote yarns and hardly knew
one end of a cayuse from the other
working that almost red-hot gun with
his left hand and biting his lip till it
bled to hold himself together raking
the roadway with a hail of slugs that
tore men from their saddles and
plunged horses into the brush-lined
ditches in heaps 

  the rancher wondered as he saw two

tears slowly form and trickle down
bantleys white cheeks bantley bit his
lip harder and pressed the trigger with
quick regularity its the horses  he
sobbed i always loved horses but
the men-i dont care a damn about
them

  again the rancher wondered lying
belly down on the roof neck crooked
that he might watch these two machines
fighting for the lives of san felicc and
for a flag that floated somewhere in the
east-perchance near a factory where
they made machine guns

  presently bantley sat back and
brushed his arm across his forehead
they have slowed up could you get
some water

  sure thing pardner if i have to
shoot my way to it just you wait a
spell

  bantley waited chewing his finger
nails davis climbed down the ladder
to reappear with a bucket bantley
waved him away as he proffered the
water pour it on the gun shes
getting too hot to function and then
he fainted

  davis carried him to the room below

  the streets were emptied of riders
the machine gun had ceased to chatter
bantley lay dreaming strange dreams
in the old adobe on the san felice
road when he came to himself an
army surgeon was bending over him
san felice was safe

  he is down on the border now doing
newspaper work for the sndicate al-
though a civilian he is known among
the troopers as the machine-gun
man

  his right arm and hand are almost
useless so mrs bantley nee lolita

to hoodwink lispenard douane
ned riordan wras surprised by the de-

the generous reward which he had
promised brought the desired results
before nine oclock he had received the
address to which doctor sinclair had
escorted the young woman the previous
evening and he smiled grimly as he
remembered the professors comments
on her luxurious existence they had
driven to one of the most fashionable
and exclusive of the new apartment
houses in a most select neighborhood
curiously enough the property of the
douane estate which he believed the
conspirators were bent upon looting
he went up there immediately although
he strongly suspected that the girl had
gone there simply as a blind ignorant
of her name he would ordinarily have
found it difficult to obtain information
concerning her for the managers of
houses of that class are extremely reti-
cent concerning their tenants but as
 lawyer attached to mr grants office
he found that austere individual cour-
teously communicative

  he knew that the young woman
could have lived there but a few
months and that together with his as-
sumption that she was unmarried made
the identification of miss martha fos-
dick who had lived there less than
half a year as the woman of mystery
seem plausible for the first time the

manager became evasive when riordan
tactfully concealing his intense personal
interest asked him about her

  mr riordan the precautions which
we take in leasing these apartments
are sufficient to guarantee the desira-
bility of our tenants he said our
investigation of references is most
rigid but naturally we regard the in-
formation which we receive as confi-
dential in any case i could tell you
little about miss fosdick it goes with-
out saying that there is nothing which
we could tell about her here we do
not discuss the affairs of our tenanats
of course miss fcsdicks position is
above questioning she was sent here
by mr douane himself accompanied
by one of his confidential employees
i am quite sure that mr douane could
supply you with any information you
desire about the young lady her rent
is always paid by a check on her ac-
count in his bank and she must be a
frequent guest at his house his but-
ler has escorted her home two or three
times-after evening parties i pre-
sume

  jackson suggested riordan his
tone indifferent his face imperturbable
although he was conscious that his pulse
had quickened and his nerves were tin-
gling

  the manager nodded ned rose ab-
ruptly from his chair

  ill send up my card it is neces-
sary for me to see miss fosdick on a
matter of business he said and main-
tained a thoughtful silence until the
hall boy returned with the announce-
ment that miss fosdick wrould receive

him in her apartment he was pre-
pared for any possible hostility or de-
fiance for anything in fact except the
smiling and cordial welcome which he
received from ail exceptionally beauti-
ful and sweet-faced girl she met him
in a cheerful and luxuriously furnished
room extending her hand as he entered
she was tall and slender dressed in a
simple black gown in age and appear-
ance she answered perfectly to mr
grants description of jessica brewster
as a girl and to that ghostly counterpart
of her which he had encountered in
lispenard douanes study

  i have often wondered if i should
ever have the pleasure of meeting you
mr riordan she said and a little
flush came to her face as in his con-
fusion he made a reply which was un-
intelligible when i saw your name
on your card i was sure that you must
be the grown-up little ned of whom
dear papa phao used to speak so often
and so affectionately am i not right

  sure-er-yes  i mean certainly
stammered riordan his confusion al-
most painful yes-er-certainly
how is the old boy-er-i hope he was
well the last time you saw him he
had hardly known what lie was saying
hearing that sweet-faced refined girl
speak in terms of affection of the old
man whom society regarded as one of
the vilest of outcasts had obliterated
what little of equanimity he retained
after her unexpectedly cordial greet-
ing

  oh you do not know then per-
haps that is why i have not heard from
you before  she exclaimed i thought
that you had not received my message
the poor dear passed over six months
ago so suddenly that i could not reach
his bedside and he was buried- before
i even knew do you know what i
hoped when i read the name on your
card the thing which will make me
inexpressibly happy if it is true

  riordan shook his head hopelessly
not daring to trust again to speech
she motioned to him to take a chair
and sat down facing him her slender
white hands clasped about her knees
as she leaned forward

  i thought-i hoped-that perhaps
you had come to tell me that the thing
he devoted his life to trying to prove
he had demonstrated positively after he
passed over she said quietly he
always promised that he would return 
he was confident that what he had
learned on earth would enable him to
recross that barrier which others have
found impassable that he would at
least be able to transmit a message
she paused as if fearing to meet dis-
appointment her large eyes pathetically
wistful as she looked at him is my
hope justified mr riordan do you
bring me a message from him

  ned had regained a measure of his
ordinary composure it was difficult
for him to retain his suspicions o this
most surprising girl but it was just as
difficult to dismiss or discredit the most
convincing evidence that she was in
league with a band of swindlers he
hesitated before answering averse to
saying anything which  light pain her
and in that hesitation she read he shat-
tering of her hopes and spared him
the effort of evasion

  just another disappointment added
to the many i have experienced she
continued taking his denial for granted
only this is harder to bear than any
of the others perhaps because my faith
and hope were stronger i had a curi-
ous experience last evening which con-
vinced me that dear papa phao was
nearer to me than ever before that he
was just at the barrier and only pre-
vented from crossing it because of the
atmosphere of trickery and avarice
which was always so repugnant to him
in his earthly sojourn 

  riordans bewilderment returned as
he listened she spoke in the jargon of
spiritualists of those on the outside of
the circle but if human testimony
could be believed she had been the apt
pupil and assistant of the shrewdest
and most skillful trickster of the inner
ring his doubts and uncertainties
were irritating and confusing and he
made an effort to dissipate them with
a direct question

  miss fosdick are you a spiritualist
a believer  he asked abruptly


the vovulacr magazine

  thats a difficult question to answer
with a simple yes or no she said ear-
nestly of course you know that none
of the tricks and deviccs employed by
the ordinary mediums are mysteries to
me-any more than they are to you
but no one could have been the close
associate and devoted assistant of dear
papa phao in his search for the great
truth without being more or less in-
fluenced by his sublime and implicit
faith and in that sense i suppose that
i am a spiritualist i am at least open
to conviction and perhaps more than
that for i wish to be convinced

  but phao trott wras the worst trick-
ster of the lot protested riordan
remember that i knew all about it
that i helped--

  the best not the worst she in-
terrupted of course i know wdiat
you would imply but papa phao was
an experimenter an investigator and
he never employed trickery with evil
purpose or design he was working
on a certain theory to demonstrate the
truth of his belief he believed that
through simulating as closely as human
ingenuity could contrive it the condi-
tions which would enable a spirit to
materialize in earthly form he could
make it easier you have helped him
in those false materializations and you
know that they were not employed to
his own profit or to the harm of those
whom he deluded that i too know
and it was that knowledge which made
me willing and eager to assist him i
did become very expert at it so expert
that i have seen many people leave the
seances comforted and happy in the
delusions which his ingenuity and my
skill had fostered nothing could have
convinced them that they had not been
in close communion with their departed
and in that communion they had found
happiness for papa phao was too gen-
tle and kindly to give pain it was
trickery yes but not the fraud prac-
ticed purely for their own profit by the
miserable brotherhood of petty swin-
dlers who pose as mediums and batten
on the credulity of their dupes

  she spoke with the earnestness and
fervor born of conviction but watch-

ing her intently riordan determined
that conviction had come through an
appeal to her emotions and affection
not through reasoning pie realized
instinctively that the girl was abso-
lutely sincere he had not the slight-
est doubt that she was the daughter
of lispenard douane and jessica
brewster and he found her a more
puzzling enigma than her mother had
been to mr grant twenty years be-
fore he looked significantly about the
expensively furnished apartment and
indicated it with a sweep of his hand

  still these surroundings suggest
that phao did not find his trickery alto-
gether unremunerative he said in

the old days-

  just a moment mr riordan she
interrupted and the suggestion of a
frown came to her brows this is not
an evidence of fraud perpetrated but
of fraud prevented i am glad to have
the opportunity to explain to you to
tell you who were his friend that after
a lifetime of self-denial and poverty-
for we were always poor although
never in actual want-dear papa phao
knew a few days of that independence
and comfort which money brings and
what must have meant far more of
happiness to him he knew when that
sudden summons came he was not
leaving me in want for the first time
riordan felt absolutely sure of the girl
and she quickly read the confidence and
sympathy in his face to it she made
instant and sympathetic response a
smile came to her lips and there was
friendliness instead of defiance in her
tone as she continued 

  that is the thing which brings me
the greatest happiness in it for i do
love this luxury and comfort the
knowledge that it must have made his
passing easy and i contributed to it
too although i am not at liberty to
tell you about it all yet and best of
all just as you might expect of dear
papa phao the good fortune came
through helping others through bring-
ing peace and comfort to a lonely and
heartsick man and gaining his support
for others old friends whom phao had
not seen for years oh it is a wonder-
ghost-dcrlvbn	is i

ful story and some day i may tell it

to you if- she paused abruptly

and a flush of embarrassment came to
her face

  but mr riordan i owe you an
apology she exclaimed contritely i
must be intruding upon your time and
good nature is this just a friendly
call or did you come to see me on
business 

  dont let that worry you miss fos-
dick and i want you to believe that it
is the friendliest sort of a call pro-
tested riordan eagerly i cant tell
you how interested i am i wish that
you wyould tell it all to me right now

  i am sorry but it isnt all my secret
and it must be a secret for a little while
for something even better is going to
happen she answered  why things
are happening all the time and do you
know that i have an indescribable feel-
ing that even in the spirit world dear
papa phao is interested with us in it
all i have the sensation that he is
always protecting and helping rne
would it interest you to hear about
my experience last night-the experi-
ence which raised such false hopes
when i recognized your name on the
card 

  riordan nodded his assent he did
not dare open his lips for fear of let-
ting a whoop of victory escape between
them

  i believed that i was on an errand
of mercy rescuing a poor old man from
the clutches of a precious pair of swin-
dlers who would have stripped him to
the bone she continued my friends
had discovered his danger but he wras
so thoroughly under their influence that
it would have been useless to warn him
in the ordinary way so they deter-
mined to make the very men who had
duped him the agents of his salvation
the poor old fellow has been fleeced
by them for months and he thoroughly
believes that the communications they
palm off on him are real letters from
the spirit world my friends went to
the swindlers and scared them so thor-
oughly that they were frightened into
obedience but they could not be
trusted and they asked me to guard

against possible treachery they wrote
a letter which also purported to come
from the other side but it was a letter
of warning against the men who had
duped him that was to be substituted
by the swindlers themselves for the
communication which they would ordi-
narily have given him and i carried
it there and watched the whole pro-
ceeding for they couldnt fool me
that part of it wouldnt interest you
but there is something wthich i think
will

  it all does intensely prompted
riordan when she paused you know
what the letter contained of course

  onfy in a general wtay-a warning
as i told you-but i did not read it
but that is unimportant she continued
of course the light was dim but it
was something about their dupe which
puzzled me pie was absolutely con-
vinced and you know how earnest and
absorbed they always become well
as i watched him sitting there waiting
anxiously for a spirit communication
i suddenly realized that his face was
assuming a strange distorted likeness
to that of dear papa phao distorted
and unreal because it was distinctly
avaricious-and avarice was a vice to
which you know he was a stranger
but it was there and it almost fright-
ened me for i believed that it was the
result of his spirit making the supreme
effort which he had promised to com-
municate with me but if it was he
failed that old miser would have been
odious to him in life what do you
think mr riordan  is it possible that
i can be right is it not possible that
the impulse which brought you here
might have been stimulated by the effort
of papa phao influencing you uncon-
sciously 

  riordan rose to his feet and she
looked wonderingly into a face which
had become set and stern

  no not unconsciously i came with
my eyes open and they opened a lot
more from what you have told me
miss fosdick he said grimly it isnt
the time to think its the time to act
see here phao trott always trusted
me will you


the popular magazine

  why certainly i do trust you mr
riordan why not she asked

  well just remember that there will
never be reason why not no matter
how much appearances may be against
me and youll be the big winner in the
end he answered ive got a mighty
unpleasant duty to perform miss fos-
dick will you help me in it by being
as brave as you know how and as trust-
ing as you can  im afraid that you
are going to be hurt and pained
aroused from a pleasant dream to a
mighty tragic reality but ill do my
best to give it a happy ending for you
and ill tell you this-that everything
i do and ask you to do will contribute
to the happiness of phao trott in what-
ever heaven or hell he happens to be

  she shuddered and drew back from
him but there was nothing but kindli-
ness in the blue eyes which met hers so
frankly and the sudden realization that
for many a day there had been a sug-
gestion of furtiveness in other eyes she
had met strengthened the trust she had
first given him instinctively

  and watching her noting every
change in her expressive face ned
riordan for the first time understood
thoroughly just what mr grant had
tried to convey in his description of
jessica brewster the girl was per-
fectly self-por-sessed entirely mistress
of herself she had the poise of an
experienced woman of the world but
she had sacrificed none of the simplic-
ity of girlhood in fact it was with
almost the trustfulness of a confiding
child that she held out her hand to him

  mr riordan ive known you only
a matter of minutes but ive known
of little ned ever since i can re-
member she said quietly i am just
beginning to realize that i have lived
the strangest sort of a life it is only
comparatively recently that i have
known adhing else and have been able
to make comparisons even under
papa phaoa kindly but close guardian-
ship i sometimes had misgivings since
his death they have grown stronger
it is difficult for me to tell you just
what i mean but those misgivings have
subtly increased until they have almost

grown to distrust i felt when you
came into this room that you had
brought with you something which i
have missed since i lost papa phaos
protection  that your presence banished
something unpleasant from which that
protection had always shielded me
you have asked two things of me the
first i have given you of the second
my bravery you need have no misgiv-
ings  i have never known the meaning
of fear now what is it that you wish
me to do 

  i wish you to come with me-at
once and without letting any one know
of it answered riordan quickly
youll have to take it all on trust but
believe me i am acting for your pro-
tection-and you need it how soon
can you be ready 

  i am ready now she answered
without a moments hesitation my
wraps are in the hallway come 

  an hour later the warden greeted
him warmly in his office at sing sing
and glanced inquiringly at the closely
veiled woman who accompanied him
riordan presented him

  im extremely pleased to meet you
i shall be even more pleased if i am
correct in my guess that your christian
name is martha said the warden as
she raised her veil

  youve guessed right the first time
and if you dont mind thats the only
name well mention just now inter-
posed riordan before she could answer
whats up warden plows your pa-
tient 

  ive been trying to get you on the
phone for the last hour to tell you about
him answered the warden gravely
hes pretty weak but he seems to have
experienced a change of heart im not
sure that he is entirely rational but
he has been calling for you and de-
manding that you bring martha to
him his other visitor anticipated you 
he vas here an hour ago i turned
down his request to see him and he
wtent off in a huff to get a court order
to see his client ill make an exception
in your case you have brought this
young lady as a visitor too 

  without question or protest almost
ghost-drlven



automatically the girl accompanied
them through the gloomy corridors to
the prison hospital the warden indi-
cated a closed door and tactfully but
with veiy evident reluctance turned
back riordans hand on his arm re-
strained him

  please come in with usr he said
quietly martha you are going to
need all of the bravery which i asked
you to show but nothing will hurt you

  together they entered the room and
riordan softly closed the door
stretched on a hospital cot only his
face visible above the white covering
lay phao trott his eyes closed his
lips moving although no sound came
from them for a moment it was only
bewilderment which the girls face ex-
pressed in that crop-headed smooth-
shaven convict with the shadow of a
bar in the small window falling across
his face gray with prison pallor there
was little to suggest the kindly old man
who had cared for her so tenderly and
whom she had mourned as dead for
many months cut when those closed
lids opened and he turned his eyes to-
ward her that old face seamed and
lined with suffering was suddenly-
transformed such a cry of joy as
human ears are rarely privileged to
hear came from his lips and in spite
of his weakness he managed to half
rise in his cot

  and before he could fall back she
was beside him her strong young arms
about him her own sweet young face
radiant with new-found happiness as
his head found a resting place against
her breast

chapter xii

  the employees in the outer office
missed the morning greeting of the
senior member of the firm for rest-
less from his anxiety mr grant ar-
rived at an umvontedly early hour and
was at his desk before the first of them
reported for duty at his club the pre-
vious evening the spectacular rise in
phosphates concessions had been al-
most the sole topic of conversation and
discussion for from the opening to the
closing of the market the price had

advanced steadily reaching par in the
first hour and closing at twenty points
above knowing his close association
with douane  co friends and ac-
quaintances had besieged him with
questions concerning it and the form
of some of those questions had served
to increase his anxiety for they im-
plied the suspicion that the old firm
was forgetting the traditions of con-
servatism and venturing into the trou-
bled waters of frenzied finance a
direct inquiry made to lispenard
douane had brought a curt and positive
denial that either the bank or any one
connected with it was in any way in-
terested in the stock transactions and
the gratuitous information that the
original concessionaires had not with-
drawn from their safe-deposit box the
common stock which they had received
in partial payment for the property

  under ordinary conditions there
would certainly be nothing discreditable
to any firm in having a stock which
it had marketed advance but the con-
ditions under which phosphates con-
cessions had been floated were anything
but ordinary and this advance was
certainly neither a healthy one nor jus-
tified by known facts so far as any
one knew the dealings were purely
speculative there was no change in the
market conditions of the product they
expected to sell and as yet no report
had been received from the expedition
which had been sent to develop the
properties which were situated far from
the beaten track of ocean traffic the
fosdick contracting company had
chartered a steamer to transport their
men and materials to the two islands
which lay several hundreds of miles
from the coast of south america and
from the estimates made by their chief
engineer whose report appeared in the
original prospectus it would be at least
six months before the first shipment
could be made

  while awaiting the appearance of
his young assistants mr grant went
carefully over that prospectus looking
for some possible clew which would
explain the feverish speculation in the
stock but there was nothing enlighten-


the vovulav magazine

ing in that prosaic array of figures
the experts reports were entirely
technical the mining engineer after
complete surveys and borings estimated
that the supply was practically inex-
haustible and easily brought to the sur-
face the chemists analyses of sam-
ples gathered by himself in widely sep-
arated portions showed that the product
was extremely rich and uniform the
contracting engineers estimates proved
that it could be cheaply transported to
the proposed docks for shipment on
the face of those reports and the anal-
ysis of market conditions the whole
thing looked like a conservative busi-
ness investment but certainly not a
proposition to gamble on before pro-
duction had started

  at first as he studied it the figures
alone appealed to him unless they
lied the proposition was a good one
but knowing the trickery and fraud
which had been practiced to induce lis-
penard douane to promote it he was
confident that they did lie he reflected
a little grimlv that the public had taken
it on appearance just as he had taken
so much for granted in the other
douane affairs and that reflection led
him to examine the prospectus again
and from another viewpoint-examin-
ing the substance rather than the figures
in the reports estimating the human
element rather than the purely business
side the name of his own firm ap-
peared in it in fact the first report bore
its signature certifying that after due
investigation the concessions offered to
the new company were found to be
valid and in proper form following
that came the chemists analyses and
the report of the mining engineer and
as his lips almost mechanically repeated
the names signed to them there was
something in the combination which
stimulated his memory and imagination
professor witherspoon was a man of
brilliant attainments whose research
work had gained him an enviable posi-
tion in the scientific world and colo-
nel rathbone had fairly earned his rep-
utation as a wizard in divining the
location and value of mineral wealth
bidden beneath the surface of the earth

  but well known and highly esteemed
as were those two names in scientific
and business circles there was some-
thing vaguely associated with them in
the back of the old lawyers mind-
something which he could not at the
moment exactly recall but which he
was sure was not connected with their
professional activities neither of them
had been numbered among his clients
in fact he had never even met cither
of them but he was positive that both
of them had been more or less con-
nected with some one of those curious
complications which he had succeeded
in settling out of court but try as
he would he could not recall the exact
circumstances and nothing in that ar-
ray of imposing names staring at him
from the tiers of black boxes served
to refresh his memory fie was still
puzzling over it when spaulding en-
tered with the announcement that phos-
phates concessions was selling two
points higher at -the opening of the
market

  and its still going strong sir he
continued there are a dozen differ-
ent rumors circulating about the curb
one is that a secret report has been sent
back quietly by the developing expedi-
tion a report that they have stumbled
upon unsuspected mineral wealth you
know that the concessions from the
chilean and peruvian governments are
both blanket ones covering all mineral
and mining rights on the two islands

  yes i have just read that statement
in the prospectus but that rumor is
absurd answered mr grant douane
is so anxious to demonstrate his sagac-
ity in promoting the thing that he would
have notified me immediately of such a
report he couldnt have resisted the
temptation to gloat a little

  just a moment sir there is a sus-
picion that lispenard douane is not
in on this you will remember that
the development was to be done on con-
tract which was taken by the fosdick
contracting company they organized
that first expedition chartered the ship
and sent their own men and materials
so far as i can discover no officer of
the phosphates concessions corpora-
g host driven	

tion sailed with them so it is probable
that any report sent back would go to
the fosdick office not to douane we
were discussing yesterday the impos-
sibility of keeping a secret in wall
street sir and there was a very con-
vincing demonstration of that this
morning old joel fosdick was down
there early and as soon as he could
get to his safe-deposit vault he took
out a cabload of gilt-edged securities
and carried them to his brokers

  are you speaking of phosphates
concessions stock asked mr grant
dryly and spaulding smiled and shook
his head

  i havent come to that part yet sir
he continued no those securities
were mostly bonds-of the savings
banks list too fosdick is notoriously
a shrewd and safe investor he has
never been known as a speculator
now transactions between brokers and
their customers are supposed to be ab-
solutely confidential but there is always
the possibility of a leak and soon after
fosdick carried his pigs to market his
brokers sent orders to their curb rep-
resentatives to buy phosphates conces-
sions common and to keep on buying
theres no wash sale about it sir they
are buying it as fast as it is offered
you can guess how quickly that news
flew about and the conclusions which
were drawn from it especially when
the wireless reports state that the
alvarado the steamer chartered by the
fosdick company would arrive at san
francisco at daylight this bids fair
to be a record day in the stock for with
a tip like that flying about all the small
fry are trying to get in its a queer
deal for it doesnt seem possible that
an expert like colonel rathbone could
have spent two months prospecting
those islands without knowing pretty
much ai there was to know but there
is nothing in his report which even
suggests the presence of other de-
posits

 harry how much do you know
about rathbone asked mr grant i
dont mean about his professional abil-
ity well concede that

  well have to concede his integrity

too sir i think he is one of the few
men in his profession whose reports
on a property are always considered
as above question replied spaulding
of course mining is always more or
less a gamble but he has hit it right
every time he has advised development
why his position corresponds  that
of professor witherspoon and more
than one murder trial has been decided
on his expert testimony

  mr grants smile was very grim as
his eyes traveled over the names on
those black boxes

  harry ive learned from experi-
ence that its dangerous to take things
for granted he said theres some-
thing crooked about this whole deal
and i cant understand how any man
in his sober senses can be on the inside
of a crooked deal unless he is crooked
himself im giving douane the bene-
fit of the doubt hes so strongly ob-
sessed with this spiritualisitc delusion
that i believe it has pulled the wool over
his eyes but i cant understand these
experts being mixed up in it if they
are as straight as the world believes
them to be rathbone is clever and
he couldnt be fooled witherspoons
report leaves nothing to the imagina-
tion he gathered his samples himself
so there could have been no substitu-
tion i dont know anything about fos-
dicks engineer but the company must
trust him or they wouldnt make a
three-million-dollar contract on his fig-
ures and estimates i dont want to be
unjust but- he broke off sud-
denly and banged the desk with his fist

  by jove we dont see the forest for
the trees he exclaimed this old
fcsdick was caught in the spiritualistic
net too can it be possible that they
have been able to impose upon men like
witherspoon and rathbone ill con-
fess that they had me puzzled at least
and perhaps riordan was right in say-
ing that under favorable conditions they
might have succeeded in making me a
convert by the way where is ned
it would be worth while tc get him to
make inquiries in his peculiar circle of
acquaintances

  he hasnt been here this morning


the vovular magazine

sir and the office has received no word
from him but from what i know of
his habits i suspect that is just about
what he is up to and if you can spare
me to-day i think it would be wise to
keep an eye on the curb mr grant
i have an idea that it is a sort of
barometer in this case and that the op-
erations there will bear watching

  mr grant nodded assent a little ab-
sent-mindedly perhaps for he was cudg-
eling his brains trying to grasp that
indistinct memory which vaguely cou-
pled together the names of professor
witherspoon and colonel rathbone
he had an engagement to lunch that
day with lispenard douane and he
was rather relieved to receive a note
from the banker asking him to dine
with him that evening instead prepared
to discuss afterward the proposed new
venture in promotion which douane 
co contemplated entering

  until he had more tangible proof of
fraud he did not care to confront
douane and discuss the startling mani-
festations in the old library remem-
bering how thoroughly he was con-
vinced he realized that his faith could
not be shaken by the simple explana-
tions which riordan had offered and
he trusted that before evening his
young assistant would appear with
something in the nature of evidence
which would be irrefutable he had
implicit confidence in riordans ability
to gather that evidence and he waited
impatiently for his return conscious
of an acute feeling of disappointment
when in the middle of the afternoon
it was harry spaulding who entered
after an eager tapping on the door

  the market has closed sir after
one of the merriest maddest days of
trading in the history of the curb
exclaimed spaulding phosphates
concessions has had the center of the
stage all day the last actual transac-
tion was the sale of a hundred shares
at a hundred and seventy that was at
two-thirty and during the last half hour
the offers jumped to two hundred with-
out bringing out another share some
one has apparently cornered the entire
visible supply and does not intend to let

go the report is that it is old joel b
fosdick they say that he has bought
nearly two million dollars worth and
i think the report is true

  thats a big order harry said mr
grant incredulously i should say that
represents pretty much all of his for-
tune and from what i remember of the
old codger he would hardly put all of
his eggs in one basket was your in-
formation straight

  i believe so sir and there is this
much corroboration of it the securi-
ties of the fosdick contracting com-
pany are pretty closely held since the
incorporation of the company until to-
day there have not been ten thousand
dollars worth of them sold on the curb
brit to-day there was a big block of it
on the market and it is supposed to
have come from his vault at any rate
it was offered through his regular bro-
kers and most of the orders to buy
phosphates came from them i hap-
pen to know that he has spent the en-
tire day in their office he never left
there until after the market closed i
saw him come out and heard him tell
the taxi driver to take him to the fos-
dick companys office

  mr grant looked up expectantly as
the door opened but it was only one
of the clerks wtith a card

  i know that you gave orders that
you were not to be interrupted sir
but the old gentleman insisted and he
seems to be in such an excited state
that i consented to bring this in he
said apologetically as he placed it on
the desk before him

  mr grant gave an exclamation of
surprise as he read the name

  speaking of angels harry its joel
b fosdick himself he said its all
right wilson kindly ask him to come
in

  fosdick was bent and decrepit his
wrinkled old skin was ashen in color
but there wras fire in the eyes which
gazed malevolently upon mr grant

 ive been swindled and hum-
bugged  he exclaimed disregarding
the lawyers courteous greeting its
a fine state of affairs when a firm like
ghost-driven



yours joins a lot of crooks like douane
 co to swindle the public

  mr grant rose to his feet and
pointed imperatively to a chair

  mr fosdick you may either sit
down there and tell me quietly what
you mean by such an astounding ac-
cusation or get out and get out quick -
he said sternly it is needless to warn
you that such an accusation made to
others will get you into serious trou-
ble

  fosdick obeyed in so far as he sat
down in the chair indicated by the
lawyers gesture but he did not lower
his voice

  you know what i mean well enough
there it is  he persisted a trembling
finger pointing at the prospectus lying
on the desk between them theres
the name of your firm in black and
white giving the first certificate of hon-
esty to this infernal swindle

  easy mr fosdick our firm states
in that letter that the concessions are
regular and valid and i have every
reason to believe that statement is cor-
rect they are certified to by-

  regular and valid-of course they
are who would want to contest the
title to that worthless junk inter-
rupted fosdick angrily dont you
know thatthe whole thing will be ex-
posed before you are a day older that
the expedition our company was swin-
dled into sending out on a wild-goose
chase has returned and the thing cant
be kept quiet  ive had the first report
by telegraph from our superintendent

i received it only a half hour ago hes
the onlj man who has landed from the
steamer but before to-morrow the cap-
tain and every one else on board will
tell the whole story and it will brand
every man whose name appears on that
lying prospectus as a crook and a swin-
dler

  suppose that you tell us that story
now mr fosdick suggested the law-
yer quietly there will be no brand-
ing of names if it can be avoided and
i would remind you that the fosdick
contracting companys estimate of the
cost of necessary improvements is one
of the main items on this prospectus

it was made upon the report of your
own engineer

  yes a crook who shot himself when
the alvarado was reported a coward
who wouldnt live to face the music 
screamed fosdick thats why i
hurried here before the rest of you
could run away or-

  stop  interrupted mr grant and
the imperative note in bis voice im-
pressed itself we shall have no more
of this we shall start with the as-
sumption that the fosdick company
acted in good faith and take it for
granted that if there has been a mis-
take it was due to the dishonesty of a
trusted employee now if you please
let us have the rational and connected
story without these absurd and unjust
accusations what is wrong with the
property  do you challenge the re-
ports of the chemist and the mining
engineer

  fosdick looked at him suspiciously
but the lawyer met his gaze without
flinching

  mr grant is it possible that you
dont know the truth about that prop-
erty  he asked incredulously if you
dont ill tell you in mighty few words
and ill make em plain the value of
the deposits there isnt the question
its the value of the product landed in
america and not a ton of it will ever
reach here there isnt on an average
more than one day in a month that even
a small boat can land at either of those
islands its impossible for a cargo ship
to get within five miles of them with-
out being smashed on the reefs every
trader on the south american coast
knows that those concessions have been
a joke down there for the last twenty
years it didnt take rathbones and
witherspoons reports to tell people in
south america of the value and extent
of those deposits theyve known all
about em but they also knew that it
was impossible to get at them commer-
cially rathbone did spend two months
going over the property he didnt have
much else to do for the day after he
was landed the usual storm came along
and they couldnt take him off for sixty
days i suppose that youve fixed it


the cpocpular magazine

up so that you are all on the safe side
of the law all of those reports tell
the truth as far as they go the deposits
are undoubtedly there and they are as
rich as you claim it would be easy
enough to mine them to build the docks
and every tiling else but no captain
would be fool enough to try to take his
ship within five miles of em thats
what our superintendent of construc-
tion found when he got down there on
his fools errand thats the story that
will go broadcast to-morrow and its
a story that ought to land a lot of
crooks in jail oh yes the fosdick
company was taken in that combina-
tion of swindlers must have bribed our
engineer the rascal who put a bullet
through his head this morning but that
isnt the worst of it what the com-
pany loses wont break it but think of
me 

  his voice had become shriller and
shriller as he reeled off his story and
at the end it was almost a scream but
when he ceased speaking there was a
marked and pitiful change in his ap-
pearance and demeanor

  defiance had died from his eyes and
he huddled down in his chair a crushed
and broken old man muttering an in-
coherent protest between flabby and
tremulous lips his shaking hands con-
vulsively grasping his heavy walking
stick angry as mr grant had been
at the baseless accusations of fraud
he could not restrain the feeling of pity
which that picture of helpless senility
aroused and although he was himself
guiltless he realized that public opinion
would never acquit his client lispenard
douane of complicity in the swindle
if the story which fosdick had told
proved to be true

  why should we think especially of
you in this matter mr fosdick he
asked quietly even if the case is as
bad as you believe it to be the loss to
your company will not be a killing mat-
ter you have done no work  the
contract and the materials-

  but im ruined-ruined inter-
rupted fosdick his voice a curious
mixture of snarl and whine almost
every dollar i own i invested in the

stock of this company to-day and to-
morrow it will not be worth the price
of waste paper

  grant exchanged glances with harry
spaulding and there was little of sym-
pathy in his voice when he answered

  ah that is a horse of another color
mr fosdick he said grimly you
may have just cause for complaint if
you were induced to take this contract
upon false information but not for
losses incurred in a speculation which
was entered into entirely upon your
own judgment i cant conceive of a
man of your experience and reputed
financial acumen making such a plunge
but that was entirely your own lookout
and that part of your loss you will have
to pockct without complaint

  my own judgment my own judg-
ment  whined the old man as he fum-
bled in his pocket and with a shaking
hand drew out an envelope do you
think that i am fool enough to take
such a chance as that without advice
read that and you will understand-
why your infernal scheme was clever
enough to humbug the greatest finan-
ciers of history even in the spirit
world

  mr grant took it and the color
faded from his face for as he turned
it about in his hands before withdraw-
ing the contents there came to his nos-
trils that faint but unmistakable per-
fume of sweet lavender as a confirma-
tion of the truth of fosdicks accusa-
tion

  the contents a half dozen closely
written sheets of note paper quickly
brought him back to the stern realities
however the communication was os-
tensibly dictated by the spirit of fos-
dicks long-lost twin brother and was
a most astonishing production a jum-
ble of spiritualistic jargon and com-
monplace business it purported to be
an accurate report of the tremendous
interest excited in the spirit world by
the phosphates concessions operations
in the spirit world they were aware
that besides the phosphatic deposits the
islands were crossed and crisscrossed
by large seams of the very highest-
grade ore which would bring untold
ghost-wivbn



wealth to the discoverers and the long
screed ended in an appeal so fervent
that it was almost a command for fos-
dick to avail himself of this inside in-
formation and buy all of the stock he
could get before the other spirit finan-
ciers could cross the boundary line and
give the tip to their respective friends
and relatives

  mr grant looked at the old man in
blank amazement after lie had read the
letter it did not seem possible that
this shrewd and miserly old skinflint
could have been influenced to part with
his carefully hoarded fortune by such
balderdash that he would have delib-
erately sold his gilt-edged securities and
invested the entire proceeds in this wild-
cat venture on such a palpably fraudu-
lent tip but that faint perfume which
came from the paper reminded him
most persistently that lispenard
douane a man of wider vision and of
infinitely greater intelligence had been
quite as thoroughly imposed upon and
he was forccd to acknowledge that
without riordans explanation of the
alleged phenomena he had witnessed
be himself would have had his skepti-
cism and incredulity rudely shaken
but ignorant of riordans discoveries
of the previous evening and the activi-
ties which were keeping him away from
the office he was puzzled to account for
the apparent connection between the
schemes of the two old sharpers who
had gained an influence over fosdick
and the unknown originators of the
plot against the douane millions for
without prompting or suggestion the
old man had mumbled out his account
of how he had received the communi-
cation mentioning doctor sinclair and
professor calkins by name fosdick
looked at him with an eagerness which
was almost childish

  do you get it he whined cant
yott see why i made that investment 
i had it straight from the spirit of
my own brother

  i get it all right but not in the way
you mean mr fosdick answered the
lawyer shaking his head you have
been swindled most outrageously swin-
dled not by the people whom you sus-

pect and accuse but by those you
trusted so implicitly mr fosdick i
happen to know that those men are
arrant frauds they have been playing
upon your cupidity and avarice for
months there is one thing which puz-
zles me i cant understand how they
happened to switch from those indian
reservation oil lands and gold mines
with which they intended to mulct you
to this stock gamble

  the old man was so far rejuvenated
that he straightened up in his chair

  dont you dare to interfere with
that he exclaimed his rheumy old
eyes suddenly blazing youve robbed
me of everything else but ive got
enough hidden away to get even with
that property and its mine by rights
-by the gift of my dead brother who
gave it to me from the spirit world

  but my dear sir dont you under-
stand that it is all a rank swindle
argued mr grant impatiently those
men never heard of your twin brother
until one of them pumped the informa-
tion out of your housekeeper and saw
the entry of his birth in your family
bible that indian story is all man-
ufactured out of whole cloth they in-
tended to get your money with it but
they evidently discovered an easier
way

  fosdick became livid with rage but
it was directed toward the man who
was trying to warn him and to his
amazement mr grant realized that
even the loss of the bulk of his fortune
had not served to lessen the power of
the spiritualistic delusion under which
he labored

  you have no right to try to get in
on this you old scoundrel he
screamed shaking his clawlike fist in
the lawyers face i tell you it is
mine all mine the spirit-the spirit
-the spirit of my-of my brother-
of my dear twin brother-gave it to

me and- his passion was too

much for him and he sank back in
his chair muttering incoherently

  mr grant and spaulding both rose
to their feet but before they could
reach him riordan entered and the ex-
clamation which came from his lips as


the popular magazine

he caught sight offosdicks convulsed
face gave them pause

  for the love of mike chief i be-
lieve im going dippy since ive mixed
up in this ghost business  he said as
he stared at it how did you manage
it how did you get him here so
quick 

  manage it get him here de-
manded mr grant what do you
mean  i had nothing to do with it
he came himself you know him
dont you thats fosdick-joel b
fosdick the man whose twin brothers
spirit has been advising him through
the mediumship of your old friends
calkins and sinclair

  riordan gave a whistle of astonish-
ment and a sheepish grin came to his
lips as he rapped his forehead with his
knuckles

  chief if i hadnt been solid ivory
from the neck up id have tumbled to
all that before he said ruefully
that accounts for marthas name and
a whole lot of things chief maybe
he has been getting advice from his
twin brother but not from his spirit
for he hasnt croaked yet i left him
alive and kicking not more than three
hours ago and i expect hes right there
yet for hes doing a twenty-year stretch
in sing sing hes the man you knew
of as phao trott

  old fosdick aroused perhaps by the
interruption had partially recovered
himself enough at any rate to get a
glimmering of riordans statement and
he drew himself up painfully from his
chair

  there can be no doubt about it
chief theyre alike as two peas con-
tinued riordan thats who old phao
is-this mans twin brother and--

  you lie screamed fosdick with
unsuspected strength raising his heavy
walking stick threateningly above his
head my brother is dead all that he
had belongs to me and-and-- the
stick fell from hands suddenly relaxed
his eyes rolled until only the white
sclerotics were visible between the lids
and one side of his mouth drew about
until it seemed to touch his ear

  riordan jumped toward him with

outstretched arms but before he could
reach him the old mans knees doubled
up and he fell limply to the floor

  its a stroke chief announced
riordan curtly i dont believe it will
do much good but harry youd better
call a doctor

chapter xiii

  the ambulance surgeon quickly con-
firmed riordans opinion that his serv-
ices could be of little use to the stricken
man and it was late in the afternoon
before he was carried from the office
mr grants face was white and hag-
gard as he sank back into his chair
when he was again alone with the two
young men

  boys this miserable matter is fast
developing into a tragedy  he ex-
claimed have you heard of the sui-
cide of fosdicks engineer ned-the
man who made the original report on
the property

  riordan shook his head ive been
too busy to listen to that sort of thing
chief hes only a small cog in the ma-
chinery anyway do you feel up to
keeping that dinner date with douane
this evening

  certainly but i cant say that i look
forward to it with pleasure how did
you know that i was dining there
never mind that now chief see
here how do you want this thing han-
dled  whats the big idea to do it on
the quiet and let a bunch of crooks
get away or to land on them and make
the whole thing public 

  mr grant hesitated ill have to
know all of the circumstances ned
before i can decide that question we
owe a duty to our client and it would
not be a service to the community to
start a financial panic for the sake of
punishing a pair of miserable swin-
dlers like calkins and sinclair tell us
what you have been doing what you
have discovered 

  chief i havent time to do justice
to it riordan protested i wasnt
thinking of those two old pikers
theyve beat it but it wasnt for fear
of the law theres some one with
ghost-driv bn



real brains behind this-with real brains
and a whole lot of inside information
i dont believe that there is anything in
that prospectus on which you could
land any one in jail and yet the whole
thing is crooked as a rams horn our
firms opinion is straight

  certainly absolutely so

  sure your partner hunted for flaws
in the title thats what he was sent to
washington to do there were none
but he never asked about the value of
the stuff and no one volunteered any
information although every one at the
legations knew it was worthless now
chief the experts who were sent down
there must have known the truth but
they kept mum yet you cant hold
rathbone and witherspoon legally re-
sponsible if their technical reports are
justified which i understand they are
the stuff is there it is of the quality
shown by the analyses now those two
men have reputations to sustain they
wouldnt have kept quiet about the
physical conditions unless some one
made them and the only way i figured
that could be done was by holding a
club over em to go back to the origi-
nal proposition chief some one had
something  both of them they were
not straight in this deal but their
crookedness is of the kind the law cant
reach they didnt certify to anything
false they simply didnt tell all they
knew fosdicks engineer could prob-
aby have wriggled out of it too that
whole prospectus was drawn up by
somebody who knew his business and
it smells of the work of a crooked
lawyer

  mr grant sprang from his chair as
if he had been electrified and hurried
to a filing cabinet in the corner of the
room a moment later he returned
to his desk with a bundle of documents
and quickly withdrew a paper from it

  ned youve put me on the track
of something which has been puzzling
me all day he said after glancing over
it these are the documents we col-
lected when we were arranging the case
against hodge  strumel in the pro-
ceedings for disbarment you may re-
member that we had complete evidence

in one case which was so flagrant that
we did not need to go farther but here
is a list of people whom we believed to
have been blackmailed by them we
never went into the cases-it was not
necessary-but two of the names on
that list are rathbone and wither-
spoon

  riordan too jumped to his feet and
again looked at his watch

  great scott chief that settles it
he said thats the one point i was
afraid old phao was steering me wrong
on his mind isnt working entirely
straight and i couldnt believe him
when he whispered those names into
my ear that answers my question
we dont want any publicity about this
thing for stirring up a mess that they
are mixed up with would make your
skeleton collection so uneasy that they
would kick the covers off those boxes
and start a tine ghost dance we could
never land em anyway chief only
jake haselburg and hes got his al-
ready i met him just outside of sing
sing this afternoon and attended to
that myself ill see you later chief

  hold on ned where are you go-
ing what are you up to demanded
mr grant as riordan started for the
door you cant run off this way 
there is a lot you have got to tell me
he continued youngman you men-
tioned a womans name a little while
ago suppose that you start in by tell-
ing us about her i am suspicious that
she plays a big part in your story

  she does chief so big a part that
she is the real reason for a whole lot
of things which have been going on
i cant stop to tell you now but very
soon you can judge for yourself and
it will be up to you  say what shall
be done with her ill tell you all about
it later

  but my boy i am dining with
douane to-night and shall be there all
the evening protested mr grant if
i know just what-

  if you dont know anything you
cant tell anything and that will make
it a lot easier for you for i dont want
you to say a word interrupted rior-
dan chief right here in this office


the popular magazine

to-day youve seen what this spiritual-
istic thing can do to a man you saw
old fosdick a close-fisted miser whose
one god has been money through his
whole miserable distorted life cling to
the delusion after it had been used to
swindle him out of his fortune if
he should recover his senses you could
argue with him for a month of sun-
days and never shake his belief if
you want to cure douane dont try to
do it with argument go up there and
dine with him to-night sit tight no
matter what happens he isnt going
to get out of this without having to pay
the piper but hes got enough to square
the whole thing without hurting him
much that can all be arranged later
the main thing is to cure him so effectu-
ally that he wont continue the dance
thats up to me and ill do it take
as much time as you like over your
dinner-i need every minute i can get
-but dont let on to douane that there
have been any new developments will
you do that chief 

  mr grant nodded a reluctant assent
but when riordan again turned to leave
spaulding confronted him

  ned if you dont let me on this
ill murder you he said resentfully
and riordan looked at him with an ag-
gravating grin on his lips

  you come right along with me and
then youll be sure not to miss any-
thing he answered its time you
were going too chief for ill promise
you a busy evening

chapter xiv

  in lispenard douanes well-ap-
pointed household everything ran
smoothly and without visible friction
that evening nevertheless mr grant
was conscious of some subtle change
in the atmosphere of the hotise and
its occupants douane seemed to be
laboring under a suppressed excitement
which verged on anxiety and more
than once he noticed jackson watching
his masters face with a suggestion of
solicitude in his eyes

  i suppose that you noticed the re-
cent performance of phosphates con-

cessions in the market said douane
as the dinner drew to a close the
public seems to indorse our judgment
in that venture doesnt it

  ive always believed that the part
of the public which gambles on the
curb market is largely composed of
fools answered mr grant and
douane laughed as he nodded assent

  certainly but if the rumors flying
about down there to-day have any
foundation that wasnt so much a case
of gambling as of investment on accu-
rate inside information he said im
beginning to think that i missed an
opportunity to make a tremendous for-
tune  i could have financed that whole
thing myself without straining my re-
sources and i have so much confidence
in it that i would gladly take over the
entire issue at the original price you
neednt look so worried old friend i
mean as a personal investment not for
the bank but after the course the
stock has taken in the past two days
theres apparently no chance i be-
lieve the rumor was straight and old
joel b fosdick has apparently stolen
a march on the lot of us

  i heard something of that i be-
lieve that he invested heavily to-day
do you happen to know what induced
him to do it 

  my dear sir no one has ever been
able to induce fosdick to invest in any-
thing he never bought a bond or a
share of stock without being sure that
he got a good deal more than a dollars
worth for every hundred cents he put
in answered douane that stock
wasnt bought on margin to-day not a
dollars worth of it has been hypothe-
cated for loans it was bought out-
right and paid for its rather signifi-
cant that the contracting companys
ship was reported at daybreak and the
supposition is that fosdick received an
advance confidential report from their
representative from the way he went
after that stock to-day i suspect that
is correct and that the report shows
even greater value than the preliminary
surveys fosdicks right and left hands
havent even a bowing acquaintance in
money matters and i understand that
ghost-qytriven



his brokers have orders to keep on buy-
ing although he gave no reasons as
it isnt probable that the old skinflint
was acting under the same advice which
induced me to take the matter up origi-
nally it is fair to assume that the in-
formation he received shows how
shrewd that advice to me was he has
never been known to touch anything
that wasnt sound but we can forget
phosphates now  our books closed on
that with a handsome balance in favor
of the bank im ready to go into that
other matter with vou i brought all
the data with me from the office and i
think that in an hour i can convince
you that it is even more promising than
our first promotion and i believe that
you will agree with me that it will
be wise for the bank to retain a good
block of the securities after the way
phosphates has turned out i expect that
the offering will be largely oversub-
scribed

  for the first time there was just a
little doubt as to douanes absolute hon-
esty and integrity in his legal advisers
mind fosdicks accusations and the
insinuations which he had heard at the
club did not seem so absolutely un-
justified as he looked at this man of
unquestioned business ability and long
training in the highest finance very
evidently perfectly sane and in full pos-
session of his faculties but who had
risked millions and was prepared to risk
many more on the alleged advice of a
materialized spirit

  now such a suspicion once con-
ceived grows rapidly and grant was
forced to acknowledge to himself that
every circumstance which he had ac-
cepted on appearances as an indication
of douanes entire innocence might
without undue strain of the imagina-
tion be twisted into even more con-
vincing proof that he was acting in
collusion with the perpetrators of the
swindle

  mr grant tried to banish suspicion
from his mind but it would not down
he was in absolute ignorance as to the
nature of the new venture which
douane was about to propose but con-
vinced that phosphates concessions

  b p

was a swindle he was prejudiced
against it in advance and determined
that no spiritualistic hocus-pocus would
be permitted to interrupt a thorough
investigation of every detail douane
however detected no trace of suspicion
or suggestion of antagonism in his at-
titude and he linked his arm familiarly

	r -

in his chatting and laughing as they
walked together to the library

  its so difficult to keep a thing of
this kind quiet until the details are per-
fected that i havent taken any one
else into my confidence he explained
as mr grant seated himself at the
table and looked inquiringly about for
the promised documents i have kept
all of the papers in my private file at
the office and it is such a big thing
that even in the security of my own
home i dont take any chances of pry-
ing eyes he slid back the panel which
concealed the safe as he spoke but
before turning the combination knob
he walked back to the entrance door
and locked it

  well secure ourselves from inter-
ruption-at least from earthly visitors
he continued as he returned to the safe
and grant smiled grimly as he remem-
bered that if riordans explanation of
the spiritual phenomena was correct
the closing of that door would prove
an effectual barrier against the alleged
spirit as well to make sure he walked
over and after trying the knob took
the key from the lock and slipped it
in his pocket as he returned to his
chair douane was standing in front of
the safe holding a large bundle of pa-
pers in one hand as with the other he
moved the account books nervously
about on the shelves

  by jove i cant understand this
he exclaimed that money is gone
it was there when i placed these pa-
pers in the safe before dinner i re-
member distinctly for i had to move
it to make room

 what money the twenty-five
thousand which was so mysteriously re-
turned to you asked grant

  douane nodded assent as he exam-
ined the door of the safe and tested the
bolts by moving them back and forth


the vovuljtr magazine

  yes that money which means a lot
more to me than its face value an-
swered douane ciuicklv i cant un-
i 

derstand it-unless jackson took it out
by mistake the safe has not been tam-
pered with

  jackson has the combination
yes only jackson and myself ex-
cuse me a moment i must look into
this he keeps the household-account
money there and it is possible that he
mixed the parcels up

  grant halted him with a gesture as
he turned toward the door

  im afraid i took an unpardonable
liberty but  wanted to make assurance
double sure to prove that your familiar
spirit would find a material closed door
a more effective barrier than the shad-
owy boundary which she finds it so
difficult to cross he said as he held
out the key douane looked- at him
curiously as he took it there was a
new note in the lawyers voice

  do you mean to say  still have
doubts  he asked incredulously
after seeing her touching her hear-
ing that sweet voice which you must
well remember

  mr grant would have found it diffi-
cult to frame answers which would not
have given offense but he was spared
the effort just as during his last visit
in that room the electric lights com-
menced to flicker and grow dim and
again douane reached out and grasped
him firmly by the wrist his face was
suddenly transformed it became set
and stern and there was a distinct
threat in the eves which a moment
before had been so wistful

  as they sat there in the darkness
douane still clasping mr grants wrist
with a grip which was almost painful
that mysterious light-at first only a
glowing ball near the floor-again ap-
peared it gradually assumed a col-
umnar form in the center there was
that same curious movement as of
something enmeshed struggling to es-
cape gradually the light seemed to
take on substance to assume the form
of flowing draperies and then the same
face suddenly flashed from the dark-
ness identically the same in feature

and coloring and an exact replica of
that jessica brewster whom both of
them remembered so vividly but wear-
ing a very different expression from
that radiant happiness which had glori-
fied it at the previous materialization

  wonderingly mr grant realized that
the dormant and underlying strength of
character and determination which he
had suspected in jessica brewster when
he dealt with her in the flesh was visibly
evident in the face of this ethereal crea-
ture which claimed to be a materializa-
tion of her spirit eyes which seemed
able to pierce the veil of darkness which
enveloped them looked at them without
flinching or wavering and there was
no suggestion of a smile  the delicate
lips nor of indecision in the resolute
set of the chin douane was quick to
note the change and he uttered a little
cry of dismay as he released his grip
of grants wrist and rose from his
chair

- jessica my darling what is it
what has happened  he exclaimed
and without speaking she checked his
impetuous advance with a quick and
imperative gesture she had remained
standing in the place she had first ap-
peared separated from them by at least
twenty feet and there was something
in her posture which suggested readi-
ness for instant flight

  that is well she said quietly after
douane had baited it will be even
better if you resume your seat and keep
it very much has happened lis-
penard douane things which make it
necessary that you and your companion
should listen to me for never again
shall i appear to you as i have so many
times during-

  douane was feeling about for his
chair in the darkness and a cry of
protest from his lips interrupted her
there was a quick swirl of the luminous
draperies as she turned as if about to
flee for in his agitation douane had
overturned the chair with a startling
crash strangely enough it wras grant
who prevented the immediate termina-
tion of the stance for reaching out
he grasped douane by the arm and
held him firmly
ghost-drvobn



  let her finish what she has to say
he said quietly the figure paused ab-
ruptly in its flight and there was a little
smile of gratitude on her lips as grant
pressed douane into the chair from
which he had risen to intercept him

  it will not take me very long-if
you will aid me she continued i
have a confession to make and you
must not make it harder for me i will
only ask you to believe that i have made
a great mistake an honest one i
believed that my appearance here gave
comfort and happiness that mr dou-

  it did it does you must not
desert me protested douane pitifully
the happiest moments i have known
have been spent in this room with you
you must not leave me alone again 
wait until i have finished and then
tell me if you feel the same she an-
swered a curious hungry wistfulness
in her eyes let me get the worst
of it over with quickly please let
me tell you that with the best inten-
tions in the world i have made a hor-
rible mistake that through following
the advice which i gave to you in all
sincerity and good faith you have im-
periled your fortune your good name
your standing in the community the
phosphates concessions company is a
huge swindle from start to finish and
i have been the unwitting instrument
which made its perpetration possible
and although i do claim honesty of
purpose i am not what you believe me
to be-the materialized spirit of jes-
sica brewster you must do me the
justice tf acknowledge that i have
never claimed to be that carried away
by a fancied likeness you fastened that
identity upon me i have many sins

to answer for but-

  shaking the old lawyers hand from
his arm douane again rose to his feet
and started forward

  i do do not care what you say what
sins you have committed-you are my
jessica he exclaimed passionately
some horrible adverse influence has
crept between us to separate us now
as it did twenty years ago but i swear

you will stay with me or i shall go
with you

  he fairly jumped toward her his
arms oustretched but a heavy chair was
suddenly shoved between them and
through the darkness came that sound
of a ripping fabric or a finger nail
rasped across a wooden surface with
a lictle cry of dismay the radiant figure
stepped back and with incredible swift-
ness repeated that curious procedure
of dematerialization which mr grant
had found so convincing before this
time however he was master of him-
self and suspecting more than half
the truth he quickly took advantage of
the interruption to douanes advance
and threw his arms about him
douanes struggles quickly ceased for
the last trace of that curious radiance
had disappeared before he could move
the heavy chair aside and they were
left in complete silence and darkness

  then the full power of the electric
lights was suddenly switched on and
standing in the exact spot where the
girls figure had been with the dark
oak paneling and its distorted shadows
for a background was a very substan-
tial and human male form surmounted
by the very practical head of mr ned
riordan

  chief i think i have proved to you
that my guess was right he said
quietly i managed the whole per-
formance to-night but thats only the
curtain raiser for the real thing

  freed from the restraining clasp of
the old lawyers arms douane strode
forward

  who are you-what is the meaning
of this outrageous intrusion  he de-
manded furiously

  riordan side-stepped backed against
the wall and placed one hand behind
him

  just a moment mr douane he
said mr grant will tell you all about
me and my intrusion here isnt the
worst jolt you are going to get this
evening it wont do any good to call
for jackson and his bunch to throw
me out with the twenty-five thousand
he pinched from your safe hes well
on his way to some place beyond the


the cpocpular magazine

reach of extradition and he wised me
up to this before he beat it

  as he finished speaking he turned
and pointed to the wall and one of
the panels slipped noiselessly aside re-
vealing a narrow staircase which evi-
dently led to the basement

  thats why locking the door wasnt
sufficient chief he said warding off
douane with one hand as he closed the
panel with the other it would be
wiser if you could inducemr douane
to listen to what we have to tell him
before he goes to meet what he will
find at the foot of that staircase

chapter xv

  stunned and bewildered douane was
easily persuaded to seat himself at the
writing table and he gazed across it
with puzzled eyes at the face of this
mysterious newcomer who had made
such astonishing statements and who
seemed to know his house better than
he did himself he acknowledged mr
grants introduction and brief explana-
tion with a curt mechanical nod and
regaining a measure of self-control
motioned to riordan to be seated

  i think that i am strong enough
to stand those jolts which you threat-
ened he said in a voice so harsh that
it sounded strangely in his own ears
the statements you have made cer-
tainly require explanation and the
quicker you make them the better i
shall be pleased

  mr douane i fear that you are not
going to be pleased with anything i
have to say answered riordan quietly
you havent heard the truth in a long
time you have been the victim of one
of the most elaborate swindling schemes
ever devised-a scheme which has kept
you in a fools paradise do you want
the plain unvarnished truth now
all of it snapped out douane
you need not attempt to spare my
feelings nothing can hurt me now

 riordan turned to mr grant

  chief ive got to dig back into
ancient history the kind that you have
stored away in those black boxes the
kind that you tried to make straight

and a bunch like hodge  strumel
tried to make crooked he said you
drove them out of business it looked
as if they were down and out when
you finished with them but they have
come back they didnt accumulate
written archives but they had good
memories and they had a lot of stuff
stored away under their hats an inside
knowledge of pretty much every
crooked deal for the last twenty years
they kept under cover but remember
that they had something on a whole
lot of people and they hadnt forgot-
ten how to use it there is the key to
this whole swindle and they had
something else chief an inside knowl-
edge of just how far they could go
without getting outside the law and
they went the limit douane struck
the table with his clenched fist

  get down to our business he ex-
claimed impatiently we have no in-
terest in the history of those scoun-
drels

  perhaps not but they had a mighty

keen interest in yours and they came
to know more about it than you do
yourself answered riordan perhaps
you will be more patient if i tell you
that it is those scoundrels who have
used you as a cats-paw to pull their
chestnuts from the fire and that they
were clever enough to get away with
close to three millions of easy money
because you fell for it see here mr
douane im mighty sorry for you and
i dont want to make it harder youve
had a raw deal and it started twenty
years ago when your father instructed
 r grant to arrange with jessica
brewster to divorce you

  douane jumped to his feet his face
livid with passion by what right do
you drag her name into this  he ex-
claimed angrily

  riordan met his blazing eyes without
flinching

  mr douane you need have no fear
that the name of jessica brewster will
be smirched by anything i shall say
he answered quietly from all that i
have learned about her she must have
been one of the finest squarest women
ever born into this world of sorrow
ghost-driven



now sit down and listen to what i
have to say

  m r grant looked at his young pro-
tege wonderingly there had been an
astonishing development in the boy dur-
ing the past few hours-a development
which brought to the surface all of the
strength and worldly knowledge which
had accumulated in his years of train-
ing beneath the rough exterior which
he had acquired as an arab of the
streets he seemed absolutely confi-
dent and sure of himself and while
there was nothing of arrogance in his
attitude he tacitly claimed at least a
temporary mastership of the whole sit-
uation and even douane accustomed
to deference and to laying down the law
both in business and social life was
so impressed that he virtually conceded
that mastership by obeying the injunc-
tion to be seated	-
chief when i tell you that hodge
took refuge in south america when
you made things too hot for him here
in new york and that strumel joined
him there after he was released from
prison you will be able to figure out
the main points of the proposition
continued riordan quietly in spite
of the big incomes they had made in
their crooked practice they didnt have
much left they had always been big
spenders and lost consistently in wall
street they didnt carry much in the
way of cash with them but they did
carry away a lot of information which
could be readily turned into money
when they discovered a way to utilize
it it didnt take them long to dis-
cover the way every roustabout on
both coasts of south america has at
least one government concession to sell
to the unsuspecting gringo and ilodge
saw a quick and easy opening to pass
the buck not to keep you in suspense
ill tell you now that erskine the al-
leged englishman is in reality our old
friend hodge and he cooked up the
whole scheme he got those conces-
sions to the phosphates signed sealed
and delivered in due and proper form
there was no opposition for every one
knew that they were commercially
valueless there is no question about

the deposits being exactly as repre-
sented but there is absolutely no way
of getting the material to market mr
douane i believe that it was at your
suggestion that professor witherspoon
and colonel rathbone were sent down
there to look over the field 

  douane nodded certainly i
selected them because they were the
leading authorities in their respective
lines

  riordan smiled you thought you
did he said grimly as a matter of
fact those names were probably thrust
upon you in about the same way a con-
jurer forces a particular card on the
man who believes that he is exercising
complete freedom of choice hodge
wanted those two men sent down there
and ill wager that if you think back
youll remember that the names were
suggested to you indirectly perhaps
im not sure about all of the minor
details but well assume that they ac-
cepted your commission in all sincerity
and honesty hodge attended to the
rest of it after they arrived on the
ground and you got just the kind of
reports that he wanted you to get
signed by names which inspired confi-
dence when you submitted those re-
ports to the public

  see here mr riordan you are go-
ing too far exclaimed douane an-
grily those men bear the highest
reputations for-

  cut it out interrupted riordan
sharply for just a moment letting the
repressed street urchin come to the sur-
face if the chief should loosen up
and tell ten per cent of what he knows
youd see a good many bright and shin-
ing lights scurrying for the tall tim-
ber theres one item he did know and
he could tell it without betraying con-
fidence  both witherspoon and rath-
bone had been in hodge  strumels
clutch before when they got down
there they both found out that the
clutch hadnt relaxed possibly they
couldnt have been dragooned into de-
liberately making false reports but they
certainly were bullied into keeping
quiet about the part which would have
queered the whole game ill tell you


the epopular magazine

this much-it didnt take long to dig
it up after i had the tip both of those
men persona deserve the reputations
for integrity and ability which you
gave them but each of them was un-
fortunate in his family relations
witherspoon has a worthless son whom
he idolizes and hodge had evidence
which would have sent him to prison
for the rest of his life rathbone re-
signed from the engineer corps of the
army to avoid an investigation which
would have betrayed that his extrava-
gant wife had been selling advance in-
formation concerning government con-
tracts to a lot of crooks-clients of
hodge  strumel think it over and
youll remember that those names were
suggested to you and ive just told
you the reason for their selection
douane evidently had been doing a
lot of thinking and just as evidently
found little of comfort in the result

  do you realize just what you are
saying-what you are implying he
demanded i have nothing to con-
ceal  perhaps those names were sug-
gested to me but my selection was in-
dorsed by advice which was infallible-
by one having sources of information

which-

  excuse me we shall come to that
part of it in due time interrupted
riordan again his marked courtesy in
curious contrast to his former abrupt-
ness i know all about every source
of information connected with this
business there were just two of them
-the memories of hodge  strumel
and their knowledge of crooked manip-
ulation they had to keep away from
the jurisdiction of the american courts
but they still maintained control of the
machinery they had perfected during
the many years they had more or less
successfully bamboozled them now
they didnt have any crooked hold on
you mr douane but they did have a
pretty good bunch of inside information
about your most private affairs and a
strangle hold on your most trusted per-
sonal servant jackson his foot slipped
when he was a young man do you
remember when one of your fathers
horses an odds-on favorite in the bet-

ting was beaten by a nose in the fu-
turity 

  of course it was a piece of bad
racing luck answered douane evi-
dently puzzled by the irrelevant ques-
tion

  it was a piece of mighty tough luck
for jackson he had so fully shared
your fathers confidence that he bor-
rowed money from him-without men-
tioning it-to bet on it said riordan
dryly hodge fixed that for him he
played the races regularly and jack-
son had been giving him the inside in-
formation from the douane stable rut
hodge wasnt entirely a philanthropist
he tool a written acknowledgment of
the obligation duly attested before a
notary and he slipped in a little joker
which made that acknowledgment a
savorn confession that jackson was a
thief and he filed it away for future
reference

  douane glanced toward the safe and
there was hopeless bewilderment in his
eyes when they again met riordans

  will you leave me faith and belief
in a single human being when you have
finished  he asked bitterty i should
have trusted jackson with everything
i had in the world i can hardly be-
lieve what you tell me but that money
is gone and--

  riordans face softened and for the
first time there was a note of sympathy
in his voice when he continued after
the older man had paused abruptly

  i hope to inspire faith and belief
where it is deserved-and there is a
whole lot of good in human nature as
i have every reason to know he said
kindly there was good in jackson
for instance lots of it after that one
slip he served you faithfully and prob-
ably never cheated you out of a penny
until jake haselburg working under
hodges instructions flashed that half-
forgotten paper on him you trusted
him implicitly in many ways you even
left the supervision of the changes in
this room in his hands i understand
the work was done during your absence
abroad 

  but how long ago was that asked
ghost-driven



mr grant surely those rascals had
not started to--

  it was just two years-so jackson
told me answered riordan before
douane could speak they had
started to lay pipe even before that
they were playing for big stakes and
didnt neglect anything in the prepa-
rations now mr douane youll have
to brace yourself and take one of the
jolts i promised you remember that
those men knew all about your tireless
search for your former wife they had
fleeced you through it and it didnt
take them long to find out that after
exhausting every usual method of
search you had taken to the unusual and
started the round of spiritualistic me-
diums that made it easy for them
without making many exceptions it is
safe to assert that those fakers are
crooks recruited largely from the class
which had formed hodge  strumels
clientele in the old days to go back
to the original proposition they had
something on pretty much every one
of them and those they missed were
easily rounded up all but one-the one
they most needed in their business the
only one who could be depended upon
to produce a convincing materialization
-phao trott

  douanes face flushed must we go
into that  he asked i know all about
the horrible end of that mans career
but there are reasons wrhy i should
rather not discuss him i never saw
anything but the best side of his char-
acter

  yes we must go into everything-
and right to the bottom of it an-
swered riordan earnestly just re-
member that we are dealing with men
who were without moral compunction
or the bowels of compassion phao
trott wasnt a saint he wras an ar-
rant old trickster but there was not an
ounce of harm in the old boy nor a
mean hair in his head and he did a
lot more good than harm he trailed
along with that bunch of crooks for a
while not knowing just what they were
up to they paid him liberally for their
lessons remember that they didnt
have anything on him and then quite

by accident they made a discovery he
had an assistant who wras exactly what
they had been looking for in their
eagerness they pretty well exposed their
whole hand and phao threw his down
refusing to play longer in the game
right there was where the wthole
scheme threatened to blow up and
right there was wrhere those two schem-
ing devils screwed down the lid
working through jake haselburg the
lawyer for most of the crooks in new
york they had prepared a mass of evi-
dence against phao perjured every
item of it but convincing enough to
convict him they showed phao just
where he stood and where he would
get off if he dared to make a defense
other than the very perfunctory one
which haselburg would present to the
court they would not rest wtith him
they would involve in his disgrace this
very assistant for whose sake he had
rebelled phao took his medicine-a
twenty-year sentence for a crime so
revolting that even his criminal asso-
ciates in prison shunned him-a crime
of which he was absolutely innocent
and there for the moment we shall
leave him

  the flush had died from douanes
face leaving it blanched almost livid
and he gazed at riordan with horror-
distended eyes

  this is horrible too horrible it
cant be true he protested he
couldnt no man could remain silent
under--

  phao trott did theres the answer
said riordan curtly but wrell leave
him now and go back to jackson  its
all part of the same scheme jackson
carried out directions absolutely in
making these alterations but they were
not the directions you had given to
him they contained additions sug-
gested by agents of hodge  strumel
one of them was this movable panel
which conceals a narrow staircase lead-
ing to a room in the basement an-
other was a switchboard which per-
mitted an operator to do about what he
pleased with the electric lights the
house was out of commission during
your absence and that gave jackson


the pocpulacr magazine

the opportunity to dismiss most of the
servants w hen he opened up again
he replaced them with new ones-he
was working under the whip-and they
were selected by jake haselburg and
then mr douane the stage was set
and the performance began in your
office you were approached in the reg-
ular course of business and asked to
float the phosphates concessions com-
pany  in the ordinary course of busi-
ness you would probably have turned
the proposition down and thats where
the value of this plant demonstrated
itself you would have laughed at
business advice in a clairvoyants joint
you would have been suspicious of any
materialization in a mediums parlor
remember that the managers of this
conspiracy had unusual means of ac-
quiring accurate information and they
knew every detail of every experience
you had ever had with the fakers whom
you had consulted but the fact that
you persisted in consulting them was
enough for them they knew if they
went at it in the right way they could
land you-and they proved that they
were right

  douane turned to face mr grant
when riordan voluntarily paused in his
narration

  are you able to vouch for the truth
of these statements he asked in a
tone which made the question a chal-
lenge if not i think it is useless
to go farther to listen to wild and
unfounded accusations which will be
painful

  mr grant hesitated and riordan
quickly realizing the truth came to his
assistance

  chief i warned you this afternoon
that shattering delusions of a certain
character would not prove an easy mat-
ter he said ignoring douane im
not asking you to vouch for the truth
of my statements ive got absolute and
convincing proof of every one of them
and ill produce it in proper time but
i think it might save time and trouble
if you would tell what you know of
old fosdicks experiences i dont
blame mr douane for doubting me
its always difficult to convince a man

of things he doesnt want to believe
perhaps it will let him down more eas-
ily if he knows that he is not the only
victim and he must have known that
fosdick wasnt an easy proposition

  lispenard pm afraid that you will
have to swallow a bitter dose for i
have every reason to believe that rior-
dan has stated nothing but the truth
said mr grant you will also have
to retract one statement which you
made at dinner-that it was obvious
that joel fosdick in plunging on phos-
phates could not have been influenced
by the same sort of advice which in-
duced you to father the flotation i
have reason to know that the advice
was precisely of that nature an al-
leged communication from the spiritual
world it is absolutely incomprehen-
sible to me-the whole thing was so
transparently fraudulent-but on the
strength of that advice he sold the best
investment securities in the market
securities representing the bulk of the
fortune for which he had slaved and
invested the proceeds in this wildcat
venture it was a letter purporting to
come from the spirit of his twin brother
-palpably a fraud-and yet fosdick
followed the directions which it con-
tained without a moments hesitation
and acquired a mass of worthless stock
which has only the value of waste
paper

  douane had listened attentively but
the effect upon him was not at all what
the old lawyer had expected

  instead of carrying conviction the
revelation of the motives which had
led to fosdicks wild and spectacular
plunge in the curb market evidently
aroused hope and strengthened dou-
anes weakened confidence and mr
grant was amazed to see that it had
brought a smile in which there was a
stiggestion of triumph to his lips

  pm afraid that i shall have to ask
you to retract one part of that state-
ment he said defiantly the market
quotations hardly bear out your asser-
tion that the stock is worthless as
for the rest of it knowing your avowred
skepticism i can hardly admit that you
are an impartial judge as to the authen-
ghost-driven



ticity of a spiritual communication
fosdick is a shrewd and suspicious
man i cannot believe that he would
be imposed upon so easily there have
been many startling and amazing state-
ments made here this evening and i
have bad one most astonishing revela-
tion a revelation which i can only be-
lieve was dictated by the adverse and
hostile atmosphere which seems to have
intruded itself into my house do you
who have twice been vouchsafed the
privilege to see with your own eyes and
hear with your own ears seriously tell
me that you still doubt that the skep-
ticism which vou expressed when you
entered this room has not been ban-
ished 

  douane do you think that i have
taken leave of my senses retorted
mr grant impatiently dont you un-
derstand plain english-that this al-
leged materialization this evening was
an imposition managed by riordan to
convince you  how he accomplished
it f do not know myself but it is evi-
dent that he has acquired control of
the machinery devised by the scoundrels
who have been imposing upon you and
employed it to show you how you have
been duped and swindled

  douane rose to his feet his eves blaz-
ing his face distorted with anger but
riordan stepped forward and con-
fronted him

  sit down  he said quietly but there
was authority in his tone the chief
lias given it to you straight but theres
a lot that he does not know i under-
stand just how hard it is to give up a
delusion which brings happiness we
saw old fosdick cling to his to the last
gasp to-day and hell never let go ill
tell you this straight mr douane the
same bunch of crooks who fleeced him
have been after you they picked him
up by accident stole him from two
miserable old pikers in the spiritual-
istic swindle who intended to pluck
him for a few thousand ill tell you
how it came about as a first propo-
sition let me tell you that you were
flimflammed by alcantara and menen-
dez into believing that they left the
stock which was issued to them in that

safe-deposit vault in your bank they
smuggled it out and if there is any-
thing in that vault at all it is probably
waste paper they unloaded at the
top of the market and when the bot-
tom dropped out of it they picked it
up again for a song they had dis-
covered an opportunity to make an-
other killing viih it for they were
not only the wops of the financial
district they were the wops who
acting under the direction of erskine
alias hodge had put the fear of god
into the hearts of the spiritualistic
brotherhood

  calkins and sinclair thought they
were fooling them but they knew
everything which was going on and
simply held off until the fruit was ripe
enough to pick then they stepped in
and took it and those two old rascals
with the knowledge of what phao trott
received for rebelling- didnt dare to
make even a protest the wops were
wise enough to see that the jig was up
when i got after phao trott and they
made a quick turn for get-away money
they had all of that stock and they
fed it out to old fosdick as fast as
he could absorb it they collected the
cash too and they carried it away with
them as soon as the market closed
jake haselburg wont be found in his
usual haunts to-morrow i didnt stop
to make explanations but what i did
to him up the river this afternoon prob-
ably convinced him that he would be
persona non grata perhaps i com-
pounded a felony in letting jackson
get away i suspected that he had taken
that money but i thought it was cheap
at the price he was forced into his
rascality and that will only be a drop
in the bucket when you come to square
up the losses he put me wise to all
of this business made a clean breast
of it and showed harry spaulding how
to manipulate the switchboard while i
managed the rest of the performance
mr grant instructed me to be careful
about creating a scandal

  douanes anger had vanished and he
relaxed helplessly in his chair but
there was a hopelessness an abject mis-
ery in his expression which caused mr


the cpopulacr magazine

grant to rise and place a friendly hand
upon his shoulder

  t think i was right in giving that
advice lispenard he said  this has
been a terrible business it is going
to require a great sacrifice upon your
part to adjust it but it would be a
public calamity to have the matter made
public the principals in the conspir-
acy have protected themselves so care-
fully that i doubt if we could bring
them to justice in any case you will
have to stand the loss it may take a
considerable part of your fortune but
a douane cannot-

  douane shuddered under the kindly
meant pressure of that hand and draw-
ing away looked at him with resentful
eyes

  even if this incredible story is true
you need have no fear that any inno-
cent person will suffer loss through
me he said bitteily that is a small
part of it all for more than twenty
years ago you and my father inflicted
an injury which makes everying else
seem trivial now you will both of
you do me the justice to listen to what
i have to say although you apparently
believe that i am a poor weak deluded
fool perhaps in my business venture
i have been imposed upon i will admit
that if your statements are true i have
been the victim of unscrupulous and
clever scoundrels how it has come
about i do not know how they man-
aged to impose their -wills beyond ter-
restrial limits i cannot conccive but
there is so much that we cannot under-
stand that it would be a rash man who
asserted that anything is impossible

  he paused for a moment and then
ignoring riordan addressed himself
solely to mr grant

  old friend i shall leave the arrange-
ment of this business matter to you
he continued you have acted wisely
in avoiding publicity i know that you
will act justly in dealing with those
who are threatened with financial loss
through trust in the name of douane
i will concede the cleverness of mr
riordan i appreciate that he has taken
advantage of conditions created by a
band of sharpers who took advantage

of real conditions i know of many
of the frauds of spiritualism as prac-
ticed by the so-called mediums and
i will even admit that his performance
to-night was extremely clever and con-
vincing but as i look back on it now
i realize that it was fraudulent per-
haps it was because my intense desire
dulled my perception that i was for
the moment imposed upon but i now
realize that the wretched woman whom
he introduced into this room was an
impostor it was not that sweet spirit
who has so often visited me in my soii-
ture fearlessly suhmiting to my em-
brace but a miserable trickster base
enough to trifle at his dictation with
the most sacred human emotions it
was a clever deception-the likeness
was skillfully imitated-but i now re-
alize that i was conscious of the dif-
ference from the moment she entered

  mr grant could hardly credit his
ears but riordan was evidently not in
the least surprised at the persistence
of douanes credulity and before the
old lawyer found words to protest he
stepped between them

  mr douane this situation has de-
veloped to the stage where the less
that is said the less there will be to
mend he said motioning to mr grant
to be silent  there will be no more
manipulation of the electric lights for
my friend harry spaulding who pre-
sided at the switchboard is more pleas-
antly occupied i realize that nothing
we can say could shake your conviction
that you have many times been in com-
munication with the materialized spirit
of jessica brewster nothing could
convince joel fosdick that he had not
received direct communications from
the spirit of his dead brother but that
is susceptible of proof which cannot be
disputed for that brother still lives
he is the man who under the name of
phao trott is serving an undeserved
sentence in prison and now i shall
offer you as indisputable a proof that
you too have been deluded and it
rests with you to find in the reality a
recompense for your shattered delu-
sion

  he stepped over to that portion of
ghost-driven



the paneling on which the antlered head
cast distorted shadows and the panel
slipped noiselessly aside in response to
a tap of his finger tips from the re-
cess behind it-for the first time in
the full illumination of the electric
lights-martha fosdick stepped into
the room a living breathing image of
the woman douane had mourned for
twenty years

chapter xvi

  of all the people in the room the
girl was the most self-possessed
dressed in a simple street costume her
face innocent of the slightest trace of
make-up her only jewelry the old-
fashioned locket which jessica brew-
ster had worn she seemed to douane
and grant a veritable remcarnation of
the girl whom they remembered so viv-
idly perhaps enlightened by the tri-
umphant smile on riordans lips the
old lawyer guessed the truth but the
exclamation which rose to his lips was
silenced by a significant gesture of his
young assistants hand

  douane who had fully expected that
riordan would introduce some brazen
creature who had acted as his accom-
plice in trickery and had prepared him-
self to utter the bitterest and most
scornful reproaches stood rigid and
silent as if fearing by sound or move-
ment to frighten her away and it was
not until harry spaulding followed her
into the room and closed the panel be-
hind him that he found himself then
as an exclamation in which welcome
seemed to be struggling with protest
camc from his lips he started toward
her but riordan quickly stepped be-
tween them

  mr douane before we go any far-
ther you must listen to a word of ex-
planation he said this is martha
fosdick the ward protegee and most
competent and efficient assistant of wil-
liam fosdick known in spiritualistic
circles as phao trott a remarkably
clever materializing medium she will
tell you how she happened to become
involved in all of this trickcry of which
you have been the victim but i wish

to make it easier for her by assuring
you that she personated to-night that
spirit which you have identified as the
spirit of jessica brewster that she has
personated it on every occasion upon
which it has appeared to you if you
will be patient it will simplify things
tremendously just remember this-
and you too mr grant will please to
bear it in mind you an educated
cultivated man reared in an atmosphere
in which spiritualism never intruded
denied nothing which wealth and posi-
tion could give and afforded every ad-
vantage for training and development
have in your maturity been completely
deluded in listening to the story which
martha fosdick has to tell you re-
member that from the day of her birth
when phao trott assumed the care of
her she has been reared in surround-
ings of trickery and mystery

  confound it man do you think that
a woman appearing in that likeness
needs your advocacy with me  ex-
claimed douane get out of the way 
let her speak for herself cant you
see that she must tell me the truth or

that i--

  mr douane she will tell you the
truth-as much of it as she knows-
but you must let her tell it in her own
way interrupted riordan and there
is one thing of which i must warn you
before she starts for months she has
believed that phao trott the man who
gave to the nameless little waif his own
name and who gave her the only pro-
tection and care she ever knew was
dead it was only to-day that from his
own lips she learned the truth that to
save her the shame of being involved
in the horrible conspiracy framed
against him he had gone uncomplain-
ingly to a living tomb until to-day she
never knew the name of the mother
who bore her she is still ignorant of
the name of the father whose blood
runs in her veins

  douanes face suddenly went white
for the love of god man dont tor-
ture me  he exclaimed brokenly tell
me that name-of the mother

  only a litle while ago you forbade
me to utter it answered riordan


the vovular magazine

quietly i told you then that from
all i had learned of her she was one
of the finest squarest women i had
ever heard of i wish that i might add
the wisest for that would have saved
a lot of trouble and sorrow perhaps
in the end she would have spoken but
death came suddenly and unexpectedly
 seal her lips within an hour of her
childs birth and she left it without a
name without legal formalities phao
trott virtually adopted it giving it the
name which was rightfully his he
was a fanatic on the subject of spirit-
ualism and beneath all of the trickery
with which he made a pitiful living for
himself and the litle girl he was always
delving and digging for something real
and tangible for what he called the
great truth which he believed would
place him in full communication with
the spirit world remember that she
learned all that she knew from his
teaching and as she developed into a
sensitive imaginative and intelligent
girl he employed her more and more
in what he called his experiments mak-
ing her adept in simulating conditions
through which he believed that he
would reach the truth for which he
sought from him she never received
anything but kindness and considera-
tion in all of his so-called experiments
she was never used save to bring happi-
ness and comfort to the lonely and heart
weary and then in all innocence she
became the tool of the most unscrupu-
lous band of sharpers the unwitting
instrument to swindle you

  lie stopped abruptly and extending
his hand to the girl led her to a seat
on the far side of the table from mr
grant and douane the latter yearn-
ing and heart hungry noted enviously
her smile of gratitude and the absolute
trustfulness in her eyes as for just a
moment she looked at the face of the
younger man before turning to study
those which confronted her across the
broad table

  mr riordan has told you the truth
-as much as he knew of it-as much
as i knew myself until a few hours
ago she said quietly in a voice which
intensified the memories which the like-

ness to jessica brewster had aroused
there is nothing to be gained by going
into exact details but never for a mo-
ment did the question of right or wrong
occur to me when i was working with
papa phao in what he called his ex-
periments  to me they were neither
more nor less than that i was just
what mr riordan has described to you
-his assistant made skillful by his
teaching and always when i helped
him he was watchful and alert hoping
that he might discover through me the
truth for which he was seeking and
mr douane in imposing upon you i
believed that i was carrying out his
instructions for i too was imposed
upon there is very very much which
i do not understand but i believed
that papa phao wtas dead and i saw
no wrong in acting for the men with
whom i knew that he had been asso-
ciated during the last weeks of his life
i have been kept alwajs secluded in
ignorance of the world to-day i have
learned more of evil than i knew ex-
isted mr douane i knew nothing
of the contents of that package which
i placed in your hands i found it in
the little box in which papa phao had
preserved for me a few little keepsakes
of that mother i had never seen-whose
name i never knew until phao trott
whispered it to me to-day would you
like to know why my mother jessica
brewster refused to avail herself of
it 

  douane nodded assent he seemed
afraid to trust his voice in speech

  i learned to-day from a little book
-her diary-of which phao told me
the hiding place she continued for
the first time a little tremor in her voice
after her death he sealed it up with-
out even opening the covers-to keep
for me when i reached womanhood
no names were written in it mr
douane but it was a very human doc-
ument-the story of a girl abnormally
sensitive prouder than lucifer and as
mr riordan very justly said perhaps
not blessed with worldly wisdom cer-
tainly not with worldly experience she
was rnarried mr douane legally mar-
ried to a man whom she loved de-
ghost-wwbn



votedly for some reason which she
docs not state that marriage was legally
dissolved but between the lines i read
the reason her pride was wounded to
the quick ignorant of many things
which she should have known she was
anxious only to get away and hide her
hurts she consented readily to every
proposition which would hurry the nec-
essary legal procedure and in an in-
credibly short space of time she was
legally freed she would have starved
before she would have touched that
money  she had taken it mechanically
to hasten the proceedings perhaps she
was not entirely sane through every
page of that diary there is a subtle be-
trayal of high principle of chivalry
which does not fit the common stand-
ards of to-day she appreciated that
she had tacitly agreed to do everything
possible to prevent the knowledge of
her marriage from becoming public
fven when she realized her condition
she never for a moment thought of vio-
lating that agreement mr riordan is
mistaken in one thing gentlemen death
did not come to her unexpectedly al-
most the last entry in that diary proves
that she knew that she was about to
die she firmly believed that her unborn
child would not come into the world
alive that diary betrayed no one she
had destroyed everything by which the
identity of the man who abandoned
her could be established just one thing
she left to be delivered-a sealed pack-
age so carelessly and openly left about
that no one suspected its intrinsic value
she believed that it would carry to at
least one man whose name it bore the

sure message-

  but dont you understand-have
you not guessed-do rou not know that
i am---

  stop she interrupted sternly
there has been too much misunder-
standing in the past there shall be none
in the present nor in the future if plain
speaking will prevent it remember
this until to-day the name of jessica
brewster meant nothing to me dozens
of times before when i have helped
phao trott in his alleged materializa-
tions i have been identified by other

names which meant as little those who
bring their sorrows to a medium delude
themselves when i first entered this
room brought here by jackson i was
uninstructed it was you who fastened
that identity upon me then i did not
understand why the men employing me
were so jubilant at the result i only
knew that they treated me with greater
consideration and kindness showering
me with a luxury which  had never
known until to-day i never knew that
i was the tool of sharpers i believed
absolutely that the advice which i gave
you at their dictation was justified by
the facts that the business scheme was
sound and a good one that in inducing
you to further it i was only repaying
a kindness which these men had done
for phao trott years ago this much
i say in justice to myself in justice
to the memory of my mother who suf-
fered pain humiliation and dishonor
to keep a promise which the world
would have considered quixotic i be-
lieve that details are already known to
you you -are probably aware that
those who profited so enormously
through my deception and mr
douanes credulity have fled with their
ill-gotten gains i understand that they
managed the affair so skillfully that the
law could not punish them if they were
apprehended but i have no desire to
cheat it mr douane through me you
have lost a large part of your fortune
the only repayment i can make is in
shattering once and for all your belief
in a delusion through which you would
eventually have been stripped of every-
thing i ask only one thing that you
gentlemen speedily right the wrong
which has been done to phao trott a
wrong which he suffered in silence for
love of me as for me-i am at your
disposition fully prepared to make open
confession of the part i have played
in this miserable swindle and to take
my punishment

  douane rose unsteadily to his feet
and held out his arms to her but she
too rose from her chair and raising
her hands in protest moved quickly to
keep the table between them

  my girl my girl dont you know


the popular magazine

that you are bone of my bone and flesh
of my flesh  he exclaimed when i
believed you to be the spirit of your
mother you gave me the only happiness
i have known in all of the dreary years
i have searched for her i am the man
who abandoned jessica brewster- i
was a weak immature boy and for
years i have suffered for my folly
what would the loss of everything else
mean to me now that i have you come
in the likeness of your mother to let
me make a vicarious atonement for the
wrong i did-- she still retreated
from him until in circling the table
she approached mr grants chair and
reaching out quickly he grasped her
hand in one of his employing the other
to check douanes advance

  my dear this time i shall not re-
lease you so easily he said and in
spite of the grim determined smile on
his lips she read sympathy and under-
standing in his kindly eyes and left
her hand unresistingly in his there
must be no talk of punishment for any
of us  we have all received plenty you
know the truth now you know that it
would be impossible for lispenard

douane to pillory- she snatched

her hand away and faced him defiantly

  remember that it is martha fosdick
who offers to take that punishment
she answered there has been no ac-
knowledgment of anything which would
tarnish the name of douane it wps
my mother who bore the shame-

  a cry of protest as bitter as her tone
was scornful came from douanes lips
and picking up a pen from the tray
he seated himself and wrote hurriedly
only the scratching of the steel fiib
breaking the silence which had suddenly
fallen in the great room it was a
different lispenard douane who rose
from the table after his task was com-
pleted there was no indecision or
hesitation in his face he was the
douane of the banking house douane
the social arbiter forceful self-reliant

  old friend i have executed here a
power of attorney which will enable
you to use my private fortune to the

last dollar to prevent loss to any one
misled by the name or the advice of a
douane to invest in the phosphates
concessions in which both of the
douanes believed implicitly mr
spaulding i believe that you are a
notary and can take the acknowledg-
ment of my signature i have also
written three notices which i wish you
to have duplicated and published in
every new york paper the first is
the announcement of the marriage of
jessica brewster to lispenard douane 
the second is the notice of the death
of my beloved wife jessica brewster
the third the notice of the birth of
martha fosdick douane and then
old friend i authorize you to go
through the contents of that horrible
black box in your office and to destroy
every record of that miserable divorce
i think that is all

  mr grant looked at him apprehen-
sively alarmed by the sudden change

  lispenard this savors too much of
putting your house in order he pro-
tested you would not be so rash
f j

  dont be a fool interrupted
douane harshly and then as he turned
to the girl there was in his face an-
other and a more surprising change
for it was softened by that rare smile
which few even among his intimates
had ever known yes i am putting
my house in order that i may make it
a fit habitation for my daughter the
reincarnation of a bitterly wronged
woman whose image has been in my
heart since the day she entered my life
wisely he said no more but stood with
outstretched hands an unutterable
hungry longing in the eyes which were
fixed upon her face

  without speaking she answered that
appeal gliding forward gracefully and
silently and then for the last time
the mediums warning sounded in that
great room and mr ned riordan made
its meaning clear by motioning to his
associates to follow him as lispenard
douane clasped his new-found happi-
ness to his breast

 victuals for venus

by henry rucker

author of a cheerful giver something like samson etc

            proteids and propinquity are responsible for this astonishing
            romance which has its amusing as well its serious angles

          the self-sacrificing hero is inny gunnish-accent strong
          on the nish and hardly anything at all on the gun

his name was william gilray but
the old lenk street gang in
wauseon ohio began calling
him inny gunnish about the
time of his first measles and inny gun-
nish it has been ever since it is a
youthful corruption of his right name
and speaking as one born in wauseon
i will concede that there certainly was
a heap of youthful corruption in those
days

  so thats the name inny gunnish-
accent strong on the nish and hardly
anything at all to the gun inny and
i have been comrades in joy and woe
since early childhood and it was from
me that he caught the black mumps
that nearly killed him and his three
sisters

  we have been broke together in a
great many large cities and when we
went flat again in san bernardino it
was i who landed the jobs for us with
the national forest-reserve commission
the letter said to report for work in
two or three months

  you wouldnt call them real im-
petuous about having us go to work
for them would you inny remarked
reading the instructions over my shoul-
der well just about have time to
go through some large college and learn
this here science before theyll need us

  you cant get a job in an hour
i argued especially a fine government
position like this

  no but i could eat in less than an
hour inny retorted and three months

from now i avont look so good to the
eye without any meals in between
well eat all right i assured him
you stick to me boy

  i have been sticking to you and all
there is to show for it is a job three
months from now when do we be-
gin regular eating habits 

  we will go as far as guthrie i
explained where we will find tempo-
rary employment

  why guthrie

  we cant find work here in berdoo
at least you cant but guthrie con-
tains one of the biggest and noisiest
restaurants in the known world i al-
ways like to be broke in- a town
that supports a large busy restaurant
there is comfort in the thought that
where so many people are feeding one
may horn in and suffuse himself with
food amid the excitement have you
never heard of guthrie university
inny had never heard of it the same
as he had never heard of adenoids but
guthrie university is a series of red
brick buildings surrounded by an iron
fence and filled with throbbing young
americans of both sexes who are de-
termined to snag whatever loose educa-
tion the place affords the university
is the main reason for the restaurant

  you journey to the little town from
san bernardino on a freight train if
you are traveling by freight that sea-
son and presently inny and i coasted
in upon the intellectuals and looked
about for a place to anchor first we


the popular magazine

had to have work to tide us over the
three months between us and ranging
the forests

  it was definitely my intention to join
the united states government in its
laudable effort to keep the forests full
of trees there was a future for both
of us as forest rangers with inny as
chief ranger of one mountain and me
on the next we would have our dep-
uty rangers who would do the hard
work and all wed have to annoy us
would be bottled beer cabins full of
food a free life amid the towering
peaks and a monthly report and it
was high time we settled down to some
regular occupation

  there was one quite definite under-
standing between me and the national
forest-reserve commission in wash-
ington in our official correspondence
it was stipulated by the department and
agreed to by me that wre were both un-
married men and would remain in that
skirtless condition

  the work said our favorite repub-
lic in the letter is of such a nature
that the employment of married men
is not feasible at this time

  well we aint married men are
we inny demanded when i laid a
warning finger on this paragraph and
held it under his nose

  no and i aint liable to be i re-
torted but youre different youre a
fuzzy-witted and vealy guy and nobody
can depend on you i want you to keep
this requirement constantly in mind
youre liable to dash out into the open
night and get yourself all wedded up
no chance at all inny said coldly
upon reaching guthrie we walked
from the railroad yards there being no-
body to meet us in a purple limousine
and surveyed the university finally
we halted across the street from the
far-famed restaurant wrhich inny re-
garded with a wistful eye over the
door was a sign leading you to believe
that the place was owned and operated
by a gent named jabez pettibone

  the pettibone restaurant mur-
mured inny studying the gay crowds
coming and going picking their teeth
as they emerged without a thought of

the distress it caused us and a nice
large busy joint too

  behold the place whete we work
and cat as soon as we reach financial
arrangements with the proprietor i
affirmed

  maybe you better surge in and hyp-
notize the man inny suggested you
seem to have a lot of confidence

  i have and i will was my reply
so we waited till the rush hour was
over and i approached pettibones res-
taurant seeking out its owner i found
that jabez was a large dark man with
whiskers and gold teeth and an uneasy
habit of lingering near his cash regis-
ters

  twenty minutes later i came forth
with two brand-new jobs for inny and
myself the wages being low very low
indeed but the board and lodging cer-
tain and of fair quality inny met me
with an inquiring gaze

  we start to work to-morrow i told
him

  thats better than three - months
from now he agreed when do we
eat

  not until to-morrow i replied be-
cause mr pettibone had said nothing to
me about eating and my pride refused
to tell him the gnawing truth

  when do the lodgings begin inny
faltered and i informed him that we
could occupy our room immediately

  then if i dont eat i lodge inny
said somewhat irritably walking
around only loads me with more appe-
tite and ive got enough now there-
upon the annoyed partner of my joys
went upstairs to bed while i spent the
rest of that long day looking over the
town

ii

  we tackled the new jobs on the fol-
lowing morning and i found myself
assigned to the ladies department
while inny was planted across the
building among the men pettibones
university restaurant was a coeduca-
tional affair with one-half of the lower
floor set apart for the female students
while opposite them the young male
yearners stuffed themselves daily
victuals for venus



  from the very first i began to ob-
serve one of the lady students with an
astounded gaze she was twenty or
twenty-one and if there was a national
museum of thin dames this tender
young thing would have occupied ped-
estal number one

  who is she i asked a morose-
looking waiter

  that said he thats annabelle
doty aint she a bird 

  he said this in a manner indicating
that she was far from a bird no matter
how many kinds of birds you knew

  she was tall and rangy and built like
a telephone cable only without its sym-
metry up at the university so i
learned she was studying science fine
arts botany and sculpture but it would
have been better if she had taken a
short course in the effect of the beef
stew upon the human form

  shes kind of slender i mused and
the waiter admitted it

  shes the thinnest female in cali-
fornia he remarked and this state
has em so thin that after they eat their
motto candies you can read i love
you for five minutes

 as i said i paid no particular atten-
tion to annabelle except to serve her
writh a plate of thin soup and some
crackers although i wondered why she
didnt eat more if i looked like her
i would have eaten more no matter
who wins the war

  i decided that she was a brainy
aesthetic creature all soul and mental-
ity with no thoughts for sordid things
like pork chops and spanish stew and
about that time who comes bustling into
the picture but inny gunnisn

  who is that girl he asked me
picr name is annabelle doty shes
a student

  what ails her 

  nothing i know of except that shes
the least mite thin

  she sure is some haggard inny
rejoined looking across the room at
annabelle as she arose paid her slight
check and wrardered on out

  inny asked me other questions about
the linear lady but i didnt give much
thought to them at the time there
b p

didnt seem to me to be any danger of
sentimental notions over such a girlish
gazelle as annabelle was

  later on i realized that youve got
to think about even the most ridiculous
things because the next time i saw
inny he was wearing a serious look

  im transferred he announced

  where and why  i asked

  the old man put me over here with
you he continued looking at me with
a guileful eye and sure enough he
went to work in the female section of
pettibones restaurant annabelle doty
appeared at her accustomed hour and
inny waited on her furthermore he
passed the time of day with her in a
polite and genteel manner and she re-
sponded at intermission time i spoke
to him

  why this interest in our bony
friend  i asked him

  shes having some very tough luck
he replied but he acted as though he
didnt want to talk much

  when he walked away he was wear-
ing his sad and melancholy look and
nothing more happened until next feed-
ing time once again inny entered into
discourse with annabelle and once
again she replied looking up at him
with a grateful gaze in her blue eye
this sort of thing went on meal after
meal sometimes annabelles girl
friend would sit at her table and inny
also talked with that person one
night lounging on the edge of my bed
and ironing a necktie on the oil stove
inny unbosomed to rne

  maybe you noticed ive been talking
to annabelle doty he asked rne

  i noticed it all right i answered
you must be hard up for some one
to spill language on

  and i have also been talking about
annabelle to that other dame with the
blue hat something ought to be done
and i think we might do it

  what i asked

  well to begin with annabelle doty
is in love with a man over in casa
grande which is the next station up
the road his name is oscar davis
and he runs the casa grande livery


the popular magazine

stable thats annabelles home town
and shes loved this davis for years
thats a lot of bad luck to happen
to one man i remarked where does
this sad affair bust into our home
life 

  well i sort of have a notion that
annabelle suffers in silence you know
shes pretty thin more than likely
her love affair is eating at her heart
if her heart is built like the rest
of her that aint enough eating to
worry about i still dont see where
we crash in upon the scene

  i hear from this other girl that
davis was all excited once about anna-
belle but love passed out of his life
and greed entered annabelle thought
he was going to marry her and it did
look that way the girl told me he
dont appreciate the real depth of her
affection and so i thought we might
do somebody a good turn

  meaning that you want me to seethe
in on a totally foreign love affair
thats exactly like sticking your hand
into a thrashing machine to see if its
really full of sharp knives you can
count me out with one motion of the
arm

  i dont want to go over there alone
because it would look funny inny
continued

  it might not be funny i retorted
suppose this davis was quick-tem-
pered and wore brass-topped boots
but inny went right on obstinately
we could have a long friendly talk
with this man and tell him about
annabelle sitting here day after day
wasting away over her lost love we
could show him that this sterling crea-
ture has kept as true to him as the
needle to the pole

  well to haul it up short and show
you why the gate is never rusty on the
home for the unhinged i let the mis-
guided galoot lure me into a promise
to go with him when he went i said
i would accompany him and help him
in his long friendly chat with oscar
davis and we dedicated the coming
sunday morning to this noble purpose
i did this feeling at the time that my
better judgment was not among us

  we took the sunday morning train
and moved upon casa grande in a
body and one of the first things we saw
when we alighted was davis livery and
feed stables casa grande is very
small and compact and we had no
trouble in locating mr davis he was
sitting on a tool chest in the rear of
his livery putting sweet oil on a set
of harness and when we came in he
regarded us with a look outside the
villagers were coming home from
church and a sabbath calm rested upon
that fair community

  are you oscar davis inny de-
manded walking up and standing be-
fore the man

  i am he replied what do you
want 

  he spoke coldly there was nothing
radiant or hearty about his greeting
and he didnt ask us how we were
inny began to tell him what he wanted
and i took opportunity to study the
man who had broken annabelles heart
he was a stoutish person of about
thirty very dark and robust and there
was a confident gleam in his eye the
more i looked at him the more i felt
that inny and i were stepping off some
place in the dark

  you know a girl named annabelle
doty dont you  inny inquired

  i do said the man

  as i understand it there were ten-
der relations between you and her at
one time 

  you understand that do you in-
quired mr davis putting down the
harness and looking at inny with fresh
interest a regular little understander
arent -ou 

  i have learned inny said coolly
that at one time it looked like mar-
riage between you and annabelle and
that subsquently you chilled off what
were here for without her knowledge
of course is to show you that youre
making a grave mistake there aint
a finer girl in the world it is rarely
that a man is lucky enough to be offered
affection like hers i know it would
make her happy if you asked her to
marry you and thats why we came
over mr davis
victuals for vbnus



  you did did you smiled the liv-
ery man you came over to ask me
to ask annabelle to marry me and
that makes a new worlds record right
here ive heard of such cases before
but never met them

  im trying to do you a friendly act
said inny

  and now im going to do you a
friendly act answered mr davis i
wont say much more to you but if
you will take that other half-witted
mamoset and get out of here you will
make the future easy for all of us

  up to this point i had taken no part
in the conversation it was all innys
funeral but now i felt impelled to
seep into the proceedings

  looks like we made a mistake after
all i said to inny it sure would
be a shame to let annabelle marry her-
self off to the uncouth and cindery-
looking horse chambermaid we see be-
fore us theres a crinmal look about
him that i noticed first off

  as i recall it that is all i said though
i may have added other remarks which
now escape me but whatever i said
was enough plenty and sufficient mr
davis turned around just once and held
up his hand and without a word be-
ing spoken four large hairy young
men in the livery business came on
what appeared to be the run

  there was no time for escape and
that is why i remained in the path of
disaster mr davis took command
and inny and i concluded our long
friendly talk by fighting for our lives
and if you want my humble and ex-
perienced tip never get into a fight in
a livery stable because livery workers
once roused are blood brothers to the
man-eating tiger of the nile

iii

  we escorted our wounds and abra-
sions back to guthrie and resumed
work as soon as possible and after that
nothing much happened except that i
loathed inny and felt sore on the gen-
eral subject of annabelle doty inny
showed that he was ashamed of him-
self for getting me punched up and

thus things drifted on he maintained
a steady interest in annabelle i used
to watch them together and annabelle
seemed to grow even thinner which
sounds impossible seeing she was al-
ready as thin as a herringbone it
wasnt long before innys natural rest-
lessness brought its own reward

  you want to know something about
annabelle doty he asked me one eve-
ning while i was fixing a bit of fresh
court-plaster to my nose

  if i tell you i want to know any
more about that woman dont you be-
lieve me i replied without enthusiasm
maybe youre thinking of having a
long friendly chat with some other pal
of hers 

  not at all he retorted hurt by my
bitterness do you know the reason
that girl is so blamed thin

  sure i do a general lack of meat
surrounding adhering and sticking to
the bones

  exactly and what causes that
lack  the poor child hasnt any money
shes working her way through the
university and meantime shes educat-
ing her younger brothers who are in
a st joe orphan asylum shes hav-
ing hard lines

  she has hard lines i said sourly
theyre all hard to look at maybe
you want me to leap over to st joe and
adopt the orphan brothers

  i dont want you to do anything
he returned but its pretty tough luck
for a young girl im going to do some-
thing about it

  he did too i watched him at wrork
and its a good thing that jabez petti-
bone wasnt gifted with similar eye-
sight because right about then the pet-
tibone restaurant began to lose money
inny mapped out a course of action
which consisted wholly of food and
he went joyously about the job of fat-
tening up annabelle doty

  every time she breezed into petti-
bones which was twice a day inny
waited on her tenderly and while she
continued to order a dimes worth she
didnt get what she ordered she be-
gan to face real provender the same


the cpopulacr magazine

being everything inny could drag out
of the kitchen

  annabelle used to come in and take
her place and inny would move upon
the kitchen with a determined air and
a large tray when he returned the
tray would be full of food all neatly
covered with a cloth to save jabez pain
in a way it was interesting to watch
inny fattening up the fair one and
the truth is annabelle liked the treat-
ment and responded to it

  her cheeks began to fill out and you
could look at her neck without hurting
your eye her tickets continued to read
twenty cents and sometimes when she
had been surrounded by a sea of glu-
tens and proteids inny would lose his
nerve so he would add a half dollar
to annabelles check and pay the dif-
ference out of his own between them
inny and jabez were paying for anna-
belles luxurious meals and she grew
plump

  in addition to caring for the girls
gastronomic affairs inny was spending
his income in still another way

  you cant expect a girl to have the
right appetite unless she gets fresh air
he argued with me

  naturally not i agreed you
might try standing her in a draft

  no but she needs air he continued
and im going to see that she gets it

  youll have to drop this full-food
exposition pretty quick i told him
the united states government writes
me that well be forest rangers soon
and to get ready for work

  fll be ready when the job is said
inny in his careless manner and he
went away to see old man thacker

iv

  the town of guthrie boasted of some
things but not of george thacker who
operated the livery stables george was
seventy years old and so was his
youngest horse he rented alleged
vehicles and equines to the college stu-
dents who desired to go buggy dashing
nw and then and inny negotiated with
the ancient man not having enough
regular currency to hire a horse and

carriage inny was forced to mortgage
the future anyhow he made a deal
with thacker and presently you could
see him driving annabelle along the
mountain roads where she could gather
up the needed atmosphere

  and annabelle became jollier and
plumper daily and during meals she
laughed at innys amusing discourse
between much food and the buggy rid-
ing miss doty was rapidly assuming
the general contour of a human being

  well you cant feed a lad day after
day and protect her with the tender
care of a young mother without grow-
ing attached to her ive always wor-
ried when inny showed signs of getting
sentimental and while annabelle doty
wouldnt insnare a man at the begin-
ning of the enterprise she was now
changing from a lean and hungry spec-
tacle to a chubby plumpish damsel

  one saturday morning i received
some news that keeled me straight over
in the mail was this letter from the
national forest-reserve commission

mr joe coleman

  dear sir  i regret to state that we have
canceled your engagement as forest ranger
this was found necessary owing to your
having concealed the fact that you are a
married man the department has found
that you were married in wauseon ohio in
 and have a wife and two daughters

  i read it in stunned amazement be-
cause i was not married in nineteen
hundred and nine and i have no wife
and daughters after my mind re-
sumed its regular throbbings i sat on
the edge of my bed and tried to figure
out what kind of a shinny game our
government was trying to play on an
honest citizen

  it slowly dawned on me in wau-
seon my home town there was another
joe coleman and a worthless scamp
he was i laughed heartily it wras a
joke on the commission the board
had simply mixed me up with the other
joe coleman

  then i ceased from ribald mirth be-
cause the joke wrasnt on the commis-
sion after all six months would prob-
ably flutter away before i could un-
tangle the mess i cursed freely and
victuals f venus

looked down on the street where i ob-
served inny gunnish on his way home
from the post office he was carrying
a letter and reading it with signs of
interest

  well i growled when he came in
ive had some fine news this morn-
ing heres a letter from the forest-
reserve people telling me i cant have
my ranger job because

  because what inny asked
because im a married man aint
that good the board must keepa lot
of intelligent investigators eh  itll
take me months to explain that im not
the joe coleman with the wife you
remember that stiff 

  i do inny said looking thought-
fully out of the window and now i
understand my letter i got one too
from the forest-reserve board

  you have i asked surprised
yes he continued still looking
fixedly out of the window and it says
here as how im to start to work at
once it goes on to state that owing
to their appointing only one ranger in-
stead of twro as they expected to on
the first of the month theyll have to
wait till they find another suitable can-
didate meantime im to go on the
job at double salary

  say i said laughing in a relieved
way thats good luck youre going
on at double pay fine ill kick right
along with you ill wire the govern-
ment and explain about this joe cole-
man and you split your pay with me
until later of course itll be all right
when the board finds it has made a mis-
take

  theres only one trouble inny said
still refusing to look me in the eye
troublep i repeated what is it
i cant take the job

  you cant what i yelled

  i cant accept this position he said
picking at the curtain tassel

  why not

  something has arose said inny
well spill it i roared what
has arose 

  not much said inny except that
im going to be married and that dis-
qualifies me

  married i shrieked sliding off the
bed who to

  annabelle doty inny replied go-
ing through what would be blushing in
a sensible man

  i looked up at him and tried to re-
main calm

  and this i quavered this is what
i get for stringing along like a loyal
partner youre going to hurl me down
and marry a milk-fed butter-fattened
proteid consumer

  enough  inny commanded speak
no ill of that girl you dont know
what love is joe and thats why you
put jobs above the sacred passion
youre marrying a food destroyer
and nqthing else i howled and
youre leaving me flat how are you
going to buy grub for that female with-
out a job 

  that is arranged for jabez petti-
bone has staked me to a new job and
the apartment over the restaurant he
wants a steady married man for floor
manager im sorry for you joe but
you dont understand what love means
to a man

  they set their wedding for the six-
teenth of the month and inny wrote
to the forest-reserve board resigning
from the job he had never accepted
two other rangers were appointed
inny borrowed a small sum from jabez
and furbished himself for the wedding
and i decided to linger on painfully in
guthrie until the ceremony was over
then i would hike back east where i
wouldnt miss inny so much mean-
time having no heart for anything i
gave up my job with jabez and mooned
around town

  the sixteenth came on wednesday
and on tuesday afternooil i began
packing up i was down on my knees
in our room wondering why i always
had such hard luck when i heard the
sound of something coming upstairs
and inny burst upon me his eyes
were standing out ahead of him his
face was red his hair rumpled and his
temperature high

  whos dead i inquired
  annabelles married lie gasped


the popvlar magazine

  married i repeated whod she
marry 

  she went up to casa grande this
morning to say good-by to her aunt and
heres the telegram

  he handed me the wire which read

  oscar and  were married at noon sorry
he is the only man i could ever really love

annabelle

  well wouldnt that cook you i
asked in amazement reading it again
to be sure

  and he refused to marry her once
inny wailed bitterly we went over
there and asked him to and he re-
fused and chased us out and now
after i go and fatten her up and make
her beautiful and fall in love with her
the sucker takes another look and bang
goes my wedding

  i looked at inny moaning there on
my bed and began to grin who
wouldnt you take a scrawny dame
fatten her  nicely and the other guy
finds shes his pie and there goes your
blushing bride so i grinned some
more but in order to do it without the
loss of life i sauntered downstairs
leaving inny to his sorrow

  buck swayne met me having just
returned from casa grande hed
been at the wredding

  tough on inny said buck grin-
ning

  how about me i asked think
of them government jobs theyre
gone and all through plumping up a
female so where are we

  i didnt return to our room for a
while and when i did i found some-
thing for the first time in his career
inny was pickled and pickled clear
tip to the hatband you couldnt blame
him at that because he was fond of the
girl also you couldnt walk him
which i tried to do he had taken his
wedding trousseau by the hand and
traded it at the corner store for two
bottles of rare old tiger bite and not
much remained when i got home

  he was in favor of hurrying over
to casa grande and murdering oscar
davis before he could get away but i

voted for a freight train east as soon
as my weaker companion could travel

  i kept the poor galoot in the house
and removed the rum and at daybreak
next morning he returned to his normal
mind though suffering some pain we
started inconspicuously out of guthrie
carrying our bags coming down main
street early as it wtas we encountered
poor old mr thacker the livery baron

  goin away  he demanded in sur-
prise theres a bill due me for horse
hire

  inny stared at him and merely gar-
gled in reply

  we are going away i admitted
any little bills will have to remain
unpaid weve had enough bad luck

  all right squeaked mr thacker
waving a paper at inny but ill re-
port this to oscar davis and hell jail
you

  i looked at -the old ruin in perplexity

  oscar davis i asked whats
he got to do with innys livery bill for
horse hire 

  dont you know that oscar davis
owns the guthrie livery  demanded
the vicious old man im only his
agent

  inny was staring at george thacker
and throbbing like one of these trans-
parent fish in an aquarium

  so he said in a voice rendered
calm by suffering so i have been
paying all my wages and then some
more to oscar davis bless his little
soul well now aint that amusing
come on along joe before i hammer
this frail old yap to death in the public
roadway

  we went on down the street toward
the freight yards and if you hear
anybody explaining that the saddest
event in history was the massacre of
the infants you tell them where theyre
wrong

  as we climbed into the coal car inny
said

  when we get this new job lets not
work in a restaurant

  why not i asked

  because said inny i dont think
i could stand it ill never feel ex-
actly the same about food again
lion for bait

by j frank davis

azithor of a fourfold gamegarland ranger service etc

   browning and maeferlincfc breed a riot in the highbrow circles of mendon texas
   and colonel buck leonard ex-ranger comes to the rescue with a trained lion

literature politics and draw

poker do not necessarily make
such an incongruous combina-
tion as might seem at first
thought they have these things in
common they are all entertaining
much profit may be and sometimes is
gained from each and there are times
when any of them can be taken with
almost fatal seriousness

  colonel buck leonard bank presi-
dent real-estate operator ex-cattleman
and ex-texas ranger held the deck of
cards on his left palm the thumb of his
right hand ready to begin the distribu-
tion for the draw and looked inquir-
ingly toward doc millikcn who had
opened the pot the others in the game
were the usual coterie that gathered al-
most nightly in doc millikens office
jim sweetland and the city marshal had
both signified their intention of draw-
ing cards in this particular hand and
each had contributed the necessary
brownchip for the privilege

  cards gentlemen if any such there
be in our midst called buck cheerily

  three cards mostly eights said
sweetland

  three here-mostly anything to help
these openers remarked doc milliken
the city marshal beyond him who had
been playing in extraordinarily bad
luck dejectedly called for one looked
at itand instantly threw it and the re-
mainder of his hand into the discards
with petulance and profanity

  buck dealt himself two very swiftly
very unostentatiously he did not an-
nounce the number one observing
from the side lines as it were might

have reasonably opined that he would
be perfectly satisfied not to have the
others notice his draw he tossed the
pack aside shuffled the two cards into
the three he had saved and without
looking at the completed hand waited
with smiling interest for milliken to
bet

  the doctor carefully surveyed all five
of his cards he fingered his chips and
then seemed struck by an omission i
didnt get your draw he remarked to
buck how many did the dealer
take 

  leonard hesitated a tenth of a sec-
ond  again one might have said he re-
gretted this publicity then he replied 
two ive got a set of very small
threes if you insist on knowin without
payin for it

  check a white chip said milliken
promptly

  that bein the case ill have to tilt

it- buck hesitated considered

stacked up in front of him five brown
chips added five more then took off
three and pushed the remainder to the
center of the table ill put it up just
seven dollars not five-i kin get
more not ten-doc wouldnt call ten
but the mystic seven queer how that
number seven is regarded as a lucky
number in histrv aint it seven can-
dlesticks seven days in the week seven
whats-their-names of greece seven
sleepers seven-

  seven times seventy-seven words
interrupted sweetland gently tossing
his hand away all right im hypno-
tized  why continue  a seven-dollar
raise would drive me even without the


the popular magazine

conversation i didnt get a thing on
the draw

  you cause me to consider deeply
said doc milliken his eyes on bucks
face which was grinning the poker grin
that meant just exactly nothing it
frames up to me something like this
on general principles youre an old liar
maybe you didnt mean me to notice
how many cards you took and maybe
you didnt mean to hesitate when i
asked you and maybe you told the truth
when you said you had a little set of
three but the chances are at least even
the other way and probly a little more
so therefore heres seven dollars ill
prove how honest i think you are by
showing mine first-a pair of twelves
and ab-sa-lute-ly nothing else

  he spread his hand face up-two
queens and three entirely irrelevant
cards

  thats good grinned buck a little
sheepishly you called a pair of
nines

  and the groans of the dead and
dying could be heard for many blocks
quoted sweetland preparing to deal

  cheer up buck put in carroll
emery from across the table rotten
as you played it you done your best 
he addressed doc milliken with mock
seriousness good player ol buck
good ol bluffer always gets away
with it me im sorry to see poor ol
buck get caught at it that-a-way i
dont think

  id rather have a million dollars
than your disposition remarked buck

  the great trouble with poor old
buck doc milliken replied gravely to
emery as sweetland began the next
deal is that he had a fever when he
was a chee-ild and he dont pick up
things hes never been able to learn
that you can sometimes lie to old liars
but you cant kid old bluffers

  colonel leonard sat in his private
office in the mendon state bank at
about three oclock the following after-
noon when doctor milliken came in
closed the door and silently passed
buck a cigar buck saw there was
something more than sociability in this

visit and waited without comment
while the doctor tossed his hat on a
table lighted a fresh cigar himself and
solemnly eased himself into a chair

  doctor milliken lost no time in com-
ing to his point

  luther hardy and gus dallinger
are in a row he said

  buck received this information with
the gravity it deserved for luther
hardy was mayor of mendon and au-
gustus g dallinger was county judge
a quarrel between them could not but
be injurious such a quarrel at this
moment colonel leonard did not need
to be told might prove not only embar-
rassing from a party sense but dis-
tinctly harmful to the community

  what kind of a row he asked
what about

  you can search me i havent hap-
pened to see either of them for two or
three days until about an hour ago
when i went to the courthouse to file
a couple of death certificates and i
naturally dropped into the judges of-
fice to say howdy we talked along
about this and that for a few minutes
and then lie says he supposes i ought
to know that hes decided he cant sup-
port luther for mayor this coming
spring i ask him what for and he
says its purely a personal matter and
that he has nothing special to say
against the mayor but he thinks its
time there was a change then he goes
into his shell like an armadillo now
what dya know about that

  not a thing said buck literally
hows the mayor feel have you
seen him

  no and i thought i hadnt better
you got him to run you know in the
beginning hadnt you better tackle
him he being a director in this bank
and all  besides hes so darn hard to
talk to

  maybe so somethin personal eh
now i wonder what the blazes those
two have got to fightin about they
never been close friends especially but
they always been friendly enough-if
you get the difference

  go to it said doctor milliken ris-
ing weve got to try to make it up
lion for bait



whatever it is a fight this election
might mean all kinds of bad medicine
for one thing theres the bond issue for
new streets

  and that health survey you was
wantin to get made

  and the new high school next
year is going to be a mighty important
year for mention but if theres any
fight in our own crowd those other fel-
lows are going to be able to hog-tie
every plan we put forward we had
too much trouble getting that gang of
old mossbacks licked to take any
chances on their coming back and you
bet your life theyre waiting to come
back first chance they get theyre
talking that old stuff about this town
was good enough for our daddies with-
out all these expensive newfangled
fads just as bad as they ever were
shore you dont have to tell me
said buck well ill try to get at
luther right away this evenin we
need to hurry

  the mayor who outside of official
office hours occupied a room in the
principal brick building on the main
street on the door of which was let-
tered l hardy stockman was in
that office when buck arrived fifteen
minutes later

  he was a very tall very broad very
leathery-faced man of fifty-five who
wore a black coat and a black broad-
brimmed hat most of the time had his
hair cut as often as his wife could make
him and lived a lonely life because he
never had been a very good mixer any-
way and hadnt been allowed to mix at
all since he had been married he was
sitting alone in a straight chair tilted
back against the wall smoking gloomily

  he brought the chair down onto all
its legs as the door opened and tilted
it back again when he identified his
visitor

   lo luther said buck

   lo buck  said the mayor

  say luther asked buck without
preamble have you and gus dallmger
had some kind of a ruckus 

  the mayor removed his cigar looked
it oyer carefully and put it back in his
mouth

  well he said after a minute hesi-
tatingly we aint exactly on the best
o terms

  whats the matter

  little personal matter

  hardy did not seem disposed to go
into further details buck declared
himself frankly

  look here luther i want to help
smooth things out before they get any
further if we aint careful maybe
gus wont be with you for mayor this
cornin spring

  another pause

  i aint for him either

  but why

  little personal matter

  the conference gave every sign of
having reached its end mayor hardy
smoked cheerlessly his eyes on the op-
posite wall

	i aint aimin to meddle in what aint
my business buck said but good
lawd you kin see what a position it
places us all in kaint you tell me a
little more about it man to man lu-
ther i think you ought to

  the mayor considered this

  talked rough about me he said
talked rough about you wh say
luther i never heard of gus dal-
linger talkin rough about anybody out-
side some prisoner when he used to be
states attorney aint there some mis-
take  are you sure he said it what
started it had you had any words
with him about anything

  not much

  what was it about politics
  nope personal

  but what could you two have to
quarrel about personally  come on
lets have it wont you luther
hardys eyes went back to the wall
again and he sighed

  wife he said

  whose wife great caesar man
you dont mean as old as you and gus

are that-

  no interrupted hardy with in-
stant animation which faded as soon
as he had spoken the word just some
advice i give him about his wife good
advice and he got mad about it
plere straighten this out for me


the popular magazine

what advice did you give him and
how come you to do it  and what did
he say  and kaint it be fixed up  go
ahead and loosen up luther just be-
tween ourselves

  well the mayor said uncomfort-
ably it kaint be fixed because he told
ike berg i was-somethin

  what 

  the mayor looked embarrassed

  oi woman he said after a brief
hesitation and he didnt have no
call to what i said was for his wifes
good i just asked him friendly like
if he wouldnt ask his wife to kinda
apologize to my wife for something his
wife said last tuesday that my wife

  hold on interrupted buck this
is gettin out of my sabe no ol bach
like mes got any business sittin into
this game i pass i would sort of
like to know what he said when you
asked him though

  thats whats funny about it the
mayor replied with almost a show of
interest he told me when i done
went to him that he hadnt no doubt
it was all an accident and hed speak
to miz dallinger about it and he
guessed itd be all right and the next
i knew ike berg he comes mentionin
that judge dallinger says im an ol
woman and then when i meet the
judge on the street the next time he
dont see me a-tall and my wife says

that--

  luther interrupted buck hur-
riedly looking at his watch theres a
man over in my office waitin for me
right this minute i gotta run say
do me a favor will you  dont men-
tion this to anybody until-well until
von hear dallinger has said something
will you

  the mayor thought this over

  all right he agreed but i aint
goin to support him for reelection
there kaint no man call me that buck
if i wasnt a peaceable man and these

were a little earlier times id-

  shore but not now adios lu-
ther see you again in a day or two
from the bank he reached doctor
milliken promptly by telephone

  say doc he called into the trans-
mitter ive got a little line on that
thing we were talkin about but i kaint
tell it-got it in confidence you under-
stand listen you go see that party
you ran into at the courthouse-get
me -and make him promise not to
mention the matter to anybody else until
he hears the other feller has think
you kin do it

  i can try

  see you later said buck right
now i gotta do a little work i aint
even opened the evenin mail

  among the letters that lay on his
desk as he turned from the telephone
was one bearing the impressive em-
bossed insignia of a famous new york
financial institution at whose head is
mr thomas vanderhoven vanderpool
adviser and administrator of hundreds
of millions buck opened this letter
first because lie and mr vanderpool
were very good friends the famous
banker having spent more than one
vacation hunting with him in salado
county

  the letter was purely personal it
read

colonel buckley j leonard state bank
   mendon texas

  dear colonel  i want you to be sure to
get acquainted with a very good friend of
mine professor john wadsworth kent
who left here last evening for san an-
tonio and hence will be there by the time
you receive this at whichever of the big
hotels he can get the best accommodations

  kent was in my class at yale and we
have been close friends ever since

  although he happens to be one of the
most famous authorities on literature and
his writings are standard textbooks in most
of the universities dont let that cause you
to misjudge him before you see him as
a matter of fact he is one of the best fel-
lows i ever knew a regular human being

  he and i were at a little dinner not long
ago given by a rather well-known lion
hunter here in new york-the lion hunt-
ers husband is such a good fellow that
neither of us wanted to decline-and when
the ladies had left the table and we were
all talking one of these long-haired boys
addressed kent in a deep soulful voice

  professor he said to kent ive been
thinking to-day of the great epigrams of
great writers the great axioms of conduct
that if every one would follow them would
lion fotr bait



make all the world better nobler and
brighter what do you think is the great-
est of them all professor kent

  kent gives him the east and west as the
boys say and replies the most useful
one in many respects is elbert hubbards
rule six  dear me says the long-
haired boy blankly im afraid im not
familiar with it what is the quotation
hubbards rule six  says kent is
dont take yourself too damn seriously 
ive told you this little story just to give
you a line on kent youll like him and
hell like you he is a highbrow all right
but he is all human meet him and ask him
what hell have and get acquainted if he
happens to come to mendon invite him to
sit in with the boys over at the doctors
office he cant play well enough to win
from you cutthroats i imagine but he isnt
exactly an amateur at the game-and if he
loses he can afford it

  my very best regards to doctor milliken
and all the others of my old friends again
this year i missed the deer shooting next
season lets hope for better luck very sin-
cerely yours	t v vanderpool

  buck went through the remainder of
his mail dictated a few brief letters to
his stenographer waited to sign them
and then went home at the supper
table he brought up the matter that
had been in the back of his mind ever
since midafternoon

  say dolly he asked his widowed
sister you know all about the society
and near-society tantrums in this town
whats the ruckus between miz judge
dallinger and miz luther hardy
literature replied his sister laconi-
cally 

  huh what do they know about
literature

  thats it mrs page explained
have you just heard about it

  you never told me

  do i ever gossip-much

  no dolly you dont-much they
both laughed possessing sympathetic
understanding but this particular
piece of gossip i reckon i ought to
know about dont mention it please
but this scrap has got extended to gus
and luther

  well some of the women have been
talking of organizing a literary society
-something outside the womans club
both mrs dallinger and mrs hardy
go in for literature you know and each

of them is entirely positive she is the
literary leader of the community
wthere do you come in on that sis 
oh i dont come in thats all right
i dont want to im not literary

  why dolly  at college you-

  yes but theres a new heaven and
a new earth buck i have old-fash-
ioned ideas i even think shakespeare
hasnt been improved upon for dramatic
expression and that nobody has writ-
ten any better poetic imagery or deeper
philosophy than can be found in the
bible irrespective of its value as a re-
ligious book no i wouldnt do even
if i wanted to get into the thing-and
i dont mrs dallinger and mrs
hardy do they want to organize a
reading club they each want to be
president general manager and chief
critic of it it hasnt started yet she
added cheerfully and there have
been not less than two fights already
whats going to be the name of it
that was fight number one mrs
hardy wanted to call it the browning
club and mrs dallinger said it ought

to be the maeterlinck club and-

  why didnt they compromise and
call it the brownlink club

  mrs page ignored this persiflage
well there was a little flare-up at
that meeting and the other women
didnt want to take sides and they post-
poned naming the club or even organiz-
ing it for the time being afterward
mrs dallinger and mrs hardy got to
telling their friends what each of them
thought of the others knowledge of
literature and things came to a head
when they both happened to meet last
tuesday down at the womans club
i heard that it was after the meeting
and the members were standing around
talking and mrs hardy said to mrs
dallinger in her most society voice
come see me some time and mrs
dallinger said in her best society man-
ner ill try but im so busy i hardly
find time nowadays to even call on the
people im fond of 

where did she get that fond of 
i dont know out of the same
book she got the whole cutting speech


the vovular magazine

from i suppose just imagine mary
dallinger using that kind of language
i kaint

  well that is all there was to it
oh no it wasnt-not by a long
shot ill tell you something about the
ensuin battles of this cruel war miz
hardy she went home and tore luther
up about it and said miz dallinger was
an ol cat and ought to be made to
apologize and he had got to do it no-
body told me the exact lines the con-
versation took-and ive got the whole
thing on the quiet anyway-but i dont
have to be a mind reader to get it lu-
ther he did as he was told--like he
always does he asked gus dallinger
to ask miz dallinger to apologize
he did

  he shore walked in where angels
would have expected to stumble and
gus not icnowin anything about it ex-
cept that his lizzie wouldnt insult any-
body he says thatll be all right and
goes home to make her the proposition
then she tells gus that luther is some-
thin or other-a henpecked ol fool for
a guess-and gives him what-for for
buttin in and gus gets sore on luther
and luther hears about it and gets

sore on gus and- say dolly itll

raise merry blazes with this town if
somebody kaint stop that scrap just
take one thing what do you spose
will happen to your new high school if
we should have a wide-open fight elec-
tion day and that other gang should
get in 

  mrs page being a practical woman
of much sense wasted no time in words
but thought deeply

  buck spoke again after a minute
if those women could be patched up
gus and luther would come around all
right wouldnt they 

  they would if those women in-
structed em to his sister replied with
finality there isnt any doubt about
who is the head of either of those
households but who can patch up a
quarrel as nasty as that

  if you could go to em and--
no use buddie i couldnt i dont
know any woman in town that could
either since those two went in for

literature their minds are on a plane
above this simple little city anyway
they spell literature with a capital
and we other poor folks--

  i wonder buck exclaimed then
suddenly  wheres billy 

  he was in the garage just before
supper i had him out this afternoon
he said something about running
downtown to-night to get some gas
why 

 i want him im goin to san
ntonio first thing in the mawnin in
the big car i gotta get some advice
now who in san antonio can ad-
vise you about-or maybe youre off
on some other subject

  no its the same one i didnt think
to tell you i had a letter to-day from
tom vanderpool theres a friend of
his come to san ntonio he wants me
to look up say whats a lion hunter 
in society i mean whats vanderpool
mean when he writes something about a
new york woman thats a lion hunter
shes a woman who invites famous
people to her dinners or parties and
shines a little with their reflected light
people that have succeeded and got
their names in the papers have to dodge
her

  i see well this chap vanderpool
knows is a lion maybe youve heard
of him hes professor kent john
something kent i left the letter on
my desk

  john wadsworth kent certainly is
a lion

  thats it-wadsworth well im
goin up and say welcome to our fair
and imperial commonwealth to him
first thing in the mawnin and speak-
in of this other thing-youre friendly
with both miz dallinger and miz
hardy aint you 

  not enough to suggest to them-

  friendly enough to make either of
em a pleasant little call and tell her
how she could cover herself with glory
-if you knew she could-aint vou 

 why i suppose- what scheme

have you got in that head of yours
now 

  no scheme dolly no scheme
said buck soothingly im just grop-
lion for bait



in darkly in a cloud of weird imagina-
tive possibilities lets go in the par-
lor and have some music put on that
record of six voices-

  at four oclock the following after-
noon buck leonard and professor
kent sat in the grillroom at the pro-
fessors hotel where they had been
since luncheon time tom vanderpool
had been right each of them did enjoy
the others company they had ex-
hausted a number of subjects and still
had a great many to look forward to
buck musing the evening before while
the phonograph played had about de-
cided the thought that had suddenly
come to him at the mention of capital-l
literature and lion hunters was not
inspiration but madness now as he
began to get really acquainted with this
handsome genial frank-eyed gray-
haired philosopher the idea did not
seem quite so mad after all

  he ordered a waiter to bring an-
other and launched into a new vein

  he told professor kent the story of
mrs dallinger and mrs hardy and of
the reactions their quarrel had had on
the judge and the mayor and of the
things that might happen detrimental
to the flourishing city of mendon if
some way could not be found to make
peace between the rival leaders of the
would-be literary set he told it well
professor kent chuckled heartily at
bucks quaint description of the dis-
putants and their dispute he became
serious and listened sympathetically as
buck reviewed briefly the battle men-
don had gone through three years be-
fore to push aside the mossbacks
and change from a careless unclean
shiftless frontier town to a city with
ideas and ideals

  buck hesitated when he had finished
the tale when he resumed it was
with some reluctance

  im almost on the point of askin
you to do me a favor-the first time
we meet i need some advice anyway
i see-or i think i see-how maybe
this thing could be straightened out

and- if tom vanderpool didnt

say you was a regular human bein and
if i didnt see that for myself i

wouldnt ask you but if it was van-
derpool i wouldnt hesitate so per-
haps-

  professor kents mental processes
were trained and swift i almost see
it already he said put it into words
of course ill do it if i can

 thus encouraged buck rapidly
sketched a plan kent nodded put in
a word here and there finally threw
back his head and laughed

  judging from my experience with
the species it ought to be a quite sim-
ple thing to accomplish certainly ill
do it and youll be under no obligation
at all ill enjoy it then after it is
done i very much want to meet some
of your friends vanderpool has told
me about-doctor milliken and sweet-
land and the rest i expect it may
prove costly from what tom said but
iil try to play well enough not to bore
you

  this is shoreiy mighty fine of you
said buck gratefully and-

  not another word didnt you hear
me say im going to enjoy it myself
now tell me please youve given me
a pretty good idea of mrs dallinger-
shes the maeterlinck person isnt she 
-and the other lady mrs hardy is
the browning booster this is going
to be interesting

  pursuant to program and moved by
tactful suggestions from mrs page
whose opinion as president of the
womans club had weight with both
even if she did not measure up to their
literary standards mrs dallinger and
mrs hardy each wrote john wads-
worth kent litt d a most carefully
composed note asking if she could in-
terview him at his convenience at san
antonio with a view to asking his
valued advice regarding certain matters
having to do with the progress of cul-
ture in mendon each said she would
take up very little of his time each
thanked him cordially in advance

  he replied to mrs dallinger that he
would be honored if she would call
upon him at his hotel on the following
tuesday at two his letter to mrs
hardy was similar except that it named


the popular -magazine

four oclock as the hour for the inter-
view

  when the bellboy found him with
mrs dallingers card he came at once
in person and escorted her to a seat
in the corner of the long lobby his
appearance was distinguished his poise
superb his manner the acme of dig-
nified courtesy the lady was awed
she plunged into her errand rather
breathlessly her remarks-in which
she departed very little from the speech
she had prepared and committed-led
up to the request whose audacity she
assured him she appreciated that he
would come to mendon and address the
first meeting of their new literary club
naming any  honorarium he desired
which it would give her deep pleasure
to pay

  he shook his head smilingly at the
mention of a fee no dear lady he
said not that

  mrs dallinger had read that phrase
dear lady somewhere she had al-
ways wondered if any one ever really
said it

  she was going to add to her en-
treaties thinking he had it in mind to
decline her invitation entirely when he
went on

  it might be arranged-perhaps-un-
der some circumstances there is a
certain duty one owes to others is
there not yes i think it would be
very pleasant to come to your little
city and speak at the first meeting of a
club that unites all the women of men-
don whose minds turn toward profitable
reading in fact you are not the first
lady who has honored me with this in-
vitation i had almost decided before
you came to accede to the charming
request made by your mrs-mrs-ah
yes i have it-mrs hardy you and
she i take it represent the same move-
ment

  at the name of the mayors wife
mrs dallinger flushed then paled

  er-why-er-professor im sorry
but all the people of mendon who dis-
cuss literature are not in entire-er-
harmony there are some who have-
shall i say little understanding of the

subject if you were to look into the

matter you would-

  oh dear me exclaimed kent
startled i couldnt think of visiting
your city at all unless the literary
women were united in wanting me
no no if you and mrs-er-hardy
and the friends of both of you are
quite unanimous in wanting me i might
-yes i will go so far as to say i
would-run over to your city and give
you an afternoon otherwise-no mrs
dallinger you mustnt ask me

  the judges wife thus thrown on the

	defensive blurted out the truth i
just cant do it professor mrs hardy
and i-im sorry to say it and i wish
it hadnt happened honestly i do-
arent on entirely good terms

  oh dear  oh dear  the great
man showed genuine concern too
bad too bad is the-er-dis-
agreement between you two one that
cannot be bridged

  i dont know

  have you a womans club in men-
don

  yes

  you and mrs-er-hardy both be-
long i presume mrs dallinger
nodded

  the president of your womans
club-perhaps she is a friend of each
of you

  yes shes mrs dorothy page
who knows if you were to go
to her and talk the matter over frankly
perhaps she would arrange a meeting
between you and mrs hardy at which
neither of you would have to make the
first advances and your misunderstand-
ings could be removed and everything
placed in perfect harmony

  she was on the point of agreeing
when she foresaw an obstacle

  i was thinking of having this meet-
ing for organization at my house and

  i understand he interrupted
brightly and you see that under the
circumstances it would be better to hold
it at the building or headquarters of
your womans club and to ask this
mrs page to preside a beautiful
lion for bait



thought mrs dallinger a generous
thought  quite agree with you
the officers- mrs dallinger be-
gan weakly but was again interrupted
you will be deeply interested to
know the custom that is being followed
in not a few similar organizations
throughout the country instead of
electing only a president whose duties
frequently embrace all the authority in
the club these societies are electing a
president and a director general the
president is the social arbiter of the
club as it were the director general
selects the courses of reading and the
programs each is practically supreme
in her own department such a club
really has two heads each equal to
the other in standing is it not a pleas-
ant idea 

  why yes yes i guess it is but

- professor kent waited smiling

tolerantly what are you to do when
a womans ideas of-of real literature

are xveak why she says--

  kent broke in the expression on his
face beatific

  what is it maeterlinck says you
love maeterlinck i hope mens weak-
nesses are often necessary to the pur-
poses of life could anything be more
beautiful 

  mrs dallinger surrendered uncon-
ditionally ill run back in my car and
call on mrs page this evening she
said can i understand if we ask
you to come about a week from now

that-

  for the culture of mendon and the
united women of that community i am
yours to command he said

  mrs hardy came at four her re-
ception in the same corner of the
same lobby included the same distin-
guished appearance the same superb
poise the same manner that was the
acme of dignified courtesy mrs hardy
also was awed and a little breathless

  she plunged into her errand strong
in the conviction that she must hasten
and not take up too much of the great
mans time

  it is very kind of you he said
gracefully when she paused for breath
to add your courteous invitation to

the other it is indeed delightful to
know that you ladies in mendon are
so united in the desire to advance cul-
ture

  then he told her of mrs dallingers
call

  if mrs dallinger said she was
speaking for all the ladies of mendon

- she began but got no farther

  oh my dear airs hardy you
dont mean to tell me there is any
schism among the cultured women of
your community oh that is too bad 
dear me and i had so anticipated the
visit

  dont change your mind professor
mrs hardys voice was almost tearful
the ladies whom i represent include
i assure you the women that are bent
on improving themselves those who are
striving to understand to see the big

things the noble things-

  the better things i feel sure of
it and yet-unless there were some
way of getting all the women to unite
i really should have to go at mrs-er
-dallingers invitation wouldnt i
mrs hardy became speechless

  as an entire outsider may i not
make a suggestion the professor said
winningly couldnt you arrange the
matter-i feel certain you could ar-
range anything in your city that you
really set out to arrange-so that all
the ladies could come together for this
first meeting of your club mrs dal-
linger suggested her home as the meet-
ing place but perhaps you could secure
the building or the rooms of the wom-
ans club if you have onte

  the president is one of my best
friends ill see her first thing in the
morning

  that is fine and perhaps she
could arrange it so that you and mrs
dallinger would unite in inviting me
mrs hardy suddenly recalled the
subject of the first dispute and deter-
mined to seek authoritative indorse-
ment

  we did not entirely agree as to the

name for the club and-

  now that is very kind of you mrs
hardy very kind indeed thank you
shall we say the mendon reading


the vovular magazine

club that is so simple so com-
plete so inclusive so-er-noncontro-
versial and i take it for granted you
and mrs dallinger will be the president
and director general

  whats a director general

  pardon me the custom has prob-
ably slipped your mind she plans all
the programs the president has charge
of the social duties such a delight-
ful division of authority neither higher
than the other yes i am sure you

and mrs-

  mrs hardy came up for the last
time

  professor kent she said with
trembling seriousness perhaps i ought
not to consult with you a stranger
about such a matter but really i must
you can do so much  good by your
advice at this first meeting mrs dal-
linger is a very prominent woman in
our town and all that but in literature
- really professor she is posi-
tively unsound that would be all right
if she were truly desirous of improving
herself if she were willing to listen to

what others say who know more-

  kent interrupted her his countenance
lighted by an inward glow 

  what is it browning says you
love browning i hope i judge people
by what they might be-not are or will
be could anything be more beauti-
ful 

  the mayors wife ceased struggling
and sank

  if things could be arranged-

she said

  im sure they can energy and de-
sire and tact always win

  as carroll emery dealt the cards
three evenings later in doc millikens
office the doctor turned to buck

  i been so busy stacking up these
amateurs chips as they insisted on los-
ing em to me this evening that i didnt
think to mention it but i saw gus dal-
linger and another friend of ours walk-
ing up toward home together to-night
thick as a couple of thieves whats
the answer

  never mind the conundrum buck
said emery what are you doin 

  openin it said buck promptly
skimming his cards for a dollar
what are the rest of you-all doin 

  im raising it five if youre talk-
ing to me said doc milliken

  sweetland and emery dropped out
the city marshal saw the raise and
buck also paid an extra five dollars
to draw

  one card called the doctor
two said the marshal ill be en-
tirely honest remarked buck and took
three

  five lit brown chips representin
five hard-earned dollars announced
buck and tossed them in milliken
promptly raised the pot ten dollars
the city marshal studied his hand ad-
dressed the company fluently on the
theoretical value of three small ones at
such a moment and passed

  buck grinning his poker grin in-
spected the stack of chips in front of
the doctor which was almost as tall
as his own

  filled your littie bittie straight did
you he said how much you got
there in front of you

  doctor milliken having counted his
chips announced that the total was ex-
actly thirty dollars

  ill have to tap you remarked
buck still laughing and pushed in
forty the largest bet he could make
under table-stake rules doc milliken
considered buck the pot and his hand
pass he growled and threw away
his cards you opened ill see em
anyway

  there they are to look at as pretty
a pair of jacks as you ever did see
chortled buck

  and nothin else exclaimed the
city marshal them as has gits

  may i live to see one of my family
vote the republican ticket cried doc
milliken if i didnt ditch two pairs
-aces up

  the answer to that buck said
gayly as he drew the pot toward him
-oh yes and its the answer to the
question you just asked too doc--is
that while it is hard to lie to old liars
and get away with it you kin kid old
bluffers-frequent
      m i   f i  some place there lias
been written or will lie written the
story that is your story we dont mean
that the story is about you it need have
nothing to do with the events and cir-
cumstances that form the outside and
visible part of your life it is your
story however because you recognize it
at once it seems as if it had been writ-
ten for you it speaks for you and tells
you your own thoughts more or less de-
scribes the things you are interested in
gives tile atmosphere you would like to
surround yourself with expresses for
you impulses and thoughts and feelings
that you know well enough but find it
impossible to put into words

             

w k are all inarticulate in the larger
sense it is bard for us to ex-
press in words our bigger emotions and
desires we need a spokesman that
is what the writer is for if he ex-
presses only his own thoughts he is
nothing xo writer can do our thinking
for us what we ask of him is to ex-
press lor us the things ztv feel and
think the american spirit is some-
thing made up of the thoughts and feel-
ings of thousands of unknown people
who have little or nothing to say for
themselves hut who gladly welcome any
one who can give them expression all
greatness in the last analysis resolves it-
self to this-that the great man is one

who has found a way to express the in-
articulate feelings of the multitude it
is true in all realms of thought ami
action oesar and xapoleon were but
the concrete types of an imperial spirit
that burned in the whole race darwin
and edison gave articulate form to the
scientific thought of their times thou-
sands had a vague grasp of the principle
of evolution of the possibilities of elec-
tricity and were struggling vaguely for
expression when the leaders gave it to
them as an individual rockefeller is
not so different from other men what
makes him a sort of human monument
is the fact that he made real and definite
the aspiration toward organization and
efficiency that has been americas gift to
the industrial and commercial world
lincoln himself was a great and living
expression and embodiment of the
thoughts and feeling of thousands of
americans who could vote and fight
perhaps but who needed lincoln to put
their thoughts into words for them
life hems us in on many sides the
bigger the idea or feeling the harder it
is for us to put it in words that seem
to mean aiij-thing we need people to
tell us our own thoughts and our own
stories

 

   o	chronicle of heroism has ever
thrilled you unless you have some-
thing of the hero in yourself how
many times have you declared with
  a chat with you-continued

paul jones that you had just begun to
fight or faced the firing squad with
nathan hale every one has within
him the spirit to play various parts in
life besides the one fate has apparently
chosen for him to awaken that spirit
to arouse generous emotions to help us
remember the scope and majesty of the
human mind and spirit to confirm in us
the knowledge that the life is more than
meat and the body more than raiment-
that is what stories are really for

the people who are working to make
the popular are telling you your
own story as you would have it not
once but many times holman days
novel the dictator in the present
number presents a drama that is being
played to some extent and in some form
in every state in the union we know it
is a story written for you it makes its
appeal to certain qualities of honesty of
unassuming courage and ability of stal-
wart americanism sure to awaken an
answering thrill the novel by james
li hendryx in the next issue -flat
gold is no less certain in its appeal if
you have never once felt like leaving the
cities behind and taking the bleak north
trail we dont know you as well as we
think we do

a a

hp he popular ought to be and in-
deed we believe that it is some-
thing more than a fortnightly collection
of stories we have tried to give it the
atmosphere you like we would like to
have it so that when you turned back
the covers you might feel that you were
entering the sort of country you like to

live in and meeting the sort of people
-good bad and indifferent-you would
like to work with or fight with or be
amused by or interested in we dont
want to take you to an unreal place but
out into a broader wider sort of life
if you are tired we dont want to lull
you into a stupor but awaken you to
that keener wider interest in life that is
the surest antidote for weariness and
lassitude

w e get many letters about the maga-
zine from writers we are glad
to get them for writers are generally
good and always generous judges of the
work of other authors what we espe-
cially prize however are the letters
from those who are so busy doing things
of various sorts that they have little
time to write and who find in the
popular some expression of their
thought and spirit if you happen to be
one of these remember that not only
is the magazine made for you but that
you yourself have a good deal to do
with the making of it it represents as
nearly as we can make it the sort of
magazine that you would make no one
story or set of stories can create per-
sonality for a magazine personality
depends on something much deeper
every publication has its own atmos-
phere its own peculiar quality we
hope it isnt for this sort of story or
that that you read the popular but
for its general atmosphere we hope
most earnestly that you like its per-
sonality--for so far as it is in our
knowledge and power to faithfully re-
flect it it is your own

h

left-handed trapshots

   as it ever occurred to you that south-
 paw trapshooters are a very scarce
 commodity they are

   scarce is about the mildest term that
 could be used in this connection there are
 upward of  trapshooters in this fair
 land and out of that number we have not
 been able to unearth  who blaze away at
 the inanimate targets from the left side

   noting the scarcity of southpaws at the
 traps in the most important tournaments
 we began a search for the shooter using his
 left hand in unison with his eye w e asked
 some of the best shots in the country if
 they could tell us a few of the portsiders
 of the traps and very few of them were of
 any assistance

   trapshooters pay little or no attention to
 each other at the traps and we learned that
 very few of them knew how their best pal
 shot there are many men who do every-
 thing with one exception with their left
 hand the exception is trapshooting
 there are a number of major-league base-
 ball players who throw with their left arm
 or hit from the left side of the plate but
 in every instance these men shoot from the
 right side

   therefore southpaw trapshooters are
 as scarce as hens teeth or the proverbial
 snowball in july lut what few left-hand-
 ers we have are good ones xeaf apgar
 of new york president of the westy ho-
 gans and one of the best-known profes-
 sionals began as a right-hand shot and
 switched to the left results from the right
 side did not please him-therefore the
 change in position it was just the oppo-
 site with lester german the aberdeen
 maryland professional f le shot from the
 left side before switching to the right the
 change didnt hurt i ester either

   william h iieer a professional of guth-
 rie oklahoma and one of the best shots
 that ever stepped to the firing line is a
 southpaw lie was the high average pro-
 fessional in  and in  he broke

                               tto for an
  and in  he broke

 his to mark was best professional aver-
 age until homer clark shattered s per cent

and two other won state championships in
 the grand american handicap win-
ners are r r barber a professional of
minneapolis and l b clarke vice presi-
dent of the hibernian bank of chicago
mr barber in  won the g a h
at indianapolis breaking  targets from

 r breaking  targets from  yards
and  straight in the shoot-off the state
champions are w a weidebusch of west
virginia and john f austin of louisiana
the fact that these men won state cham-
pionships is concrete evidence that they are
excellent trapshots another southpaw
is no less a person than frank gotch the
wrestling champion gotch isnt as good a
frapshot as he is a wrestler but he is a good
shot at that

  as far as numbers go the southpaws
do not show up very strong but when it
comes to bustin  the clays theyre right
there with the quality

	

trapshooting under municipal
auspices

xt ever has there been such a general in-
dorsement of any line of sport as has
been accorded trapshooting in the past twro
years

  the campaign to educate americans to
handle firearms has been universal and in
quite a number of cities men of affairs have
petitioned the park commissioners to set
apart a tract for trapshooting purposes

  spokane washington has been given
credit for having the first municipal trap
but such is not the case the first trap to
be installed under municipal supervision
was in nichols park jacksonville illinois
about twelve years ago but this was so
long ago that present-day writers are not
expected to remember

  in lincoln park chicago there are a
number of traps that are open to the public
every day except sunday omaha mil-
waukee minneapolis kansas city and
cleveland all have public traps

  wilkes-barre pennsylvania has a mu-
nicipal rifle range and the city council has
been asked to add traps for the scatter-gun
enthusiasts so has the scranton pennsyl-
vania city fathers

  new york city park commissioners some
time ago voted twenty acres of ground in
van cortlandt park for trapshooting leav-
ing the erection of club houses traps et
cetera to the shooters

by fannie hurst

  we are spending live thousand dollars this
month to tell you that the greatest short
story of the year has been written by
fannie hurst and is in the may metro-
politan would you is a gripping
tragedy of new york life in which a
womans love and the get on ambition
of a great city blend in a pathetic sacrifice

  the heroine is a modern ruth who in her
own way and in her own time lives out the
beautiful promise of her prototype whither
thou goest i will go and where thou lodgest
i will lodge thy people shall be my people
and thy god shall be my god

  in the same metropolitan is a great baseball story
binglcs and llack magic by hugh fullerton anti a
leroy scott detective clifford story also the love

story of thc-girl-who-wanted-to-go-in-lhe-movies by jo-
set to ierrish

  the facts of life are well faced too william itarj
back after six months in london for the metropolitan
has an enlightening article on knglaud at w ar

  a commanding contribution is an article by lord
northclilve lie compares lavyer-go erned america
with group-governed england much to our disadvan-
tage there is another instalment of the adventures
and letters of richard harding da is which has been
the literary event of the year

  theodore rooseelt who writes exclusively for the
metropolitan spent a busy day in the municipal court
of philadelphia where smc practical christianity is
taking the place of ponderous blackstone what he
saw and what lie thinks of the work done the colonel

how small investors have made large fortunes

you know and i know that small investors have made large
fortunes-men who guided by judgment and courage have
placed their funds direct into creative enterprises at their incep-
tion and thus reaped full benefit of the earning power of money today opportunity
on bended knee is entreating the small investor to accept her favors-and those who
heed the insistent call are achieving fortunes

     my magazine explains the rules by which small investors have made wise and profitable in-
 vestments-how  grows into -the actual possibility of intelligent investment

learn the real earning power of ii you can save  a month or more

your money

  the real earning power of your money is
not the paltry to sfo paid by banks or
by corporations that have their future be-
hind instead of in front of them invest-
ing for profit reveals the enormous profits
financiers make and shows how one can
make the same profit-it demonstrates the

how to determine the value of
different investments

  there are thousands of salaried people
today who have a small sum laid aside or
who can invest a small amount each month
-but who realize that they do not know
how to determine the value of the differ-
ent classes of investments that are offered
to them daily this condition has created
a demand for a publication or institution
whose express object is to help direct and
guide the small investor investing for
profit is the result of a pressing need and
sh o uld i e worth tens-perhaps thousands
of dollars to you

  investing for profit is for the min who in-
tends to invest any money however small or who
can save  or more per month-but who has not
yet learned the art of investing fur profit read
what russell sage one of the most successful
inanciers of his day said in regard to investments 
there is a common fallacy that while for legal
advice we go to lawyers and for medical advice we
go to physicians and for the construction of a
great work to engineers-financing is everybodys
business as a matter of fact it is tin most pro-
found and complicated of them all
