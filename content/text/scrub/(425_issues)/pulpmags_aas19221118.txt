the two faces

the lavender pall of a late tropical
afternoon hung like dead smoke in
the dreary repetition of pine ham-
mock and cypress swamps through which
no  had been steadily boring since early
in the morning a perspiring trainman
drew aside the green curtain and poked in
his head to announce languidly

 turpentine gents turpentine

  some one heaved a sigh the big man
     a	

in the corner contemplated the wet end of
his cigar critically the miami insurance
agent mopped his long nose with a pink-
bordered handkerchief and the dark-
skinned young man in gabardine methodi-
cally addressed himself to last-minute con-
tingencies

  jaca javalie as the dark-skinned young
man in gabardine was known in remote art
and musical circles could not recall a last
minute when there had not been contin-
gencies he could always depend upon
them something always happened the last


argosy-allstory weekly

minute the last step the last inch until
an hour ago the horizon had been flawless
now a coarse and massive individual with a
hard red face and a pair of hard suspi-
cious eyes bulked ominously upon it

  jaca javalie was relaxed in the black
leather chair-the only chair the smoking
compartment boasted-half listening with
only one ear to the insurance mans mono-
logue on florida climate industries cus-
toms personages and-climate the other
ear like a beetles feeler was attuned to
random vibrations

  javalie was irritably aware that the
large silent red-faced man in the corner
represented some branch of legal authority
a mirror over the nickeled tooth-brushing
basin had kept him informed that this man
had been for the last forty hot miles watch-
ing him with the absorbed and expectant
air of a cat watching a bird it was most
annoying

  the smoking compartment was blue with
the fog of good fellowship the insurance
man who sat in the favored seat the one
next the window was doing his best to up-
hold the first law of florida hospitality
which is to dispense information to the
stranger within the gates

  he was dispensing information he flit-
ted from topic to topic-and from tropic to
tropic-with the airy grace of a butterfly
and suddenly without in the least being
aware of it he was flattered with the un-
divided attention of javalies other ear he
had been speaking of the kinds of people
that florida would be better off without-
tin-can tourists at one pole lawless and
dissipated millionaires at the other

   now take this man banning the ex-
banker well be passin his place in a few
minutes just this side of majolica looks
like a castle-swellest place in this part of
the state y understand im broad-
minded and libral in my views as any man
but those bannings are a bad lot hes
one of these fellows wthore doin more harm
than good to this state

   is he spendin money you bet he is
chunks of it but that aint everything
y understand of course we want folks
to spend their money down here but flor-
idas outgrowin that stage hes got a

house full of flippers and flappers and flop-
pers drinkin gamblin and i hate to think
what else night after night it ain right
that kind of doings just gives the state a
black eye we want decent law-abidin
people down here-like yourself hotel
man arent you

  javalie smiled faintly no i play the
organ

  the big man in the comer upon whom
lay the unmistakable imprint of the laws
majesty slowly spilled from full red lips
a cascade of oily blue smoke the smoke
rolled down his shirt front mounted in a
veil through which his unblinking eyes
peered meditatively

  since he had boarded the palm beach
limited at vero he had been studying the
delicately modeled face of java javalie
had been plunged by the study into the
deepest thought xo movement no slight-
est gesture of the young man had escaped
him

  his mind was slowly revolving the quer-
ies where when what a blind game
of mathematics-permutations and combi-
nations the sheriff of bedloe county was
exasperated but he did not betray it he
had like many another of floridas officials
gone to an excellent school-the new york
police force a longing for equable climate
-a place in the sun-had lured him to the
land of golden beaches and cabbage palms
and here he had taken root he was not an
ordinary sheriff

 where when what

  his mind was a rogues gallery but the
dark face under observation was not filed
there this was not surprising he had
been away from new york for ten years
an organist eh well maybe

  the face of the young man in gabardine
perplexed him it was an interesting face
perhaps that of a religious zealot perhaps
that of a gifted crook a slender clever
face ot tanned olive divided into equal
halves by a slender clever nose broad
brows a thin cruel mouth rather an
irish face experience and suffering had
written their signatures upon it and refined
its angles

  devil take the fellow what was it the
sheriff expelled a small hurricane of smoke
red darkness



he had it now two faces one from
the arch of the nose up the other from the
arch of the nose down two faces two
forces-a good one and an evil one the
upper angelic the lower a devil it was an
absorbing game

  now-and it was for the first time since
the sheriff had entered-javalie took heed
of him turning his head as if he were mag-
netized by the very vitality of the sheriffs
thinking a flash of blue electricity from
deep-set penetrating eyes blue electricity
holy smoke

  the sheriff instantly decided  that lad
works through the ladies but he was
doing javalie a grave injustice when he
thought that javalie worked through no
one man or woman he was too clever
professionally women did not appeal to
him their hearts were too big for their
heads

  javalies lower face might have told the
sheriff that but he was done with analyz-
ing he had become the infinitely pains-
taking man of action

   yawning he stood up indifferently sprin-
kling ashes down the front of his limp blue
seersucker coat as he did so his clothes
fitted him like the skin on an elephant
aimlessly he lurched into the corridor and
cornered an amazed colored man

   that feller in the gabardine suit he
grunted  dark complected blue eyes
thin lips black necktie gray silk shirt
got him

   uhuh never mind me keep your

mebbe

  now jaca javalie had in the course of
his somewhat varied experience cultivated

a certain sense not easy to define in a
few words and had refined it to an ex-
quisite degree it corresponded in a way
to the delicately refined sense of sheriff
judson which had enabled him to discover
in javalies countenance after long study
two forces-one with a latent capacity for
good and one with a latent capacity for
evil-each conflicting with the other it
was a habit if you will of searching for
the little insignificant things that most men
overlook

   call it alertness call it trained observa-
tion call it anything you please but the
fact remains that within thirty seconds of
the time when the pullman porter entered
the smoking compartment javalie knew
that something was happening the por-
ter was not behaving naturally yet he was
doing nothing but straightening the towels
in the rack and fussing about the wash-
bowls as porters in smoking compartments
have been fussing since time immemorial

  the palm beach limited was whistling
for turpentine losing momentum and it
was due in majolica fourteen minutes later
although his ticket entitled him to go as
far as palm beach javalie had no inten-
tions of going to palm beach

  he brushed past the porter into the cor-
ridor and as the green curtain fell behind
him the indicator rang twice-two jabs of
a black thumb

  it was a code that javalie understood
instantly when he reached seat no 
the sheriff of bedloe county was drowsily
staring out of the window from seat no 
across the aisle

  his black suit case had been moved-a
glance assured javalie of that he unlocked
and opened it and extracted therefrom a
fresh package of cigarettes then he re-
locked it and started back toward the smok-
ing compartment

   the sheriff of bedloe county followed lei-
surely

  javalie stopped at the drinking tank
flipped a paper cup out of the sanitary
container and flattened himself against the
wall to permit the big man to pass with
a misty smile sheriff judson went by and
entered the smoking compartment

  javalie sipped the water slowly crum-


argosy-allstory weekly

pled the paper cup and dropped it into the
wire rack he went to the doorway and
looked in the sheriff was washing his
hands

  the train was stopping the brakes were
on a double file of gummy kegs glided
past the window a gray structure with a
tar-paper roof and a sagging ramp moved
into view-a turpentine still the building
jerked the train had stopped

  now javalie detested above all things
the role of low comedian he wtas essen-
tially a young man of unshakable dignity
and reserve and what the present circum-
stances demanded of him was singularly
distasteful he must to insure his safety
perform an act that smacked of low com-
edy there was nothing else to do within
the coming hour he had important plans to
execute

  after that hour had expired any one was
at liberty to watch him to follow him
but until that hour had expired he would
tolerate no interference and no watching
and what he chose to term low comedy was
his only salvation

  he dropped the heavy green curtain re-
turned to his seat picked up the black suit
case and proceeded to the other end of the
car

  the end of the station-a small canary-
colored building-was visible from the left
side of the vestibule going south all of
the stations were on the left side this
side of the vestibule had been opened-the
floor raised on its hinges and the door
clamped back

  javalie unlatched the platform on the
right side raised it opened the door and
clamped it back similarly the vestibule
could now be left or entered on either side
he descended on the left sie the station
side and walked briskly toward the end of
the train

  turpentine was in the heart of a pine
forest a drainage ditch half full of green
water and choked with hyacinths ran
through a concrete culvert under the
tracks it went under the tracks a few
feet beyond the platform of the observation
car

  when he reached the culvert javalie
looked back and saw sheriff judson in the

   act of leaving the car he had left he fol-
lowed leisurely

   so far excellent

   javalie circled around the end of the
observation car and ran there were a
number of empty gondolas on the siding
and beyond them a cluster of canary-
colored buildings but he did not run to-
ward any of these he ran fleetly beside
the observation car until he reached the
vestibule he had a few seconds before
opened for just this emergency

  he had hardly climbed aboard before
no  began moving he had hardly
concealed himself when the sheriff of bed-
loe county shot around the end of the ob-
servation car and stopped puffing to glare
at the line of empty gondolas and the scat-
tered canary-colored buildings beyond

   sheriff judson was giving these buildings
a thorough search when the palm beach
limited clicked around a curve and was lost
to sight

   jaca javalie seated on his black suit case
in the vestibule gravely wiped his dripping
face with a silk handkerchief he betrayed
none of the delight or relief you would nat-
urally have looked for at the ease the sim-
plicity with which he had outwitted the
crafty sheriff of bedloe county he was
in fact still rather resentful for he detest-
ed low comedy and his sense of nicety had
been offended

chapter ii

sackcloth and mystery

jaca javalie detested anything that
smacked of low comedy not that he
lacked a sense of humor and not en-
tirely because such parts offended his sense
of nicety the deeper reason was con-
tained in the fact that javalie was an artist
truly a great artist not with paints or words
or gestures-or with nitroglycerin and
breast drills as you many have erroneously
suspected-but with ideas it was artistry
that had to do with the brain

   given a set of facts and fancies that bung
together javalie could produce the most
brilliant the most extraordinary effects
the brain of this distinguished-looking
red darkness



young man approached if it did not ac-
tually cross the misty border line beyond
which lies genius

  the sheriff of bedloe county had called
him clever it was an insult the sheriff
had been nearer to guessing the riddle when
he had discovered the two conflicting forces
-the angel from the bridge of the nose up
the devil from the bridge of the nose down
then the sheriff had suspected women in
javalies electric blue eyes it was women
that had put the sheriff off the track
women happened to be the sheriffs weak-
ness they solved most riddles but they
didnt solve javalies

  even to himself it must be admitted
that javalie was a riddle and the key the
nearest approach to a solution lay between
the angel and the devil it had been a
lifelong fight-the devil on the one hand
the angel on the other fighting over the
possession of jaca javalie at times one
was uppermost at other times the other

a man with two conflicting souls a good
soul and a bad soul is a battlefield scarred
and desolated such a man is not to be
envied

  javalie did not move from the vestibule
once the train left turpentine with the
precious black suit case between his knees
and the brim of his straws hat gripped firm-
ly by the brown fingers of one muscular
hand he waited

  from time to time he leaned out squint-
ing his eyes against the rush of wind and
smoke from the oil-burning locomotive and
peered into the distance

  an orange grove laid out with the geo-
metrical nicety of a parchesi board fled
past him with ripening fruit shining in
great clusters in the late afternoon sunlight
the air when the exhaust from the loco-
motive was not carried down the wind to
him was sweet and languorous refreshened
now and then by vagrant puffs from the
ocean which lay close by sometimes it
was visible a gleaming immensity of softest
blue like a sheet of enamel the surf was
hidden there were no ships in sight it
was an empty ocean

    no  whistled down a lane of thin pine
  trees each trunk bearing a long white scar
  and a brilliant red-clay cup then came

rolling hills of yellow sand studded with
dry wind-blown clumps of scrub palmetto

javalie waited until the village of majolica
was in sight then he tossed the suit case
far out clutched his hat in both hands and
jumped

  the next few seconds were confusing and
painful the palm beach limited had not
lost much headway when he flew from the
platform into the candy bed of a dried
ditch leaving trains at high speeds was
one of the arts that he had never cultivated
yet he jumped scientifically with his legs
almost straight out relying upon his mo-
mentum to bring him upright

  his heels sank inches into powdery white
sand his knees instantly gave way and
he pitched forward heavily on hands and
knees he came dazedly to his feet and
discovered that his straw hat was in shreds
it had been carried under the wheels of the
observation car

  the loss of the hat did not concern java-
lie it had served its purpose and he was
through with it its purpose had been to
hide his hair and new that no restraint
was imposed upon it his hair fell in a
rippling chestnut mane almost to his shoul-
ders it was beautiful hair thick and curl-
ing and fine of texture it had taken java-
lie more than a year to grow that splendid
mane

  he shook it out ran his fingers through
it and stared across the tracks toward the
sea he was still dizzy from the shock of
his descent

  it was as though he had been deposited
in some bewitched spot from a magic carpet
or as if he were dreaming a beautiful dream
the soft blue sea and late afternoon sky
formed a background against wthich stood
a spanish air castle a vision of lovely colors
and exquisite grace a castle of pinks and
blues and milky white in a glorious garden
a low stone wall of palest rose inclosed
the dream

  the roof was of deep-blue tile a roof of
lapis lazuli within the walls were the
gardens the flame of their blossoms was
discernible even at this distance and the
castle was at least a quarter of a mile away
javalie stared at the dream castle with de-
lighted eyes it was indeed a material


argosy-allstory weekly

 projection of some great dreamers dream
 and the artist in javalie responded with a
 kind of ecstasy

   he drew his glowing eyes away from it
 directly as if with reluctance recovering
 his suit case he stepped over the tracks
 and entered the pine thicket beyond in
 the center of the thicket he found a clear-
 ing and disposed about the clearing like
 sentinels were four cabbage palm trees
 worn and gray from the beating suns and
 the sand-laden winds of a hundred years
 he was concealed here from observation in
 every direction

   he dropped the suit case and stood listen-
 ing faintly there came to him from the
 west singing voices then all was still
 again javalie sat down on the suit case
 and unlaced his oxfords with one shoe off
 he listened again a dull deep thudding
 pulsed through the air there was a distant
 crackling

   javalie waited with the shoe in his hand
 his eyes darting sharply to and fro the
 throbbing of surf on the hard beach was
 resumed

   he undressed with haste stripped to the
 skin and if sheriff judson was studying
 javalie then which very fortunately for
 javalie he was not he would have been a
 greatly astonished man

   before he removed the last of his clothing
 -a white silk union suit-jaca javalie was
 an ordinary young man with an unusual
 face when he was undressed he was an
 extraordinary young man altogether the
 skin of his body like that of his face was
 dusky satin but that of itself was not
 noteworthy in every gesture every un-
 conscious attitude every line javalie was
 a beautiful specimen of manhood he had
 the grace of perfect physical coordination
 his shoulders his arms his slim waist were
 those of a fighter his chest shoulders and
 back were corded with muscles they twist-
 ed and coiled when he moved he might
 have been training for months to attain this
 condition

   as a matter of fact he had been his
 physical perfection his muscular develop-
 ment the glow of vitality under his skin
 were due to months of the most rigorous
 training his body was simply in harmony

 with his brain javalie overlooked nothing
 the clothing he had removed he folded and
 assembled into a neat pile from the black
 suit case he removed a pair of white fiber
 sandals and two garments both strange
 one was a white cotton loin cloth the other
 was a robe of sackcloth roughly but strong-
 ly stitched the sleeves reached to his el-
 bows the hem touched his insteps

   with the chestnut hair curling about his
face and the gown falling about him loosely
a transformation was wrought a divine
sweetness had taken possession of that
clever ascetic face the angel you might
say had driven the devil out

   he examined himself in a little square
hand-mirror he smiled his lips seemed
to have lost their cruelty it was the smile
of a pure and beautiful soul tranquil and
serene the eyes glowed with a mysterious
and benevolent light

   here indeed was a man from out of the
ages significantly familiar yet elusive-a
man whose beauty and purity of soul shone
like a living flame in his countenance me-
thodically javalie packed his discarded
clothing into the suit case closed and locked
it scooped out a hole in the sand and buried
it the clearing would not be difficult to
find again

  he walked out of the pine thicket and
crossed the tracks proceeding slowly he
picked his way between bristling beds of
spanish bayonet toward the magnificent
estate

chapter iii

the great vacation

the house of banning was a house of
discord a house divided against itself
once one forsook the brilliance and
fragrance of sunlight and flowers for the
cool violet gloom of the great lower hall
one was in some manner made aware of
this there was a jarring note elusive but
there-a tension a prickling uneasiness

   as six oclock was tolled in the famous
carved-stone drawing-room one would have
been distinctly aware of reasons above
the tinkle of a fountain the voice of a man
and a girl sounded strident with displeas-
red darkness



ure one assumed that they were quarrel-
ing they were from another quarter
if one listened sharply could be heard the
voice of another girl plaintive in yet an-
other part of the spanish air castle a deep
rich voice boomed wrath and profanity a
door slammed

  it was an extraordinary atmosphere

  in a splendid dining room of mahogany
and amber sat the owner of the booming
wrathful voice-alone and in keeping with
the dignity of a tribal king a patriarch he
sat at the head of the table it was a re-
fectory table long and narrow its beauti-
ful antique lines concealed beneath a cov-
ering of irish linen two carved silver
candlesticks upheld clusters of candles
whose snowy purity contested with that of
the cloth

  the table was set for five five cocktail
glasses coolly misted each containing a
stoned ripe olive and a transparent topaz
liquid five assortments of glistening heavy
silver a black man in a white uniform
floated through the service door the man
at the table spoke to him all five cock-
tail glasses trembled so did the candle
flames

   what in the devil is the matter where
is my son my daughter mme jeanne
that-mr reynolds

  this is the voice of theodore p ban-
ning the richest retired banker in america
let us consider him and judge him while
the frightened butler flits about on his un-
happy errand that of bringing the errant
sheep into the dining room

  an aristocratic gentleman of about fifty-
five with a ruddy rather youthful and ex-
ceedingly stubborn face an abundance of
ivory-white hair brushed smoothly back
fiercely blue eyes under bristling tufts not
yet ivory white a correctly trimmed white
mustache sans points a rigid forceful
mouth a jaw to stand in awe of an aristo-
cratic and powerful man of fifty-five boiling
with anger

  fortune had lavished certain inalienable
gifts upon theodore p banning as the
business world of america had been com-
pelled to realize when he was still a very
very young man he had sprung from the
most casual of middle western stock he

was inexcusably powerful and dominating

modern science provides us with a casual
explanation of theodore p banning and
his kind the secret of his early power
his apparently easy success his later shark-
like grip on the money market lay in the
fact that he was biologically unusual he
was not like ordinary men any more than
napoleon or alexander or bismarck were
like ordinary men

  nature had endowed him with an inex-
haustible stream of vitality nature had
endowed him with an extraordinary equip-
ment of beautifully cooperating energy
glands-adrenals thyroids and pituitary
great men are explained on that basis now
it is not a question of fate or luck it is a
question of ductless glands of hormones

  at all events theodore p banning had
poured out his amazing energy year in and
year out men said he never slept and this
was only a slight exaggeration for thirty
years he took no more than six hours of
sleep in a night every morning of those
thirty years he awoke refreshed and in-
domitable

  the greatest mistake he ever made was
to retire aside from an occasional blind-
ing but short-lived headache he had never
been ill in his life he withdrew from busi-
ness sold out at the age of fifty-three
each of the years he had been on earth
represented to him one million dollars he
explained that he had made enough and
that he wanted to enjoy his family

  his retirement was a signal for great re-
joicing in many quarters how many men
were spared nervous breakdowns and finan-
cial desolation when t p banning sud-
denly withdrew his heavy fist from the
throttle of his juggernaut it would be im-
possible to estimate there was rejoicing
among another class of men as well among
newspaper men theodore p banning en-
joyed the reputation of being the hardest
man to interview in the financial district
his tremendous mind was not open to the
public like other men who have enjoyed
great power he had little but contempt for
the public the average man was a senti-
mental fool he was the daily victim of
silly emotions that was theodore p ban-
nings attitude toward the public but he


argosy-allstory weekly

was wise enough not to ventilate his private
views

  when he retired he relented charmingly
however he called the amazed newspaper
men into his private office-a temple in
which the clay feet of newspaper men had
never but once before trod and then during
the panic-and in an interview which was
published simultaneously the following day
by every newspaper within reach of a tele-
graph wire he graciously told of his plans
to live happily in the bosom of his family
during the days that were left to him

  he confessed that he deserved happiness
for he had worked very hard he even
unbent to answer a question shot at him
in regard to his formula for success which
every one of course wanted to know it
was his reply that  made  the interview
by this reply you will no doubt recognize
the man recall the interview  my suc-
cess is due wholly to a simple rule which
i have not once violated it is get up
one hour before the other fellow gets up
and go to bed one hour after the other fel-
low goes to bed

  thus it was discovered that the mighty
banning never took more than six hours
of sleep in a night-and never napped in
the daytime and this simple homely rule
on which the mighty banning modestly
based his success was freely commented on
all over the world

  foolish young men all over the world
tried out the rule did they become in
due course of time leaders of men and au-
tocrats of finance of course not but
how were they to know that banning like
napoleon and alexander and bismarck and
a few other of natures darlings wras a
biological freak-that a formula of success
is a formula of success only when it meets
ones individual requirements

  at all events banning retired and sought
in the bosom of his family the happiness he
so justly deserved what if his children
happened to be perfect strangers to him
that could be easily remedied

  his wife was in england when the cele-
brated interview was published she read
it in the london times and wrote him a
keen little note on stiff creamy stationery
which contained a coat of arms in relief

in the upper right-hand corner she was
no longer mrs banning she was lady
northam now years ago when the chil-
dren were young she had tired of his for-
mula for success-after he had persisted
in applying the formula to her own regi-
men-and secured a divorce and married
lord northam a man several years younger
than herself whose formula for success was
quite the other way around-if he hap-
pened to have one which is doubtful the
keen little note went the way of the other
keen little notes which his wife from time
to time addressed to him on family mat-
ters and he entered upon the great vaca-
tion with a spirit that was nothing if not
characteristic of him

  as one of the foremost among americas
aladdins he caused to be erected in a
breathless hurry two splendid temples to
the architectural art-the spanish air castle
in florida and a french chateau at south-
ampton

  we come now to a trait in his character
which is not so easy to understand unless
it be classified under greed which was
doubtless the dominating force of his career
the fire under the boiler so to speak this
trait as well as his own freakish revelation
of it is not uncommon among rich men
very rich bankers are often addicted to the
weakness of carrying upon their persons
huge sums of money-more money than
they could possibly find employment for
under any contingency very rich men gen-
erally pay their bills twice or three times
a year

  carrying about such immense sums as
they often do is foolish obviously and it
is a confession of the greed which domi-
nates them which has made them what they
are-rich bankers perhaps it is partly
fear perhaps it is analogous to the misers
despised habit of fingering counting his
gold silver and copper to touch-to feel
-to gloat over

  in a steel vault embedded in the concrete
back wall of a windowless alcove adjoining
theodore p bannings bedroom were lit-
erally shelves full of money not stocks
and bonds these were efficiently looked af-
ter by a famous new york trust company
but money-currency crisp new bills in
red darkness



neat packs hundred-dollar bills five-
hundred-dollar bills thousand-dollar bills
cash every cent of it legal tender drawing
no interest beautiful green and yellow en-
gravings

  that vault contained one might say
theodore p bannings art gallery he
loved money not for what it could buy
not because it represented the sweat of his
brow but for what it was if he had any
hobby at all it was that of playing with
his money he loved to look at it he
loved to handle it and it was safe no
thieves could break into that vault the
door and the walls were a foot thick an
electric or an oxyacetylene torch could cut
through perhaps-but in how many hours

a three-dial combination guarded its open
sesame

  unless one is well acquainted with the
higher orders of greed mr bannings art
gallery was a hard thing to understand in
a man who was in most other respects
so rational so unimaginative it was like
biting into an apple and finding a worm
his only other weakness-and it is hardly
fair to term it a weakness-was his very
positive but very private belief in spirits
not that he had the slightest desire to
communicate with any of them for he
hadnt the subject merely gratified a cu-
rious grain of mysticism which ran through
his psychic fiber

   upon his retirement it developed that
there was another worm in the apple he
was determined to lead his childrens lives
for them the tremendous flow of energy
which had washed him to success and power
must have an outlet he had while fight-
ing for his millions pictured himself in his
twilight years in the role of indulgent fa-
ther gentle guide and loving friend and
when the time came he found that his
two children nan and teddy were perfect
strangers to him almost enemies-for they
were members of an amazing new genera-
tion that he did not understand

    they declined to share any interests with
  him they were willfully determined to
  include him in none of their affairs why
  should they they had never done so be-
  fore why simply because he had descend-
  ed in their midst-like a strange airplane

out of the blue-should they do so now
when their attitude became clear to him
he was shocked and offended was he not
their father did they not owe to him every
stitch on their backs every morsel of food
that went into their mouths every dollar
they squandered on their frivolities had
he not slaved for them for thirty hard
years was he not entitled to every atom
of their affection every hour of their time
every thought that passed through their
heads 

   he did not of course put this in words
he awaited impatiently the adjustment that
time would make time went by and their
aloofness did not diminish he grew irri-
table and condemnatory he fought with
them he threatened dire punishments
the breach widened-and he knew what it
was to suffer agony he had learned to
know agon- intimately when his wife left
him for the gay lord northam but this
agony was worse he suffered as only
proud monarchs know how to suffer he
was enacting the leading role as we in-
telligently have perceived in the great fam-
ily tragedy of america-a tragedy which
is decidedly more american than european
or chinese

  children must grow up and divorce them-
selves from the parent stock that divorce
is their passport to life the present
highly criticized generation more vehement-
ly than any previous one is demanding its
passports

  theodore p banning did not know that
there was a new generation he had fatu-
ously believed all of these years that his
children were simply his children they
were his by god they would remain his
for two years the house of banning had
been a house of discord a house divided
against itself

   it was a fight to the death

chapter iv

mr banning in action

 the first member of his household to
 appear in answer to the tribal kings
 thrice-repeated summons was his
 daughter-in-law mme jeanne she ap-


argosy-allstory weekly

   proached the table with the air of one who
   would not have been greatly astonished if
   one of the handsome silver candlesticks had
   been hurled at her she sidled into the
   chair on mr bannings left with the tragic
   meekness of an abused kitten

    the young lady had recently been cry-
   ing her eyelids werereddened her cheeks
   swollen in all other respects mme jeanne
   was singularly attractive ringlets of glossy
   black hair were done up in a quaint and
   becoming manner on the top of her head

     she was a tiny thing with beautiful slim
   legs and beautiful snow-white arms her
   mouth was so small that one wondered at
   times if it were really there mr banning
   used to refer to her jovially at first as
    teddys watch charm in all sentimen-
   tal transactions he dealt extensively in time-
   honored bromides now as he regarded
   the red eyelids and the swollen cheeks his
   air was one of frank dislike

     where is my son

     mme jeanne and the five cocktail glasses
   shivered

     oh mon pere je-

     dont talk that damned language in
my presence

   she stared at him hopelessly her soft
brown eyes melting her little hands
clutched in her lap the tip of a tiny red
tongue protruded momentarily it always
did when mme jeanne was distraught it
was only a little uncontrollable nervous
gesture not intended to be impudent

    dont stick your tongue out that way
 please

    i am saw-r-ee

    you have not answered my question

    but teddy ees sleeping

   mr banning leaned forward pushing the
 silver out of his way his lower jaw pro-
 truded

    get him he grated  i dont care if
 he has to be carried to the table i am sick
 and tired of this nonsense do you under-
 stand me

   an event in the arched doorway provided
a distraction a confused impression of
blue pink and yellow momentarily pre-
vailed as a girl flew rather than ran into
the room pursued by a laughing young
man in white cricket cloth

     nanette banning had entered the tribal
  kings presence with her customary dignity
  and reserve she was the girl whom deep
  in his heart in the old pre-vacation days
  mr banning had fatuously cherished as
   the apple of my eye he had once heari
  a doting father refer in such terms to a
  successful daughter and mr banning
  lacking imagination had made the phrase
  his own

    an impartial judge of the older school
  would have been hard put to decide wheth-
  er or not miss banning could be called
  successful a jury of her peers would
  unquestionably have given her a rousing
  unanimous acquittal for she could smoke
  more cigarettes drink more educated gin
  dance longer drive a car better and hand
  out a snappier line than any of her near
  competitors she had been described by
  her contemporaries variously as the cats
  vest the eels elbow and the bees knee
  could praise be any higher

    the apple of mr bannings kindling
  eye to use a more discreet phrase was a
  portrait of her mother at twenty-one a
  radiant beauty but nanette possessed
  that which her mother had never possessed
  -fire and it wasnt divine fire either

    blue-eyed golden-haired with the com-
 plexion of a delaware peach she had cap-
 tured somewhere along in her late teens
 an irreverence of manner that provoked
 and exasperated her father beyond articu-
 lation he had hoped to subdue her during
 the great vacation but all of his crude and
 heavy-handed efforts had only seemed to
 make her worse

   she had absolutely no regard for his feel-
 ings she was not the sweet affectionate
 daughter of whom he had dreamed such
 pretty dreams-a daughter who would cud-
 dle up on the arm of his chair of an eve-
 ning and charmingly apply matches to his
 continually expiring invincibles where she
 got her lawlessness from was beyond him
 certainly not from him

  mr banning had changed his attitude
 only enough to look over at her when she
 flopped into her chair the thunderstorm in
 his eyes had not diminished a particle

   where have you been all day
nanette
red darkness



  miss banning lifted her eyes and sang
sweetly  oh gloom where is thy vic-
tor-ee

  he snapped answer my question

  she bent forward pushed the yellow hair
out of her blue eyes and mimicked her
fathers blood-curdling expression

    in bed she grated

   you came in at seven this morning

   quarter of eight dad dont cheat me

   where were you

   ha pete and i went fishing

   fishing

  no italics can convey the shocked amaze-
ment and incredulity which mr banning
embodied in his gasp

   yes dad-with an ivory-handled rake
but the fish got away with all our bait
we dropped-urn-lets see-about three
thousand oh we had a slick time didnt
we pete most wonderful night moon
stars-

  peter reynoldss position in the banning
household was not an easy one to define
he was a gracious well-mannered young
man on the leeward side of forty-he
claimed thirty-four-with thinning light-
brown hair through which his scalp shone
pinkly he danced wonderfully nan had
met him at a dance a month or so ago at
the royal poincianna and had forthwith
acquired him

  in private conversations with his daugh-
ter mr banning scornfully referred to their
guest as  that damned beach comber
yet he had nothing against pete reynolds
except that nan liked him and that he
spoke french well enough to converse un-
intelligibly-to him-with mme jeanne
certainly-with the possible exception of
mme jeanne-he was the least trouble-
some member of the family pete was in
fact the very soul of diplomacy

   was ted with you

   nope

   he wasnt mr banning now ad-
dressed fresh thunderclouds at the unhappy
jeanne  where was he madame

   i do not know my father

   you do not know you are his wife
  and you do not know where your husband
  spent the night my god what time was
  it when he came in

   eet was seex praps seffen

   why werent you with him

  nan snorted

    dad for the love of mike let the poor
child alone pick on somebody your size
pick on me

   i will attend to you in one moment
madame i told you to tell your husband
to come down do you intend-

  but mme jeanne with a swish of silk
a twinkling of slim ankles had bolted

  mr banning with a slow convulsive
movement of the shoulders hunched the
collar of his white linen coat a fraction of
an inch upward he deposited his elbows
on the table and clasped his hands under
his nose boards of directors had learned
to squirm in their chairs when mr ban-
ning did nothing but this it corresponded
to a slap across the cheek with a gauntlet
it meant  look to your steel  when
theodore p banning planted his elbows
on a table and clasped his hands under
his nose some one was going to be hurt
in the two years nan had known him
she had learned to interpret these signals
correctly

  they did not frighten her in the least
and she had yet to be vanquished her
father should have known that it is noth-
ing but folly to carry battlefield tactics into
the bosom of ones family but mr ban-
ning was a difficult man to teach he much
preferred to instruct others

  a clash now was inevitable nan sip-
ping her cocktail contemplated him over
the rim of the glass with luminous blue eyes
they were beautiful provocative eyes she
put the glass down and fished for the olive
with slim white fingers

   fire when ready gridley

    i am going to tell you something her
father began firmly

   ah you are sick and tired of my
conduct

  he squinted and when his eyes opened
they seemed to flash

   i am sick and tired of your conduct
this has been hanging in the air for days
i am going to settle it to-night-now this
is-the end

   oh dad how dramatic do go on
   i want no more of your impertinence


argosy-allstory weekly

 have tried for the past two years to
understand you i have tried-

    but dad you havent really you
have positively neglected me you havent
courted me at all the past two years
have been nothing but a continued per-
formance of  nan dont do this  nan
you mustnt do that nan i disapprove
of her  nan i think hes a common for-
tune hunter

    and when you havent been blacklist-
ing my actions and my friends youve been
plunged in disgusting-perfectly disgusting
-poker orgies you havent tried to un-
derstand me you havent tried to be nice
i dont think you have any cause to com-
plain at all really father

   but mr banning was not to be side-
tracked so easily

    you were out all night

    i admitted it pete will bear me out
we were playing a perfectly innocuous rou-
lette system at bradleys its a good sys-
tem even if it didnt work you simply
alternate on the-

    all night he repeated  all night
with a man i dont know from adams off
ox you say-

   nan thumped the table with a clenched
fist and sprang to her feet

    i wont stand for that if my own
father is going to cast reflections-

   he managed a final interrogation

    how do i know

   but it left him wide open to a killing
thrust and he knew it

  she replied curtly  you have my
word

   of course she had skillfully brought it
around to that mr banning removed his
elbows reluctantly from the table one of
the things one does not do in questions
involving honor is to doubt ones daugh-
ters word

   but mr banning was not defeated he
was only outwitted he was merely re-
tiring to bring up fresh reenforcements

   nan resumed her seat with sullen eyes
and blazing cheeks she sighed wearily
her father had never he was forced to
admit seen her so beautiful as she was
now radiant with emotions only partly ex-
pended

  when she was angry indignant as she
was always after their little tilts she blazed
with a beauty that actually pained him-
his heart why would she not learn that
his reiterated donts were his only way of
conveying his love he was not he fre-
quently told himself a demonstrative man
why would she not meet him halfway
he adored her was she blind to that
did she really hate him why then was
she so unkind

   he was still staring reproachfully at his
cocktail glass when his son trailed by poor
frightened mme jeanne entered the scene
theodore p banning jr did not come
all the way into the dining room he
stopped in the doorway with a purple
dressing gown folded indian style about
him a grotesque figure with dark hair
disheveled eyes nearly closed and very
murky a face that might have been
chalked he glanced sulkily from pete
reynolds to his sister thence on to his
father

   there was all but scarlet murder in his
fathers eyes

  now if theodore p banning adored his
daughter he fairly worshiped the ground
upon which his only son walked cast in
his own image eye for eye bone for bone
sinew for sinew he was something more
than a chip of the old block he lacked
it was true his fathers driving dynamo-
like energy but he made up for it in other
ways

  he was very quiet very slow very me-
thodical lacking entirely his sisters spon-
taneity his anger was not easy to arouse
but when it was aroused it was dangerous
it burned steady and long it didnt
flare up and die out as did nanettes he
thought things out teddy did he was
something of a dreamer a philosopher and
being a philosopher he frequently sought
solace in drink

  loving his only son as he did it was
only natural that mr banning should be-
tray his tenderness constantly in his attitude
toward him his attitude therefore was
one of constant abuse he abused teddy
at every propitious opportunity he tam-
pered with his private affairs whether the
opportunity was propitious or not
red darkness



  a case in point was the late and not
unlamented war when the time came for
us to participate teddy was old enough
to go-eighteen he was a healthy speci-
men well built strong and endowed with
amazing powers of endurance he was ad-
mirably fitted in all respects for service in
the front-line trenches he volunteered
before the draft caught him his father
who had not been consulted merely gave a
few casual suggestions to one of his secre-
taries

  within two weeks teddy discovered him-
self in the act of being transferred from an
infantry training camp to a second lieuten-
ancy in a non-participating washington
bureau

  it took some time for teddy to trace
effects back to their causes when he iden-
tified his fathers fine spencerian hand as
he presently did he applied for leave ob-
tained it and went to new york he had
been given time to think it over and the
more he thought the angrier he became

  in no uncertain terms he told his fa-
ther not only what he thought of slackers
but of those custard-hearted beings who sat
in the seats of the mighty and contributed
to the delinquency of slackers it was the
first real clash they had had and the fa-
ther was too proud of his son and too
ashamed of himself to do aught but yield
when next heard from teddy was throwing
hand grenades in picardy and enjoying his
leaves with the son of a tonowanda new
york dry goods merchant

   he returned in the spring of  from
occupied territory with a french bride fed
up with the soldier business and eager to
take part in the universal reconstruction
program which was being discussed so
largely by the newspapers about then he
was merely leaping it proved from the
frying pan to the fire for it was imme-
diately after his return that mr banning
had decided to take the great vacation to
become the indulgent father the gentle
guide and the loving friend of his two hand-
some children

   his son lounging white-cheeked and
  blue-lipped in the dining room doorway
  after a night spent god knew how and
  with whom was eloquent testimony to the

 kind of success that had crowned his ef-
 forts

 teddy said surlily

  i am not hungry i dont want any-
 thing to eat all i want is sleep ive
 got a headache and i feel rotten i wish
 youd leave me alone

 his father glared at him a moment

  theodore where were you last night
  down the road

  drinking

  certainly

  dont be impertinent

 a muttered oh lord distinctly
  yes sir drinking

  what else

  what else god knows

  were there women in the party

  i dont know i dont remember

  what do you remember

 the boy straightened up angry finally
  what is the charge father murder

  i want you to answer my questions civ-
 illy i am sick and tired of your conduct
 leaving your wife alone here all night
 coming in after sunrise this morning look-
 ing like some degenerate alley ruffian i
 demand an explanation

 teddy glanced at his sister who snorted
 contemptuously then back at his father
 with a weary sigh

  there isnt any

 the insolence of the sigh was the last
 straw his father lurched to his feet with
 knotty veins bulging out in his forehead
 his complexion seemed to be turning black
 his eyes bulged horribly he brought his
 fist down on the table with a smash and
 shook with futile rage well the explosion
 had come at last

  you- you- he shook his fist at his
 son shookrit again at his daughter  my
 children he laughed wildly mockingly
  my darling children look at you an
 impertinent shiftless vagabond and a
 drunkard for a son a gin-drinking
 cigarette-smoking gambling she-devil for a
 daughter who stays out all night with
 damned beach combers 

 pete reynolds ventured indignantly
  see here now by jove i wont-

 mr banning ignored him and backed
 through the doorway


argosy-allstory weekly

   so this is what ive slaved and driven
myself for all my life i tell you-i tell
vou damn you i wish youd never been
born

  nanette sang tauntingly as he vanished
 gosh are we to be blamed for that
too

chapter v

hatreds ugly light

a balmy languorous breeze fragrant
and fresh from the gulf stream
greeted mr banning when he strode
furiously out of his house and upon the
great southern veranda a balmy languor-
ous breeze and the strangest apparition it
had ever been his privilege to gaze on-a
handsome dark-skinned young man in a
robe of brown burlap which reached almost
to his toes a slender athletic young man
with a flowing chestnut mane which reached
almost to his shoulders framing a counte-
nance in which benevolence shone like a liv-
ing flame

  he was smiling tranquilly as if his
thoughts were good and his eyes were se-
rene and humble mr banning drew in
his breath swiftly and exhaled it with the
words  good god where did you come
from

  the answer in a voice as rich as musical
as full as an organ note was as astonishing
as the apparition i am the voice of one
crying in the wilderness

  mr banning continued to stare at him
as if bewitched then shades of doubt
and suspicion flickered over his eyes he
had cut his wisdom teeth in an environment
where cranks were bluntly dealt with he
snapped  who are you

   my spirit is one that surpasseth all
worldly understanding

  mr banning waved an impatient hand
up and down

   that-that sack affair youre wearing
he said  whats the idea thats what
i mean

   the good in heart are simple javalie
explained with a forgiving smile

  the banker scratched his head what
he could not understand all other things

being understandable was the expression
in this queerly garbed young mans hand-
some dark face he had never except at
a distance beheld bona-fide holiness and
he strongly suspected that it was shining
before him now

   humph well-uh-what can i do for
you

   nothing my friend i do not take i
give

   nothing mr banning surrendered
unreservedly to amazement now  well
then what-what-

   i have been drawn here i do not know
why the astonishing stranger assisted him
in his full rich beautiful voice  such
things are beyond my power to explain
there is trouble in this house there is
hatred i do not know why i know but it
has been revealed to me

  you are the master here ah yes
you consider yourself a rich man to be
sure yet you are not you are poorer
by far than i-and all i have in the world
is this coarse robe these poor sandals did
you not realize that the moment you saw
me my friend you did not know why you
knew but you knew

   well ill- mr banning began in a
strangled voice  well ill be- he tried
again and again checked himself although
he was fairly blinking with bewilderment

  and because he omitted that perfectly
natural  damned javalie knew that the
most difficult step in the execution of his
difficult and delicate program-the one that
had worried him the most-had been trium-
phantly taken

   see here young man- mr banning
was still struggling with worldly doubts on
the one hand and the silvery grain of mys-
ticism which ran through his psychic fiber
on the other

  he yielded still struggling to the latter

 sit down sit down what did you say
brought you here

  he had as always when his interest was
captivated lighted one of his long black
havana specials dragging a singapore
lounging chair close to the one he had
settled himself in he thumped on the arm of
it imperatively

  the young man in the sackcloth garment
red darkness

   seemed not to have heard him with a
   hand shading his eyes he was gazing across
   the flaming banks of poinsettia and bou-
   gainvillea toward the sun the sanguine crest
   of which was just visible above the pine
   thicket across the tracks

     his lips were moving as if in silent
   prayer for a half minute at least he was
   engaged thus then he squatted on the floor
   and looked searchingly into the retired
   bankers flushed face

     mr banning frowned and puffed

      by jove what in the-what are you
   young man-a sun worshiper

       life goes into the west javalie replied
    very low

     mr bannings frown darkened  are
   you a pilgrim

      a pilgrim of a sort perhaps

      what else a healer do you lay on
   hands or-

     he checked himself

     javalie was gazing at him sternly the
   lines about his mouth hardening

      do you question the power that lies
   within yourself do you question the
   source of the good that resides in one man
   of the evil that dominates another why
   do you ask these empty questions you
   say  where do you come from what
   can i do for you what are you what is
   your name i say i come from every-
   where-from the mountains the deserts the
   seas i say i am the symbol of a power
   which heals the wounds of souls you do
   not understand me i say this is a house
   of hatred it blazes out like an ugly light
   that is why i am here you cannot un-
   derstand that i want nothing from you but
   you will not turn me away

      you do not believe me you say he
 is a beggar you say he is a thief it is
in your eyes but your heart knows that
your eyes are lying

good lord mr banning declared
 look here my friend forget what my
eyes are saying forget what my heart is
fi thinking listen to me a moment i have
made a lifelong study of mens faces and
yours is a stranger to me what youve said
its true how youve come by that knowl-
edge i dont pretend to understand the
nameless man from nowhere eh come

into this house with me ill show you
where that ugly light of hatred is coming

from 

  javalie followed he did not miscon-
strue the motives which underlay mr ban-
nings eager invitation

  mr banning looked upon him as a freak
he would be proud to exhibit such an un-
usual find at the same time mr banning
who had all of his life dealt with hard cold
facts had encountered probably for the
first time a man who positively refused to
deal with facts

  he was impressed even more than he
realized

chapter vi

jordan is a hard road

following the tribal kings precipi-
tate retirement the dining room had
been given over to warm discussion
pete reynolds had a solution at the tip of
his ever-ready tongue he remarked with
a crushed air

   i know whats wrong ive worn the
 welcome  off the mat the row started
over me-adams off ox alias the damned
beach comber it will clear the ozone if i
fold my tent like the arabs i will fold to-
morrow

  nan bannig turned on him tigerishly
 pete reynolds youll do nothing of the
kind you dont figure in this at all dad
is simply wild at the wray teds been cutting
up he takes it out on the guilty and inno-
cent alike and i dont blame him

  her brother glided swiftly across the
room fumbling at the hem of his purple
dressing gown he slipped into his fathers
chair sagged over the table and peered
leeringly into his sisters flushed face

  the hell you say id like to know
when you were elected to sit in judgment
on the things i do you give me a pain
all of you give me a pain if he isnt rag-
ging me youre pulling some of your cold
storage sarcasm and when it isnt you
jeanne is whimpering about the way--
jeanne forlorn wet-eyed all but forgot-
ten in the doorway whimperingly protest-
ed  mon cfter tu nas pas-


argosy-allstory weekly

  he spat at her  tai toi venez ici
asseyez vous we are going to settle this
now-whos who and whats what

  mme jeanne crept to the table and slunk
into her chair with bowed head and tremu-
lous throat

  nan reached over suddenly and patted
her brothers hand

   now ted just hold your prancing stal-
lions a minute and listen to what i have to
offer leave jeanne out of it we know
you made a mistake when you married her
but thats something to settle some other
time

   what weve got to face is the big mis-
take we came home from the war to were
neither of us fitted to earn our own living
and if this feud goes much further our wor-
shiped parent is going to turn us out in the
most approved movie style its in the air
as he said were in for it lets face the
facts

   now heres what im going to do im
going to tell that high-handed monarch ex-
actly what i think of him then- listen
ted pete wants to marry me at least
he admits it under sufficient stimulation
when sufficiently pressed its up to pete
my notion is that we simply ought to beat
it father will cut me off without cigarette
money let him damn it im tired of
jazz anyhow petes poor as blazes but
were both young were nt afraid

   i dont believe pete put in sagacious-
ly  that we should do anything so-well
so rash to-night wait until after the
party anyhow

  nan shifted her attention to him gazed
at him with hard speculative young eyes
what do you mean by that pete she
asked softly

  her brother sneered

   ill tell you what he means by that
he drawled  he means hes yellow he
means hes nothing but a rotten he-gold-
digger-thats what he means 

  nan shrieked

  pete reynolds had flung one arm across
her face as he grasped a handful of teddys
hair with the other he was preparing to
strike

  mme jeanne was pressing a bouillon
spoon hysterically to her breast

  the tableau had progressed thus far when
mr banning and javalie entered

   here my friend the banker cried
gloatingly  is the source of that ugly light
of hatred mr reynolds kindly resume
your seat theodore will you oblige me by
taking your customary place i wish to
introduce to you a gentleman from afar-
a gentleman without a name whose philos-
ophy may entertain you the keynote he
strikes as you will observe is extreme sim-
plicity

  mr banning flashed an ironical smile
about the table

  the light from the northern window had
dimmed the candle flames flickered at the
tops of their long virtuously white stems
and glowed pallidly upon surprised faces
teddy suddenly relaxed was grinning
nans smile was like that of mona lisas
there and still not there jeanne was star-
ing with mouth agape as though the tall
shadowy figure in the sackcloth robe might
have been a vision or a specter perhaps
the candlelight invested javalie with an air
of mysticism almost of unearthliness which
the glow of sunset had only suggested it
softened the lines of his meuth and jaw
it deepened his eyes and heightened their
mystery

  pete reynolds was studying him through
suddenly narrowed eyes and it was upon
reynolds that javalie bestowed his longest
glance

  he was not smiling he advanced to
the foot of the table and there he stopped
with his hands clasped behind him and
an expression of wonderment upon his face
the spell was broken by the entrance of
the colored butler who halted and gazed
with blinking eyes at the apparition

  he was brought to earth by mr ban-
ning

   dont stand there like a gibbering
idiot a chair for this gentleman

  javalie said gravely i do not use a
chair

  this was greeted by a moment of un-
certain silence then a chorus of laughter
the negro retired in a daze

   wont you have a drink mr-mr
gentleman without a name this hasnt
been touched

  nan pushed her brothers cocktail glass
toward him without moving her eyes from
his

  javalie met her slightly mischievous gaze
with one of tranquil benevolence she
seemed to become aware then for the first
time that his face was made up of integral
parts she relinquished the cocktail with-
drew her hand and candidly stared at him
then she shifted her eyes quickly to her
father whe in javalies own attitude with
arms behind him was staring triumphantly
down at her

   well nan

   dad what does this mean

   i dont know nan the young man is
a stranger to me

   at all events pete reynolds mur-
mured dryly  he does not look upon the
gin when it is synthetic

  nan shrugged her shoulder nearest pete
to enjoin silence and addressed the mystery
man directly

   do you mean youre not going to tell
us who you are-or where youve come
from she said softly

  teddy was leaning forward with drooping
lids and a twisted grin  how was every-
body up on mars when you left

  nan was no longer smiling the same
ineffable thing in the strangers dark hand-
some face that her father had described
for lack of a better name as holiness was
making its appeal to her something in his
deep-set penetrating eyes in the expres-
sion about his serene mouth sobered her
it was one of the most interesting faces
she had ever seen and with the mellow
light of the candles playing upon it it
reminded her of some one her brain raced
back to an afternoon in paris-a stroll
through the louvre-a portrait of ignatius
of loyola

     youre a jesuit she cried

     nor a franciscan nor a trappist
  javalie said gravely  but a stumbler
  along the blind trail that we call life you
  ask me questions that i cannot answer
  i came to this house without knowing
  why-

   hold on young man mr banning
  stopped him  you came to this house
  because you saw a bright and ugly light

     	a

 no one but nan took this seriously  a

 bright and ugly light

  hatred said her father kindly

  a fanatic reynolds muttered

 javalie regarded him thoughtfully and it

 seemed with a measure of relief

  i am what i seem to be that is what
 we all are we live and so we are we
 are written in plain letters for the others to
 read

  holy man nan inquired solemnly

  can you read me or is the writing sim-
 ply unpublishable

 he gravely answered  the writing as
 it is written by your own acts is distressing-
 ly vivid

 there was a mild explosion from mr
 banning

  i knew it the man is a genius
 distressingly vivid isnt it perfect
 ive hunted for that phrase for the past two
 years and this young lady-my daughter-
 in-law

  a bleeding heart
 u oh juniper exclaimed teddy

 his father glared at him  this young
 man knows what he is talking about theo-
 dore how-how about me-uh-holy
 man

  cold steel

  here now here that isnt-

  perfect nan cried  and this gen-
 tleman-mr reynolds

  sifting sand

 every one laughed but reynolds who
 scowled

  gorgeous  agreed nan  and my
 brother-

  red darkness

  perfectly slick

  what do you mean by that mr ban-
 ning demanded

  you have asked for symbols javalie
 replied  i do not try to interpret them-
 so soon

  do you read palms too holy man
 nan inquired innocently

 he gazed at her as he had done before
 with that wondering serene gaze which
 seemed to penetrate to the very core of
 her

 she resisted it as long as she could and
 her eyes suddenly dropped it was the first


argosy-allstory weekly

time in memory that a man had been able
to make her do that

  it was confusing but she glanced up
sparklingly

   how long would it take you to inter-
pret our symbols

   javalies head moved vaguely

   stay until youve done it mr ban-
ning exclaimed

   nan added hurriedly  of course youll
stay wont you wed love to have you

    of course hell stay

   stick around old trouper teddy
urged him huskily  if you think you saw
an ugly light wait until youve been in
this happy household a day or two huh
wait until the shindig starts to-night

    duty has called me here javalie ad-
mitted quietly  yes ill stay

  the negro had returned with bouillon
cups and dishes of salted wafers javalie
at his appearance had turned gracefully
to the west with one hand at his fore-
head his lips moved rapidly as if in prayer
the silence was except for the remote rum-
bling of the surf absolute while he per-
formed this rite

  no one was smiling now but the banker
and his was the unchanged smile of tri-
umph with which he had inducted his find
into the bosom of his family

  when javalie turned back to the table
his host asked gayly  do you eat all of
your meals buffet style

   i must stand while eating food is no
less a gift from heaven than the light from
the sun and the stars he smiled tender-
ly  it is one of my beliefs

   your own personal belief nan want-
ed to know

  he nodded

   you mean you dont belong to any
sect

   to none that i know of

   are you-proselyting

  he smiled again  perhaps i am in
error no i cannot take that responsibil-
ity i have seen no visions i am not a
st ignatius how and why my beliefs are
inspired-i know not i have stumbled i
have fallen but-i have risen to my feet
again his wonderful eyes glowed with re-
ligious fervor

   and you believe youve got to stand
 while eating

    yes my friend

  mr banning nodded amiably  do just
 as you please it is the law of this house-
 hold every one does as he pleases and
 answers to no one youll have soup

    i do not touch food that is desecrated
 by fire

  what well well pardon me my
boy but you dont look it you look like a
meat eater to me

  he and his daughter exchanged glances
 and smiles they were the first friendly
 smiles they had exchanged in goodness
 knows how many weeks

   javalie had intercepted them his pro-
 gram was proceeding if not precisely ac-
 cording to schedule at least on a satisfac-
 torily parallel course he was accepted as
 wandering minstrels were accepted by the
 feudal barons of medieval times but he
 was accepted

  he watched mr banning eat mr ban-
 ning like all active aggressive men was a
 hearty eater he enjoyed good food and
 he ate quantities of it

   javalie delicately devoured two apples a
 sliced tomato and a small dishful of wal-
 nut kernels mr banning ate fresh shrimp
 salad three thick juicy slices of red roast
 beef and five large baked potatoes as well
 as other foods which had been desecrated by
 fire

   javalie had had only a light luncheon
 he was very hungry the sight of mr ban-
 ning enjoying his food was almost painful to
 him mr banning had hewn close to the
 line when he had guessed javalie to be a
 meat eater javalie loved rare roast beef
 before the meal was finished his appearance
 was more that of a mystic than it had been
 when the meal began jordan is a hard
 road

chapter vii

the moon room

mr banning had a number of
fixed habits one of these was to
sit down to dinner punctually at six
another old and unshakable habit was to
red darkness



 take his after-dinner liqueur in the dining
 room he sipped with deep enjoyment one
 ounce of napoleon brandy it was a ritual
 he had observed for twenty years he
 claimed it aided digestion and materially
 shortened the evening

  javalie appreciated good brandy he was
also fond of frapped creme de menthe col-
orless which the others drank but he
allowed himself nothing more stimulating
than distilled water

  when the brandy ritual was concluded
mr banning took him up to a guest room
 you have probably walked a good many
miles to-day young man

   what is distance javalie smiled

   i know-i know but you probably
wont feel any the worse for a good shower
or a tub were having a little party here
to-night and you must not miss it my
parties are generally very interesting events
you will no doubt be shocked i want you
to be shocked it will make explanations
easier h-m i suppose you dont sleep on
a bed do you

   the hard ground with only the stars
for a canopy has been my couch for many
years

  mr bannings lips twirked but he con-
trolled them in time

   well a good many of us would be bet-
ter off if we followed your example now
that buddhist prayer rug over there-that
really ought to be as comfortable as the
ground dont you think or do things
woven by the heathen-

   the buddha of kapilivastu was a man
after my own kind my friend-an earnest
seeker after the truth

  the banker rubbed thoughtful fingers
over his crisp white mustache

   i-i suppose so young man it seems
to me youve got some pretty fine ideas
tucked away in the back of that good-
looking head of yours what you said
downstairs about my children struck deep-
struck very deep red darkness now
that-that did perplex me red darkness
that really troubles me young man do
you suppose-i mean- red darkness
just what did you mean by that

   your son javalie replied sadly  is
trembling at the brink of a bottomless pit

red darkness surrounds him the world
in which he lives is always plunged in night

a soul struck blind

  mr banning was frowning attentively
 i cant quite understand all of that but
i dont say there isnt sense to it the
ugly light of hatred thats where you hit
the nail on the head

   young man- h-m you dont sit
down do you well i can say it standing
up in just as few words for the first time
in two years i actually enjoyed my dinner
to-night with my family you have brought
something into this house i dont know
what it is you-you drew us together in
a way we laughed together now dont
take that as an offense what i mean to
say is your presence has somehow taken
off a dreadful strain

   dont take it into your head to leave
in -a hurry-thats what i wanted to say
stay here ill make it worth your while
theres mighty little i wouldnt do for a
man who straightened out this family snarl
of mine

javalie lifted his hands and slowly let
them fall he shook his head sorrowfully

 why is it that you reduce all humanity
all life into the two cruel words deliver
and pay money what can i do with
money will it make me any happier

  mr banning nodded guiltily  i spoke
hastily i see i did not mean to offend
you simply wanted to give you some-
uh-idea of my earnestness my anxiety to
have you stay youre not apt to take it
into your head to-to go on-are you i
cant tell you how anxious i am to have
you here could you give me some assur-
ance

  javalie replied in a voice that was little
less than a blessing  i will stay if you
so desire it my friend until i have fin-
ished

  when mr banning was gone javalie
locked the door and sank into a chair with
a sigh of utter exhaustion he had re-
hearsed the scene with the banning family
every day for the past three months stand-
ing before a mirror practicing his serene
and benevolent smile yet in spite of the
smoothness with which it had gone through
he was trembling in every nerve and wa-

     ters even more ticklish jay ahead he
   studied the room with critical approval it
   was done in warm grays with an undertone
   of chinese blue gray walls gray hang-
   ings gray furniture gray-and-blue rugs
   dared he sleep in that wonderful bed no
   a bed with fresh linen once occupied was
   altered in a thousand respects

     he stretched out his arms yawned and
   grinned then he sobered according to
   the architects plans which he had secured
   and studied until he knew the house of ban-
   ning by heart the bankers bedroom should
   be two doors from his own he would have
   preferred an adjoining bedroom but no
   matter it was enough that he had the free-
   dom of the house

     he went over to one of the windows and
   gazed through fine-mesh copper into the
   dusk a patch of the afternoon sky still
   lingered in the east a blue ground on which
   were piled massive cubical clouds stained
   saffron the kind of solid-looking clouds that
   howard pyle loved to paint in all their soft
   brilliance

   from his window to the dim white beach
 stretched the famous garden he saw trel-
 lises half hidden by red-gold begonias
 drooping bugle-shaped clusters across the
 latticed squares rows of flame-red poinset-
 tias their star-shaped blossoms stiffly erect
 long low walls where cloth-of-gold roses
 clung and drooped two columns of stately
 royal palms with silvery green trunks
 marching down to the sea

   two years ago this garden had been a
 tract of scrub palmetto hyacinth and bunch
 grass the land had been cleared and
 filled royal palms had been shipped to
 majolica from the royal palm hammock
 south of the everglades vines and shrubs
 and plants in full flower had been trans-
 planted well money was a magic wand
 and aladdin was an amateur

   javalie kneeled down with his elbows on
 the sill and gazed out over the garden to
 the vastness of purple water far at sea
 the lone light of a steamer twinkled like a
 star a freighter from south america per-
 haps or the west indies no-more than
 likely a whisky runner from the bahamas

he sprang up slipped off the robe and
loin cloth and strode into the bathroom

     this was a magnificent establishment
   walls floor and ceiling were composed of
   nicely mitered slabs of white marble there
   was a sunken tub along one wall long
   enough and deep enough almost for a
   swim there were mirrors and sprays
   silver-plated knobs and fittings-a bath-
   room grand enough for a prince

      with his hands on his lean brown hips
   the adventurer took this grandeur in with
   a smile that was almost wistful he appre-
   ciated artistry and here was a masterpiece
   of the plumbers art perhaps if he played
   his hand with the proper finesse he might
   some day in a house of his own sport a
   bathroom as elegant as this

      he filled the tub extravagantly to the
   brim with cool water as blue as ice slipped
   in and floated it was salt water luxury
   with his body floating as if on air his mind
   was free to roam he closed his eyes re-
   flectively he thought most clearly when he
   lay floating in water

     theodore p banning    yes hook
   line and sinker that crafty business mon-
   arch was applying a rule with which he had
   made more than one of his millions in his
   busy wall street days-surrendering a
   technical problem to a specialist an expert
   he had jumped nimbly to the conclusion
   which javalie had carefully planned that
   he would jump to-firmly believed that
   javalie specialized in pouring oil on trou-
   bled waters the trace the more than a
   trace of mysticism in the bankers psychic
   make-up on which javalie had based his
   expectations had responded beautifully
   pigeonholes for the others

   miss banning    sharp sophisticated
 hard mischievous would probably make
 a determined attempt to undermine with
 flirtation the most natural outlet for her
 peculiar type of egotism possibly neu-
 rotic

   the son    ponderously ill-humored
 seething under constraint a possible quar-
 rel here positively neurotic

i

  confessions javalie hoped would be

forthcoming in abundance his data was
by no means complete

  the fellow with the thinning hair   
trouble there had been a clash when
their eyes met a schemer dangerous

  javalie rubbed himself down with a lux-
urious towel inspected a blue pint bottle
in an embedded medicine cabinet  alco-
hol for external use only if taken inter-
nally will cause serious gastric disturb-
ances he replaced it with a grimace
then he resumed his loin cloth sandals and
sackcloth and slipped out into the hall

  the distant tinkling melody of a fountain
again attracted him it should be situated
according to the architects final plans in
the center of the house the moon room
which was a glassed-over modification of the
patio of the moorish hacienda after which
the house had been patterned every fiber
of javalies appreciative artistic being hun-
gered for the moon room

  at the second door from his own how-
ever he paused a moment like his own
it was a solid-looking door of some dark
wood probably walnut with a heavy bur-
nished bronze knob

  he saw in a perfectly clear and detailed
mental picture the closets the battery of
windows the door at the upper left which
gave upon a windowless alcove whose princi-
pal feature was a vault door of gray steel as
tall as a tall man as thick as the upper
armor of a battleship as impenetrable as
the mind of a german diplomat a job for
a small army of cracksmen equipped with a
small factory of apparatus could he un-
aided cause that massive hinge to swing
his artistic brown fingers twitched with
pulses slightly accelerated he passed on
and turned to the left into another high-
ceilinged hall he slipped through the
gloom on a deep carpet with the grace and
stealth of a prowling cat

  a passionlessly cool blue glow sank into
the hall from space beyond the hall
ended upon a wide balcony and here java-
lie stopped with hands knotted behind him
the architects description of the moon
room had formed the nucleus of javalies
desire to visit the bannings in reality it
was bewitching

  fairyland at night the tropics in the
moonlight those must have been the im-
pressions the artist who had designed the
moon room had striven to convey huge
globes of some dark metal punctured with
thousands of tiny ragged holes hung down
from the lofty arch of the glass roof they
twisted and turned in vagrant currents of
air as if swimming in ether brilliant
tungstens in the centers sparkled through
the punctures like myriads of stars in a
blazing midnight sky

  other lights concealed stained the air
of the moon room blue-the blueness of
a grenada night the sensuous flavor of
imported tropical flowers-the tuba rose
narcissus maid o the night and chain of
love-rose in cloying volume from beds of
gleaming dark leaves in the center of a
blue-tiled floor a fountain played catching
glints from the counterfeit starlight and
shining like sprays of diamonds tinkling as
they fell

  moonlight in a tropical garden a dream
of grenada the artist in javalie respond-
ed with a thrill of irrepressible ecstasy
it was a complete thing a masterpiece
to think that the mere expenditure of
money could paint a picture so beautiful

  teeth gleamed whitely in the darkness
to the left of him two tiers of them a
french organ

  javalie had lightly but with his accus-
tomed dignity informed the miami insur-
ance man on the palm beach limited that
he played the organ he did he had
with especial permission played the great
organ in st peters in rome he had tried
the organ in the egg-shaped mormon taber-
nacle in salt lake city with its choral
stops purer and sweeter than the voice of a
boy soprano

  he slipped into the curved seat exam-
ined the stops and searched in likely places
for an electric switch controlling the bel-
lows motor he found it and ran his fin-
gers tentatively over the upper register

  bachs  passacaglia  was one of java-
lies favorites there is toward the climax

in the bass two forming a major third in
the middle and one high in the treble

the old home

        the old home i was born in

	the homestead mid the trees

 comes stealing back across the years
 like murmurs on the breeze

         and yet there are no raptures

         such as the poets sing

         in all the host of memories
         the olden dreamings bring

                        in winter or in summer
                          on the homestead that i knew

         though clear the day or rainy

 there were endless tasks to do

        and though we labored hugely
        from dawn to setting sun

         it seemed to me a dreaming lad

        my work was never done

         the chores i did were legion

        i threw hay from the mows

                          i curried countless horses

         i milked a drove of cows

        and when the day was over

        to keep my thoughts from sin

         i filled the pails with water
         and lugged the stove-wood in

                        my tasks done in the winter
                     i climbed the drafty stairs
                     into an arctic bedroom
                     to shiver through my prayers

                     but during all the summer
                     this room of mine would be
                     as hot as-well the regions
                     which good souls never see

                     let others hymn the glories
                        of the old home mid the trees

                   now i have a shower-bath
                      to use when i darn please

                     now i have a comfy flat

                       and from my easy-chair
                    i laugh at the old homestead
                    and rejoice that im not there

the fates victim

first i want to affirm positively that
the greeks made a huge error when
they paraded zeus as the lord of the
wide heavens they should have placed the
real rulers there-clotho lachesis and
atropos-for the inscrutable fates rule both
the heavens and the earth

  if you doubt that romance and adventure
still exist in real life-go live among the is-
lands of the south seas for a while

   if the capricious fates had not dabbled
how could bob carter walking the streets
of his home city have had his destinies tied
up with a little island in the coral sea
and why did moy song who lived in dis-
tant macao take a photograph from a dead
mans hands

   perhaps youd better read my story it
 has often been said that truth is stranger
 than fiction it is when truth ventures
 into the realms of melodrama it beggars de-
 scription this is one case in point

   when bob carter returned from france
 he wore a captains uniform he also wore
 a medal bestowed in the name of france
 because in his quiet way he was something
 of a fire eater

   you would probably have suspected
 something of this because of his appearance
 tall broad of shoulder deep of chest nar-
 row-hipped he walked with the natural
 grace of an arab easy-going worldly wise
 blessed with a serene insouciance he was
 much addicted to taking most things pas-
 sively you would have called him lazy-
 but with the italian laziness as of a leopard

 tv ho sleeps in the sun there was promise
 of leonine strength in his suppleness and the
 raphaelesque head was set strongly upon
 his shoulders

   beneath this suave exterior however
 there was a vague restless impulse a lurking
 instinct that answered to the call of war
 that thrilled toward fiery perils and the ner-
 vous excitement of stirring events

   a recent graduate of a famous university
 he had been helping his father in the latters
 modest brokerage office the first day war
 was declared he joined the army his father
 had wrung his hand in silent approbation
 and had hobbled down to camp to see him
 march away

   he returned to his native shores to find
 that his father had been dead for six
 months that instead of a modest inheri-
 tance there was nothing but a few debts
 as his mother had died during his child-
 hood he was quite alone except for a maid-
 en aunt somewhere in the west whom he
 hadnt seen for years

   when he was mustered out he set out for
 the first time in his life to find a position
 but a college graduate with no vocation
 didnt seem to fit in anywhere did he
 know  credits  could he keep a double
 entry set of books or take dictation and run
 a typewriter no did he know filing or
 exports or advertising no well they were
 sorry they needed some one with specific
 experience if hed leave his name and ad-
 dress and anything turned up theyd let
 him know

   closely hoarded his pay lasted for several
 months then came a day when he realized
 that his condition was becoming hazardous
 he moved to the cheapest boarding house
 he could find on a wtest side uptown
 street he practiced every economy possible
 he sold surplus clothes and possessions to
 furnish himself with additional capital to
 withstand his involuntary siege of idleness
 and he sought avidly for some sort of work

   but the fates had decreed otherwise he
 did not find any and at length there came
 a day when he walked the streets going to
 his room with his last few pennies in his
 pocket bitter morose desperate shabby
 wondering if it paid to continue his appar-
 ently impotent assaults to obtain a position

every one seemingly had already forgotten
that there had been a war or that any debt
of gratitude was owed to the defenders of
the nation america had gone back to busi-
ness it couldnt be bothered with un-
trained ex-soldiers

   meditating gloomily he turned into the
avenue to go home suddenly he was
thrown to the pavement by the furious con-
certed rush of several men who had turned
the corner at a run

   a volley of vivid oaths greeted him the
men sprang into a waiting automobile there
was a loud staccato thunder from the ex-
haust and the car darted ahead turned a
corner and was gone from sight it all
happened in less time than it takes to tell it
here

   following swiftly came a crowd of shout-
ing people who ebbed and flowed about
bob gesticulating excited and-miracu-
lously enough-a policeman

   theres one of em shouted several
boys in the crowd pointing to bob who
eyed them all in startled bewilderment

   gradually he gathered from the excited
comment that a robbery had been at-
tempted and had failed that some one had
been shot it slowly came to him that he
was being pointed out as one of the thieves

   the bluecoat laid a heavy hand on his
shoulder while he swiftly searched bobs
pockets to see if he was armed no sus-
picious or menacing protrusion was evident
the officer tightened his grip

  come along with me he growled
clear the way-this to the jabbering
encircling crowd-get out of the way
ive got to get to that box to ring up the
wagon

   the crowd was excited it had nearly
witnessed a robbery-and perhaps a mur-
der-and it wanted a victim bob shabby
in his seedy suit and cap stared while a
natural resentment began to ferment within
him

    ill go with you he said to the police-
man  theres no need topull me around
this way take your hands off ill not
run away youve made amistake-

    thatsone of em  shouted a boy  i
saw him he fell while he was running
and the others left him
out of the coral sea



   mistake nothin answered the officer
tightening his grip  you can tell it to the
judge and dont make any funny breaks
if you know whats good for you

  bobs heart began to pound with a fierce
sense of outrage he noted the growing
crowd the pointing fingers-the lust of the
mob for a victim he saw that his appear-
ance was against him and he foresaw that
his desperate financial straits would come
to light and forge a plausible link that might
connect him with anything desperate

   i tell you to take your hands off he
said again his voice low and fierce while a
great shame burned upon his cheeks

 youve made an error officer ill go with
you and explain whatever may be necessary

i was just turning the comer when those
fellows bumped into me and threw me over
ill go with you but dont hold me like
that-

  the policeman looked him over shrewdly
the crowd-a menacing one-had grown
swiftly and was pressing close there was
no chance of breaking away and something
in bobs voice halted him he removed
his hand saying

   stand right where you are young fel-
ler if you try any breaks-

   im giving you my word ill stay said
bob  ive nothing to run for

  the officer opened the patrol box and
called up the station while bobs eyes
blazed upon the chattering menacing crowd
this was the same crowd that had cheered
so lustily when he had embarked for the
front the same crowd that had cheered
upon his return the usual temperamental
mob that is always so willing to love you
passionately one day or to stone you to
death the next

    it was growing dark now and myriad
  electric lights along the street began to
  twinkle an eddy in the shifting crowd
  that surrounded him caught his eye an-
  other patrolman was pushing his way
  through the densely packed humanity to his
  side

      hold on to him joe he called to the
   officer who stood near bob  looks like
   old man bedsow was seriously wounded 

     a fresh tremor of excitement ran through
   the mob the second policeman stood close

to bob and clutched his sleeve a barely
perceivable signal was exchanged by the
two officers bob started at the second
mans touch his liberty was gone he
restrained himself with difficulty from any
show of resistance until with a simultane-
ous movement both policemen laid hands
on him and he felt the cold chill of steel
handcuffs touching his wrists

  the first officer had broken faits with
him trusted he would have made no
move and accompanied him as he had prom-
ised deceived the chains of his promise
were broken and now as the cold steel
sought his wrists all he was conscious of
was a furious revolt all the wild blood in
him his inherent honor the pride of his
breeding all the life and soul that were in
him flashed into fiery action

  he wrenched his wrists free before the
locks could close and with a single rapid
blow he felled the first officer the second
never knew what hit him but it was bobs
left fist then like a tiger breaking his
way through a circle of beaters he hurled
through the shrieking crowd striking right
and left and ran down the avenue the
crowd took up the chase immediately now
thoroughly inflamed and in earnest

  for one instant the thought occurred to
him that he was running away flight

a loathing sense filled him the criminals
resource-the cravens refuge

  a shot rang out the policemen had re-
covered their feet he wished in that mo-
ment of agony that the bullet might reach
him and kill rather than be driven to this

  with the speed that had carried him to
  more than one victory in his university days
  he fled rapidly up a side street the hue
  and cry was after him the crowds excite-
  ment was raised it knew not why or where-
  fore and it was joined with the keener pur- 
  suit of men organized for the work of man-
  hunting

    it was dark now his chances of escape
  was increased he felt a hunted thing-
  a coward-a felon yet he increased his
  speed for all the wilder blood in him awoke
  spurring his strength and heating his veins
  they might kill him but he swore to die
  free

    westward toward the river he ran dou-

bling like a hunted fox now walking rapid-
ly through a lighted area then turning into
a dark street and spurting again always
he heard yells in his wake but these were
growing fainter he was dropping them
behind

  he approached the river and stopped for
the first time his blood was beating in
every vein and his brain was numbed his
heart pumped furiously and his lips drew
breath with gasping spasms in his ears was
a rushing roar

  glancing behind he saw the two officers
emerge from the shadows of a quiet street
without a moments hesitation he went
over the wall and into the river

  there was a yell behind him the shock
of cold water drove the breath out of him
and he came to the surface

  there he is cried a voice from the
dock of a ferry a moments pause then a
flash and a report a line of light flared
a second and a bullet hissed past him and
splashed into the river

  he dived and swam upcurrent under
water

   hes hit cried those on shore  get
a boat-he went under

  steadily fighting his way upstream and
allowing only his nose to come to the sur-
face for air occasionally he reached mid-
stream

  he saw a rowboat investigating die waters
about the shore and guessed that they be-
lieved him hit and drowned the night was
dark fortunately for him and he floated for
a minute resting his tortured limbs and
lungs then he swam cautiously to the
other shore

  here all was dark a storm seemed to
be brewing for the heavens grew murky
with cloud rack dropping quietly down
the river he came to a rowboat tied to a
small wharf into this he climbed and lay
upon the bottom prostrated his blood beat-
ing in his brain his breath painful his limbs
quivering after the intense muscular effort

  his eyelids heavy as lead closed uncon-
sciously and he lost all sense and memory
how long he lay there he never knew but
when consciousness returned he saw a gem-
spangled sky above a rising wind was
rocking the boat gently

  to stay was impossible the shore was
dangerous cautiously he unfastened the
boat took up the oars and slipped like a
ghost down the dark quiet river he gath-
ered the impression that it must be after
midnight for few crafts plowed the usually
busy stream

  he rowed steadily- they gray dawn
found him out at sea then he lost an
oar unable to recover it he used the
other as a paddle and began to go in a
southerly direction thinking to go ashore
somewhere on that coast

  at eight oclock or thereabout a small
steamer bore down on him and he managed
to attract its attention taken on board
he simply explained that he had been night
fishing and had lost his way in the dark

  the captain informed him that the vessel
was on its way to havre with a load of
cattle and couldnt turn back

  france he had spent nearly two years
there and had a fair smattering of the lan-
guage france had bestowed a medal upon
him in appreciation of his services he had
some friends there why not-since his
own country had treated him so shabbily

  so he arranged to work his passage over
while the captain puzzled for several mo-
ments over the various species of blankety-
blank fools to be found in the so-called
human race

a mission for mov song

in a far comer of the south pacific you
will find norfolk island it is cast away
all by itself in a world of water several
hundred miles from the queensland coast

  everybody must know the story of the
mutiny of h m s bounty it is a most
enthralling and romantic narrative of fact
of the tyranny and hazing that led to the
desperate seizure of a kings ship how the
mutineers returned to tahiti took wives
from among the natives sailed to little pit-
cairn island and burned the bounty found-
ed a colony and a race of people as unique
as any in the world quarreled fought and
killed one another and finally throve and
multiplied until pitcairn was too small to
out of the corai sea



hold them then they were brought back
to norfolk island in -sixty-five years
after the mutiny

   the descendants of the mutineers are liv-
ing upon norfolk island to-day-a strange
people who speak a quaint language com-
pounded of english tahitian and sailor
slang their gentle caressing voices in-
tensely musical remind you of their tahi-
tian extraction and the beauty of some of
their women tells of the english blood that
flows in their veins here in some in-
stances the races have fused and blended to
produce the best in each-unbelievable ex-
otics whose beauty is breathtaking and
clamorous

  these were zelma forsythes people
her history was brief

   her mother a strikingly beautiful girl
had been seen by tom forsythe first mate
of the trading schooner shark it was love
at first sight for both tom forsythe had
left his ship and married her and had spent
a full blissful year upon the island with
his young wife then zelma was born-
and her mother died in his vivid despair
insane with grief his unreasoning agony
tom forsythe had cursed the daughter who
had cost him his wife he left the island
never to return

  the english mission had taken in the
child and raised it while tom went up and
down the islands drinking himself into an
early grave deteriorating rapidly becom-
ing lazy and lax-minded he forgot that a
world existed outside his grief became a
tradition and he hated the daughter whose
existence had been bought at such a tre-
mendous price

   he sent money regularly for the childs
support but he would not go near her
she wrote him letters which he never an-
swered he instructed the mission people
never to send him any of her photographs

  some twenty years later he sat in the
gambling house of moy song in macao-
a portuguese-controlled settlement on the
chinese coast just below hongkong-and
gazed with startled drunken gravity upon
a photograph of his daughter which she had
sent him on her nineteenth birthday it
was the first likeness of her he had ever
beheld

  she was very like her mother-lovelier
if anything a full-blown english rose with
an exotic touch from the tahitian blood
that made her bewildering a lofty poetic
soul-lit loveliness and a patrician grace that
told of the early norman blood that came to
her through her father

   a corrosive remorse ate into his heart as
he looked and tears rolled unrestrained
down his wasted furrowed cheeks he
drank deeply that night and his outraged
constitution gave way at last

  they found him the next morning safe
in port at last a smile on his sunburned
face his hand clutching the photograph and
a letter that had come with it

  moy song a quiet elegant chinaman
owner of the gambling establishment and
several vessels-one of which tom forsythe
had commanded for years-took the photo-
graph and letter and went to his private
room with both

   here he read the letter-a wistful lonely
epistle then his eyes were lured again by
the photograph and he sat in a fascinated
silence for some time

  finally his shrewd eyes began to stray
about the luxuriously furnished room and
he hummed an endless plaintive melody his
fingers beating an intermittent tattoo upon
the table

   suave successful learned in all the wiles
of the polyglot races that mixed under his
roof he was a power in macao because of
his wealth-though there were rumors of
his participation in opium-smuggling and
raids upon certain islands for anything from
pearls to women ostensibly he dealt in
copra and beche de mer he had a white
wife as far as macao knew they lived
happily together and he was a good hus-
band giving her everything that money
could buy

  he ordered that tom forsythe be given
decent burial then he sent for one of his
captains a burly italian who had done his
bidding upon more than one occasion to
their mutual financial advantage over a
bottle of wine in his own rooms moy song
talked long and seriously to the hulking
italian

    take a crew of kanakas he instruct-
ed  and go to norfolk island youll take


argosy-allstory weekly

this letter along and this photograph and
youll tell the girl that her father is on the
point of death and wishes her to come at
once

  the italian nodded understanding a
twisted smile upon his full lips

   simply say that he sent you to bring
her show the photograph and letter as evi-
dence-and heres a ring of his too-and
bring her to me see that it so happens
that you put in here late at night

  again the italian nodded his eyes nar-
rowing slightly in a somber way he was
a handsome man with blood in his veins
that had once run full and strong in the
lustful lords of sardis his father had been
a wild mountain hunter in the etruscan
hills the son was the true robber chieftain
and adventurer of romance

   and-whats this worth to me he
asked  this is a great risk shes no
island woman you know

  moy song glanced around the room as
if to assure himself that he was alone with
the captain he took a pencil from his
pocket wrote a sum upon a piece of paper
and showed it to his companion the ital-
ians eyes glittered it was more than he
had expected still-the girl was beautiful
and worth it

   and shes not to be roughly treated
went on moy song in his caressing low
voice  shes not to be harmed-in any
way do you understand his voice and
eyes were significant

  the italian nodded brusquely

   the money is more to me he answered
shortly  than any woman you know
that

  moy song smiled faintly he knew it
well that was one reason he had selected
montozzi

   and he went on quietly  when she
gets here and has no complaint to make
ill double that sum to you

  montozzi stared moy song was paying
high he looked at his fastidious employer
in frank curiosity

   shes yours song be said rising
 ill drift out to-night

   he put the ring the letter and the pho-
tograph in his pocket shook hands with his
elegant employer and departed

  then moy song made his way to the
other side of the house where his white
wife had her apartment knocking he en-
tered immediately after and looked with
slant-eyed disapproval upon a worn once
pretty girl who sat reading a magazine and
smoking a cigarette she was dressed in
an exquisite silk jacket and trousers chi-
nese fashion and her hair was combed a la
mme butterfly with a huge jeweled comb
at the back

  she looked up smiled in a tired fashion
and went on reading and smoking

  moys eyes contracted slightly he
walked to her side and took the cigarette
from her lips

   the illustrious white lily he mur-
mured throwing the cigarette on the floor
 should not smoke in my humble home
it befits not the wife of moy song-
oh stop that illustrious stuff she
cried springing to her feet  im tired of
it ill smoke if i want to-i have to do
something to keep from going crazy

   all right he answered calmly in a
different voice  ill stop the  illustrious 
stuff but let me tell you that i want your
dance-hall habits stopped while you are
here im becoming tired of some of your
habits dont forget that if i hadnt been
fool enough to marry you youd have
wound up like- he paused and pointed
downward as a burst of some kanaka girls
liquor-tuned laughter rose to them from the
dance hall below

  the girl sniffed

   id never come to that she answered
defiantly  i went around a lot but i was
a good girl-you know that 

  he did not answer he paused at the
door and said sarcastically

   the humble husband of the most illus-
trious white lily wishes her a most restful
night and he closed the door

  the girl shrugged disdainfully then
she began to play with a pet snake which
she took from a box-a tiny green harm-
less thing that turned and twisted around
her fingers as she crooned and whispered
to it

   i prefer you she whispered to the
reptile  to him 

  then she defiantly lit another cigarette
out of the coral sea



  moy song walked slowly to his own
room his eyes inscrutable

   we shall see he murmured to him-
self we shall see

  at daybreak the water queen with cap-
tain montozzi at the wheel stole out of
macao harbor and pointed her nose south-
ward she carried a full kanaka crew and
a portuguese mate

 chapter iii

 shipped to noumea

bob carter counted himself safe and
began to plan life anew upon his ar-
rival in france he underestimated
however the cleverness of police brains
because the ship he had taken involuntary
passage upon was not equipped with wire-
less he forgot about it

  this is what happened the rowboat he
had borrowed was reported missing to the
police and they put two and two together
with a sure logic his landlady after two
days absence became choleric because he
owed her money and reported his disap-
pearance to the police she wanted him
arrested or she wanted her bill paid

  the police again investigated searched
his room and effects found some letters and
papers and a photograph the photograph
was promptly identified by two policemen
and several members of the crowd that had
witnessed bobs capture and escape

    swift inquiries were sent broadcast then
   a police tug picked up a lost oar in the bay
   it was identified by the owner of the boat
   shrewd brains began to study the list of
   vessels that had sailed that same night and
   early morning

    the chase was finally narrowed down to
  two commercial freighters-both bound for
  french ports

    as the freighters took nearly three weeks
   to cross a copy of bobs photograph was
   sent immediately by a fast mail and pas-
   senger steamer to the detective headquar-
   ters of paris the destinations of the two
   freighters were given would the french
   police hold the prisoner-providing he was
   on board either freighter-until a man
   could be sent to bring him back

  the wireless was brought into instant
use and the story and request duplicated
advising the french police of the explana-
tory mail following upon the aquitania

  the wireless crackled back a reply short-
ly that the french police would be watch-
ing

  in the meanwhile the jeweler whose store
the thieves had attempted to rob lay at the
point of death delirious or unconscious
as he was a rich man and an influential
citizen the police bent every energy and
resource to capture the man they believed
would finally be tried upon a murder
charge as for the actual thieves they had
vanished as completely as if they had
dropped off the earth

  so it was that when the freighter put
into flavre three weeks later two quiet
ferret-eyed men came on board had a chat
with the captain and a few minutes later
deftly handcuffed bob as he stood looking
unsuspectingly over the rail

  entreaty or explanation had no effect
upon the frenchmen it was a bitter and
a somewhat dangerous bob who was lodged
in a cell to await extradition

  and as the days went by he grew reck-
less and daring the injustice of his in-
carceration made him as savage as a sorely
wounded animal he brooded grew mo-
rose bitter plans for daring escapes
flashed in his mind continually though he
knew them all futile

  he was treated decently enough but he
snarled like a trapped thing when spoken
to at other times a weary blighting res-
ignation rested upon him with the weight
of lead

  as the weeks dragged by he grew ner-
vous and curious why wasnt he taken
back and tried did they expect to let
him rot and die in this french prison

he became insubordinate and stubborn
his self control was at an end one day
prodded sharply by a burly ignorant guard
he whirled and attacked him with all the
seething accumulated fury that was in him

   the guard was taken by surprise bob
  lifted him bodily and flung him down he
  was badly hurt the physical action some-
  how seemed to make bob feel better his
  attack earned him a solitary cell he de-


argosy-allstory weekly

  manded to know why he was not returned
  to his own country he was informed that
  he would be as soon as some one came for
  him

   but no one came there were hot mo-
 ments of rebellion when bobs eyes would
 flash he chafed sorely and his breath
 came uneven and fast with the proud bold
 instincts of birth and freedom but there
 was no relief

   meanwhile on the other side of the
 ocean there was an annual political shake-
 up of the police department-rival factions
 sparring for power-and bob was forgotten
 along with other matters of like importance
 no one was sent after him other fresher
 matters claimed public attention the
 world is a busy place

   and bob made insanely savage by his
 solitary confinement rebelled again and
 was dubbed an  incorrigible  by the prison
 head to whom he was a thorn in the side

    i dont want him here he explained
 to his superior  he is like a tiger-he
 will kill some day

    but what shall we do with him

    do anything to get him out hes
 a bad example and perfectly fearless some
 of my other incorrigibles are going to nou-
 mea soon ill send him along if the
 americans want him they can get him
 there i dont want to be bothered with
 him he almost killed one of my guards
 the superior officer had a dinner engage-
 ment and was in a hurry so he shifted the
 burden

    well he said  do as you think best
   the americans are playing politics again
   anyway and theyll forget all about him
   i suppose he could be here for years before
   theyd send for him - if they ever did
   cant you spare a man to take him back
   to the united states

    i have no man nor funds for it ex-
   plained the warden  it would be weeks
   and maybe months before i could arrange
   it and in the meanwhile hed kill some
   one no ill ship him to noumea and
   get him off my hands this prison wont
   hold him anyway hell get out of here
   sooner or later and be a menace to the com-
   munity hell be safe in noumea anyway
   will it be all right

   oh i suppose so send a letter and
 tell them the circumstances then they
 can do as they wish

  the letter was sent possibly it arrived
 thus by special arrangement with the
 inscrutable fates bob in common with
 other  incorrigibles  from various prisons
 in france was sent to noumea in new
 caledonia yes the fates were weaving

chapter iv

            a desperate try

 it was weeks later when his eyes first be-
 held new caledonia its solitude was
 uncanny flung down as it is in the im-
 mensity of the south pacific long lines of
 breakers marked the coral reefs a tall
 lighthouse stood apparently in the sea be-
 hind the lines of surf  cold blue mountain
 ranges pierced the sky in the interior it
 was a wild forbidding country that struck
 a chill to his heart surrounded by hun-
 dreds of miles of open shark-infested
 waters there seemed to be no possibility of
 escape

    the convict ship did not go to the town
 but stopped opposite isle nou with its
 grim prisons and barracks an orderly in-
 ferno where are confined the most desperate
 and abandoned of the obstreperous exiles
 who form the main portion of the popula-
 tion of new caledonia

    in the distance bob saw the little leaf-
 bowered town a mosaic of gleaming roofs
 on the edge of a tropical jungle

    the new arrivals watched the gangs of
  orderly prisoners under guard at work
  and a hopeless despair settled upon their
  features this was the end all who en-
  tered new caledonia left hope behind

    then began for bob a nightmare exis-
  tence that sapped his body and his brain
  one fiercely torrid day succeeded another
  with unfailing regularity all day the
  gaunt unhappy prisoners toiled upon the
  mainland and at night packed to over-
  flowing upon huge barges they were towed
  back to their cells on the island

    day after day they toiled and slaved in
  the blinding heat always under the surveil-
  lance of prison wardens who lolled under
out of the coral sea

enormous white cotton umbrellas and at
whose ample girths were strapped huge re-
volvers

  there came periods of passionate rebel-
lion to bob of insurgent heartsickness
he longed with an agonized desire to
stand once more stainless among his equals
to taste once more the nectar of liberty of
unchallenged unfettered life liberty lured
him with an insidious temptation under
the lash of prison rules and the noxious
bitterness that came at the thought of the
injustice being heaped upon him a venom
grew and poured into his heart and veins
sooner or later it would burst forth

  he wondered dully how long it would be
before he went mad and made a dash for
freedom he saw what this action wouid
result in one day when a prisoner driven
desperate by toil and heat ran for some
adjacent brush the guard shifted the um-
brella and without rising shot down the
unfortunate man unerringly then he lit
a fresh cigarette - upon which scores of
longing eyes were fixed-and glared at the
other prisoners

    let that be a lesson he said as the
wounded man was carried away

  bobs cell mate a young frenchman of
perhaps twenty-seven was unduly excited
and paced the small cell incessantly

   murderers  he whispered tensely

 to shoot a man so-like a rabbit-be-
cause he loves life and liberty

  bob did not answer he sat in a physi-
cal stupor after the days work in the white
sun and glanced helplessly about the bare
cell there was no way of escape what
hope he had possessed was slowly vanish-
ing the massive bars and walls held him
impotent

    he watched chataine his cell mate as
  that volatile young man paced the floor
  back and forth with seemingly boundless
  energy because he played in the band
  he was allowed to keep his hair and he also
  wore a boys growth of vandyke beard
  he would have been handsome had he not
  been so gaunt

     at first he had snarled at bob and re-
  sented his entrance into the cell but as
  the weeks went by he thawed out and be-
  came companionable though bob found

himself being examined at odd moments
with curious veiled glances that puzzled
him

they had one evening in a burst of mu-
tual confidence exchanged histories and
chataine had been highly indignant at the
manner in which bob had been mistreated

his own story he stated briefly and the
look on his face convinced bob that he
spoke the truth

 it was my sisters husband chataine
explained  she married a pig-a camel
who was slowly killing her i could do
nothing for it was her husband then he
took to beating her-and she fled to me for
protection that fired my blood-my lit-
tle sister he tried to strike her and when

i	stopped him he became a demon-mad
he pulled out a revolver and in the strug-
gle for possession he was shot

 they said  killed him and because i
rebelled so furiously i was sent here dicu
de dieu i ask you-is this justice
chataine quivered with rage as he told
the story when he became calmer he
again eyed bob in his curious questioning
inscrutable fashion

the work was beginning to wear down
even bobs splendid constitution to-night
weary aching in every fiber he watched
the nervous chataine in his endless pacing

    some day he said  ill do the same
thing chataine better death than-this
chataine halted abruptly and sat down
at bobs side upon the iron cot

    no my friend he whispered  dont
do that you cant escape that way even
if you got away into the interior the na-
tives would finish you-oh theyre bad cus-
tomers these  man-belong-bush  here
bear it-perhaps-

   perhaps what asked bob wearily
 do you think i can bend those bars drop
a hundred feet into a shark-infested lagoon
and swim to australia

  chataine rose paced up and down a few
times and then paused again

 one can never tell he answered in a
low voice  do nothing rash perhaps-
bob looked into his cell mates face at
the suggestive tone a faint hope began to
stir

   you know of some-


argosy-allstory weekly

   hush  hissed chataine  i know
nothing but-i am desperate listen-
if the opportunity should come - well-
well go-together

  bob thrust his hand out for answer and
their fingers locked in a tight clasp cha-
taine was strangely excited

   who knows he whispered  one
can never tell something may turn up so
we can escape this living death i feel i
can trust you bob

   you can replied bob quietly

  a little later chataine left for it was
band night and he had to play twice a
week the band played for the edification
of the civilian inhabitants of the town

  the sweet strains of music could be
heard in the grim silent penitentiary soft-
ened by distance as it came wafted across
the star-studded lagoon and mingling with
the murmur of the southern ocean

  what a mockery it was for those prison-
ers to play and see the groups of statuary
symbolical of liberty and labeled as such
that occupied conspicuous places in coco-
nut square

  more than one pair of longing helpless
eyes sought the circle of brilliant flame trees
and tried to peer beyond to the wilderness
where liberty might be found then their
envious eyes would rest upon the civilian
crowds sitting at the little tables outside
the surrounding cafes the police and sol-
diers and the guards who sat upon the band
stand with carbines across their knees

  it was strange they could play at all-
these incorrigibles who took no pleasure in
their music all gaunt men with pallid
starved-looking faces that were stolid sor-
rowful savage cunning or desperate-but
always unhappy

  chataine played a comet solo that night
and played amazingly well he seemed to
be in an excitable electric mood he was
congratulated again and again he did not
tell them that he had been a musician of
note in paris before his unfortunate affair

  the next day an admirer sent chataine
a great bunch of flowers and a cheap small
alarm clock the warden finally allowed
chataine to keep it in his cell but not be-
fore he had looked inside to see that it con-
tained nothing but what an alarm clock

should and had taken off the glass face
he wasnt going to give any prisoner glass
to be used as a means of self destruction
not he

  a clock is a much-wanted article by most
prisoners why i cannot say let the
learned psychologists answer the passing
hours should certainly have no interest for
men who are serving for terms of years and
some for life

  at any rate chataine was overjoyed
and the whole prison envied him some
of them within hearing of his cell called
out at night to know what time it was
chataine petted and fondled the cheap lit-
tle timepiece as if it were worth its weight
in diamonds

  bob was amused and touched too it
took very little to make chataine happy
the cheery ticking of the clock helped him
too he confessed

  on one occasion he went to wind it and
chataine sprang upon him like a tiger

  no he snarled dont dare touch
it no hands can touch it but mine-un-
derstand

  bob was astonished for weeks cha-
taine had been in almost a sunny mood
now he became a fury for no apparent rea-
son

  bob shrugged

    as you wish he said seating himself
 i meant no harm

  no-my friend continued the mer-
curial chataine contritely  i meant no
offense-but it is precious to me-a gift-
i want no one to touch it-do you see

  then he left to play for it was band
night again

  that night as bob slept he felt a cold
hand upon his shoulder opening his eyes
he saw chataine sitting at his side caution-
ing him to silence he sat up puzzled

   no noise-no sound  whispered cha-
taine he was fairly quivering with sup-
pressed excitement  the time is here
he continued barely above his breath
 we go to-night

  bobs eyes opened wide now

   ill explain bob continued chataine
 you will learn more later im trusting
you if you fail me- there was deadly
menace in the frenchmans voice

                         	a
out of the coral sea



   why should i fail you asked bob
 i have as much at stake as you have
lead on paul-if theres a ghost of a
chance well go through-or-take what
comes once i start i swear ill never
come back

  good murmured chataine he lis-
tened intently no sound disturbed the
silent building

   there is a girl he continued presently
still in a cautious whisper  in the town-
an english girl a teacher in the schools
when i came here i first saw her from the
band shell later she talked to me we
fell in love-yes-she loves me-branded
as a criminal

  his voice broke slightly

   i tell you bob while there are such
women on earth theres little need of
heaven for a year now we have had our
little meetings occasionally on band nights
at length she planned that i should escape
-you may be sure i did not suggest it first
to her-not to the woman i love better than
life--or my hope of heaven

   i saw her to-night for several minutes
i have been here long enough to know that
one cannot escape without aid from the out-
side and the warden knows i know it he
doesnt dream any one would help-thats
why he sometimes sends me on errands

   she saw me leave on my errand to-
night and followed me i ran to the ca-
thedral in back of the town-walking
through the rue austrelitz across the rue
inkerman and sebastapol and no one
stopped me i waited for her in the shadow
of the statue of jeanne darc it took but
a moment everything is ready

   she has made all preparations she
goes with us at the first opportunity we
will be married now you know

  bob stared

   but how are you going to get out he
asked

  chataine chuckled quietly

   well go through the window and into
the water-the lagoon has few sharks
well swim to a certain point-youll fol-
low me-where she will meet us almost
all the guards are in town to-night at the
garrison dance-i played sick and got away
from playing now-have you the heart
 a

for it it is desperate bob it may
mean-

  anything breathed bob  im with
you anything is better than this

   then to work 

  to bobs astonishment the frenchman
began taking his treasured alarm clock
apart swiftly silently it came apart in
his long fingers until the long mainspring
dangled in the narrow strip of moonlight
that flooded in through the heavily barred
window

  then bob saw that the reverse-inside-
of the spring was filed-it was in truth a
long steel saw of the finest keenest metal

   an idea of mine whispered chataine
gleefully  it couldnt be seen if the clock
was opened and it allowed the clock to run
now to work it is eleven oclock by
morning we must be far to be safe-make
every moment count 

  working as quietly as possible desisting
at every shadow of sound hearts beating
fiercely they worked the bars were heavy
iron but not hard the prison was of an-
cient construction and the metal was old-
fashioned forge bars the keen steel bit
into it yet it was slow arduous work
somewhere in town a clock told them that
it was twelve when the last metal was cut
through

  chataine picked up the clock its parts
and the saw and put them in his pocket

   i dont want them to know how it was
done he whispered then  ill go first-
follow me dive as quietly as you can
fll show you the way through the shallow
waters so that well take the least chances
with-sharks but should it happen youll
see a rowboat burning three small lamps-
red white and green go to it-dont stop
to help me-it will be too late-and ill do
the same	v

  their hands met in a tight clasp it was
life or death the frenchman suddenly
raised his face to the brilliant skies and his
eyes closed

  oh god he murmured help us

  bob turned away suddenly abashed he
heard chataine murmuring something about
 ada the light was blocked out as his
body filled the window and then it came
again below bob heard a faint sw-w-ish


argosy-allstory weekly

      without a moments hesitation he climbed
     to the window there he poised a second
     to measure the distance and then dived
     into the sea

 understand now
 rested for we have

            chapter v

           the uncharted isle

  it was a long dizzy drop-more than a
  hundred feet-and bob thought he
  would never reach the surface again
  lungs almost bursting with the prolonged
  submersion he came to the surface finally
  and breathed deeply recovering he kept
  his body below only allowing part of his
  head to show ahead he descried chataine
  swimming noiselessly and powerfully all
  about them die tropic night glowed with an
  elysian luster the prison was dark and
  quiet so far all was well he followed
  chataine

     once the thought of sharks came to him
 and he recalled chataines tragic injunction
 a thrill of horror raced through him prick-
 ling his flesh but he resolutely put it aside
 years seemed to be slipping from his shoul-
 ders the taste of freedom was sweet in his
 mouth the thrill of adventure the lure of
 the tropics all were calling to the warm
 stream in his veins freedom at last he
 thrilled in answer to the thought grimly
 he resolved to die rather than to go back to
 the prison

  some thirty minutes later they both
climbed into a small tender moored in the
shadow of a tiny cove and chataine clasped
the figure of a girl to his heart with many
murmured endearments

   bob sat in the back and turned his face
toward the sea a passion like this he had
never known that a woman would risk so
much for a man he had never believed he
glanced back over the water all was quiet
and calm under the white witchery of the
moon so far their escape had not been
discovered

   pauls voice broke in on him

    this is bob whom i told you of ada
 he was saying  and this bob is ada we
 owe her everything bob-life itself she
 planned it all for me-is giving up all that
 most women hold dear-

    hush  whispered the girl laying slim
white fingers upon pauls lips  i am
sure mr-bob will
quickly if you have
miles to go

   both men settled to the oars and di-
rected by the girl stole along the shore
to the north while they rowed the girl
enlightened bob she was a wholesome
good-looking girl one who breathed of the
fresh outdoors and athletics bob was
struck by one fact-there was an unusual
distance between her eyes

    i have a thirty-five-foot sloop she was
telling him  with mainsl and jib and spare
sails it has a cabin is sound and sea-
worthy and is fully stocked-for our trip
-even if it should take months and shes
fast

    i pretended a more than usual interest
in island cruising and bought her with my

 savings it has taken six months and infi-
 nite caution to get her ready i left a mes-
 sage that i have gone to pau to buy a
 pearl i frequently go there-its only
 forty-five miles i said id be back in a
 week i hope to gain that much start the
 rest is simple theyll think you both went
 inland most attempts to escape are made
 so perhaps well get a weeks start its
 all we need

   bob nodded he examined the calm girl
 again as he listened to her crisp words he
 even smiled slightly the distance be-
 tween her eyes meant something more than
 mere facial space paul was indeed a lucky
 man

   within an hour they were aboard the
 hawk bobs heart leaped high with hope
 when he saw the trim stanch sloop with
 its heavily built hull and cabin its racy
 lines in his boyhood he had sailed a cat-
 boat and a canoe equipped with a sail upon
 the hudson so he had a slight familiarity
 with the mode of procedure he fell to and
 helped the girl and chataine hoist the sails
 with hardly a sound the hawk pointed her
 nose into the phosphorescent sea ada stood
 at the wheel

  first trick at the wheel she laughed
excitedly in her full throaty voice  i
know this boat and ill get her out to sea

if they should ever think that i had a hand
out of the coral sea



in pauls freedom theyll imagine we went
due north to the solomons or east to
queensland i dont think theyll ever sus-
pect me though theyll think you went
inland anyway were headed into the
coral sea nor-norwest in three days the
whole french navy couldnt find us

  both men stood and watched her with an
admiration that could find no tongue she
stood silent for a minute then went on

 dont think me a desperate character
bob im not i did this first for paul

i know he is innocent and a great injustice
has been done him if i hadnt helped he
might have-died there before anything
could be done for him

   he told me your story and we both
were sure you were innocent too some-
times the gods conspire to mean things-
then-then-we must do what we think best
and right she paused again her voice
uncertain then with concern  go below
paul and change your clothes youre wet
through and youre not strong theres a
change for both of you as soon as paul
is through you can change i dont like
your-prison garb

   bob lingered at the task of changing into
dry civilian clothes above he heard the
murmur of the lovers voices he smiled
and resolved to give them an opportunity
to talk to their hearts content on this their
first uninterrupted meeting

  he examined the snug little cabin di-
vided into two separate parts the boxes
of provisions and canned fruits the water
casks axes the two serviceable martini-
henry rifles fishing tackle tins of tobacco
rope matches instruments and many other
articles

   he lit a pipe reveling in the long-lost
luxury and examined one of the rifles the
hawk began to feel the motion of the big
rollers and the sails became taut she raced
away the wind strong and steady the
girl had thought of everything bob
reflected there was even a cask of oil
for the lamps and cooking utensils a pistol
hung in a holster several clocks a small
demijohn of rum and-even a supply of
books

    lucky devil  bob told his soul think-
ing of paul  one girl in a million

  later he went on deck the lovers sat
close together at the wheel and they hailed
him as he turned away

   you and i will finish the night at the
wheel bob said paul  while ada gets
some sleep in her cabin

  the girl went below and the two men
stood silently at the wheel gazing out over
the sea

   well asked paul in a blithe voice

  bob turned to look at the man it was
an entirely different paul chataine than he
had ever observed before a remarkable
metamorphosis had taken place he saw
a handsome straight-standing young man
whose cheeks were flushed and whose eyes
shone with the life and animation and hope
that freedom inspired

   i think you are a very lucky man
paul said bob quietly putting a friendly
hand upon pauls arm

   i-know replied the other humbly
 its all like a dream i have already
forgotten-noumea i owe my life to her
think what she invites by helping us
think they could send her to prison
god help me to be worthy of her 

  his voice trembled with emotion for
some minutes they stood in a pregnant si-
lence then deliriously happy paul broke
out again

   well touch somewhere long enough to
be married then well go far enough away
that theyll never think of looking for us
its easy to lose ones self among the is-
lands but you my friend is there no
one you wish to go to-no one waiting
somewhere

   not a soul replied bob

   then you shall go with us enthusias-
tically decided paul

   and where are you going asked bob

  paul did not answer immediately wtien
he did his voice was grave  heaven only
knows i suppose every large port will be
watched-every civilized avenue of escape
closed im afraid weve but little choice-
since we have no money to pave the way
to justice ada and i have talked it over
more than once

   we thought wed simply drop out of
sight and live on one of the uninhabited
islands you know there are thousands
argosy-allstory weekly

 

 cts yef uncharted where a white foot has
 never stepped they are mostly fertile-
 fruit and game and fish-and we thought
 that after some years we could go to the
 united states and start all over again that
 is what we have in mind to do if you want
 to you can come with us

    i have no pressing engagements else-
 where answered bob after a moments
 thought  ill go with you

  good exclaimed chataine and
now for a voyage of discovers to find an
uncharted island our first stop is aola
where ada and i will be married theres
only a lone missionary there-no cables or
wires thank heaven then for the coral
sea

    you know he went on with the ex-
 cited air of a boy on a holiday  ive al-
 ways wanted to come to these islands-since
 ive been a boy i used to study their his-
 tory in utter fascination and i could name
 every one and give you its history-if it
 had any i never thought though that
 my first sight of them would be-noumea

   the night passed uneventfully they
 talked and planned and learned once more
 how to laugh the next day they touched
 for an hour at aola where an astonished
 white missionary hastily married paul and
 ada was hugged enthusiastically by both
 and watched them sail out of sight then
 he went back to his primitive abode on the
 edge of a wilderness of tropical jungle
 where he lived and wrestled valiantly with
 the native  man-belong-bush he was
 no fool this missionary he had a shrewd
 suspicion regarding the two men but when
 he thought of the girl he smiled  un-
 less im asked he told himself  ill say
 nothing

   for a week all went well the honey-
 mooners were deliriously happy and bob
 finding himself in the great wonderful open
 of the coral sea was as happy as he had
 ever been in his life no signs of a chase
 or any craft whatever had as yet been en-
 countered

   on the fourteenth day paul slipped and
 fell hurting his ankle severely when it
 was found that he could not walk it was
 decided that they would land upon the
 first island that seemed uninhabited

   on the fifteenth day they sighted a long
low island heavily wooded a hasty con-
sultation of their maps and a survey of their
position failed to reveal any sign of it being
recorded

   anchoring the hawk in a sheltered cove
they brought paul ashore in the tender for
his foot was now swollen badly and he could
not use it at all

   the thick patches of woodland ran close
to the dazzling white coral sands of the
beach in the treetops gayly colored par-
rots screeched and quarreled while a cloud
of pigeons whirled against the turquoise of
the sky bougainvillea red hibiscus and
countless other flowers drugged the drowsy
air with perfume which mingled with the
saline savor of the sea heat lay on the
land like sleep on the eyes of a tired
dreamer

   bob stretched languidly then explored
the near-by woodland he grinned genial-
ly at every primeval evidence they found
a species of natural cave where they took
up their habitation and they planned to
stay indefinitely the island seemed fruit-
ful and they had no doubt that small game
would abound as for fish they were sure
of that

   the rifles ammunition and various other
articles were brought ashore while they
made themselves at home disporting more
like children than fugitives it was decided
that they would explore when paul recov-
ered the use of his ankle only one black
bead was there in the golden rosary of their
prospect-natives no one voiced this pos-
sibility but paul had told bob that many
tribes were still utter savages wild and un-
tractable and some still practiced canni-
balism

  still there were no signs of human
beings anvwhere it might have been the
dawn of creation but for themselves when
a week slipped by and nothing disturbed
the perfect peace of their retreat they forgot
their fears

  then one evening they heard what
sounded like faint distant gunshots all
three came to their feet their meal forgot-
ten listening intently of course they
could not be sure the sounds were too faint
and far away they were sobered they
out of the coral sea



determined to keep the hawk in instant
readiness for flight and also to reconnoiter
cautiously the next day that night both
men lay with their rifles close by

chapter vi

a cift from other aces

bob slept very little that night a ner-
vous fear haunted him it would be
too ghastly to be taken back to nou-
mea now-after this taste of freedom
early the next morning it was decided that
he was to go alone to reconnoiter pauls
foot was still quite useless and he still hob-
bled with pain

  both paul and ada cautioned bob again
and again until he finally laughed  ill
be very careful he promised though their
affectionate concern brought a throb to his
throat  ill not show myself and ill not
go far dont worry please ill be back
by noon

  he set out and described a semicircle
around their camp the tropic forest
flamed with flowers and abounded with
small game but he found no signs of hu-
mans he wondered how long the island
was how wide what lay over the range of
low hills but he had no time to explore
farther as he had promised to be back by
noon and he knew how his friends would
worry if he should delay

  as he swung down toward the shore in-
tending to make his way back to camp over
the white sands he suddenly froze in his
tracks he had come full upon a sandy
stretch protected by long wooded arms that
ran far to sea on both sides and on the
beach was the hull of a ship-apparently an
ancient wreck

  the masts were gone but the lines of
her hull caused his eyes to widen it
looked like a fantasy of other centuries
 if i didnt know better he told himself
 id be firmly convinced that columbus
lost one of his caravels here

  greatly excited intrigued by this survi-
val of other centuries he made his way to
the hull which lay partly in the shallows
it was green with age plant life had found
a foothold in many a favorable spot yet

the stout hull itself had remained intact
throughout the years

  he made out some letters upon her bow
carved upon a stout name plank there
was also the remains of a coat of arms
but parts had split and rotted and the
balance was little more than a fungus com-
position

  he spelled the letters  -i-a-a eager to
penetrate the identity of the old ship but
they meant nothing to him  i wonder
he mused k what ill find inside her-some
of her people-i wonder- his mind was
whirling with possibilities gruesome expec-
tations

  he dropped his rifle and scaled the sides
once on deck he looked about it was
grass-grown yet the stout cedar planks
held gingerly with beating heart bob
walked to the cabins that slanted away aft
he tried a door it disintegrated into
pieces

  then he started back with an exclama-
tion of alarm for a witch-flight of giant
bats rushed past him he shook himself
and entering saw that a great hole on one
side permitted the gruesome creatures to
enter and make it their home

  inside he found some remains of what
had once been furniture whatever article
he touched fell away in his fingers like chi-
nese punk then he saw several chests
of cedar heavily copper bound nowt green
with age

  a hope-wild impossible thrilling-
leaped in his heart he broke open one
chest easily enough and stepped back dis-
appointed it contained what appeared to
be several black vases and some black
crosses

  he smashed open the next chest a
heap of gray ashes lay in it disappoint-
ed again he stirred them wnth the back of
an old worm-eaten mahogany chair the
ashes had once been clothes-tiny vestiges
for identification still remained and at the
bottom he came upon some marvelous vases
that were gem-studded so thickly with un-
mistakably fine jewels that he cried out with
sudden vehemence

  a fortune rubies and sapphires and
great rose-cut diamonds by the score
searching further he found a large quantity
s

argosy-allstory weekly

of huge gold coins they bore a mint mark
but were so worn that he could not make
out the country of their issue

  trembling now he tore oft his coat and
filled it with the treasure leaping from
the ship he buried it in the sands near
the foot of a great coconut palm several
trips of this sort he made until the contents
of both chests were safe underground-ex-
cept for some coins and one vase which he
intended bringing back to his friends as
evidence of their enormous good fortune
he picked up his rifle and fairly ran down
the smooth sands soon he was forced to
make several detours but finally he was
surprised to come upon the hawk riding at
anchor right before him the treasure ship
was not even half a mile away

  he burst in upon paul and ada in a
galvanic fun of enthusiasm as fast as
he could he told them of his find and of-
fered the coins and the vase before their as-
tonished eyes

  they stood looking at one another with
mixed feelings hardly daring to credit it
all wealth such as this unlocked the gates
of that world which had shut upon them in
their poverty

   but tell me finally exclaimed the vol-
uble paul  what was the name of the ship
could you see was there anything to
identify it i used to know the history of
these seas perhaps-

  bob gave him the initials he had been
able to decipher and paul wrote them
down puzzling over them intently

   xow said bob  with money at our
command we can get justice his voice
grew slightly acrid  without it we are

	incorrigibies with it we can go through
the courts and prove-

   we-we interrupted paul  you-
not we you found it-its yours

  bob turned and sun-eyed his friend with
narrowed eyes while a smile stole about the
corners of his mouth sternly he pointed a
finger at the radiant paul

   young man he reproved  i said u-e
this is half and half theres enough for all
of us and im not- he paused and his
face grew very grave he turned to ada
who was watching both men with her hands
clasped in ecstatic joy her eyes brilliant

 it really is all vours went on bob quiet-
ly nodding toward both of them  if it
were not for ada and you paul i would
still be making reads under the broiling sun
-or be dead because id made a dash for
liberty lets not talk about it further

   oh-i-i- began ada then her voice
quavered and failed she buried her head
upon her husbands shoulder and wept

   le bon dieu has been good to us my
sweet murmured paul patting her shoul-
der  cry little one if you feel like it
now-i do not mind tears of happiness

i-i-am very near it myself  then he
shook his head almost impatiently  but
to work  he cried taking up his paper and
pencil again while ada smiled through her
tears  what shall we do now bob

   have something to eat  suggested
bob gravely  the treasure is safe-well
decide after lunch-im hungry come on
ada ill help you cook a meal im a good
cook-thanks to the army

  while bob and the girl busied themselves
making a small fire paul sat hunched over
his paper his brow knit in furrows

  u ive got it he cried suddenly-so
suddenly and unexpectedly that ada
dropped the coffee pot and bob whirled

   by the way you act exclaimed bob

 id rather say you ft ad em heavens
man-you startled me

  look cried paul pointing to the
paper and taking no note of bobs levity

 you see it fits in your ship bob is
the almiranta id swear to it

   which replied bob  means nothing
in my young life who was she

   dont you recall babbled the over-
wrought paul  about  mendana
sailed from lima peru with four ships and
four hundred people to colonize the solo-
mons they were to come to san cristo-
val but instead were lost and made santa
cruz in a storm and that same night
the almiranta one of the ships disappeared
from the ken of white men her fate was
one of the many mysteries of the sea dont
you recall it now and think of our find-
ing her-after three hundred years-and
more 

  they stared at one another incredulously

   mendana if i remember died in the is-
out of the

coral sea



lands and his chief pilot quiros looked for
the almiranta but gave up the search and
went to manila i remember it all distinct-
ly now-i used to pour over the story when
i was a boy

    well said bob after a silence in which
they had eyed one another with conflicting
emotions  im extremely grateful to mr
mendana-but im just as much grateful
to you-and to ada

   he shook the grave shadow from his voice
and continued more brightly

   lets get something to eat now to-
morrow well explore the rest of the al-
miranta-or whatever her name was we
cant be sure of course the spaniards who
sailed out of lima lost many treasure
ships

   to-morrow cried paul  to-mor-
row right after lunch 

   but your foot

   you have no idea how much better it
is grinned paul  the power of money
is marvelous

  their simple meal began to take on the
aspects of a feast for good fortune is a
stimulating condiment

   then again like an ominous threat came
three faint detonations-distant shots

chapter vii

 and what a girl

they eyed one another with grave con-
cern their meal forgotten

 those were gun shots said paul
chataine quietly

   what shall we do whispered ada
white to the lips her eyes resting upon her
husband for herself she felt no concern
but possible recapture or danger to paul
wrung her heart

   this decided bob swiftly well
leave our find here-its safe where i put it
under the tree there are no marks in the
sand and no one could locate it in a hun-
dred years we have the latitude and longi-
tude of this place and can find it again

   in the meanwhile well take this one
vase and the coins with us and look for some
other island where well be undisturbed un-
til their confounded man-hunt dies down

   you and paul go on board the hawk
and make ready to sail while i investigate
and find out who is on this island with us

i cant imagine who would be firing shots in
a place like this

    unless answered paul  there are na-
tives in the interior and they have an old
trade gun or two the shots seem to come
from over those hills

    well continued bob  theres no sense
in running out into the open sea until we
know what we are trying to run away from
ill go and have a look in the meanwhile
get on board and be ready to sail

   he picked up his rifle again stuffed an
extra box of cartridges into his pocket and
added a field glass to his equipment paul
and ada began to pack their belongings into
the tender

    ill be back by evening i hope said
bob  youll see me on the beach

    i hate to let you go alone began paul
his eyes full of affection for his friend  but
my foot-

    please-be careful  called ada

  bob who was already swinging toward
the woods turned and laughed

    i promise he answered gayly  to be
very careful ill eat no cannibals and i
wont attack the french navy

   with extreme prudence making as little
noise as possible he made his way into the
jungle above him the bright-hued parrots
screamed in the green tropic roof which
seemed to be supported by the vine-clad
trunks of mighty trees that reared skyward
like cathedral pillars here and there grew
groups of banana trees or graceful sago-
palms red hibiscus flowers made patches of
color on the somber green of the grass
delicate mosses and feathery ferns were
everywhere and over all hung the moist
hot taint of the tropics

  it took him half an hour to reach the
first low hills then almost an hour to cross
them from their summits he saw that the
island was apparently miles in length a
veritable eden as undisturbed as it must
have been in the first faint day of creation

   reaching a height he caught the glitter
of the sea before and below him evidently
the island was narrow

  walking forward and wondering how to


argosy-allstory weekly

account for the shots he came to a natural
opening in the jungle that permitted a clear
view of the sea-and stopped abruptly

   riding at anchor upon the gentle swell
was a big two-master that meant white
men what were they doing here he im-
mediately decided that this could not be
part of a pursuit for official french vessels
were all steam power several shots sound-
ed right before him he slipped behind
some dense underbrush and waited his
heart beating tumultuously he could not
see who was firing as the heavy foliage
intervened	

   speculating with excited curiosity he de-
termined to push forward and get a glimpse
of the people whoever they were

   crawling at times dodging from tree to
tree he moved slowly toward the beach and
stopped when he had a good view of it

   he saw several seminaked kanakas gath-
ering shells from the beach and dumping
them in baskets others working from a
small boat seemed to be diving and bring-
ing up more shells a white man so dark
that he looked like a kanaka swung out
of the woods carrying a shotgun and a string
of pigeons

   evidently decided bob this was an is-
land trader who had discovered a bed of
pearl shell and was taking it aboard he
breathed a sigh of relief this ship would
go sooner or later  then he and his com-
panions could stay in peace as long as they
felt it was necessary

  he was about to return to the hawk
when he remembered his glasses and curi-
ous to get a closer look at the man with
the gun and the ship he swept the beach
an exclamation left his lips

   with the aid of the glasses he saw another
white man swarthy aquiline - featured
saturnine who stood in the blue shadows
of some coconut palms at the extreme right
of the beach he was leaning upon his
rifle and on a flat-topped stone sat a girl
dressed in white

   the glasses brought them face to face
with him and he caught his breath sharply
and fell back a pace staring with the blank
stupidity of a bewildered and incredulous
amazement in all his life he had never
seen such sheer incomparable loveliness

    a white girl he told his listening soul
and what a girl and that chap with
her looks like a-pirate

  he could see she was young possessed
of an indescribable patrician delicacy min-
gled with youthfulness and a strange for-
eign grace the eyes were twin violet pools
with gold-flecked pupils that would have
driven a velasquez to despair the sneer-
ing dangerous face of the man caused in-
stant antipathy it was leering evil

  eagerly he looked again at the girl and
something within him seemed to gush warm
all at once and thrill in answer to her un-
usual beauty

   who can she be i wonder he thought

  as he watched he noted swiftly that they
seemed to be quarreling their voices did
not reach him

  the man was arrogant and smiling leer-
ingly the girl was both angry and beseech-
ing bob watched the soundless drama in
utter fascination

   all at once the man stooped suggestively
and the girl slapped him he laughed and
caught her in his arms they struggled
sharply the girl apparently frantic but the
man easily bent her arms away and kissed
her then he lifted his cobralike head and
laughed the girl covered her face with
her hands and sank upon her seat a mo-
ment later when she removed them bob
could see her face burning with a keen un-
bearable passionate shame

  a berserker rage began to mount in bobs
heart a soundless oath was on his lips
he glanced at the kanakas they were
laughing somehow this further outraged
bobs inborn instincts of chivalry to let this
pass unchallenged was a mock at his man-
hood

   suddenly flinging the rifle to his shoul-
der he brought it to bear upon the white
man then he put it down again slowly
that wouldnt do the girl might be a re-
fractory wife-it might be a domestic quar-
rel yet-

  he noted that a high palm-covered ledge
came within a few feet of where the man
and the girl were some instinct within
him urged him to investigate further ut-
terly oblivious of the chances he took in
thus exposing himself he crept forward
out of the coral sea



and at length lay almost directly above
them

  peering over the ledge he saw them both
and the mans voice came to him distinctly
glancing around he noted that the kanakas
on the beach could not see him parting
the grass he looked over

   what a fuss you make the man was
saying  over one kiss

   when we get to macao the girl
stormed raising her face her voice broken
by sobs  ill tell my father hell teach
you a -lesson-you soulless b-brute

  the man laughed heartily

   your father is dead i tell you he an-
swered brutally  drank too much be-
sides a shrimp like that never caused me
any worry t could break two of him across
my knee 

   i dont b-believe hes dead the girl
sobbed

   youll see the man said shrugging his
shoulders then  maybe we wont get back
to macao ive found a bed of gold-edged
pearl shell that ought to make me rich i
can sell it in any port for nine hundred a
ton-then we can come back here you and
i eh this island isnt on the maps and
no one knows of it-we could be here for
years and no one would disturb us its
ovit of the trading and passenger routes
lucky our casks leaked and we had to come
ashore for fresh water eh

  the girls low sobbing was her only an-
swer

   oh stop it  cried the man impatient-
ly  i hate a crying woman why no
one else would have treated you as well as
i have im master here and on my ship
and my will is law-do you understand
what i mean

  still there was no answer but she shiv-
ered under the lash of a veiled threat that
she only partly comprehended

  a blaze of bitter blood shone in bobs
face his teeth came together firmly his
instinct was to punish the man on the spot
but he saw that such an action would be
worse than suicide for both he would be
captured and that wouldnt help the girl
he held his sense of proportion and self-
control with a firm hand

   something told me not to trust you

sobbed the girl  id never have gone with
you if i hadnt been so anxious to see my
father-and you had the letter i sent him-
w-whatever made him trust you to bring
m-me oh i wish i was dead

   oh come-come  said the man gruffly
 lets not go over that again youre here
now-so why talk about it as for the
letter and the photograph-i have moy
song to thank for them

   look here he went on argumenting
sullenly  wouldnt you prefer me to a
chinaman i promised id bring you back
but i never dreamed youd turn out to be
such a little beauty he offered me a
pretty stiff price to get you well im
passing that up because i like you-any-
way wouldnt you prefer me to him hes
a little dried-up yellow chinaman and he
already has a white wife why not be sen-
sible he wouldnt marry you-he
couldnt i might thats the difference
youve got me crazy about you-im off
my head-i dont know what youve done
to me- he stopped and looked around
stirred by the depths of his feelings then
continued  ill have lots of money zelma
when i sell this bed of shell-theres tons
and tons of it and we could come back
here-

  id die first cried the girl coming
to her feet her eyes filled with a great ter-
ror a breathless loathing disgust

    you certainly will die he told her with
a sudden furious vehemence  if you try
anything desperate if you go overboard
the sharks will get you or youll drown
if you try running away here the snakes
will get you or youll starve to death-or
worse-if theres natives-

   the girl cried out sharply

  please she begged please you
have your better moments-please let me
go see-here on my knees i beg of you
i swear that i shall kill myself before ill
accept either-

  you wont get the chance he inter-
rupted darkly  ill watch you pretty
closely and youll either do as  want you
to-or by god ill take you back to moy
song and let him work his will with you
that will be worse for you-but ill get
my money im damned if ill let you


argosy -allstory weekly

cheat me out of both either i get you-or
it get the money for you and turn you
over to that yellow reptile

    now come along zelma youve got to
go back on board dont force me to tie
you up well be here for some time and
if you behave ill let you come akiore
every day for a while im not going to
rush you-you can think it over as long
as we stay here-but when the shells on
board-i want my answer thats all the
time you have to think about it-and by
god its more than any other man in the
world would give you come along now-
dont make any useless fuss-youve got to
go aboard

   bob held himself in check only with in-
tense difficulty white as chalk his re-
straint slipping he watched them get into
the longboat after which several kanakas
rowed them out to the ship

  the girls sobs made no impression upon
the depraved natives nor apparently upon
the other white man for a week seeming-
ly until all the shell was on board she
was safe-unless driven hard she might de-
stroy herself bob began to plan though
his white-heat anger handicapped him
something must be done-but what he
had already irrevocably committed himself
to action on her behalf-but there was paul
and ada-they must be thought of too

  it would soon be dark he suddenly
remembered that he had promised to be
back early he must do nothing to jeopard-
ize their safety they too must be con-
sidered as well as the girl though her cause
pulled at his heart strings with paining fin-
gers

   he made his way back to the jungle and
once out of sight of those on the beach
lost no time in crossing the island it was
dusk when he stepped out upon the beach
and saw the hawk sailing back and forth
across the little bay

  paul must have been watching sharply
for his signal was answered instantly the
hawk swung at once to her former anchor-
age and dropped anchor paul came for
him in the tender

   seated upon the deck he told them swift-
ly what he had seen and heard

    but he wound up  its my affair and

i cant allow it to jeopardize your safety
i have no right to include you in the risk
of getting her away so heres what i pro-
pose you and ada clear out and leave me
enough ammunition and food for a week-
then paul exploded and ada raised her
hand in interruption

  look here cried paul do you
think-

   bob interrupted ada placing her
hand on his arm  we cant leave without
some attempt to release her-what else have
you in mind-anything

    this is simply fine of both of you
bob answered  but i cant allow-
fool cried paul in exasperation
 dont talk nonsense wte wont leave
you-its out of the question why youd
die here why dont you watch until you
get an opportunity to talk to the girl if
you could get her into the bush with an
hour or twos start she could board the
hawk and wed be gone before they could
round the island to give chase-

    and eagerly interrupted ada  the
hawk can show a clean pair of heels to
anything like a trader-shes fast we
must try to help that girl

    perhaps suggested bob suddenly  i
could buy her release with some of our
jewels the man looks and talks like an
avaricious cur who would sell anything at
a price

    perhaps agreed ada but paul shook
his head

    you wouldnt succeed he declared
 you dont know the caliber of some of
the traders of these waters hed take your
jewels and the girl too-and perhaps your
life in the bargain so you would never be
able to tell what you know

  then for some minutes they sat in a
palpitant silence

    ill go back there every day bob said
firmly  ill make an opportunity to talk
to her and effect her escape into the bush
somehow if i can manage to get several
hours start ill bring her aboard and well
be gone before he can round the island to
give chase if not ill take my chances of
buying her release with my share of the
find-now dont interrupt me-ill not
budge an inch i tell you
out of the coral sea



   in the meanwhile ill dismount the
jewels in the vase we have-bait and proof
of greater quantities in exchange for the
girl-if it becomes necessary and the chance
offers well go right now and divide the
vases and coins youll take your half and
ill bury my half in several places your
half will be on board so you can pull out
at any minute

   every day youll stand off and on the
island ready to put to sea if i show up alone
with the girl if i fail to come back for
two days then as you value adas life put
to sea and leave this island ill manage
somehow-

   but look here- began paul in heated
protest

   thats all there is to it old friend
bob interrupted grimly facing paul  its
that or i stay alone

  no amount of entreaty could move him
from his decision

  they unmounted a dozen large rose-cut
diamonds sapphires and rubies from the
vase bob concealed these in the waist-
band of his trousers then they sailed the
hawk to the cove where the ancient wreck
lay and the treasure was divided bob
buried his share while ada made a map of
its location and wrote out latitude and
longitude of the island this map she kept
at bobs request after he had memorized
the necessary numbers

   i can remember it he assured her
 its best that i dont carry it with me
one can never tell what nay happen you
know

  later when they sat upon deck in a
friendly silence after even paul had ceased
his attempts to dissuade bob from his
course ada suddenly asked bob

   is she-beautiful bob

   the most beautiful thing i ever saw on
gods earth he answered swiftly without
any hesitation he realized that this girl
had impressed him out of all proportion to
what he knew of her yet a swift analysis
disclosed to him that the entire chemistry
of his being longed for this one girl it
was startling he tried to disbelieve it as
well try to turn the stars from their courses
it suddenly became the one looming most
firmly fixed fact in his life

    ah breathed the vivacious paul soft-
ly he was french and real french blood
runs richly in the understanding of love
 how strange it is we see a million faces
we hear a million voices we meet a million
women and they do not touch us then-
we see one and- he stopped and glanced
affectionately at ada  still he con-
tinued  it is not so strange after all-the
heart knows

  they slept on board that night next
morning early bob picked up his rifle
extra cartridges glasses some food and
went ashore

chapter viii

a dash for safety

the cool early morning freshness of
the tropics greeted him a sudden
compelling excitement once he had
actually embarked upon his adventure
urged him on faster and faster

  he crossed the island with greater speed
this morning but when he neared the beach
on the opposite side he slowed down cau-
tiously

  creeping to his former vantage-point on
the ledge his rifle and glasses beside him
he saw that the kanakas were already at
work loading pearl shell there was no
sign of the white men or the girl for sev-
eral hours he lay in the sun thinking wan-
dering evolving plan after plan executing
maneuvers pondering on how to get the
girl away without being noticed it never
occurred to him that perhaps the opportu-
nity might not arise he had definitely
committed himself to rescue her-at the
point of his rifle if need be

  at about ten oclock the dark man who
had shot the pigeons on the previous day
came ashore he carried his shotgun and
after giving some orders to the kanakas
walked up the beach evidently bound upon
further depredation on the islands flocks
bob rightly guessed that the pigeons were
intended as tid-bits for the captains table
hour after hour he lay but there was no
sign of the captain or the girl he began
to grow apprehensive was she going to
stay upon the ship had something oc-


argosy-allstory weekly

   curred he caught his breath as sinister
   possibilities passed through his mind

    the pigeon hunter at length returned
   with a good bag of the birds and was rowed
   to the ship

     i could pick off the kanakas one by
  one bob thought savagely  force them
  to come ashore to investigate then pick
  them all off but he had put this thought
  away  it might do as a last resort but
  i couldnt storm the ship he decided
   unless-i swam out at night and caught
  them unaware

    about two oclock a signal flashed from
  the ship and several kanakas jumped into
  the longboat and rowed out to her using
  his glasses bob made out the captain and
  the girl coming ashore a thrill ran through
  him-the old thrill of excitement always
  sweet to him

     the longboat was pulled up on the beach
  the girl leaped lightly to a dry footing dis-
  daining the proffered hand of the captain
  bob watched her approach the stone be-
  neath him with a curious muffled drum-
  ming in his heart and ears she was far
  more beautiful than he had dreamed seem-
  ingly she was calm and oblivious of all her
  surroundings the captain lounged after
  her confident smiling

    now be careful he heard the cap-
tain warn her  dont go too near the
jungle my mate reports many large
snakes i have no doubt but what the island
is inhabited most of them are-and some
of the natives have a pleasant little way
of saving white heads to put on sticks
around the village if you dont behave
you cant come again

   the girl looked at him with a cold scorn
a contemptuous disdain that apparently
penetrated his armor of braggadocio he
flushed slightly under the level luminous
regard

   theres plenty to interest you right
here he went on with a species of defi-
ance  watch those parrots or pigeons i
will stroll down and see if any more pearls
were found im treating you decently
zelma-giving you a pretty free hand-so
dont make any foolish attempts to es-
cape you cant do it youd be caught in
ten minutes

     as zelma surveyed the tropical jungle it
  looked hopeless indeed she made no re-
  ply she sat looking out to sea her eyes
  swimming in a haze of tears in her daunt-
  less little heart the resolution was already
  born to take the chance-rather to die in
  the jungle than to risk further proximity
  with the hulking captain

    bob began to make his way slowly and
  noiselessly back toward the jungle blood
  racing in every pulse the saline taste of
  excitement in his mouth he checked his
  usual desire to whistle aimlessly as was
  his habit when under intense strain in
  the trenches in france he had caught him-
  self doing this and had smiled the zero
  hour was coming now again

     he crept tow-ard her keeping a clump of
  foliage between himself and the occupants
  of the beach at length he was as near as
  he dared go

    then he raised his head just a trifle
  above the ferns and grasses she was still
  gazing out to sea the look in her great
  violet eyes bruised his heart the others
  were a good fifty yards away he knew
  her name so he raised his head and called
  softly

     zelma a friend dont scream or
  talk

     he saw the blood go from her face while
  a tremor raced through the slim body she
  sat quite still but her hands clutched at her
  parasol until the knuckles shone white
  through the skin

     im here to help you get away he
  went on very quietly  my friend and his
  wife are on the other side of the island
  you will be safe with her i heard your
  story by accident yesterday and came back
  to help you dont be afraid please you
  can trust me

 the girl glanced swiftly at the captain
 and the kanakas they were examining
 pearls and were deeply engrossed with an
 unhurried movement she shifted her position
 and looked into bobs face

  he saw the amazement the wild hope
 the incredulous joy that shone in her eyes
 at the possibility of release from her in-
 tolerable situation what she saw in bobs
 face evidently reassured her she nodded
 her head slightly it was too bizarre but
out of the coral sea



  what had she to lose she thought any-
thing rather than the captain or-macao
she shuddered while the tumult of her
pulses constricted her throat

   walk to the waters edge instructed
bob softly  put up your parasol pick
up shells and throw them into the water
saunter up the beach slowly-take your
time ill keep pace in the woods when
you get to that tongue of palms run into
the woods ill be there

  he crept back into the underbrush and
examined his rifle it was full he was
ready now for whatever might come he
watched her as she obeyed his instructions
-the careless grace of her walk the calm
imperturbable manner by no sign did she
show the nervous strain under which she
must be laboring

   little thoroughbred bob told his soul
in intense admiration

  captain montozzi watched her too as
she picked up shells examined them and
threw them into the sea she sauntered up
the beach aimlessly

  he smiled she would turn out sensible
after all after the first outbreak they all
came to their senses sooner or later he
let her walk he could see up the beach
fully a mile he never dreamed shed take
to the jungle even escape meant death
and he couldnt believe that any woman
would prefer death to safety-no matter
what species of safety it was as for that
talk about killing herself first that was all
melodrama they all said that he smiled
again

  but when zelma came to the palms bob
had indicated she slipped into the brush and
looked around

   this way called bob at her side in a
moment

  she started hesitated and examined his
face briefly

   dont be afraid he assured her  you
can trust me

  she nodded

  they ran swiftly inland but before they
had covered a hundred yards they heard
cries from the beach and the sounds of the
captain and the kanakas taking to the
woods

  the captain had missed her

   keep going straight ahead whispered
bob  ill cover the rear go as fast as you
can please

chapter ix

a deal in diamonds

for half a mile the girl made swift
progress after that her pace grew
slower she staggered once or twice
and her breath came in short sharp spasms
bob swore silently as he saw her strength
and wind ebbing toward exhaustion his
jaw set grimly tensely

  the kanakas had evidently spread out in
a circle in his rear and were beating for-
ward rapidly-keeping pace with them he
could hear the captains furious shouts of
command

  the girl stopped and leaned against a
tree she had no breath even for words
but her great eloquent eyes looked up at
him as if to tell him that she had done her
best she pointed to the jungle and finally
gasped

   he-he-doesnt know about you-
yet go-and leave-me hell-kill-
you ill find another opportunity-

  for answer she received a vicious grum-
ble as bob swept her up in his arms and ran
with her through the dense underbrush she
lay in his arms like a thing bereft of life
only her eyes looking up at him with a spe-
cies of wonder

  it was harrowing hot work crossing
an open parklike space a kanaka saw him
and shouted his discovery to the others
the hue and cry redoubled a bullet sud-
denly sang over bobs head then another
and another

  this was becoming dangerous the next
bullet might strike him or the girl he de-
termined to fight it out dodging behind
a bowlder he set zelma down and swung
his rifle to bear upon the dodging leaping
forms in front of him before he could
pull the trigger another shot rang out

  the bullet struck the bowlder to one side
of him the nickel-jacketed slug chipped
a piece of stone which struck him above
the eye and sent him reeling he dropped
his rifle striving to keep his whirling facul-


argosy-allstory weekly

     ties the blood began to run down into his
   eyes and he felt a pair of arms grasp him
   from behind

     employing an old trick he seized the
   kanaka by the back of the neck and threw
   him over his shoulder another kanaka in
   front went down with a hard straight blow
   but it was useless he couldnt see his
   head was whirling and other arms fastened
   upon him he struggled hard but all at
   once be felt the curious soundless crash of
   his senses and he knew no more

     when he regained consciousness he was
   firmly bound and several kanakas stood
   about him captain montozzi watched
   him with venomous eyes bob noted that
   zelma too was bound and was sitting upon
   a stone her eyes fixed upon his face it
   had been a hopeless effort they were
   caught he looked at the girl with a
   white still anguish that searched and found
   her heart

      who are you demanded the captain
   with vivid oaths

     bob glanced at the girl in great mortifi-
   cation montozzi followed his glance and
   had the grace to redden

      what are you doing here he demand-
ed  who are you

   bob did not answer directly he felt
faint and sick he tried a different tack

    if you dont release us he answered

 youll soon find out i ve enough men
here to wipe you and your crew off the map
untie me

   the captain glanced around swiftly and
smiled

    xot right away he answered sarcas-
tically    take a chance

   he turned to several of the watching crew
 and issued several orders they wheeled
 into the jungle and were gone

    ill soon find out about your men
he went on  in the meantime well cross
to the other side of the island theres no
ship on our side so ill have a look at the
other side perhaps  find out where you
came from as for me i think youye a
beach comber and sos you wont get into
mischief ill hang onto you for a while

 get up 

   montozzi picked up bobs rifle and ex-
amined it

       martini-henry eh he said  youre
   an englishman arent you while im at
   it iii see what else you have might have

   a knife in your pockets

      he searched bobs pockets but found no
   identification of any kind then he calmly
   confiscated the entire contents bob said
   nothing he was fearful that montozzi
   would discover his jewels but the captain
   overlooked them not thinking to look in the
   lining of his trousers

      now get up  rasped the captain

    march

      as they neared the beach a kanaka came
   bounding toward them and said something
   to the captain

      montozzi grinned  little bluff didnt
   work he said to bob  my man tells
   me theres only a little single-master ratch-
   ing off and on the coast

     bob bit his lip with a new dread he
   was bringing danger to paul and ada in
   some way he must contrive to warn them

     a few minutes later they came out on
   the beach and bob saw the hawk plying
   across the bay she altered her course
   slightly and a white object waved upon her
   deck they had seen him that meant
   that they had seen the others also

     without thought of his own safety he
   suddenly sprinted forward and ran into the
   water up to his knees then with all the
   power of his lungs he shouted  get
   away paul-get away-

   that was as far as he went for mon-
   tozzi was right behind him and dragged
   him out of the water bodily

    damn you  he cried savagely as bob
 struggled to keep his feet  ill show you
 and your interfering-

   a shot sounded from the hawk and she
 swung about in her course the captain
 looked up and immediately ordered his
 crew back into the brush where he also
 pulled bob

   ill show you he fumed an intense
 malignity a brutal vengeful lust blazing
 in his cruel face and echoing in his voice

   show you how  deal with your
 crowd 

   he issued an order to a slim kanaka
 who left immediately

    by the time we get back to my ship
out of the coral sea



   he said  shell be ready to sail im
   going to overhaul that boat of yours and
   sink her then ill attend to you march
   in front and head back to where we came
   from if you make the slightest break to
   get away ill fill you full of lead

     bob looked him in the eyes with a level
   steadiness

      that wont do you a bit of good he
   answered calmly  youll never catch the
   hawk and her people know that youve
   kidnaped this young lady and that youre
   bound for macao to turn her over to moy
   song theyll make it hot for you if you
   dont release the girl and myself

      how the devil did you know that
   queried the captain astonished

      never mind how answered bob his
   voice cold  better consider carefully
   what you do-or it may go hard with you
   they know youve got me and youll have
   to answer to the authorities for your ac-
   tions every port in the world will be

	watched for you

     montozzis eyes narrowed

      maybe he said slowly  and maybe
   not im not the sort to be bluffed if i
   sink your boat no one will be any the
   wiser havent thought of that have you
   go ahead now-walk

     during the walk across the narrow is-
   land bobs mind ran in a strange confu-
   sion his head hurt fearfully where the
   stone had struck despite his high-
   sounding phrases he was apprehensive for
   paul and ada if they only would leave
   at once they might get away if they hung
   around hoping against hope to help him
   out of his difficulty the trader would surely
   sink them bob saw only too well that
   montozzi was a man who hesitated at noth-
   ing in the calendar of crime especially if
   his own safety demanded drastic action

     arriving at the beach they were taken
   on board the water queen zelma was
   sent to her cabin and locked in while bob
   was allowed to remain on deck

    now ill show you what ill do
   grinned montozzi evilly as the ship gath-
   ered speed and stood out to sea  these
   are unfrequented waters-no one will know
   or see ill teach you inquisitive english
   to come interfering just sit here and have

the pleasure of seeing your friends boat
splintered 

  the water queen gathered speed and
began to weather the island bob sat in
a haze of disconnected thought his head
hurt badly trussed up as he was he
could do nothing he wondered where
zelma was where it would all lead to and
what montozzi would do with him then
an electric flicker came to his eyes and he
began his aimless tuneless whistling as
they rounded the island he saw the little
hawk ahead standing out to sea mon-
tozzi stood near him watching her through
his glasses

   a woman at the wheel he exclaimed
 so thats your gang of men eh he
laughed sarcastically

  bobs breath came faster as he saw that
the hawk was holding its own ada was
an expert sailor and the hawk was fast
perhaps-

  the sun was setting in a red haze and
if the hawk could hold out until night she
might slip away in the darkness the
wind was good-two points aft the beam
steady and strong

  montozzi too must have thought of the
approaching night for he ordered the top-
gaffsls and the inner and outer jibs shaken
out they had been running under main-
sls forestaysl foresl and jib now the
water queen forged ahead and carried a
 bone in her teeth  as she raced along

  the hawk was too far away for bob to
be able to see much but he did note that
the distance between the two ships did not
decrease

  more canvas yelled the irate mon-
tozzi to the portuguese mate  theyll
get away in the dark he glowrered at the
hawk fiercely and swore  damn them
if i had a gun on board id sink them
quick its too far for rifle fire

  eleven knots by the log sir called
the mate

   haul out the spinnaker boom yelled
montozzi  haul her off a point or two
and take the full wind we must catch
them move jump to it get busy
he turned to bob  who are those peo-
ple he demanded  youd better talk
or ill make it damned wforse for you


argosy-allstory weekly

    bob didnt answer but looked montozzi
    over contemptuously he noted that the
    water queen was racing along with all her
    canvas set and yet she gained nothing on
    the little flying hawk

      the race thrilled him far ahead he
   saw the hawk leisurely dancing away it
   gradually became apparent that the water
   queen couldnt overtake her

       montozzi swore with a vitriolic fury as
    darkness came and a faint unilluminating
    moon shone upon the waters finally they
    lost the hawk altogether bob breathed a
    sigh of intense relief ada and paul were
    safe-thanks to adas stanch seamanship
    and the speed of the hawk the hopeless-
    ness of the chase became evident to even
    the dogged persistent montozzi

     get up he ordered curtly come
   along with me i want to talk to you-
   and youd better talk or ill-

      he didnt finish the threat but his voice
  carried a deadly menace in montozzis
  brain a doubt was forming if the people
  on the little hawk knew of zelmas abduc-
  tion knew of his destination and the name
  of moy song they could cause him trouble
  had he been able to catch them things
  would have been different

    he did not know of course that the peo-
  ple on the hawk were fugitives and would
  not dare enlist the aid of any authorities

 he gave the mate some orders in a low
 tone then motioned bob into his cabin
 here he lit a pipe and turned to bob

   who are you he demanded and
 what were you doing on that island

bob concluded that silence was golden

  he did not answer but he smiled in a tan-
  talizing manner at the captain then he
  stared at the wall in rapt attention he
  rightly guessed that silence would confuse
  montozzi

    it did montozzi exhibited signs of ner-
vousness for nearly an hour he tried to
obtain some information from bob-from
what source he had obtained moy songs
name-but bob kept silent it finally in-
furiated the hot-tempered italian

   by god he cried  youll talk or 
pull your tongue out by the roots  

 a new thought came to bob he turned
to montozzi and said in a quiet voice

       take it easy and sit down ive a
    proposition to make to you

       yes-i suppose you have-

        keep quiet and listen to me inter-
    rupted bob coolly  i have the power to
    cause you a great deal of trouble and it
    depends upon you whether i do or not
    remember that my friends know im
    here they saw me they know who you
    are why you are here and your destination
    with the girl

        even if you dont go to macao youll
    never be able to put into any other port
    theyll all be watched for you what good
    would it do you to kill me

       the captain eyed him sharply  well
    he asked

        now went on bob  lets talk busi-
    ness unfasten my hands and ill tell you
    something that  make you happy and
    give you immunity

       montozzi laid an automatic pistol on the
    table and cut bobs hands loose

        try anything he said indicating the
    pistol and ill drill you-quick

    in answer to the threat bob smiled
    pleasantly and nodded

  forget it he said easily  the
 fourth of july is over-put the cannon
 away im trying to talk business be
 sensible give me a smoke and ill ex-
 plain

    curious admiring the nonchalance of the
 younger man though puzzled and worried
 by it montozzi obeyed when bobs ciga-
 rette was going he turned and began

 you want money dont you

     naturally montozzi sneered  we
 all do what of it

    this replied bob youre bringing
 zelma to moy song for a price well
 will you deliver her to me give us both our
 freedom unharmed if i gave you-one
 hundred times as much and in the bar-
 gain agreed that no harm would come to
 you from the authorities because of your
 acts

thats fine talk montozzi sneered

  i might be agreeable-but where is this
 money to come from

     like this went on bob pulling the
 great jewels from his trousers linings and
 spreading them on the table

                           a
out of the coral sea



  they blinked and glittered wickedly in
the light of the hanging lantern montozzi
gasped he seized and examined one after
another

   the diamonds are good he exclaimed

 but these -he shoved the great rubies
and sapphires across the table- i dont
know anything about-dont want them
where did you get this

   all in good time replied bob  now
those diamonds you have in your hand
would alone make you wealthy suppose
i told you that id give you twenty or
thirty more like it-if youll agree to my
terms

   montozzis eyes glittered with the avarice
of a harpagon

   you have them here he asked

   no said bob smiling  this is all

i	have here but ill give you the location
of the balance-after zelma and myself are
put ashore

  the captain grinned

   i have these now he said  and the
  twenty or thirty others may be just bluff
  now i have this and zelma too you-
  listen the others are in a safe place
  these are only as an evidence of good
  faith examine the stones you see that
  they are rose-cut thats the way they
  were cat hundreds of years ago

    montozzi looked and nodded

      im going to tell you a story went on
   bob  i and my friends found the hull of
   an old spanish ship there were dozens
   of vases on her all studded with stones
   such as i have here my friends have their
   half of the treasure safe my share is bur-
   ied in a certain spot if youll set zelma
   and me ashore in some port ill give you
   the location and you can go and get them
   theres enough to make you very wealthy
   even in these days of great fortunes ill
   get in touch with my friends assure them
   that both i and the girl are safe-so therell
   be no trouble for you now all i want is
   these red and blue stones you can keep
   all the rest there are over fifty more
   what do you say

    a dewy perspiration began to stand out
  upon montozzis brow this was wealth-
  real wealth if this tale was true-and he
  held some evidence in his hands to support

      	a

its veracity-he would be rich beyond his
fondest dreams a canny idea began to
dawn in his crooked brain

  he shook himself and eyed bob

   how could i explain to moy song
he asked  hes a hard man and very
powerful

   you wont ever need him again re-
plied bob  youll be far richer-and
consequently more powerful or you can
say the girl wouldnt come tell him what-
ever you choose

   yes-i suppose that would be easy
enough where is the balance of the stones
-on the island

   no lied bob calmly  its on a
small island we found-about three hun-
dred miles away ill give you the exact
latitude and longitude when you fulfill
your end of the bargain

  all right exclaimed the captain sud-
denly  ill do it ill take the chance
good said bob now if youll
free zelma treat us decently on the trip
and put us off at manila or hongkong
youll have wealth that few people ever even
dream about

    and youre willing to part with all this
-for a girl asked montozzi curiously
 its a high price to pay i like a good-
looking girl myself-but not at such a
price he laughed unpleasantly  i sup-
pose youre in love with her eh

   thats my affair bob answered qui-
etly though his cheeks burned at the cap-
tains careless speech

  the captain shrugged a cynical smile
upon his lips

    all right-its a bargain he repeated
 ill put you off at hongkong then ill go
on to macao and have a little talk with
moy song after that ill go after the
balance of this

  he tapped the big diamonds

   will you please release zelma now
requested bob  treat us as passengers
for the voyage im paying you high cap-
tain be something of a sport-and play
square 

   montozzi put his diamonds into his pock-
   et picked up his pistol and lit his pipe

    will he answered  see that you
  do ill give you a bunk forward ill let


argosy-allstory weekly

 the girl out now too im going to let
 you have the run of the ship so behave-
 dont do anything rash

    what could i do asked bob shrug-
 ging  im on you ship and youre twenty
 to my one i have no arms-

    and youre not likely to get any inter-
 rupted the captain  well ill have the
 cook give you something to eat

   he walked out

   a sigh of unmistakable relief escaped
 bob no price was too high that would
 give him and zelma freedom he swept the
 dazzling pigeon-blood rubies and the azure
 sapphires into his pocket and smiled the
 captain didnt want and didnt understand
 the colored stones they would give him
 plenty to gain a fresh start that was all
 he wanted

  montozzi walked forward in deep
thought after all he reflected with this
deal in effect he wouldnt have to watch
them during the voyage they would be-
have and not give him any trouble later-
he smiled darkly he knew what he had
to do

chapter x

treachery

 for the two young people there followed
 blissful days during the voyage as the
 water queen skimmed over the wind-
 tossed tropic seas

   bob did not tell zelma of his hard bar-
 gain with montozzi or the price he was
 paying for their liberty he simply told
 her that he had arranged to buy their lib-
 erty for a few precious stones that he had
 for some time nor did he tell her how
 he had happened to come to the island or
 to that part of the world she didnt ask

   she was not sophisticated enough to be
 very curious like miranda on her isle
 she had lived upon norfolk island far re-
 moved from the everyday world all she
 knew was that this young man had saved
 her from a horror which she herself did not
 fully grasp and her heart went out to him

she had read much true but she had
lived as far as all love went as untouched
as any mountain flower the breath of

passing love fancies which dulls the mir-
ror of so many womens souls had never
passed over her

   led both by nature and inclination to
seek the treasures of scholarship she had
lost herself in the immeasurable majesties
of thought she found an all-absorbing
happiness in the myths of heroic ages in
the delicate intricacies of language in the
meditations of great minds the evil in-
separable from all knowledge passed her
unfelt for a young girl can lose herself in
abstract impersonal pursuits far more suc-
cessfully than a youth

  several men had wooed her some with
passion for her beauty was great but a
thousand rejected wooers teach a woman
nothing

   when bob came into her life her first
love entered her heart a whirlwind of feel-
ing transformed the pale narcissus into a
passiflora with a heart of fire she gave
him unstintingly all the warm treasures of
love in her heart as she would have given
him the kingdoms of earth had she had
them

   as for bob who had long lost the ideals
and illusions of boyhood he found again
the happiness of cherished ideals her sub-
tle and potent allure made his standards
inadequate she was his ideal come true-
and more

   she brought again to him the old chival-
ries the pretty sentimental fantasies that he
once associated wtith femininity-the spring-
tide of the year the breath of early flowers
the verses of the old dead poets the sweet
scent of summer rains she brought an
aura of peace and purity patience and pity
sacrifice and sorrow high standards and
sanctity

  he had always pictured a pal and a
sweetheart he was an epicurean who de-
sired to carry into the one passion in his life
the fires of the senses and the coldness of
philosophy

   they spent the days together with a vivid
pleasure finding heaven in each others eyes
love came to them as dreamily as ex-
quisitely as a stirring melody heard over
evening waters

  and with the coming of love zelmas
beauty became clamorous a thing to marvel
out of the coral sea



over montozzi who kept much to him-
self stared at her occasionally with eyes
that smoldered like live coals then he
would shake his head and anile cryptically

  it was the tail-end of a hurricane that
forced a climax the water queen struck
only the side of the typhoon as the ship
began to pitch and roll the girl had looked
at bob with some apprehension later in
the full fury of the storm when the artil-
lery of the heavens rumbled and flashed
glaringly she crept into his arms and he
held her close then for the first time he
kissed her

  the storm was as brief as it was furious
the sun came out again the wet decks
steamed then he told her all his history
and of his arrest and imprisonment she
cooed over him with all a mothers tender-
ness and a sweethearts consolation

  they would be married in hongkong
they decided then theyd go back to the
states where bob would clear his name
he never expected to see paul and ada
again he didnt see how it was possible
he never expected to see the island again
as he intended playing fair and giving mon-
tozzi the correct location of his half of the
treasure

  they planned their future with the en-
thusiasm and wonder and high hopes that
are the heritage of youth and grew silent at
times with the marvel of life

  and the gods of the open sky must have
sat back and laughed for well they knew
the stormy seas that lay ahead

  montozzi watched them occasionally and
grunted he had been friendly during the
voyage toward zelma even somewhat con-
trite bob did not altogether trust the
swarthy italian but there was little he
could do he counted upon montozzis
avarice to insure them safety but he did
not know the crafty brain behind the in-
scrutable eyes

  he was awakened one night by some one
pawing over him he sat up to find his
hands tied montozzi and several kanakas
stood over him the captain grinning like
an evil tomcat

   whats this cried bob  whats the
idea-

  ill tell you mr smart englishman

interjected montozzi  im taking zelma
ashore where shell be safe then you and
i will both go and get the balance of those
stones i dont trust you if youve lied
to me-heaven help you thats all if
not ill bring you back and you can go to
your zelma then thats all-only youll
stay here under guard until i get ready to
sail

   if you try to get away the guard will
shoot- oh no-not to kill-just to
wound youre valuable to me until i get
the balance of the stones but -he leered
meaningly- if youre a wise young man
you wont risk too many wounds-under-
stand it wouldnt be nice to have your
arms and legs shot-pierced would it

  bob made a terrific effort to break the
cords that held him but a useless one he
finally lay exhausted while montozzi
laughed

   stop it and be sensible he suggested
 youll simply have to play this game my
way so make up your mind to it wtell
be on our way again in a week or so

  he gave the kanaka who was to guard
bob some instructions in a strange tongue
and handed him an old-fashioned large-
calibered pistol the kanaka nodded un-
derstandingly then montozzi left

  bob managed to get his face near the
port he made out a palm-fringed shore in
the bright moonlight he heard some one
say  macao  then the kanaka motioned
him away from the window

chapter xi

moy songs prisoner

zelma was awakened by montozzis
knock upon her cabin door

 get up he called  and dress
were in port and im taking you and bob
ashore while its dark-for good reasons
bob thinks it best

  she dressed swiftly her heart aflame with
excitement no shadow of suspicion
dawned upon her until she opened the door
and montozzi and two kanakas stepped in-
side one guarding the door the other
seized her hands and tied them behind her
while montozzi held her


argosy-allstory weekly

    sit down he said when she was tied
 bewildered her eyes shining like rain-
 washed stars the girl obeyed

    im taking you ashore montozzi con-
 tinued evenly his face contorted with a
 huge amazement   and youre going to
 moy song-

   the girl cried out as if struck a physi-
 cal blow

    noise wont help you observed mon-
 tozzi  better not attempt it or ill muz-
 zle you besides its three in the morning
 and were a mile from shore now my
 friend im going to collect for you from
 moy song as i originally intended-and
 youll find hes not quite as easy as i was 
 you-infamous beast said zalma
 quietly with unutterable scorn in her voice
 and eyes  you-you traitor ill tell
 moy song everything-even a chinaman
 cant be as contemptible-

   that will be about all interjected
 montozzi in a dangerous voice  be care-
 ful what you say as for telling moy song
 youll not say a word except that you had
 a very pleasant trip and youll mention
 nothing at all that happened-not even a
 word about bob-or ill slit your lovers
 throat the minute you do understand

    your father died as i told you but
 youll ask for him when you see moy song
 -you know nothing understand youre
 no fool-you know what i expect of you
 if you love bob do as i instruct and ill
 tum him loose at the end of our cruise
 now get up im going to remove the
 cords and well get started

   her brain reeling weighed down by a
 new terror the girl obeyed bobs life was
 dearer to her than her own she would
 have gladly laid down her life that he might
 live

   they rowed far to the left of the bay
 where the circle of lights around the bund
 ended by devious dark streets she was
 finally ushered into a darker house whence
 at length she was led into a room brilliant
 with electric light

   it was a richly furnished room with
 oriental hangings and rugs vases and curios
 teakwood furniture inlaid with mother-of-
 pearl and odd pictures when her eyes
 grew to its brilliance she saw a crafty-look-

 ing chinaman of indefinite age regarding
 her the scrutiny contained so much of
 suppressed veiled cruelty and sensualism
 that the girl dropped her eyes

   her clean unerring instinct instantly told
her that this bland chinaman was far more
to be dreaded than the openly rough and
piratical montozzi she shuddered

  montozzi came forward and smiled

   this is captain forsythes daughter
zelma he said to moy song by way of
introduction  we just arrived

   so replied moy song coming closer
and eying her in a manner that somehow
seemed to be an invasion upon her privacy
the girls blood chilled

   my-father she murmured mindful
of bob for montozzis eyes were upon her
meaningly every drop of blood had faded
from her lips and cheeks

   ah yes purred moy song  he has
gone to fusan for a cargo of furs he will
be back in a few weeks and you shall see
him in the meanwhile it is his wish that
you wait for him here-as my guest have
you had a nice trip

  she nodded

  so very good now you must be
tired best go to your room and rest he
clapped his hands and a chinese servant
came to the door moy song gave him an
order and accompanied zelma as she walked
from the room the slender supple form
of the girl dropped like a bruised lily be-
tween the shambling masculine figures on
each side of her

  the chinese servant opened the door of
a room and zelma entered the others re-
mained outside it was a finely furnished
chamber in exquisite taste but the girl
shuddered and stood looking around in un-
certainty

  moy song smiled slightly

   if you wish anything he said  clap
your hands for the servant we shall talk
in the morning you must be tired good
night

  he closed the door the girl flew to it
like a freshly caged leopard it was locked
tight examining the windows she found
great iron shutters over them ventilation
came through an iron grate in the high
ceiling
out of the coral sea



  helpless the word came to her as she
looked about she gasped audibly after
all she was but a child and this was her
first experience and contact with the outside
world the bands of pain at her heart
pressed a great sob to her throat and she
wept bitterly

  thereafter she sat day after day doing
nothing or pacing the room with the fever-
ish impetuosity of some wild forest thing
deprived of liberty for the first time in
her life her hours were empty came with-
out welcome departed without use here-
tofore the full rich studious days had al-
ways seemed so short now the hours
dragged with bitter pangs and revolting
fears

  as for moy song he motioned montozzi
back into the gorgeous study and poured a
glass of wine for both of them they se-
lected cigars drank and sat down

  moy song opened a drawer of his huge
teakwood desk and counted out some bank
notes montozzis eyes sparkled with greed

   there  said moy song  is that
right

  montozzi nodded counted the notes and
shoved them into his pocket all things
seemed to be coming his way he was at
peace with all the world and highly in love
with his own cunning

    had a fine trip he was saying  only
stopped once-to get some fresh water
had a leak in our casks young lady en-
joyed it very much wonderful looking
girl song isnt she

  the chinamans inscrutable eyes rested
upon him for a brief moment

   very he answered quietly  much
more so than her photograph led me to ex-
pect

   montozzi laughed a curious light in his
eyes he had his own little plans of which
moy song was not aware hed show the
chinaman a thing or two about real craft
when the time came

  they drank more wine then montozzi
became a bit noisy moy song filled still
another glass of wine as he held it his
great green-jade ring opened and a tiny
amount of powder fell into the glass this
he pressed upon montozzi and took a glass
himself

  both drank both were gay montozzi
however suddenly sagged in his seat and
slipped to the floor

  with no undue hurry moy song searched
the unconscious man methodically confis-
cated the money he had just paid out
dropped all the contents into his desk
drawer and then turned the captain over
with an elegantly shod foot

   quite dead he murmured calmly
 the pollen of the death flower has lost
none of its potency what a gross pig he
was i wonder what happened on the
trip the girl was frightened to death
ill question the mate later-when he least
expects it something is wrong this pig
knew too much anyway

  he clapped his hands sharply

  two furtive chinamen stepped seeming-
ly out of the wall

  moy song pointed to montozzi issued a
low order and raised his eyebrows with a
faint smile the two grinned understand-
ingly lifted the great body took it through
the panel in the wall and disappeared
that was the last the world ever saw of
captain montozzi

   moy song lit a fresh cigarette and walked
toward zelmas door here he listened in-
tently for a moment then made a sign to
the chinaman who sat there apparently
watching the servant nodded

  moy song let himself through several
doors and a long hall into another part of
the house here he knocked upon still an-
other door and entered

  the white lily clad in silken coat and
trousers sat by the open window smoking
she glanced at him briefly then stared out
at the sky

   not sleeping he queried

   no she answered shortly  i cant
sleep

  he eyed her comprehensively noted the
dark circles under her eyes her fading
beauty moys eyebrows lifted in derisive
contempt he pulled a roll of bills from
his pocket and threw them in her lap

   in a few days he said softly  you
will go there is the money later i shall
get a divorce i could be less kind-but
i choose to do this

    where shall i go she asked in a dead


argosy-allstory weekly

apathetic voice  there is no place for me
now my own kind turn away from me-
your kind hate me there is only one thing
left open to me-do you want to drive me
to that im your wife moy please re-
member and i have been good and true and
faithful- her voice broke pitiously

  again moy raised his eyebrows and
shrugged his shoulders

   wherever you wish he answered  i
am not interested back to england would
be best i believe-that would be my-ah-
suggestion

  he inclined his head in slight courtesy
and went out closing the door behind him

  in his own studj again he took from a
dark closet a wicker basket the contents of
which hissed and writhed moy song
smiled through a glass partition he saw
the two cobras within their ugly triangu-
lar flat heads struck repeatedly at the glass
in impotent fury

   if she does not leave soon he mur-
mured to himself  these little pets may
find their way to her room i cannot be
responsible if she chooses to keep such
strange pets it will be her own fault
everybody knows her fondness for snakes
he smiled as he put the basket away
again into the closet then his mood
changed his eyes lit up with a luster akin
to the eyes of the cobras

   that girl he mused  knows already
that she cannot leave here something hap-
pened on the voyage ill find out in a
short while-not too soon ill give them
plenty of time

   as the days passed he laid his plans care-
fully methodically with a cold logical in-
genuity that took count of all contingencies

  he spoke to zelma every day but she
told him nothing and affected surprise at
mention of any unpleasantness during the
voyage she knew nothing of course of
montozzis end and was fearful of saying
anything that would cause the captain to
react upon bob

  moy was puzzled but he smiled always
patience he thought it would all unravel

  once or twice zelma had asked to leave
the house but the suave chinese watcher
shook his head moy told her the city was
a rough one and he could not allow her to

venture out when her father came back he
would take her out in the meanwhile he
moy was responsible for her did she un-
derstand yes

  she did she understood that she was a
prisoner and lived in a perpetual state of
fear and apprehension what little sleep
came to her was haunted always by fears of
unutterable violences she grew pale and
worn and desperate at times she would
have ended her life had there been any
means at all present but there were none
moy song was too clever for that

chapter xii

a young man with a hobby

the kanaka who guarded bob had a
sense of duty not usually possessed by
natives he watched bob as closely
and minutely as if his life depended on it
bob frequently thought that perhaps it did
knowing montozzis code of ethics

  for two days and two nights he was a
prey to the most torturing thoughts a man
can have-the girl he loved better than
life was helpless in the power of unscrupu-
lous hands that would hesitate at no dese-
cration or violence and he could do noth-
ing to help her

   he grew insensible to all his surroundings
to everything except her peril countless
terrors swept across his mind half sharp-
ened half dulled by the deadly pain that
grew out of his helplessness at times his
anguish drove him to the outskirts of in-
sanity he ate little or nothing of the food
offered him

  on the third day he became somewhat
calmer he resolved to eat to keep his
strength and sanity and to watch for an
opportunity he reflected savagely that it
would never be too late for one thing-ven-
geance that he would have if zelma was
harmed by as much as a verbal insult he
became quiet and apparently resigned it
brought a grin from the kanaka to see
his sudden quiescence

  by the fourth day the kanaka had re-
laxed his vigilance considerably and bob
began to look about whenever the kana-
ka left the room bob searched it feverishly
out of the

for some means to cut the stout hemp that
bound his wrists and ankles but there was
nothing at length laying in his bunk his
hands restless behind him he discovered
down deep below the blankets and mat-
tress the protruding head of a nail

  when the kanaka left to get his lunch
locking the door after him bob worked
feverishly but to no avail the cord was
stiff and strong but he did succeed in cut-
ting his wrist that wouldnt do it might
be noticed

  after feeding him the kanaka stood out-
side the door talking to one of his kind
bob went to work again the chances were
slim but it was a chance all through the
afternoon he tugged and pulled and feigned
sleep when the kanaka looked in on him
now and then by evening he had severed
several strands his heart was racing with
fresh hope again

   after his slight dinner he lay down in his
bunk again drawing a grunt of approval
from the kanaka by his apparent resigna-
tion to an inevitable situation it was near-
ly eleven oclock when the last strand fell
apart for he had to work cautiously

   feeling his hands free he untied his feet
and stretched to take the stiffness out of his
joints then he waited for the kanaka to
return

    the kanaka slept in the same cabin
  about eleven oclock he became sleepy and
  decided to turn in he never knew what
  struck him it was a good dean straight-
  from-the-shoulder knockout he went limp
  without a sound

     bob tied him securely took his pistol and
   a knife and stepped out of the cabin

    stealing forward he saw the portuguese
  mate coming toward him it would have
  been a simple thing to shoot the man but
  noise meant discovery he was standing in
  the shadow of montozzis cabin he tried
  the door it was open he slipped into the
  dark cabin and waited pulses hammering

    the mate however was also bound for
    the captains cabin he swung in the door
    bob staying behind it and lit the hanging
    lamp then in a nervous wary manner
    he began searching drawers and the cap-
    tains clothes closet he even searched the
    pockets of the dothes

coral sea	

all at once he glanced around fearfully
the door was open he went to close it
the next instant a hard list caught him
flush on the jaw and he collapsed as one
dead

with the tablecloth bob bound him
bending him in a semicircle as he tried to
make both ends meet behind a sardonic
grin appeared upon bobs face his lips
puckered with his desire for aimless whis-
tling but he checked it

one night during the voyage he had ac-
cidentally witnessed montozzi in the act of
concealing the diamonds he had given him
bob had no doubt that this was what the
mate was searching for and since he didnt
know where they were it looked as if he
had intended stealing them from montozzi

bob blew out the lantern and taking off
the bottom that held the oil reservoir
dumped the oil and the diamonds into his
hand pocketing his property once more
he guardedly opened the door and peered
out not a soul was in sight the night
was fairly bright and the shore looked
about a mile away

taking off his shoes bob tied them to his
waist and with the quietness of an otter
slid into the water pie swam with swift
ease grimly he reflected that this was his
third escape by water it was becoming an
unpleasant habit

  nearly an hour later he landed far to the
left of the city and let his clothes dry while
he dozed in the jungle growth and planned
his course in the morning

  when the city awoke he strolled through
the poorer quarters near the bay he looked
like a beachcomber a white tramp not
much attention was paid him there were
scores like him on the water front of macao

at length he saw what he wras looking
for-the shop of a chinese gem merchant

  with the piratical-looking owner bob
finally struck a bargain for two of the sap-
phires he had to practically give them
away but he couldnt help it the china-
man on the other hand positively believed
that the white beachcomber had stolen
them but they were marvelous gems and
would mean a fortune to him when resold
he therefore asked no questions and finally
gave bob a sizable roll of bills

   after this bob worked swiftly and with
 characteristic snap and speed he bought
 new clothes shed the old ones and took a
 ricksha to the railroad station here he lin-
 gered a few minutes mixed with the people
 and later saw a train pull in from canton
 again he engaged a ricksha and told the na-
 tive to bring him to the best hotel then
 he lay back his new bag between his feet

   it was bobs belief that no one would
 think of looking for him at the best hotel
 he looked like a prosperous tourist at the
 hotel he registered as  john arthur ham-
 by san francisco california u s a
 then he asked the clerk if there were any
 drafts awaiting him

   the clerk sorrowfully and with respect
 informed him that there were no drafts or
 letters with an exclamation of impatience
 and a petulant frown bob walked out into
 the street

   here he eyed the queer mixture of ori-
 ental and european life trolley cars that
 ran side by side with rickshas the streets
 that looked like any small city the stone
 buildings quite up to date through all
 the evidences of modern civilization pooped
 the oriental throngs the rice-and-honey
 stands on the bund the tropical foliage the
 strange smells and mixture of tongues con-
 trasted greatly with the orderly sidewalks

   finally he saw what he was looking for-
 a big english bank here he asked for
 the president and was soon talking to that
 curious individual a stolid englishman
 courteous dignified

    its this way explained bob briskly
 with the quiet importance of a man of af-
 fairs  im john arthur hamby of san
 francisco im traveling for pleasure and
 looking for a certain business opportunity
 to open up on palawan island i was to
 find some large drafts here at your bank
 or at the hotel but they havent arrived as
 yet as speed is necessary to the success
 of the venture i need money now will
 you loan on good security

   the banker thawed out at once he saw
 fat fees a remunerative client all in one bat
 of the eye would he certainly what
 was the security

 i am a lover and collector of precious
gems sir answered bob indirectly  i

always have some of my-ah-pets with
me a hobby sir

  the banker nodded sympathetically
evidently a very rich young man he
thought with expensive hobbies

   bob took four of the great diamonds from
his pocket inwardly his blood was seeth-
ing outwardly he was a wealthy young
man cool collected

   will-will you loan ten thousand
pounds on these until my drafts arrive
theyre worth much more

  the bankers eyes stood out as he fin-
gered the wonderful gems he gasped

   would you allow me-i know nothing
of these things sir-allow me to have them
inspected and valued-

  certainly - certainly agreed bob
heartily  send some one you trust to
your local authority or jeweler with them
ill wait-i have some other business in
mind that id like to discuss with you

    my son sir agreed the now very much
impressed banker  ill send my son
while the son was gone bob stated that
he wanted to buy a large yacht the bank-
er beamed he had just what bob wanted
his own yacht right down in the harbor
all fitted with mahogany a powerful auxil-
iary engine great cruising radius and fast
under sail she was in tiptop order-he al-
ways kept her so-but he couldnt afford
to run her-she was too expensive-not so
very you understand but for him- she
had cost five thousand pounds he would be
willing to sell her for four thousand pounds

  bob agreed to look and to buy if the
boat suited him the banker became effu-
sive now truly the gods were kind to him
this morning

  when the son returned he talked in pri-
vate with his father for a few minutes the
result was that a very respectful banker ad-
vanced bob ten thousand pounds on the
stones after which bob looked at the boat
found it ideal bought it and had the papers
made out to his new name then he had
lunch with the banker at a fashionable eng-
lish club

  suddenly he had become a man of affairs
with plenty of money and a splendid yacht
of his own truly money is a great power
he smiled bitterly at his thoughts
out of the coral sea



  in a booking office on the bund he asked
the superintendent to get him a crew to-
gether at once while he was talking he
noted a huge young man with a pinched
humorous face who was regarding him from
a chair near the window something about
the man attracted bob he turned to him

   looking for a berth he asked

  the young giant saluted

   i am sir he replied  havent had
one for some time-im flat as a raindrop on
a stone pavement

   stranded

   completely sir

   whats your rating

   first mate-with the blue star line
sir

   american

   every damned inch 

  bob laughed

  li do you think youre qualified to com-
  mand a private vessel and stay out a year
  or more at a time-if necessary

  the giant scented a brother adventurer
  his eyes brightened

   for a berth like that he said  id
  lie willing to increase my schedule and kill
  two chinamen a day-heaven knows this
  town can stand it

  then more soberly  the superintend-
  ent has my rating and qualifications sir

    bob turned to the superintendent who
  stated that the mans ability was up to the
  mark for the berth

      all right decided bob swiftly turning
  to the big fellow  heres some money in
  advance my ship is the morning star
  shes anchored in the bay now get a crew
  --many as you think necessary-white men
  tank her up with gas look her over and get
  her ready to go as soon as possible when
  youre ready see me at the grand hotel
  now lets sign up

     the new captain and the new owner left
  the office together

      you know the authorities in this port
  asked bob

      i do sir answered the captain whose
  name was martin otoole

   well answered bob secretly pleased
   heres some more money to buy provisions
  -plenty of them - and to grease their
  palms get the necessary papers and give

minutes notice and stay out indefinitely-
and have everything on board for any-
contingency

yes sir

 youve a lot of work to do and so have i
otoole watched bob roll away in a
ricksha a pleased grin upon his homely face
his fingers caressed the big roll of bills

 he trusted me  he thought  me for
him some rip-snortin go-getter son-of-a-
gun well first to get acquainted with a
meal again-im as hollow as a drum
then to work im going to like him-
thats the kind of an owner to have and
if he should happen to want the moon to
play with damme if i dont go get it for
him

that afternoon bob found out that moy
song was the owner of the largest gambling
house in macao he went around the
bund found the place and looked it over
bitterly he reflected that he could not call
in the local authorities to help him being
an escaped prisoner himself he did not know
at what moment he might be apprehended

  the place looked ominous many na-
tives thronged in and out he wondered
if zelma was somewhere inside there was
only one way to find out-search the place
but how

   as he strolled along mixing with the
conglomerate frequenters of the district he
suddenly felt a hand clutch him and he
whirled to face-paul

   an exclamation of incredulous amaze-
ment escaped bob the next instant paul
had drawn him inside and whispered

 not a word here come with me
although hardly able to control his curi-
osity he went with paul in silence in si-
lence too he watched as paul led him to
his own hotel entered the lift and took him


argosy-allstory weekly

   to a room and here ada flew into his
   arms with a cry of joy and kissed him full
   upon the lips

     it required several minutes for them to
   get over the wonder of their meeting sev-
   eral more for bob to tell of his voyage and
   its conclusion then he demanded their
   story paul gave it

      after we left you he said in a low
   tone  we altered our course and next day
   came to another small island there we
   buried our half of the vases taking only a
   few stones with us ada took the latitude
   and longitude-its about a hundred miles
   from where you left yours then we deter-
   mined to go to macao to help you-if you
   ever reached the place

      the hawk was fast so we made hong-
   kong in good time but we were worried
   about explanations customs officials et
   cetera also they might be watching for
   the hawk

       so we ran her on a rock outside the har-
   bor and yelled for help-although we had
   the tender well the hawk went down
   with everything except our stones then
   we were towed in by a passing fisherman

    we explained that we were an american
 couple circling the globe in our boat they
 expect that from you americans and
 thought nothing of it everybody was kind
 to us and sorry that we had lost our craft
 as everything was lost aboard our boat we
 werent bothered by the customs or any one
 else

    i sold two stones to a chinese jeweler
 obtained some money and clothes and came
 on here yesterday to see what we could
 do for you if any-

    i see interjected bob eying the ex-
 cited paul  no thought of the danger
 you ran eh

   paul sniffed

    dont be an ass he interrupted casu-
 ally though he squeezed bobs hand adas
 eyes were wet  no one would think of
 looking for us here-in a first-class hotel-
 a couple of thousand miles away i besides
 in these clothes with no beard speaking
 english why-

    well said bob presently when they
 had exchanged further details  i think
 shes in that house well have to play a

lone hand heres the plan he swiftly
outlined the details

   because paul had never been seen by
montozzi or any one else connected with
the water queen he spent half the night
gambling in moy songs place he lost
considerable money to the house in the
meanwhile he made a rapid survey of the
plans of the house as far as he could see
his losses and the cheery way in which he 
took them caused the croupiers to christen
him the  mad englishman

   at last he ran out of money which only
caused him to laugh and to promise that
he was coming back on the morrow for his
revenge moy song in person cordially
invited him to come and promised him sat-
isfaction

   at noon the next day captain otoole re-
ported to bob that everything was ready

   and by that i mean everything sir
reiterated the sharp-eyed irish-american

 we can sail at five minutes notice

    good  said bob keep her that way
he was introduced to paul and ada and
told that they would be guests

   they spent the afternoon upon the morn-
ing star exploring and becoming familiar
with her she was a finely built yacht
stanch seaworthy and everything else the
most fastidious seaman could want

if the gods are kind- thought bob
looking her over the sentence remained
unfinished it lay in the lap of the gods

it was an afternoon of torture to him
though he was glad to be with his friends
again at length the evening came and they
discussed their plans again ada was to
stay on board and wait

after a hasty meal they sat on deck
silent apprehensive worried the air
seemed electric with portent it finally dis-
turbed the highly susceptible captain
otoole but pleasantly then that clair-
voyant seaman could stand it no longer he
walked aft and saluting stood befoi bob

 well asked bob nervously

 im thinkin sir otoole answered

 that by the looks o things something is in
the air you want to sail at five minutes
notice well if its anything like a scrap
with those pigtails youve on your mind
could i ask you to favor me and include
out of the coral sea



me i owe them a few wallops myself
im not trying to butt in sir but im trying
to tell you that you can count on me

  bob eyed him for a space in silence

   i wonder-how far

   to the hilt sir 

  something about the big fellow inspired
bob with confidence there was no mis-
taking his sincerity it stuck out all over
him in gobs

   suppose continued bob  i were to
tell you that i wanted you and paul to go
to a notorious and influential chinese gam-
bling house to-night and that there might
be a dangerous row-would you see mr
paul through

   would i chuckled the giant  would
i did you get my name correctly sir
just allow me to hit out at any of em

a free-for-all is it my god man dont
leave me here i havent had any real
amusement for months

  paul laughed and bob smiled

  all right decided bob suddenly

 go and get your coat youll go with
  paul hell tell you just what to do-do
  just that nothing more nothing-i dont
  suppose youll do less

      not likely sir answered otoole de-
  parting for his coat

      dieu whispered paul  hes a whirl-
  wind and it will help us wonderfully to get
  our effect

    at about ten oclock that night paul
  and otoole strolled into moy songs gam-
  gling house and dance hall fair kanaka
  girls with beflowered hair and white dresses
  hung upon the arms of some of the men
  or flitted about the crowd like ghosts in the
  rembrantesque shadows huge coconut-
  oil lamps illumined the scene none too well
  but picturesquely there were also some
  malay girls chinese in baggy clothes
  some sailors from an italian cruiser and
  some from a brazilian man-of-war portu-
  guese german traders natives of different
  hues-the usual habitues of the water front
  saloon and dance hall

    paul was hailed by the roulette dealer
  and moy song himself made him welcome
  to the establishment for two hours paul
  played every game seconded by otoole

    at midnight when the activities of the

place were all at their height when the
dancing became a bit wilder and clumsier
and the barkeeper worked faster paul and
otoole began to plunge upon the roulette
wheel

  at first both lost steadily but they
laughed and played on with a reckless dis-
regard for money that endeared them to
moy songs heart then paul began to
win he won so constantly and the sums
were so large that moy song became appre-
hensive and took the wheel himself

  big sums were changing hands therefore
the whole roomful of people began to crowd
around to see the fun and it became
faster and faster moy song steadily losing

  paul placed his wagers recklessly and
otoole even more so yet both men won
constantly the fickle goddess of fortune
was crowning their efforts well moy
songs smile began to go

chapter xiii

a surprise for moy song

moy songs wife the white lily
had gone from one extreme of emo-
tion to another from lethargic re-
sentment to hot bitter hatred

  she knew moy song she had been
ordered out it had been suggested that she
go back to england if she didnt comply
with the suggestion-something would hap-
pen to her she shuddered she knew
what it would be-death in one form or
another such death as could never be con-
nected with the urbane moy song

a passionate revolt shook her a vitrolic
hatred entered her heart to be turned out
now for a new favorite after all her sacri-
fices the obloquy she had been subjected
to yet she knew that moys decisions
were as inexorable as death she would
have to go or-be carried out

    seething with rage she began to dress
  in european clothes when her toilet was
  complete she made her way to moys rooms
  ordinarily she wouldnt have dared to do
  this but she was now beside herself

    a silent chinese servant barred her way
  but she thrust him aside he raised his
  eyebrows and submitted after all she was


argosy-allstory weekly

     moys wife it was his business if he had
   chosen to marry a spitting cat of a white
   woman

     before a door of moys suite she found
   another chinese servant sitting from the
   interior she heard a womans sob and in a
   flash guessed that moys new favorite was a
   prisoner within she thought of inform-
   ing the authorities but quickly put it
   aside moy was all-powerful

    the chinese servant was immutable
  under threat or entreaty he would not al-
  low her to look into the room when she
  attempted force he roughly pushed her
  aside

     stung with a new sense of her unimpor-
   tance in this queer oriental household she
   went to moys own room there she seat-
   ed herself before his great teakwood desk
   lit a cigarette and gave vent to her whirl-
   ing thoughts knowing moy song she also
   knew that her presence would soon be ter-
   minated if she didnt leave of her own
   will

     she looked around at the luxurious room
   furnished with a sybarites taste from a
   closet the door of which was slightly open
   she detected a slight hissing that stopped
   the flying shuttle of her thoughts

   investigation disclosed two hooded cobras
 in a wicker basket a caustic smile came
 to her lips that was primal and savage

   she took the basket to the light the
ugly reptiles were striking against the glass
she began a tuneless whisper with her lips
a side-to-side swaying with her head a
glassy stare crept into her eyes the pupils
dilated the cobras ceased to strike and
began to sway in mesmeric fascination

   still whispering and swaying she at
length opened the basket and took the now
harmless cobras out she opened the large
drawer of moys teakwood desk and laid
them there coiling their ugly flat heads
laid upon their folds the beady eyes
watched her unblinkjngly as she slowly
closed the drawer

   a startling change came over her she
swayed as if about to faint then with
more control she put the basket back in the
doset and tapped the desk drawer a vig-
orous thrashing about and a hiss answered
her

   she made her way from the room quietly
 walked out of the house unmolested by any
 one and then stood in the street a moment
 the gambling hall was in its usual uproar
 a big game must be going on she smiled
 and walked away

   at the railroad station she lowered a
 heavy veil over her face bought a ticket
 to hongkong and in a stupor of acute suf-
 fering and heart-break waited for her train

           chapter xiv

              over the roofs

 bob spent two hours reconnoitering
 around the house of moy song it
 was a large structure the entire ground
 floor of which contained the gambling and
 dance hall also the bar and the little tables
 all around above many windows attested
 the number of rooms and all were dark
 some of the rear windows had great iron
 shutters over them on the front was the
 big sign  gambling house as required
 by law

    bob strolled along the water front only
  vaguely conscious of the exotic beauty of
  the tropical night a febrile excitement
  blinded him to all exteriors warm odors
  came across the star-shot waters of the bay
  mixed odors but of tropical essence fran-
  gipanni bloom reek of coral trash the
  scent from women walking past him sil-
  houetted figures in the blue darkness

    toward midnight he finally decided that
  the only chance of gaining an entrance un-
  observed was from the roof the houses
  on either side were the same height-dark
  evil-looking structures whose basements
  emitted dank noisome odors he made
  his way to the rear of the buildings and
  found a tree that came near one of them
  not a soul was in sight in this backwater
  of the alleys he climbed the tree slowly
  and swung to the roof then he tiptoed to
  moy songs house over the roofs

there was a trapdoor on moy songs
roof that led into the house but it was
fastened securely fro-m the inside he could
not budge it with all his strength applied
next he investigated a v-shaped affair that
seemed to be a ventilator a faint glimmer
out of the coral sea



of light showed from it with his heavy
knife he unfastened one end and by sheer
strength slowly and without noise bent
the heavy iron-braced zinc backward it
disclosed an iron grille ventilator and a
lighted elegantly furnished bedroom and
looking up into his face with wide startled
eyes was-zelma

   he saw the amazement the agony of rec-
ognition the longing love she unconsciously-
revealed he motioned hastily to her not
to make any sound though he thought the
wild beating of his own heart would wake
the city

   the grille was about two feet square and
 screwed down from the roof he set to
 work and in ten minutes lifted it from its
 position then he unwound a coil of rope
 from his waist and making a loop lowered
 it to her she placed it under her arms
 and grasped it tightly above laboriously
 he raised her through the grating

   hardly had she gained the roof when
the door of the room opened and the chi-
nese watcher peered in attracted by some
slight noise they had made a limpid
monosyllabic escaped him when he saw
that the room was empty a glance at the
windows assured him that they were tight
he ran into the room and saw the forced
ventilator grating

   bob acted quickly there was no other
way and he had to give the signal agreed
upon anyway his automatic cracked and
the chinaman crumpled clutching his knee
the next shot splintered the lantern that
illuminated the room then he took zel-
mas hand and guided her across the roofs
he heard a pandemonium of noise come
from moy songs establishment breaking
glass curses shrieks and the hoarse yells
of struggling men mingling with the lyric
terror of the kanaka girls

    over the roofs he said under his
breath refastening the rope under zelmas
arms

   she made no answer but closed her eyes
 as he helped her lower herself over the
 edge bob braced his shoulder against a
 chimney and lowered her slowly when
 the rope ceased to drag he dropped it over
 the roof and sprang into the tree he
 came down so fast his hands burned once

upon the ground he glanced about still
no one near he unfastened the rope and
holding her hand they raced away

chapter xv

the cobra strikes

in the gambling house paul had played
recklessly-he wanted to lose instead
he won-won so consistently that moy
song secretly worried but outwardly calm
insisted on staying at the wheel in person
the crowd had drawn close to see these
besiegers of fortune throw huge sums into
her lap as all watched absorbed a sud-
den shot rang out then another almost
in the same instant captain otoole sprang
forward and shouted in his shrill and clear
voice

   hes cheating paul i saw the chi-
naman cheat its a come-on game

  moy turned green the crowd hedged
him about and he in common with the
others hardly knew which to pay attention
to first-the accusation or the shots from
above

  in a twinkling however it was decided
by paul who threw the roulette wheel over
with a violent push otoole picked up a
chair and went for moy in another in-
stant the uproar began the lights went
out otoole flung chair after chair into
the struggling group of men occasionally
laying out one with his hamlike fist

  boy he kept whispering over and
over again to himself as his arms flew
 isnt this a peach of a scrap then
all at once he heard his name called and
he withdrew to a window where he found
paul together they went through and
raced away down the quiet streets

  moy song was only startled for a mo-
ment battered about he crawled in the
darkness to a panel in the wall which
opened to his touch upon a stairway a
conviction that the shots above and the
instantaneous eruption below were related
began to glimmer in his crafty brain then
he thought of the white lily-perhaps
those shots-a jealous woman at any
rate something was wrong it looked as
if it might be an attempt to rescue the


argosy-allstory weekly

girl he had set all the strength of his evil
heart and passions upon

  in his own study he opened his desk
drawer to obtain a pistol he kept there
something bit his hand a hot fire surged
through his veins startled out of every
vestige of his usual composure he saw to
his horror that it was a hooded cobra he
cried and shrieked and staggered about but
could not make his voice heard above the
uproar that raged below

  finally he collapsed the cobra still hang-
ing on when the police investigated a
bit later they found him he was dead
and the cobra was coiled upon his chest
watching the horrified spectators wickedly

chapter xvi

safe in port

bob and zelma sped through the
streets until they came to the more
respectable sections then the girl
breathless halted they were back on the
bund now looking over the waters of the
bay it was late there were only a few
stragglers in sight

  zelma was breathing hard and leaned
against his shoulder a faint sweetness
came to him it seemed to cling about her
like an insidious narcotic it spread in his
veins they were in thick shadows and
no one was near enough to see he took
her in his arms and kissed her her lips
cool unresponsive at first warmed to his
kisses and clung to his lips with a child-
sweet tenderness that left him quite out of
his head

   will you marry me zelma he whis-
pered  now-to-night

  if-if-you want me to she an-
swered her low musical voice making a
joyous song of the english words

  they found the american consul that
night-woke him up out of a sound sleep
in fact-and were married the consuls
servants acting as witnesses the consul
was curious he asked questions bob
naturally had given his own name and
finally because the consul had kindly eyes
and a deeply lined face that was a diploma
of the university of life bob told him his

entire story and zelma listened and held
on to his hand

  the consul hemmed and hawed and once
he blinked his eyes suspiciously

   i have a bad memory he said at
length when bob concluded  i dont re-
member a thing you told me and i never
heard of you or what you have told me
before so you and your wife rest a while
and ill drive you over so you can board
your ship i have an american flivver
he patted bobs shoulder looked at zelma
and left them alone he was not so old
but what the girls unusual beauty thrilled
him an old bachelor by choice he yet
sighed once or twice

  while a servant went after his machine
he lit a cigar and looked over some news-
papers he was suddenly lonely for his
own kind his own country and he wanted
to see pretty girls again-white girls-like
zelma for instance-not the brown kana-
kas or malays the back copies of his
papers had some photographs of just what
he wanted to see they were on a califor-
nia beach bathing

  he left bob and zelma alone to look
wistfully back over the newspapers until he
heard the machine sputtering in the street
then he drove them to their point of em-
barkation as he shook hands with bob
he handed him a large envelope  a little
wedding present he explained  theres
only one stipulation dont open it until
youre miles to sea

  a few minutes later bob and zelma
boarded the morning star and found paul
ada and otoole anxiously awaiting them
there was a quiet though none the less
joyous reunion

  bob told of his adventure while paul
and otoole laughed over theirs in the
meanwhile the morning star under engine
power was creeping out of the dark harbor
the mate at the wheel

   lord breathed otoole ecstatically
 but it was a peach of a row never was
in a finer thing in my life sir i think
my chinese score is about even now
where are we bound sir

  a consultation resulted in the production
of two locations given in latitude and
longitude
out of the coral sea



   make both those islands instructed
bob  well go ashore on each for a half
day then you can sail-well ill give you
further instructions later

   aye sir

  still later bob bethinking himself of the
consuls wedding present opened the big
envelope it contained a newspaper clip-
ping his own name caught his eye he
read it

  it stated that the jeweler bedsow had
recovered and had failed to identify bobs
picture as one of his assailants the three
actual bandits had been caught and identi-
fied by him

  the police investigation disclosed his sen-
sational escape his arrest in france and
his escape from noumea an official of the
french prison system gave it as his opin-
ion that both men had been the victims of
sharks

  it was a good story and the  sob-
sisters  cried over it and everybody said

 sacrifice

 when grief comes close to you-

  so close that you can see the hue-
 of his cruel eyes-

 when you can feel his hands
 white and strong as iron bands
 stifling your cries-

 while death bends close above
 the one you dearly love-

 how dark the hour

 you pray with strangled breath

  pass on pass on oh death

 pluck not this flowr

 this one who is a part
 of my own beating heart

 this one who loves to live

 who loves to take and give
 all that makes life so sweet

 see death here at thy feet
 i kneel a hostage-nay

 i will go all the way-

 let him live and ill not dread
 thy touch-take me instead

chapter iv

the constant shadow

you here still geoff dr hood
emerged from the library to en-
counter the stone mason descend-
ing the stairs with a trowel which he
promptly stuck in his pocket  wrhat on
earth were you doing up there with that
thing

 soundin the railin i put up round
the gallery for flaws you told me to stay
doc and mis cayley said i wasnt to work
on the terrace and the district attorneys
feller give orders that nobody was to leave
the house geoffs tone was as matter-of-
fact as ever  reckoned id put in my
time some ways

this story began in the argosy-allstory weekly for november 

       	 a

   h-m the doctor observed so
 youve met the detective from the county
 seat youre pretty sharp yourself geoff
 what do you think of him

    seems to me i had the wrong idee o
 detectives geoff shook his head  kind-
 er thought they went round quiet and found
 out what they could without blowin no
 horn to advertise who they was and what
 they was there for shouldnt be sprised
 if he made himself real busy for a day or
 two but i hope he lets my concrete mixer
 and tools alone whats he doin now

    outside examining all the doors and
 windows to see if any of them were forced
 during the night

   there was amused contempt in the doc-
 tors tone
above suspicion



   he dont take any stock in the fact that
the terrace doors were wide open within a
dozen feet of where the body was found
 still somebody would have had to walk
across the loose sand on the floor from the
doors o the terrace to the bench and from
all i heard tell mr benkard set facin em
geoff spoke meditatively as though to
himself and his companion watched him
with a shrewd attentive light in his eyes

   howd he git hit on the back o the
head then unless the feller that did it
smoothed out his tracks as he left-and
the smoothin out would show same as foot-
prints-howd he go

   that argument would hold good if he
came from any other direction of the court
and he certainly didnt fly dr hood re-
torted  you gave me some good ideas
that helped a lot when jim hicks was found
dead in the swamp and again when old
mrs beckley was murdered in her barn and
i always thought you had the makings of a
detective yourself geoff for all youre slow-
thinking come on out front a minute i
want to tell you a theory of mine about this
case and see how it strikes you

  they passed out of the broad entrance
doors and down the steps to the driveway
where they halted and looked about them
but no one was in sight

   id like to hear it doc this is one
o the doggonedest things i ever see re-
sponded geoff  i aint heard no weepin
and wailin about it either not from any-
body

  the doctor darted another quick glance
at him

   sometimes folks think more of your life
insurance and your will than they do of
your company he commented dryly
 thats how i size this situation up so far
and men that fight their way through to
success are bound to leave a few scars and
bruises behind them now suppose benk-
ard was sitting there smoking on that bench
last night and some one he knew well or
perhaps even expected came through the
terrace doors and joined him

   suppose the visitor had a heavy ham-
mer or a short iron bar or some other
weapon hidden under his coat waiting for
a chance to brain him with it suppose he

   	a

dropped something on purpose behind the
bench and got up and went around to get it
and benkard not suspecting anything
didnt turn his head but maybe even
dropped it forward a little on his chest as
though he were thinking if the blow was
struck then and the murderer went out
through the terrace doors leaving them
wide open behind him theres something we
havent taken into consideration that would
have helped him by wiping out his foot-
prints on that sanded floor geoff and it
could only have done it in that one place
in all the court the night breeze

  dr hood paused in an unconsciously
dramatic effect but his companions ex-
pression did not change he stared straight
before him in stolid reflection and his
thumbs sought the straps of his overalls and
crooked there

   well doc he vouchsafed at last  i
dont aim to put forward my opinion but
since youre askin me for it the wind last
night was from the south not the north
that those terrace doors open out on and
if it had a been how could it have got
under and behind that bench to blow away
the footprints there too if the feller walked
around it then why would it wipe out
his footprints and leave benkards there in
front of the bench where we both seen em
as plain as day the rest of it seems a like-
ly enough idee-

  its the only one the doctor inter-
rupted nettled in spite of his habitual good
nature by the unenthusiastic reception of his
theory  no matter which way the wind
was from a little scurry of breeze was likely
to swirl in at the open door and just by
chance scatter the sand and smooth over
the footprints in that one spot leaving a
space a few inches away undisturbed

   its the only explanation for there be-
ing none visible this morning and the mur-
derer may not have gone around behind
the bench thats a mere detail i tell you
geoff youll find that ive hit it before this
case is finished

   i aint got no idees about it at all
admitted geoff  reckon youre right
about my bein slow-thinkin doc seems
to me though that no matter how rich and
successful id be id want somethin even

a dog to grieve when my time come to be
took who do you spose is a-comin in
hanks deepo jitney he aint driv so fast
since the town hall burned over to the
corners 

  a dilapidated small car came at a wild
pace up the driveway swinging from side
to side and the two spectators hopped nim-
bly out of its way as it drew up before the
steps with a clatter

   hello doc the youthful driver cried
eagerly  hows things any news

  but dr hood was present on official
business and he merely nodded to his inter-
rogator and stepped forward to intercept
the single passenger who alighted geoff
retreated to the shadow of the entrance hall

   im the medical examiner in charge
whats your business here sir

  the newcomer was a frail slender stoop-
shouldered man who seemed prematurely
aged he hesitated as though bewildered
and the face he turned to the doctor showed
deep furrowed lines while he blinked near-
sightedly in the sunlight

   i am william dunn mr benkards
private secretary mrs cayley sent for
me-

  his voice was low and tremulous and it
was obvious that he was laboring under
great agitation if not some deeper emotion
 i have been given to understand that mr
benkard is-is-

  he seemed unable to continue and the
doctor replied gravely

   mr benkard was found dead this
morning and it looks like foul play mrs
cayley is engaged just now but come this
way there are some questions i want to
ask you mr dunn

 foul play the others jaw
dropped  i was only told of-of sudden
death can it be true that after all these
years-

  they wrere passing geoff in the entrance
hall now as the doctor led the way to the
dining room and he saw the sudden glisten-
ing of the secretarys faded eyes

   you have been a long time with mr
benkard dr hoods tone was sympa-
thetic

   seven years doctor seven-years 
dunn repeated in a whisper like a man in a

dream  i-i was a broker myself in good
standing once but i met with reverses do
they know who-who killed him

  the doctors reply was lost in the closing
of the dining room door and geoff made
his way out to the terrace once more it
was deserted but retrieving his pipe which
he had left to cool on the pile of boards
he seated himself and was proceeding to
refill it when a bulky shadow appeared on
the newly dried concrete and he looked up
to find the county detective confronting
him

   you the guy thats been doing this
work around here he gestured compre-
hensively and geoff nodded  im detec-
tive sergeant eliot from the homicide
bureau of the office of the district attor-
ney  

  he flipped open the lapel of the light
gray coat for an instant displaying his
badge but the stone mason merely nodded
again and went on filling his pipe

   heard tell you was a-comin and t seen
you when you stopped the cook from leav-
in he remarked

   i thought it was you in the kitchen
wtiat were you doing there

   gittin some coffee geoff cupped his
hands over the match he had lighted and
then drew the cool fragrant smoke in con-
tentedly

   so you were going to let her make her
get-away were you sergeant eliot
adopted a bullying tone and the other
squinted at him quizzically

   nobody hadnt pinted me deputy nor
told me to stop her and i aim to mind my
own business he drawled in perfect good
humor  my job is to finish this here ter-
race and the garage soons i git a chance

   been working here long the detective
demanded

   off and on ever since the foundations
was laid

   inside as well as out any of that
plaster stuff around the fountain and the
balcony

    all o the finishin off only it aint plas-
ter explained geoff  its stucco and-

   never mind what it is im no brick-
layer sergeant eliot had dropped his
bullying tone and his manner was heavily
above suspicioxv



facetious  if youve been here working
on the inside from the beginning youre
the man im after to tell me how the rooms
are laid out downstairs for instance
whats this long one here at the left that
runs from the library all the way back

    its a goin to be the conservatry when
mis cayley gits round to puttin in the
plants and such as you could have told
from the windows if youd been a-past em
outside

   there was the barest suspicion of a twin-
kle in the bovine brown eyes

    and on this side theres the kitchen and
pantry and dining room and then another
room that stretches across the front to the
entrance hall about as big as the parlor op-
posite but it seems to be shut up the de-
tective pursued  whats it used for any-
way

   nothin now mis cayleys goin to
have the ceilin hand-painted and move the
piano in from the parlor and call it a
 music room but i heard tell they was ex-
pectin to have lots o gay society doins
dancin and card parties and private play
actin

   are the windows of that and the con-
servatory always fastened

   reckon so geoff smoked on with
  elaborate nonchalance  henry tends to
  that-henry carp the butler

      and the doors of both of these unfin-
  ished rooms are they kept locked

     geoff squinted up once more

      dunnos i can tell you that mr-ser-
  geant i aint had occasion to go in either
  of em since the family moved here and
  thats been about a month there was lots
  o sets o keys made to every room in the
  house but i never heard tell who had em
  cept mis cayley and henry-and o
  course mr benkard

      whats your name asked the detec-
  tive suddenly after a pause

      geoffrey peters

      got your card with you

      geoff thrust out his lantern jaw a trifle

    i dont belong to no union and i dont
   ned to everybody round here knows me
   like they knew my father before me and
   he wa the best carpenter and mason in the
   county i git more odd jobs and steady

ones than i can tend to and i hope you
and the constable-i mean the lieutenant-
will ketch the feller soon that killed mr
benkard sos i can git on with my work
sergeant eliot chuckled

guess you wont be idle long then
he boasted then added quickly in a lowered
tone  who is this

geoff glanced toward the path which led
around the west side of the house from the
newly laid-out garden and rose

 young lady visitin here miss sher-
wood her name is he replied  friend o
mis cayley and her daughter from the city
reckon ill git on down to the beach and
see how them concrete piles o the boathouse
is settin unless theres somethin else you
want to ask me

 not now the detective motioned him
away and geoff reached in the tool box for
his cap and then strolled off down the ter-
race steps but as soon as he was out of
sight from above he felt in the torn lining
of the cap for the precious bit of soft glossy
black fabric which he had secreted there

reassured of its safety he went on whis-
tling his gay but monotonous refrain of
the morning at first softly then shrill and
clear as he approached the boathouse as
he expected two youthful anxious faces
peered cautiously at him from around the
corner of the tiny veranda which faced the
sound

affecting not to notice them he stooped
and ran his hand down one after another
of the concrete piles but when he reached
the one nearest to them at the waters edge
the whistle ceased

   taint any o my business he spoke
as though to himself  but i kinder think
somebodys been missed from the house
that young lady whos visitin there miss
sherwood just come lookin round outside
real anxious shes on the terrace now but
i dont reckon shes quainted with that
path leadin out back o the garage

  cutting short the grateful thanks of the
pair by renewed whistling he turned and
started for the terrace once more but he
silenced his refrain abruptly before he
reached the steps and ducked hastily
through a clump of bushes beside them un-
til he stood just beneath the spot where he


a rgosy-allstory weekly

  had left the detective miss sherwoods
  low clear tones came distinctly to his ears

   yes i understand perfectly i make
  my home in new york with mrs harper
  middleton on park avenue    none with
  the exception of some distant cousins of the
  same name from whom i have not heard
  in years

     the unintelligible rumble of the detec-
   tives voice intervened and then at intervals
   her replies

      a frightful shock naturally although
   i am merely a friend of the family mr
   benkard was a man who will not soon be
   forgotten by those who really knew him i
   believe that i must have been the last of the
   household to see him alive except for carp
   when he went to lock up for miss cayley
   had retired some time before and mrs
   cayley preceded me by a few minutes in
   the library mr benkard asked me to go for
   a sail this afternoon i remember if he could
   arrange to return from town in time   
   no certainly not nothing whatever of
   that sort i have told you that i am just a
   friend of mrs cayley and not a particularly
   intimate one this is the first time that i
   have ever been a house guest of hers in
   town or country

    the indignation of the young womans
disclaimer made the nature of sergeant
eliots question plain geoff waited to hear
no more but keeping close to the house
wall he made his way to the front and in
at the entrance

    dr hood was just crossing the patio from
 the staircase to the dining room half lead-
 ing and half supporting the shaking form of
 the old butler and he beckoned imperative-
 ly geoff sauntered along in their wake
 until they had entered the room and he
 heard henrys quavering tones

   oh mr dunn sir this is a sad day
for all of us

   a day of shocking changes indeed
carp dunns low still dazed voice re-
plied and then the doctor reappeared in the
patio

  i want you to hear this geoff he
whispered  i told you it was somebody
benkard knew well and perhaps expected
but i guess it wasnt quite the way i thought
and my theory is knocked into smither-

  eens go into the pantry ill open the
  door between on a crack

     with a wary eye on the opposite gallery
   lest letty appear and a quick glance or two
   toward the library from which the subdued
   sound of voices still issued geoff hurried
   to the small door leading to the pantry and
   slipped in silently

     henry dr hood was saying in his
  most persuasive tones  mrs cayley wants
  you to tell the truth and all the truth as
  far as you know it mr dunn has just
  told me something that he is going to re-
  peat to you and i want you to say whether
  you ever heard anything about it or not
  whether it was ever discussed by mr benk-
  ard and any of the family at home in your
  hearing do you understand

     i-i think i do sir henrys voice
  had risen a note as though he already an-
  ticipated what was coming and was appre-
  hensive of it  i havent seen mrs cay-
  ley sir since early morning and i dont
  know that she would wish to have me men-
  tion what might have been said at home-
   she wishes everything done everything
  told that will help to find the murderer of
  her brother no matter what else should be
  brought out she gave me that message
  herself the doctor interrupted tell
  henry what you told me mr dunn

      i said that for the last three or four
   years mr benkard had been in fear for
   his life

     the secretarys low voice had steadied
  and now it rang out with unexpected firm-
  ness

      i said that he knew he had some enemy
 who was only biding his time and would get
 him in the end i said that he was a man
 who walked in the constant shadow of
 death 

   mr benkard didnt know what it was
 to be afraid of anything nor anybody sir
 that i ever heard of henry cried  if-
 if he did have some enemy who-who might
 have threatened him it didnt frighten him
 for he wasnt afraid of death itself

   but he did have such an enemy he
 had been threatened with death and you
 and the family knew it dr hood ex-
 claimed

   henry carp did know it dunns
above suspicion



level tones followed with almost sinister in-
sistence upon the medical examiners accusa-
tion

   you knew when the anonymous letters
began coming on certain days of every year
and how he defied them he never would
admit that he guessed who sent them or
why and perhaps he didnt know the iden-
tity of his enemy but he knew the reason
all right he used to wait for the days
to come and pass-

  oh its true henry broke down
 he wouldnt have a special guard or go
to the police and after the first year not
even mrs cayley dared to speak to him
about it but we knew and waited too and
when i laid eyes on him this morning i
saw that it had come at last its been just
as mr dunn says sir for these four years
and more past mr benkard has walked
in the shadow of death 

chapter v

the curiosity of letty

for a brief space save for the ster-
torous breathing of the old butler
as he strove to regain control of his
emotions there was silence in the dining
room

   the secretary stared straight before
him and dr hood glanced meaningly to-
ward the pantry door behind which geoff
stood listening with all his ears then
as though to himself william dunn spoke

  barking dogs never bite he used to
say ive seen them come to him at the
office cringing and bullying begging and
bargaining the men hed beaten at their
own game and he laughed at them all
but he didnt laugh at this thing that hung
over him

    i might have known that something
terrible was happening last night for i
seemed to have a premonition-a sense of
impending horror for which i could not ac-
count sleep would not come to me and
at last i dressed again and went out to
walk the streets aimlessly till it was nearly
morning

the doctor cleared his throat  why
did you say that perhaps mr benkard did

not know who it was that was threatening
him but that he knew the cause do you
mean that some one had taken up anothers
quarrel with him

   perhaps doctor a man cannot be as
close to another day after day as i have
been to mr benkard all these years with-
out getting to know him pretty thoroughly
and to a certain extent i may say that he
confided in me i mean that he would
let himself go occasionally show his
thoughts and feelings without the restraint
he exhibited toward almost every one else
dunn paused and covered his eyes with one
thin hand but after a moment it fell to
the arm of his chair and he continued

   he never showed me one of those let-
ters nor told me the contents except that
some lunatic was threatening his life for
an imaginary cause that he couldnt fath-
om but when he raged against the sender
of them he seemed sincere enough in his
wonder as to the mans identity

   it was only when he spoke of the al-
leged reason for the insane persecution that
his tone assumed the defensive i always
thought that perhaps the letters themselves
or the dates on which they came so regu-
larly recalled some incident in the past
in wthich he had gotten the best of a deal
and the loser nursed a grudge

  dr hood shook his head

   that wouldnt account for murder mr
dunn especially if it were some one else
who took up the grudge and that person
was actually insane i never heard of a
maniac able to keep track of dates with
such regularity as you say over a period
covering several years but perhaps he was
crazed only on the one subject and had
brooded over it until it had become an ob-
session that would hardly be the case if
it concerned a mere financial deal with a
third party at that

  it might if that deal involved ruin for
others doctor dunn said  and the writer
of those letters were one of them and be-
lieved mr benkard to be responsible you
dont know what it is to have everything
swept away i do but my failure was my
own fault an error in judgment or perhaps
lack of nerve in a crisis and i had no one
to blame but myself


argosy-allstory weekly

   i was present less than two years ago
when a man who had been wiped out on
the market the day before forced his way
into mr benkards private office and lev-
eled a revolver at him mr benkard just
laughed and took it away from him he
had courage as carp says he wasnt
afraid of anything on earth

   did the man ever trouble him again
the doctor asked

   xo sir dunns voice sunk to a
whisper u he blew his own brains out that
night of course mr benkard had noth-
ing to do with his failure-he just imag-
ined it-and i only mentioned it to show
you to what lengths despair can drive a
man sometimes

   on the blind impulse of the moment
maybe but not in the calculated persecu-
tion which your story of these letters indi-
cates dr hood removed his spectacles
and began to polish them absentmindedly
 on what dates did they come were they
sent to his home or to his office

   on the ioth of october and the ist of
january sometimes they came to the of-
fice but more often to his home

   but wasnt it your custom as his sec-
setarv to go through the office mail your-
self demanded the doctor

   xot on those dates dunn shook his
head  the first letters had gone to his
home you see doctor and i had instruc-
tions after that not to touch the mail in
either october or january until mr ben-
kard turned it over to me again but it
was always back in my hands on the
nth of october and-except this year-
by the d of january the letters came
promptly

   i call to mind well when the first one
came to the house it was henry who
spoke and although his tones were feeble
they were fairly controlled  that was
four years ago last new years da id
sorted the mail never thinking and put it
at his place and mrs cayleys and miss
mildreds at the breakfast table i was
serving them when all at once i heard mrs
cayley cry out and ask him what was the
matter

   mr benkard laughed and crushed the
letter in his hand and said it was nothing

that some crank or practical joker had sent
him an anon-anonymous threat i no-
ticed though that he only pretended to
eat after that and a little later i saw him
burning the letter and envelope in the open
fire in his study there was an informal
reception that afternoon and a small dinner
party at night-they didnt go in for so-
ciety so much then sir-but all day mr
benkard looked as though he was seeing
ghosts 

   and when did the second letter come

   on the ioth of october sir as mr
dunn says and it was just the same only
miss mildred being away at boarding
school mrs cayley made a bit of a scene
if youll excuse me for saying so wanting
to see the letter and demanding to know
what it was all about

   mr benkard got in a rage the worst
i ever knew him to have and told her not
to meddle in his affairs or-or she would
regret it i dont know that mrs cayle
would like me to speak of it especially
now sir but you said she wanted me to
tell all the truth

  henry paused but the doctor reassured
him

   thats right henry go on

   let me see then sir that will be
three years ago next october and the fol-
lowing new years day i looked over the
mail right carefully you may be sure but
i couldnt see anything suspicious nor
was there the letter didnt come all
day i watched mr benkard and i noticed
that mrs cayley did too-and we-we all
waited but nothing happened miss mil-
dred didnt know anything about it having
forgotten what happened the previous year
of course

   it was the next day when mr ben-
kard came home from the office and i was
helping him off with his coat that i saw
in his face he must have had the letter
down town

   he did dunn affirmed  when i
reached the office at my usual time i found
him there before me burning some papers
in a big brass ash tray and he was in a
towering fun that was the first i heard
about the letters when he burst out and
told me about the first two he said just
above suspicion



 vvkat ive told you doctor no more and
 no less and he gave me instructions then
 about the mail for the next october

    where was the fourth letter sent
 to the house sir and the fifth too
 in october and then on new years day-
 that was two years ago last new years
 henry took up the recital  he bore it
 better but you could see it was wearing
 him down like a man under sentence
 mrs cayley and me wed never spoke of
 it but there was a kind of an understanding
 between us and we could tell different
 kinds of envelopes must have been used
 each time for i never knew which to look
 for and mr benkard always burned them
 directly afterward my memory isnt what
 it used to be but the next one must have
 gone to the office

   he looked at the secretary who nodded
 without speaking and henry went on

    the last to come to the house was on
  new years day a year ago and mr ben-
  kard shut himself up in his study for hours

 	afterward but when he came out he was
  more like his old self than he had been
  for days

      you see sir i could tell the strain he
   was under and how hed begin to wait
   when it neared time for the date to come
   around i fancy mr dunn must have
   taken notice of it too

      i did of course said dunn  and al-
   though no one else at the office had an
   inkling of the matter i think the whole staff
   felt that something was in the air at those
   times when the final letter came last
   october i was relieved that he merely
   langhed at it instead of becoming enraged
   but he was unusually thoughtful for days
   thereafter absentminded i might say and
   his keen business acumen seemed to slip a
   cog he pulled himself together though
   and in a week or two he was plunging more
   actively into the game than ever that is
   until january

     he paused and the doctor observed
   if no anonymous letter reached him
   then either at home or his office it might
   have been sent to one of his clubs

     henry shook his head and dunn replied
   quickly

      it wasnt doctor because all that

month he insisted on opening and examin-
ing his own mail and his business affairs
went to pieces every deal he undertook
fell through and it began to be whispered
about that he was losing his grip breaking
up they were all down on him then like
a pack of wolves but toward the latter part
of the month he began to change gradually
to come back

    it was as though a burden were slipping
 from him a trifle more each day and on
 the i st of february he flung the whole heap
 of mail unopened on my desk and said

	here bill heres your old job back my
anonymous friend has thrown up the
sponge

    since then mr benkard has been just
as he was before the first of those letters
came and he not only made up for his j an-
uary losses but hes pulled off some of the
most sensationally successful coups of his
career

    he was the same at home sir henry
supplemented  from new years on he
scarcely ate or slept and every hour he
was waiting waiting then little by little
his old spirit came back and its been as if
those letters was never written but it
must have come at last sir the thing he
was waiting for it must have come last
night

  the weak tears of age sprang to his
eyes and as he threatened to collapse once
more dr hood rose hastily

    come along henry youd better go
back and rest now and try not to think
about it ill give you a little something
that  help you to sleep wait here till i
get downstairs again mr dunn and if
any one should happen to come in dont
mention this conversation you under-
stand dont you

   the secretary nodded and the other two
left the room while geoff slipped from his
hiding place and through the outer door of
the kitchen which opened on a pergola
beside the terrace hed had enough of
eavesdropping for one day and there was
a question to be settled in his own mind

   the noon whistles blew at a distant mill
 while he was still strolling back and forth
 under the trellised arbor and more from
 habit than anything else he procured his

dinner from where it reposed wrapped in a
newspaper on his coat in the tool box and
seated himself on the steps

  if he had hoped to devour it undis-
turbed he was disappointed scarcely had
he consumed his first sandwich of cold
fried pork and bread than a thin voice
twanged behind him and turning to his
astonishment he beheld letty advancing
with a glass and bottle in her hands

   i was thinkin maybe a little ginger ale
would go good with your lunch geoff she
remarked jerkily  i dont know what i
would have done with old henry this mom-
in if it hadnt been for you when-when
we found mr benkard

   its a pity no one thought o old henry
afterward he replied  thank you kind-
ly for this though

  he drank deeply but eyed her askance
over the rim of the glass for the acidulous
housemaid had shown him no favors before
and he was wary

   i did think of him when i could get a
minute from mrs cayley and the others
but he told me youd brought him up some
coffee and he didnt want anything else
without invitation she plumped herself
down on the steps beside him with her
sharp elbows on her knees and her sharper
chin in her hands  i went up again jut
now but hes sleepin like a child and im
glad of it he seemed nearly crazy from
the shock of cornin on mr benkard like
that when you saw him could you get
anything out of him geoff what did he
say

  so that was it she had come to pump
him but why should she care particularly
what the butler or anyone else had said
about joseph benkards death was it
just a womans love -of gossip geoff fin-
ished the other sandwich before he replied
 i didnt try to git anythin out o him
tamt none o my affairs but i wouldnt
say henry was noways crazy seems real
bright and level-headed to me for an old
feller

   well he isnt hes in his second child-
hood if you ask me but the shock was
enough to drie anybody out of their
head letty peered into the newspaper
spread between his knees  what are you

eatin doughnuts and apples and stale
cheese goodness gracious what messes
you bachelors do fix up for yourselves
its what i like geoff protested in
some alarm  i been eatin it steady for
fifteen year ever since my ma died

   just you wait letty rose  zeppa
is a good-for-nothing lazy thing but she
makes lovely chocolate cake and i think
theres some left

  she was gone before he could remon-
strate further and philosophically geoff
poured himself another glass of ginger ale
after all he had committed himself by ac-
cepting that and he might as well take
whatever else was offered but this new
attitude on her part was disquieting letty
returned presently with a huge wedge of
cake on a plate and seated herself again
beside him

   i guess youll like that better she
remarked in answer to his cautiously
worded thanks  my what a momin its
been first that-that awful business and
then havin to break the news to mrs
cayley and the young ladies and trying to
keep zeppa from havin a fit and then the
police cornin the doctor is a friend of
yours isnt he geoff i saw you talkin
to him two or three times what does he
think about the murder

  her tones were confidentially lowered as
she bent nearer to him and geoff edged
away

   doc hoods a friend to nigh everybody
in the county goin miles day or night to
take care o the sick whether they kin pay
or not he observed noncommittally hes
knowed me since i was knee-high to a
grasshopper but he wouldnt likely talk to
me about his criminal cases as medcal ex-
aminer he asked me questions just the
same as he done to everybody else

  what kind of questions geoff her
voice was a mere whisper now and
she hitched along closer to him on the step
he saw with dismay that she would soon
have him hemmed in against the balustrade
and escape would be impossible  dr
hood asked me a lot of questions too and
he was awful kind about it but i couldnt
make head nor tail of what he was gettin
at what did he ask you
above suspicion



   geoff remembered all at once that it was
the doctor himself who had called him
 slow-thinking and he smiled inwardly
 well after hed got through about this
mornin he asked me if id seen any spi-
cious characters hangin round while i been
workin here the last few days-tramps or
tough-looking city fellers that might have
been burglars spyin out the place then
he wanted to know if id noticed any
strange motor boats anchored down there
offshore or ottermobiles pretendin to be
stuck in the road right close to the gates
with license plates from way off some-
wheres

  geoff warmed to his subject  after
that he started about the ketches on all
the winders and locks on the doors and
was there any alarm system and did mr
benkard have a gun that id heard tell of
did he ask you any o them things

   he did not letty eyed her compan-
ion in open skepticism  i must say its
funny too did you talk to that detective
from the county- seat

  he talked to me geoff chuckled
kinder likes to hear imself dont he
reckon he had an idee i might have done
it he asked me every question he could
think o bout myself and i expect im
liable to find him snoopin round my place
down by the crick most any time what
do you think o him

   lettys sniff was eloquent

   i guess if it was goin to depend on
him wed never find out who killed mr
benkard  she caught herself up suddenly
 mr lane is here

    i heard tell so

   geoffs tone was absent for he was won-
dering what she meant and why she had
stopped and changed the subject as though
sorry she had spoken on whom was the
investigation to depend if not on the local
and county authorities

   mr benkards secretary mr dunn
came a while ago too letty remarked
after a pause

    seen him when he driv up but i aint
spoke to him responded geoff truthfully
enough  he looked most as bad as old
henry

  theyre a good pair she exclaimed

 henrys in his dotage and mr dunns
half cracked about losin his own money in
wall street theyd both outlived their
usefulness when we came on to make our
home with mr benkard six years ago and
why he kept them i never could see though
mrs cayley got kind of fond of old henry
and i like him because hes willing and
faithful enough i guess mr dunn is too
but if anybody was to listen to either of
them and believe a word they said it d be
downright foolishness

   why geoff asked mildly

  l because theyre likely to imagine all
kinds of things now that mr benkard has
been murdered and make mountains out of
mole hills thinkin they can help trace the
one who did it i shouldnt be surprised
right now if one or the other of them wasnt
cookin up some notion or makin a mystery
out of nothin

   except that old henrys asleep you
say and i expect mr dunn is busy with
mis cayley geoff remarked  you come
with her and her daughter to new york
didnt you where did you live before
that i aint never had time to git no-
where only just round here

  letty bit her thin lips

   we came from milborough in penn-
sylvania she said shortly

  geoff debated for a moment and then
made a valiant effort

   you couldnt have been with mis cay-
ley long you aint old nough tove been
out o school moren a few year

  he gulped when the words were out and
awaited the result of his rash move with
trepidation but nothing happened and after
a brief space he stole a sidelong glance at
her to his surprise lettys face had turned
a dull brick-red and a little suggestion of a
smile softened her sharp features

  age is sometimes deceivin geoff
she laughed not unpleasantly  ive been
with mrs cayley since two years before her
husband died and that  be ten years next
september poor man

   you workin twelve year if anybody
else was tove told me id never have be-
lieved it he exclaimed gallantly adding
 what did mis cayleys husband do
was he in big deals like mr benkard


argosy-allstory weekly

     the query was put innocently enough
   but lettys smile disappeared and she gave
   him a sharp suspicious glance

     he didnt do anything he was an
  invalid she replied with an air of finality
   mercy i cant sit here gabbing all day

     she rose and he did likewise with a sigh
  which might have been an expression of re-
  gret or relief

      nor me neither though its the first
  time we got kinder acquainted i puttered
  round all morning doin nothin and now i
  reckon ill move my concrete mixer over to
  the garage and git to work there mis
  cayley didnt say i shouldnt and ill be
  out o folks way-

   hey geoff lieutenant zeke foster
  came around the comer of the house on a
  run  seen anythin o doc hood

    no whats up geoff demanded de-
  serting his erstwhile companion abruptly

     that detective from the district attor-
 neys office has found where a window o
 that big empty room at the front was
 forced and the lock o the door broke
 thats how the murdrer got in last night

chapter vi

geoff helps

 the creek which wound between broad
 gently sloping meadows to the sound
 reflected the last pink glow of sunset
 that evening as dr hood left his car at
 the side of the main road and made his
 way along the narrow well-worn path to-
 ward a tiny frame cottage set in a garden
 that fairly rioted with bloom

 as he neared it a deep-throated baying
 sounded from within and geoffs tall lanky
 figure appeared in the doorway

 why hello doc unfeigned surprise
 and pleasure quickened his drawling tones

  dont reckon youve been here since ma
 died come in

  youve kept up her garden i see the
 doctor paused to sniff at a fragrant rose
 bush

  yes geoff replied half apologetically
 as though revealing a hidden weakness

  seems kinder more like livin with some-
 thin pretty round go on outside rufe

    he added the last to a nondescript hound
 which had ceased its baying and come to the
 doorway beside him inquiringly the dog
 obeyed wagging its tail in friendly fashion
 at the visitor and then trotted off to the
 shed from whence came the occasional
 stamp of a horses hoofs

     what sort of a collection have you in
 your menagerie now geoff asked the doc-
 tor as he followed his host into the immacu-
 late kitchen

     only rufe and sim perkinss old mare
 that he turned out to die last winter and-
 and lady here

   as he spoke a huge silky buff-and-white
 bundle moved on an old quilt in the comer
 and a great dog raised herself on her fore-
 legs with the hind ones stretched out help-
 lessly behind her

   why its a russian wolfhound a
 beauty dr hood exclaimed what
 happened to her that her hind quarters are
 paralyzed-run over

    shes been mistreated geoff responded
 briefly but there was that in his tone which
 few had ever heard there  i was give ten
 dollars to take her out and shoot her but
 i brought her home instead and the vet i
 had down from the city says shes goin to
 git well set down doc i reckoned id
 keep out o what wasnt my business so i
 worked on the garage all afternoon

     it looks as though this case were any-
 bodys business the doctor observed rue-
 fully as he seated himself  im going to
 perform the autopsy to-night but there
 will be nothing to it and then im out of it
 until the trial if there ever is one ser-
 geant eliot is using zeke for a sort of watch-
 man since he discovered that the window
 and inner door of the empty music room
 had been forced and hes busier than a bird
 dog around the place but somehow i dont
 take much stock in that story of the forced
 window geoff

    no burglary was attempted and if the
 murderer wasnt a stranger and had recon-
 noitered he would have found the man he
 was looking for sitting unarmed within a
 few feet of those open doors mrs cayley
 tried to bluff when i asked her about those
 anonymous death threats but finally she
 had to admit that her brother had received
above suspicion

a few such letters evidently the work of
some harmless crank and no one had paid
any attention to them except perhaps his
overzealous secretary or poor childish old
henry

  geoff chuckled

   yes she sent letty out when i was
eatin my dinner to bribe me with a bottle
o ginger pop to let on to you that henry
and that there dunn were a couple o half-
cracked fools and not to listen to em she
was real anxious though to find out what
you thought and what the sergeant had
asked me and i reckon she told letty to
pump me generally

  the doctors eyes twinkled

   was the pumping good

   well geoff rubbed his chin  that
there lettys real faithful but then shes
been with mis cayley for twelve years
mis cayleys husband was an invalid and
died ten year ago and four years after-
ward she and miss millie and letty come to
new york from milborough pennsylvania
to keep house for mr benkard henry
and william dunn was with him already
the visitor laughed until his fat body
shook

   i thought that was how it must have
tuned out he exclaimed then his face
sobered

   mrs cayleys afraid to have those let-
ters investigated for some reason dread of
notoriety perhaps there might have been
a few things in benkards life that wouldnt
look good printed in his obituary

   yet i shouldnt be sprised if they was
anxious to find out for themselves anyways
just who it was killed him letty kinder
hinted they wasnt exactly tickled to death
with the district attorneys feller and then
she shut up quick mebbe therell be an-
other stranger round the place pretty soon
who wont flash no badge nor act like he
was leadin a brass band but i dont see
what he kin do the tracks  be all covered
up by that time

   do you mean you think mrs cayley
is going to get a detective of her own out
from the city demanded the doctor

   kinder looks that way but o course
taint any business o mine seems to me
though that if i wanted to start on a new

tack and i thought mebbe the feller that
writ those letters mightnt have had nothin
to do with the murder after all id have a
little talk with zeppa

   the cook 

   seems to me id kinder let on what an
ornery cuss i thought that district attor-
neys feller was and that mebbe id use my
inflooence-providin i had any that is-
to git leave for her to go seeins she didnt
know nothin about what happened to mr
benkard if shed tell me what she heard
goin on in the dinin room last night after
miss sherwood had stopped playin the
piano

  geoff spoke slowly and meditatively as
though communing with himself alone but
his visitor listened eagerly

   shouldnt wonder but id ask her who
the feller was that said he was through
hed been played for a sucker because the
lady hadnt no intentions o marryin him
and so nowr he was goin to queer mr
benkards game reckon shed tell me that
mr benkard threatened to break him like
he had the others but that the feller swore
hed git him first-and that a few minutes
after there come the sound of an ottermobile
tearin off down the drive

   stoneham lane mrs cayley told me
that he had a talk with her brother in the
dining room just before he left

  the doctor took off his spectacles and be-
gan polishing them vigorously with a corner
of the red cotton cover on the table beside
which he sat

   but benkard went back to the library
and talked to her and then to miss sher-
wood alone for a fewt minutes after mrs
cayley had gone to her room and old henry
saw him later when he went the rounds to
lock the house up for the night

   he didnt lock the terrace doors
though and somebody mightve forced the
window and inside door to the music room
to make it looks if a burglar or leastwise
a stranger had done it kinder think if
this case was any affair o mine-which it
aint-id like to know if mr lane driv
straight back to the city and what time he
put his ottermobile up at whatever garage
he keeps it at and then id make sure he
went home and to bed instead o mebbe hir-


argosy-allstory weekly

in a strange ottermobile or borrowin one
for a little ride out in the country again

  geoff ran his fingers through his shock
of sandy hair paused for a few moments
then he spoke again

   its plumb curus bow a feller kin go
along makin money and livin high till hes
old nough to know better and then git crazy
bout some yeller-headed little gal who
mightve been his daughter and when she
wont marry him hell git an idee that she
was leadin him on because shed been told
to by somebody she had to mind

  if hed thought the party that put her
up to it was his friend and had praps got
mixed up in some dirty work with him be-
sides hed likely git even no matter what
it cost him but if he was scared mebbe that
the other party would win out i shouldnt
be sprised but that hed take a chance on
crackin his skull where a feller tries to
mix courtin and business hes bound to lose
on one or tother and if the business hap-
pens to be a little mite crooked theres liable
to be a sight o trouble

    crooked business  repeated the
visitor thoughtfully  those big financiers
in wall street dont care much who they
ruin geoff so long as they get to the top
from what dunn said to-day although he
was as loyal as they come i gathered that
benkard was about as ruthless a fighter
as any of the lot but i didnt think hed
do anything crooked

   never kin tell doc geoff produced his
pipe and sack of tobacco  o course if
mis cayley does git a detective down it
wont be his business to unearth anythin
that  mebbe reflect on her brother but to
cover it up instead and thats where hed
be workin with his hands tied but if a body
was free to investigate where he pleased
he could look up some o the deals lane and
benkard have been in together just to git a
general idee o their game

   lane aint nobuddys fool for all he
wants a gal that dont want him and if he
was tove turned and come back last night
hell have it all fixed to prove where he
was every minute o the time from when he
first left here till mis cayley called him on
the telephone this mornin with folks all
ready to swear to it too likely

   an alibi you mean dr hood nodded
a trifle grimly  if his alibi cant be shak-
en thats the end of it but iu be hanged
if i dont think you may have struck it

geoff i never thought to talk to that
cook it beats all how you just fall into
luck

   reckon its because i aint lookin for
nothin his host responded as he suddenly
put the tobacco sack back in his pocket un-
opened and reached for a large tin box on
the shelf  kinder think ill try this new
mixture too bad i aint got any cigars for
you doc

   mr newbury gave me a couple this
afternoon the other took a fat perfecto
from his pocket as he spoke  those big
city lawyers certainly have the best there
is

    lawyers  geoff looked up quickly

   he was benkards attorney and mrs
cayleys too and he came out on the first
afternoon train it seems that lane left
word to have him notified for mrs cayley
before he himself started out here i had
a long talk with newbury about benkards
affairs and i can tell you if there was any-
thing crooked about them he doesnt knew
it or he wouldnt have touched them with a
ten-foot pole hes a man of fifty-five or
so i should say with gray hair and a little
pointed beard did you ever see him while
you were working around the place

  geoff shook his head and the doctor went
on

   his voice is deep and solemn just like
a preachers and ill bet he makes them
sit up and take notice in a court room he
wanted to know when they could have the
body and when i told him  to-morrow
morning he said they would have the fu-
neral the next day-saturday-so as to get
it over with as quickly as possible and avoid
all the notoriety for the family that they
could

   he seemed pretty well shocked but it
was more as though he felt it a personal
scandal and disgrace that one of his clients
should have gone and got himself mur-
dered than any real regret if benkard
was worth anywhere near as much as he
hinted his fees for settling up the estate
ought to run into a tidy sum though even
above suspicion



for him and that must have softened the
blow

   didnt benkard leave no will geoff
asked drawing at his pipe slowly

   yes of course newbury drew it up
for him and hes going to read it to mrs
cayley and her daughter on sunday after-
noon he couldnt tell me in advance what
was in it benkard wasnt a member of
the stock exchange himself but he traded
through the biggest houses and he was
known as one of the most daring brilliant
speculators in the street at the present day

   he didnt stick to any one kind of stock
but took flyers in everything-railroads and
wheat and mines and oil and so forth-and
nobody knew which side of the market hed
be on next sending the price skyrocketing
or making the bottom drop out of it

   reglar gambler commented geoff
lost out in the end though didnt he
no matter how much he made he couldnt
take none o it with him where he went last
night howd he get his start and when
did he first show up down on this here wall
street did newbury tell you

   i dont believe he knows the doctor
replied  all he said was that benkard
came to him about twelve years ago with a
small civil suit so small that he wouldnt
have bothered with it only the young man
brought letters of introduction from two of
his most important clients he said that
benkard couldnt have been more than
thirty then but he started right in to direct
how he wanted the case handled as though
he was giving instructions to some cheap
law clerk and newbury was astonished at
his shrewdness and keen insight

   he made up his mind to watch him and
he was glad to take him on as a regular
client for though benkard was only a spec-
ulator in a moderate way then he came up
by leaps and bounds until soon everybody
was talking about him and trying to follow
his moves if there was anything crooked
about his game he was smart enough to
keep newbury from even suspecting it and
i dont sae how i can find out what nobody
else guessed

   guessin and provin are two diffrunt
things geoff remarked  i dont know
nothin bout speckilatin and i never was

to that there stock exchange in my life
but aint you acquainted with some o them
brokers seems to me i heard tell that fel-
ler wyckoff was one that had the old mid-
dleton place over to the comers two sum-
mers ago you tended his children when
they was down with scarlet fever there
didnt you

   thats so i did the doctor took a
last pull at the stub of his cigar and then
laid it almost reverently in the saucer which
geoff had placed at his elbow  ill run
into the city and look him up to-morrow
the first thing after i get benkards body
back home but what if he was one of the
fellows who worked in with benkard like
lane

   then o course he wont give him away
on account o savin his own skin but since
youre askin me i blieve id git from him
as much as i could bout some o the big
deals benkards worked durin the last few
years when he sent the stocks whoopin uji
and down and the dates after that seems
to me id look up the names o firms that
failed round those times if they was any
and id go see the heads o them theyd
talk fast nough likely if they was any-
thin to say geoff paused

   dunno zackly how id go bout it to
find em but old newspapers would have
the nouncement o the failures in em and
id write down the names and then mebbe
go ask round in brokers offices if they
knowed what had become o them
shouldnt be sprised if i found one or two
like dunn workin for other folks on this
here wall street its gamblin that there
business no matter what name you call it
by and ive took notice that the losers will
hang round doin any old odd jobs just to
see the play when once the gamblin fever
gits in their blood

   and i was going to send in my report
on the autopsy to the district attorney to-
morrow and wash my hands of the case
dr hood struck his plump rounded knee
with his fist  why i hadnt even begun
to go into it ill get a man from head-
quarters in new york to look up lanes
movements from the time he drove away
from mrs cayleys house last night until
he came down this morning in response to


argosy-allstory weekly

  her telephone call and have him bring me
  his report on it and if there is a loophole
  anywhere ill make lane produce an alibi

      in the meantime ill find out all i can
   about his and benkards deals and see
   wyckoff and perhaps get a line on some
   other brokers or speculators who failed and
   who may hold a grudge against benkard
   like that fellow dunn told about to-day
   who tried to shoot him you heard that
   from the pantry didnt you

     yes seems to me dunn could tell a
  lot more if he was a mind to

     ill bet he could but mrs cayley prob-
   ably raised old ned with him to-day for
   talking as much as he did after id ques-
   tioned her about those letters and hell be
   afraid to open his mouth still if lane
   can prove an alibi i may be able to dis-
   cover some one in wall street whos held a
   grudge against benkard for four and a half
   years and who might have written those
   letters and hetll have to prove an alibi
   too 

     the doctor rose

      i stopped by to-night to talk things
  over with you geoff because i thought you
  might have picked up something that i
  hadnt about this case but i never dreamed
  for a second that you had anything up your
  sleeve as important as that quarrel and the
  threats that were exchanged between lane
  and benkard why on earth didnt you
  come and tell me at once

   because twasnt none o my business
geoff replied slowly  wait till i light the
lantern outside sos you can see your wray
jong the path to the road doc

  he preceded his visitor out on the little
porch and as the rays of the lantern
streamed forth the doctor held out his hand
to the stonemason

    well youve helped an awful lot geoff
and im mighty obliged to you see you
to-morrow good night

  geoff remained on the porch until he
heard the rattle of the ancient car out on
the main road then he extinguished the
lantern and reentering the kitchenhe closed
the door carefully behind him taking
from his pocket the tobacco sack he had all
but opened in his visitors presence he drew
from it the scrap of soft resilient black

 fabric and gazed at it reflectively for a

  long space

 at length the injured dog in the comer
 stirred and geoff looked over at her

  lady he remarked  i wonder if i
 done right if i helped

chapter vii

from out the sand

  at eight oclock the next morning while
  geoff was mixing concrete and whis-
  tling his monotonously unchanging
  refrain a black motor car of unmistakable
  lines drove slowly in at the gate and up to
  the front door from where he stood be-
  side the cayleys unfinished garage he could
  get a straightaway view of the main drive
  and his whistling ceased while involuntarily
  his hand went up to the cap upon his head
  for the last time joseph benkard was re-
  turning to the home of his sister

    then the mason shook his head stubborn-
  ly to himself replaced the cap and turning
  his back went deliberately on with his work
  it was up to the family not him to show
  respect for their dead

    he heard the car drive away empty at
  a more brisk pace and a few minutes there-
  af ter came the sound of a second motor the
  familiar clatter of hanks station jitney
  geoff turned once more and stood staring
  while it passed the comer of the house front
  turned halted and in another moment re-
  appeared gathering speed as it lurched
  wildly toward the gates

    he caught just a glimpse of a command-
  ing figure with gray hair showing beneath
  an immaculate straw hat and a small point-
  ed gray beard from doc hoods descrip-
  tion that could be none other than mr
  newbury the family lawyer and he was
  evidendy in some haste to get to town

 geoff had bent to his task again when a
 genial voice hailed him and he looked up
 to find himself confronted by a red-haired
 freckle-faced young man who stood with
 his hat on the back of his head and his
 hands in his pockets regarding him with an
 infectiously good-natured smile

   hello buddie you the whole works
 around here he asked
above suspicion



      looks like it dont it

     the answering friendliness in geoffs tone
   offset the bluntness of the reply but his
   mild brown eyes narrowed slightly fresh
   young city feller in cheap store clothes nos-
   ing around where he had no business to be
   and asking fool question scrape ac-
   quaintance there could be only one expla-
   nation of his presence and he was probably
   the forerunner of a whole crew geoff went
   on mixing concrete

     sure does  the young man balanced
  himself nonchalantly on the edge of the
  wheelbarrow  been here since the job
  started

      off and on

     were you here yesterday morning
  when mr benkards body was found
  there must have been a lot of excitement
  around the place the young mans tone
  grew wheedling  tell us about it like a
  good fellow

      aint nothin to tell i didnt see no
   excitement folks kept cornin and goin
   but it wasnt none o my business and thats
   bout all i got time for

      geoff spoke with good-humored empha-
    sis but the other was impervious to hints

        didnt you get a look at the body be-
     fore it was moved what was the first you
     knew of the murder see here ill make it
     worth your while-

       young man geoff straightened and
    eyed him blandly  the only thing thats
    worth my while right now is to git this con-
    crete into the molds before she sets and
    ive got to have that wheelbarrer to do it
    reckon you better be goin on bout your
    business too whatever t is or zeke fos-
    ter the police lieutenant thats cornin down
    the drive might mistake you for one o these
    here city reporter fellers and hes death on

	em

       right-o thanks for the tip the
freckled youth slid off the barrow grinning
cheerfully even in defeat  you think it
 over and if youd like to talk to me when
sh you knock off for dinner ill be down by
 that tourists soft-drink stand on the main
if road

the red head disappeared among the
trees in the direction of the hedge zeke
mi foster had gone around the other side of

the house and geoff resumed his piping
whistle when again a voice greeted him
this time in low rich feminine tones

    good morning geoffrey

   he turned quickly removing his cap for
mrs cayleys guest vera sherwood stood
before him she was clad in a soft gray
gown and her face was colorless as marble
but the mass of red-brown hair glowed like
molten copper in the sun

   good momin maam geoff gave
her one of his rare smiles  i hope i aint
disturbin folks up at the house by workin
round out here but when i start a job i
like to git through with it

   i think most of us do she smiled
faintly in reply  i havent heard any one
complain although of course you have done
no work inside

    i puttered round a mite yestiddy fixin
 up things here and there while the folks
 was all busy havin conferences cause i
 reckoned the court ought to look as goods
 it could in case there was a big funeral
 mis cayley told me not to go on with the
 terrace yet so i started out here in the
 afternoon

   his bovine eyes were fixed on her inquir-
 ingly as though anxious for commendation
 on this thoughtfulness but she shook her
 head

   there wont be any funeral ceremony
here i understand mr benkards body
is to be removed very quietly she
paused  the notoriety-mrs cayley has
been much annoyed already by reporters
and curious strangers

    one o them there reporter fellers come
 snoopin round out here just now re-
 marked geoff  didnt git nothin out o
 me though maam taint my business
  i know mrs cayley will appreciate
 your not talking to any of them the lo-
 cal police lieutenant has been instructed to
 keep them off the place oh

   miss sherwood caught herself up with a
little catch in her breath and stood staring
as though she could scarcely believe her
eyes geoff followed the direction of her
gaze and saw a tall athletic figure striding
toward them across the lawn he appeared
to be a man in the early thirties and al-
though he was a stranger there seemed


argosy-allstory weekly

something familiar in the smooth-shaven
clean-cut features and eager boyish blue
eyes which brought a vague impression to
the stonemasons mind it deepened to a
certainty as the newcomer neared them and
he smiled to himself once more and then
turned and moved off out of sight

  adrian miss sherwood exclaimed in
a low agitated tone  i-i thought you
were in canada

   i reached home last night georgette
told me of-of what had taken place out
here and i found her all packed up and
waiting and this morning we came out and
opened up the old manor house at the cor-
ners youve never seen it but harper and
i were bom and grew up there you know
until we went to college

   georgette thought there might be for-
malities connected with this horrible affair
which would make it necessary for any one
who had been in the house when it hap-
pened to remain in the neighborhood for a
few days at least and she wont hear of
your staying on here another hour

  his voice was firm but there was an un-
mistakably revealing note of tenderness in
it which told its own story  ive come to
take you home

   now oh adrian i couldnt as
the only outsider the only guest at the time
it is inevitable that i shall come in for a
certain share of questioning and notoriety
and i cannot drag your sister-in-law into
it as kind as she has been to me

  real distress made the young womans
rich tones quiver

   i must think of mrs cayley too she
has only her daughter a mere girl and i
could not leave her alone in this terrible
hour after accepting her invitation to visit
her here

   i dont see why you did adrian ex-
claimed impulsively  youre not an in-
timate friend of hers and they were never
in our set in town oh my dear i am not
criticiing your actions or your choice of
associates but it maddens me to think of
your being connected however remotely
with the hideous mess and scandal this case
is bound to be before it is settled

   that is all the more reason why i
would not think of going to georgette now

but i fail to see why you should draw such
a conclusion adrian a-a frightful trag-
edy has taken place certainly but why
you think a hideous scandal must ensue-
she spoke in warningly cold accents but
her companion was too vehemently in earn-
est to heed

   because i knew the mans reputation
i knew what was whispered about him on
the street what is being shouted now from
the housetops have you seen the papers
this morning do you know that one des-
picable yellow sheet had the audacity to
hint that you-that a possible engagement
might-

  adrian indignation and a sort of
shocked horror rang in her tones but be-
fore she could speak again the cheerful re-
iteration of a whistled refrain sounded from
the rear and geoff marched around the cor-
ner of the garage he hesitated in awkward
embarrassment and his eyes traveled from
the couple standing before him to his con-
crete mixing paraphernalia as if he were
uncertain what to do

   miss sherwoods pale face flushed vivid-
ly and she moved as though to retreat but
her companion stood staring at the mason

   havent i seen you before he asked
 i mean arent you a native hereabout
i used to live near a good many years ago
geoff chuckled

   reckon youve seen me all right mr
middleton he replied  i was speakin
o your old home only last night at least
o the folks you rented it to a couple o
year back when you and your brother
was kids we all used to go swimmin down
behind the big rock-

   and once when i was taken with a
cramp you fished me out and saved my
life adrian middleton advanced with
outstretched hand  youre geoffrey pe-
ters good lord after all these years
im mighty glad to see you again

   same here mr middleton

  geoff wiped his plaster-smeared hand on
his overalls and clasped the one extended
to him

    i heard tell that your brother had died
four or five year ago he was a mite older
than you or me but i recollect him s if it
was yestiddy

                          a
above suspicion



   yes his widow came down this morn-
ing to open the old house for the summer
miss sherwood and she live together in
new york you know just think vera
we played with each other when we were
kids

  he turned to her and die smiled warmly

  so i gathered she said  i knew
that geoffrey was a native here

   youve gone on with your fathers old
trade i see middleton glanced compre-
hensively about him and then back to geoff
 our place needs fixing up and my sister-
in-law will want a lot of work done as
soon as your job here is finished or you
can get away if it isnt too far to the cor-
ners-

   twasnt too far when your ma used
to give treats for the village kids and i
reckon there aint nobuddy id rather work
for now than any folks o yours geoff re-
sponded u dunno how soon i kin git away
here but whenever the contractor sends out
a new gang o bis own men ill go over and
see what mrs harper middleton wants
done

   fine youll find miss sherwood
there too and ill probably be down miss
sherwood is coming home to-day

  the last remark was obviously intended
for the benefit of the young woman but
she shook her head smiling wanly

   not so long as mrs cayley needs me
here adrian

  she spoke with a finality which brooked
no denial and turned to the house and
middleton prepared to follow

   dont forget geoffrey as soon as you
can leave here that old place of ours will
keep you busy for the rest erf the summerl

  he strode off and the mason stood gaz-
ing after them with a soft light glowing
deep in his eyes until they had mounted the
terrace steps and disappeared within then
in an absent-minded fashion he returned to
his work once more but he whistled no
longer and the concrete molds filled slowly

  no two-faced letty appeared to offer en-
ticing refreshments at noon and geoff con-
sumed his dinner in peace under the shade
of a near-by tree then wandered down to-
ward the boathouse it struck him as odd
that he had caught no glimpse of young
 a

rupert ashe hanging about the place and
it occurred to him that the boy might be
waiting at the last rendezvous in the hope
of being able to communicate with mildred

cayley

  the place was silent and deserted how-
ever and he had started to retrace his steps
when on the farther side of the boathouse
high up on the strip of beach near where it
merged into a growth of rank coarse grasses
a tiny heap of driftwood piled up as no
steamers backwash would have left it met
his eye he sauntered over to it and idly
kicked the sticks and bits of board aside
to find beneath them a low mound of sand
no bigger than his two hands but packed
down tightly as though something had been
buried there

  curious he knelt and began to dig but
a few scoops with the flat piece of wood
which he had picked up to serve as a shovel
brought to light that which made him sit
back on his heels with a gasp of surprise
it was just a soft wad of some glossy black
fabric but when he finally pulled it out
and unrolled it a gaping rent appeared in
its surface a jagged tear into which that
scrap in his tobacco sack at home would
have fitted with nice exactitude

   geoff stuffed it inside his shirt and glan-
cing around him he rose scuffing the sand
about until the shallowr hole was complete-
ly filled there was a look of stern gravity
on his face as he strode hastily along the
back path which would lead out behind the
garage there was an expression almost o
pain in his kindly eyes but his jaw was set
resolutely when he reached his destina-
tion he took up his work again doggedly
ignoring the unsightly bulge on his chest
beneath the coarse shirt

  well on toward the middle of the after-
noon a smart sedan rolled up the driveway
to the house front with a sedate chauffeur
in dark livery behind the wheel geoff
could not discern whether it carried one or
more passengers and in a few minutes it
departed in the direction of the village

   if it were seeking jakes service station
and the public garage adjoining the indi-
cations were that the new arrival or arriv-
als intended to remain but the solitary
worker did not go near the house it was


argosy-allstory weekly

    none of his business and moreover curi-
    osity had led him into assuming enough re-
    sponsibility for one day

      he continued his labors uninterruptedly
    until the six oclock whistles blew but dr
    hood did not put in an appearance and
    at last he made everything shipshape for
    his return the following morning and start-
    ed for home a few yards beyond the
    gates however the medical examiners dis-
    reputable little car came in sight and geoff
    waited until it had pulled up beside him

      phew ive had a day of it geoff
    the doctor exclaimed  hows everything
    been going up there

     he nodded toward the cayley estate
   and geoff responded

       dunno doc i aint been up to the
  house at all but -worked steady on the ga-
  rage zeke foster didnt come a nigh me
  he was busy keeping folks off the place that
  hadnt no business to be there but one
  slipped past him and tackled me-a young
  reporter feller from the city i got shut o
  him quick though and then that lady visi-
  tor miss sherwood come along and stopped
  to say  good mornin real pleasant-
  spoken she is with no more airs than if
  shed been livin here to the cove all her
  life have you talked with her

     i saw her for a few minutes yesterday--
  just long enough to have her corroborate
  mrs cayleys story of how they all spent
  the evening before the murder she didnt
  hear anything during the night she said
  and only knew what had happened when
  letty came up to break the news to mrs
  cayley miss sherwoods a mighty hand-
  some young woman the doctor comment-
  ed  was she the only one of the house-
  hold you had any conversation with geoff
  whats become of sergeant eliot

   aint laid eyes on him all day nor on
any o the folks from the house except miss
sherwood but while she was talkin to me
a fine-lookin city feller come to see her
and who do you spose twas

  geoff described the meeting with adrian
middleton and their mutual recognition
also the conversation which he had over-
heard from the rear of the garage the
doctor listened attentively until its conclu-
sion then he remarked

         i read that article in the paper hinting
     at what it called  a budding romance be-
     tween the financier and a charming society
     girl who is reported to be a guest at his sis-
     ters home where the murder took place
     that was all it didnt mention her name
     there but an earlier paragraph had given
     a list of every one known to have been in
     the house at the approximate time of the
     tragedy so it might as well have come out
     with it middleton seemed pretty indig-
     nant about it from what you say-jealous
     eh

         kinder looks more to me s if he hated
     the idee o a friend gittin in the scandal
     geoff pushed back his cap and scratched his
     head reflectively  theres one thing sure
     he didnt have no use for benkard did
     you find that feller wyckoff and git any no-
     tion from him bout how benkard and lane
     have been workin their deals doc and was
     there any failures long bout the time they
     made any big killins

      i found wyckoff dr hood replied
  slowly and a certain grim expression came
  over his round genial countenance  he
  isnt a member of the stock exchange any
  more hes clerking in another brokerage
  house and his children who used to run
  wild and as happy as the day was long over
  the old middleton place are cooped up in
  a bronx flat benkard ruined him

      land o liberty  geoffs jaw dropped
  and his habitual drawl vanished  to
  think we should a picked out him to go to
  when did it happen was lane mixed up
  in it

     no it was just after that summer
  down here wyckoffs not like dunn hes
  a fighter and if there had been anything
  illegal about the business benkard would
  have been behind the bars now instead of
  in his coffin it was worse geoff it was
  an abuse of friendship

      wyckoff trusted him accepted his tips
 passed them on to his customers and found
 himself all at once on the wrong side of the
 market then the crash came that was
 benkards secret of success to win the con-
 fidence of a lot of the less important brok
 ers who catered to small speculators by let
 ting them know in advance the truth about
 what he and his crowd was going to do and

of course they would follow his lead and
make money for a time then without
warning he would betray them and wipe
them out and the law couldnt touch
him

   i aint sprised none observed geoff
dryly  kinder had the opinion benkard
was that sort o feller but if it happened
once you wouldnt a thought anybuddy
would trust him sos he could work it
again

   thats the worst of it no one believes
the man who fails they think hes just a
poor loser and try in to put the responsi-
bility on somebody else

  the doctors voice was stem

   i got the names of two other firms
wyckoff says went under because of ben-
kard but i couldnt locate the heads of
them robbins  boone one was and
lang  lacey i got enough from wyck-
off anyway about the past he told me
a funny thing too that i cant just fit in
with the rest of it until about a year ago
lane and benkard were bitter enemies not
personal ones but in their trading for
years each has been trying to push the other
to the wall and then all of a sudden-no-
body knows how nor why-they got to-
gether and theyve been hand in glove ever
since

   if theyre doing anything actually
crooked i couldnt get a line on it wyck-
off sent me to another broker who might
know but i had to wait until after the mar-
ket dosed to see him and then he either
couldnt or wouldnt talk i tried to look
up some other folks wyckoff told me about
and thats what kept me so late but they
were out of town

   taint my business but if twas i
reckon id like to know what made ben-
kard and lane filfcndly after fightin each
other for so long taint in human nater
onless theres somethin back o it

  geoff rested one of his capacious feet on
the running board

   did you git anybuddy to find out bout
what lane did after he driv away maddern
a wet hen on the night o the murder

   yes i stopped in at police headquar-
ters and they put a man on it for me re-
plied the doctor  hes driving out in a
car to meet me around eleven to-night down
by the picnic grove want to come along
you were the first to get an idea that lane
might have come back night before last
and id be glad to have your opinion

   s long as you ask me id kinder like
to hear what he has to say course he
neednt to know doc that im just workin
round the place and aint got nothin to do
with your case

  geoff paused and he did not see the fat
little doctor smile to himself in the gather-
ing dusk he added suddenly  that law-
yer feller newbury went to town right
after the body was brought back this morn-
ing

   he took the same train i did but he
didnt see me dr hood chuckled  i
was careful to keep out of his sight and
when we got to the city i trailed him
first time in all my experience i ever tried
that but it wasnt so hard because he
wasnt suspecting anything you were
right geoff though how you figured it out
from just a hint of that lettys beats me
where do you think he went straight to
ohares private detective agency

 iv-the persistence of percival jayne

the mystery surrounding the hodge
case might never have been dis-
pelled if it had not been for the
persistence of percival jayne the younger
member of the banking firm of hodge 
jayne he it was who followed every step
in the solution of the puzzle with a fasci-
nated interest that was almost sordid in its
intensity it brought out an unexpected
side of his character in the small world
of finance jayne was noted for his thor-
oughness in getting to the heart of a prob-

lem in the early stages of the hodge
tragedy it was felt that he was urged on
and on by this same characteristic

  the thing that upset so many well-
ordered lives happened late in the afternoon
of the last day of the then old year perci-
val jayne had an appointment to meet
hodge at the country home of the banker
at hedgewater they were closing up the
business and the venerable man had made
all arrangements for turning over his share
in the business to the young financier

the first story of this series appeared in the argosy-allstory weekly for october 

	
the adventures of peabody smith



  it was to be a gift-a new years pres-
ent well worth receiving jayne arrived
precisely at the hour appointed-four thir-
ty in the afternoon he pressed the electric
button with a smile on his lips and the
door was opened by the butler who burst
into tears at sight of his visitor

   why ambrose exclaimed jayne
 what in the world is the matter

  the answer came in one expressive and
dramatic sentence

   mr hodge has been murdered-hes
lying dead on the floor of the sun room 
percival jayne acted with promptness
and decision he asked for no details he
did not even pause to look at the body
but going to the long-distance telephone
he summoned peabody smith the famous
investigator late of the united states se-
cret service and now retired after years of
fine service peabody had once run down
a bond theft for the banking firm and he
was acquainted with hodge and the young
partner begged him to come down to
hedgewater on the score of friendship he
hesitated for the fraction of a minute but
ended by accepting and promised to hurry
down on the next train and when that
train pulled in at the quiet rural town he
was the first man to alight

  it was an agitated percival jayne who
poured his tale into the ears of peabody
smith as they rode the short distance be-
tween the railway station and the country
home of the dead banker the young
financier was haggard and distracted there
were dark lines under his big black eyes
and his well-manicured hands trembled

  the veteran detective was calm cool and
collected he looked more like a retired
business man than a professional thief
catcher and the red carnation in his but-
tonhole and the opal in the old-rose tie
gave him a debonair appearance that just
escaped the suspicion of rakishness

   but jayne he protested  you have
the local police down here what was the
big idea in dragging me out of my well-
earned retirement

   because you knew the old man was
  the fervent reply u and because you are
  the one man that can solve the mystery
  the chief of police is at the bouse already

but i want you because im sure you will
leave no stone unturned

  the car turned into a graveled driveway
and the two men found themselves in the

portico of the hodge homestead the
shadow of death was visible on every side
it was paraded in the expression of the
solemn-faced butler who admitted them
and in the drawn shades in all of the win-
dows peabody and jayne walked rapidly
through the corridors to the officelike addi-
tion at the far side of the house two ob-
jects informed the detective that he was
at the scene of the crime the first was
the silent form under a white sheet in the
corner of the room the second was a red-
faced fidgety very-much-alive individual
who came to meet them

   hello kelly exclaimed peabody  i
see that you are on the job

  the chief of police of hedgewater nod-
ded stiffly

  yes he growled keeping it warm
and getting ready to play second fiddle to
you

  the detective conjured up his most en-
gaging smile

   im just a friend of the family he
said soothingly and with gentlemanly men-
dacity  its your case kelly and i only
ask the privilege of helping to the extent of
my ability

  the official vanity was appeased the
local dignitary thawed out at once  im
really glad to have you mr smith i got
here ten minutes after the body was found
and not a thing in the room has been dis-
turbed i heard youd been called in and
i thought youd like to start your own way
besides with a grin  if i havent done
anything you cant accuse me of pullin any
bones

  jayne asked to be excused and as he
did so peabody smith got down on one
knee and lifted the sheet from the body
samuel hodge looked more impressive in
death than he had in life the face rigid
now seemed as though it had been carved
by a sculptor with practical swiftness the
detective took in every detail of the inani-
mate form an ugly bruise on the left
side of the temple indicated that it had
been struck with some hard substance


argosy-allstory weekly

     smith pausing for a moment looked
   about him the room was in disorder as
   though a struggle had preceded death the
   drawer of a roll-topped desk was slightly
   open

      what do you make of it he asked
   his colleague

      chief kelly reflectively rubbed the palm
    of his brawny hand across his broad blue-
    black chin

       burglary he said finally  youll
   notice that the glass window in that door-
   way has been smashed besides four hun-
   dred dollars have been taken from that
   drawer

      how do you know

      because jayne tells me the old man
   cashed a check for that amount in order
   to make presents to-morrow he kept his
   money in that drawer its all gone now

        i see said smith assentingly but still
    keeping his eyes on the prostrate form on
    the floor

     what he saw was an expensive diamond
 pin in the tie of the dead man and a hand-
 some gold watch chain hanging from the
 pocket of his waistcoat if robbery was
 the motive how did it come that the mur-
 derer had left valuables that could be had
 for the taking

   presently the detective arose and made
 a second survey of the room he gave a
 particular scrutiny to the floor not a
 square inch of it escaped his keen eyes
 the net result of his search was two ragged
 bits of parchmentlike paper-the sort of
 paper that is used in legal documents he
 deposited them carefully in his large wallet
 and placed that in turn in the breast pocket
 of his coat kelly watched the perform-
 ance curiously

    blank pieces of paper he comment-
 ed disdainfully

 they are not to be despised chief
retorted the detective  you must not
forget that the greatest war in the worlds
history was caused by contempt for what
was called a  scrap of paper 

  war isnt the same as murder

  i should say that it was murder on a
wholesale scale but thats neither here
nor there tell me who are the people in
the house

        well said kelly  there is miss al-
      len hodges niece ambrose berrello the
      butler mrs harkins the housekeeper and
      jim moody the chauffeur mrs harkins
      was out when the thing happened and
      moody was fired this morning

        have you talked with any of them

         yes and their stories all agree hodge
    was alone in this room for a long while
    going over business matters at twenty
    minutes after four the butler was passing
    and looked in and found the old man on
    the floor

       peabody smith was not yet through with
    the officelike apartment in which samuel
    hodge had been killed he moved rapidly
    around the sparsely furnished room there
    was a roll-topped desk against the wall and
    in front of it a swivel chair the desk was
    closed and the chair had evidently been
    thrown out of place if there had been a
    struggle it must have been brief there
    were two windows looking out on the lawn
    and a doorway containing two large panes
    of glass one of these panes had been
    broken smith got down on his hands and
    knees and minutely examined the shattered
    glass

     kelly watched him closely

       thats how the fellow got in declared
  the hedge water man  when he smashed
  the pane of glass it gave him the chance
  to put his hand through the window and
  open the door

     that sounds reasonable agreed smith
  but he still remained on the floor examining
  the broken glass with fascinated interest

    the door was closed after a while the
  detective opened it and going outside
  stooped down and closely scrutinized the
  ground it seemed as though he would
  never finish the examination kelly was
  visibly restless he could not understand
  why the detective should spend so much
  time on an obvious thing but as he ner-
  vously paced to and fro he made a discov-
  ery that caused him to shout with joy

     look out there  he cried with ill-
  concealed impatience pointing to the snow-
  covered ground

     what is it asked smith with a foolish
 grin

     footprints exclaimed kelly  foot-
the adventures of peabody smith



prints all the way from the house to the
garage

  it was as he said a light snow had
fallen that morning and the telltale marks
were there with a distinctness that could
not be overlooked by the most obtuse de-
tector of crime smith did not ignore them
on the contrary he gave them the most
careful attention they were large foot-
prints and the center of each one was filled
with little lines the snow had been slight-
ly stained with mud but in spite of that
the tiny crisscross marks were perfectly vis-
ible

  smith followed them slowly until they
reached to the very door of the garage he
went into the little frame building but
found nothing unusual there a door on
the other side opened out on to a graveled
path and beyond this the snow-covered
lawn sloped down to the river bank the
path which led in a circular direction to
the house was barren of snow the tiny
flakes had evidently melted as fast as they
fell on the stones

  the detective returned to the officelike
room in a reflective frame of mind but as
he entered he paused once again to examine
the broken glass

  half an hour later he was gently ques-
tioning may allen the niece of the dead
man she was a frail little body apparent-
ly all but crushed by the awful tragedy
that had suddenly entered her life she
sat in a great upholstered chair her blue
eyes fastened on the detective trying hard
to compose her feelings and intelligently
answer his questions

   miss alien began peabody in the
low voice with which one might address
a little child  do you know whether mr
hodge had any enemies in this part of the
country

   i dont think he had an enemy in the
world she answered with a pathetic show
of spirit  everybody in this house loved
him and he was liked by all the neigh-
bors

   has anything happened lately that
might lead to this-to this tragedy

   not to my knowledge she answered
 we have all been talking lately about
robberies in the neighborhood there have

been a number of holdups and crimes of
that kind

  smith paused for a while then resinned
quietly

  i am told that moody the chauffeur
was dismissed this morning do you know
why

   he was not dismissed he was laid off
for the winter that was an odd notion of
uncles heretofore he has kept him all
the year round but you know he was re-
tiring from business this year and he prob-
ably thought it an unnecessary expense as
he used the car very little during the win-
ter

   has moody been with your uncle
long

   about ten years

   how did he take his-lay-off

  miss allen hesitated a moment before
replying when she spoke it was in a re-
luctant manner  very badly i am sorry
to say he complained saying that he mas
being badly treated after all of his years
of faithful service uncle answered him
shortly and then moody became abusive
did he make threats

   yes she answered in her subdued
manner  he threatened to get even

  at this stage in the examination percival
jayne entered the room still very pale but
more composed than when he had greeted
peabody at the station

  the detecdve called to him  mr
jayne he said  i suppose you can give
us a good description of moody the chauf-
feur

   certainly-but im afraid youre wast-
ing time in going after him moody had
his faults but he would never be guilty of
anything like this

   maybe not but kindly give the descrip-
tion to chief kelly there and he will know
what to do with it

  the head of the police stepped aside and
listened to the description given him by the
banker five minutes later he was on the
telephone talking to the metropolitan po-
lice before the hour had struck the police
of two hundred cities were combing their
districts in the effort to locate the dismissed
chauffeur

  mrs harkins the housekeeper was next


argosy-allstory weekly

  placed on the grill but every time she
 spoke as has been said of an eminent
 statesman she subtracted from the sum of
 human knowledge mrs harkins wept
 constantly and wrung her hands and rocked
 to and fro and persisted in telling of the
 effect the tragedy had on her nervous sys-
 tem she was mortally offended when she
 she was asked to  keep to the point
 because she felt that the chief purpose of
 the inquiry must be to ascertain the state
 of her personal feelings smith dropped
 her with a sigh of relief and called for
 ambrose berrello the butler

    berrello was a man with a smooth-shaven
 face and coal-black eyes that smoldered in
 their sockets beneath a pair of bushy eye-
 brows he was a perfect type of the well-
 trained servant with his emotions well un-
 der control yet his slightest movement
 was expressive the rolling of those won-
 derful eyes spoke volumes and the merest
 shrug of his broad shoulders conveyed
 endless possibilities he talked fluently
 clearly but always with the air of one who
 answers all questions fully without volun-
 teering information

   yes he was bom and raised in italy
 likewise it was true that he was connected
 with patriotic organizations in that coun-
 try nor did he deny that he was affiliated
 with certain secret societies in the lnited
 states but he had always tried to do his
 duty toward mr hodge he said that he
 had passed the little room about four
 oclock and noticed his employer engaged
 in going over some papers he was posi-
 tive that mr hodge was alone in the of-
 fice at ten minutes after four because he
 had looked at his watch at the time at
 twenty minutes after four he discovered his
 employer lying dead on the floor

   xow ambrose said peabody  did
 you notice anything in particular about the
 appearance of the room when you passed
 the first time

  the italian was silent for some moments
 the first time he commented thought-
 fully  the lid of the desk was open and
 the last time it was closed

   well remarked the detective  the
 only significance about that might have
 been that mr hodge having completed his

business might have naturallv closed bis

desk

  the mention of the desk suggested the
desirability of examining its contents the
key was missing and could not be found
without any ceremony it was broken open
everything was found in order indicating
the careful habits of the owner on the
blotter was a sheet of legal paper it was
signed and witnessed and it transferred mr
hodges interest in his banking business to
percival jayne without any consideration
whatever and as a reward of years of faith-
ful service

  that practically closed the case for the
dav

ii

  it was at the earnest invitation of per-
cival jayne that smith remained at the
hedgewater house overnight the two men
sat up late and it was while they were
smoking their final cigar that the young
financier asked the detective what progress
he had made

  he was told of the various discoveries
and for the first time a smile of satisfac-
tion appeared upon his haggard face  i
knew youd get down to it he said  it
seems to me youve got a complete case
already

   its far from complete-and besides
we havent got the man yet

  jatie nodded comprehendingly  that
is true are there ever cases where they
fail to get the man

   well said smith cautiously  i have
heard of such cases

  the young man paused to light his cigar
which had gone out when he spoke again
it was in a challenging tone of voice if
that be true what becomes of the conten-
tion that murder will out

   i hardly know confessed the detec-
tive slowly  but i suppose in some way
and at some time every- crime is discov-
ered

   i dont believe it was the sharp re-
joinder  in my opinion that is simply
an old copybook maxim that will not bear
analysis its like that ancient theory of
the victims blood flowing when the body is
touched by the assassin thats rank su-
the adventures of peabody smith



perstition and nobody takes any stock in
it nowadays but even yet some people are
fooled by the science of deduction and such
nonsense

  smith was surprised at the earnestness of
the attack he smiled at percival jayne
 and in the face of all this you call on
me to solve the mvsterv of samuel hodges
death

   well exclaimed the young man  you
are on trial as far as this case is concerned
you have not one but several clews will
you solve the mystery

   time will tell grinned the old man

   maybe it will replied the skeptic
 but pm sure of one thing if you dont
discover the murderer no other man will

  smith rose to prepare to retire  per-
cival he said gravely  thats the nicest
thing youve said to-night and i believe
you mean every word of it

iii

  shortly after breakfast the next morn-
ing kelly returned to the house in a state
of great excitement the river tide just
below the hodge home had washed up a
pair of muddy rubber shoes the local
policeman carried them to smith wrapped
in a newspaper he turned them over to
the detective with pride glowing from his
eyes

   they may mean nothing he said  or
they may mean everything its up to you

to say

  peabody smith was intently interested
in this new exhibit he cautioned his fel-
low worker to keep the news of the dis-
covery from every one in the house and
at the same time contrived to get several
pairs of old shoes belonging to the various
members of the household

  the next proceeding was to compare the
shoes of ambrose berrello with the strange
rubbers it was found that the rubber
would not go over the butlers shoe the
one was at least two sizes larger than the
other the final test was in the garage
the footgear of the chauffeur was tested
his shoes were so big that it would have
been a physical impossibility to have cov-
ered them with the rubbers

   well sighed smith  well have to
compare the rubbers with the footprints
between the house and the garage

  the policeman and the detective started
at the work in a more or less perfunctory
manner but they had not gone far when
both experienced the thrill that comes with
the discovery of a clew the rubbers fitted
precisely into the footprints more than
that the rough soles of the rubbers pro-
duced exactly the kind of crisscross marks
that had been found on the snow-covered
lawn

  smith and kelly looked at one another
significantly

  were getting warmer exclaimed the
hedgewater man with a smile that threat-
ened to extend from ear to ear

   wrere certainly fairly warm for such a
cold day agreed the detective as he rose
from the ground

  while they were talking the door of the
house opened and miss allen came out
on the lawn

  smith walked over to meet her holding
the odd bit of evidence behind him  miss
allen he said gently  i do not want to
startle you but would like you to give me
some information

   ill be glad to tell you all i know
she replied with a slight catch in her oice

  the detective produced the rubbers and
held them in front of the girl with some-
thing like a dramatic flourish  did you
ever see these shoes before he asked

  she leaned over and scrutinized the mud-
dy rubbers very attentively

  the tears came to her eyes  they-
they are the rubbers that were worn by
mr hodge he kept them in his little
office almost constantly

   you are certain

   positive was the reply  i could not
mistake them we often laughed at uncle
samuel for wearing such old-fashioned
things

   that is all miss allen said the de-
tective  we will not trouble you any fur-
ther

  five minutes later smith and kelly were
alone in the officelike room they stared
at one another in silence for many mo-
ments


argosy-allstory weekly

   well exclaimed the policeman impa-
tiently  i thought you would be pleased
whats the matter

   matter enough ejaculated smith
 weve discovered something but it leaves
me more puzzled than ever

   why asked the other blankly

   cant you see they are undoubtedly
the rubbers that made the marks on the
snow but how could they have been worn
by hodge how could a dead man walk
from the house to the garage

   i dont know was the feeble reply
 unless he walked across the lawn before
he was killed

   walked fiddlesticks and even if he
did how is it that they found themselves
in the river hodge was not the kind of
man to throw away his belongings he was
too careful for that thrift was his middle
name and as you see these rubbers are
not worn out weve found something
new but all it has done is to thicken the
plot

  a telephone call prevented further dis-
cussion of that point it brought impor-
tant information jim moody the chauf-
feur had been arrested and was being
brought to hedgewater he arrived half
an hour later in the custody of a plain-
clothes man from the city he was a young
man with traces of dissipation on a rather
good-looking face smith brought him into
the death chamber and proceeded to cross-
examine him

   you were dismissed yesterday morn-
ing said the detective  and before you
quit the house you talked to mr hodge in
a threatening manner

   that is true was the frightened re-
sponse  but i didnt mean anything by
it im sorry because mr hodge treated
me decently and i wouldnt harm him for
the world i was in a rage at the time but
what i said was just hot air

   but you see the position it places you
in now

  i do but ill swear that i hadnt any-
thing to do with his death

   moody im going to ask you a ques-
tion and i want a truthful answer did
you leave the premises at once or did you
linger around here

  the chauffeur hesitated a moment then
he threw out his hands impulsively and ex-
claimed

   i stayed-i didnt leave until the half
past four train

  chief kelly almost bounded from his
chair at this admission but smith remained
perfectly quiet a smile played around his
lips

   thats right-i want the truth where
were you most of the time

   i was in the garage i slept for a time
and then began to pack my things

   did you see any one else around the
garage while you were there

   yes some time after four oclock
some one came out of the house and passed
through the garage and went out of the
door leading to the river bank i was
sleeping at the time but i got up and
looked out and saw him walking along the
graveled path

   did you get a look at his face

   i did not all i know is that he wore
a gray overcoat and that be seemed very
much agitated

   would you know the overcoat if you
happened to see it again

   i think i would

  thats all exclaimed the detective
with a note of victory in his voice  i
think we have every link in the chain com-
pleted kelly if you will call all the
household together in the drawing-room we
will present them with the results of our
investigation

  it was an expectant group that gathered
a few minutes later mrs harkins the
housekeeper aggressively dominated the
scene and beside her stood miss allen still
grieving and half frightened at the dra-
matic aspect of the meeting percival
jayne occupied the fringe of the little
tableau and just behind him were ambrose
berrello the butler and jim moody the
chauffeur

  the darkness of the rooms was only par-
tially relieved by a few candles in brackets
on the sides of the walls it was pictur-
esque but under the circumstances it gave
most of the actors a creepy feeling pea-
body smith appeared with something of
the air of a conjurer about to take a rabbit
the adventures of peabody smith



out of a hat but before the exhibition
opened the detective did a strange thing
he turned to kelly and whispered to him
in a stage voice that could be distinctly
heard by every one

   chief he said  after a while i wish
you would go up to the second story front
room and bring me down a seal ring that i
left on the bureau

 as he said these words he melted into
the darkness and unobserved gained a
back stairway and almost ran into the bed-
room he slipped into a half-opened closet
and watched he did not have long to
wait presently the door opened and a
man crept into the room walking on tiptoe
he moved over to the bureau and began
nervously pawing the articles that stood
there

  evidently he did not find what he want-
ed because he turned to the drawers of
the mahogany stand and opened them one
after another all of this did not take
more than a minute and when he left the
room the bowed head and sagging shoul-
ders spelled disappointment as plainly as
though he had shouted it at the top of his
voice

 peabody smith managed to get back to
the drawing-room before the mysterious one
had resumed his place in the circle clear-
ing his throat he said

  fm going to try and reproduce the
scene that took place here yesterday af-
ternoon and ill do it as briefly as possible
at four oclock samuel hodge was alone
in his little office going over some papers
preparatory to meeting percival jayne to
whom he was to turn over his business as
most of you know

   mrs harkins and miss allen were out
ambrose berrello was taking his afternoon
siesta in his room in the attic and jim
moody was asleep in the garage now
most of you are acquainted with many of
the details of this story and if i make any
errors i want to be corrected

   about fifteen minutes after four some
one rang the doorbell and hodge answered
it the caller had business with him and
was escorted into the little office there
was a dispute between them a struggle
and the visitor struck samuel hodge a vio-

lent blow on the temple-a blow that killed
him it was not premeditated but it was
a murder just the same terrified by the
tragedy he did not know what to do at
first

   but he recovered quickly and then
came the instinct of self-preservation and
he began to cover up his tracks his first
move was to add to the disorder of the
room he would make it appear as though
a burglar had entered and killed hodge for
his money

  to give color to this he abstracted
four hundred dollars in bank notes from
the drawer of the desk but he made the
error of permitting the diamond stickpin
and the watch and chain to remain on the
body of his victim

   he pulled down the lid of the desk and
then most realistic move of all he smashed
the pane of glass of the door leading into
the room from the garden that might
have been enough for any ordinary person
but this murderer was no ordinary person
he had the dramatic instinct in a high
degree

   it was necessary for him to leave the
house he noticed a pair of rubbers on
the floor why not depart by the back
door as a burglar would and at the same
time leave a series of footprints on the
snow-covered ground to confuse astute in-
vestigators

   he did this and he walked through the
garage without as he thought disturbing
moody who was asleep in the loft he
threw the rubbers into the river then glided
away by the graveled path which failed to
photograph his real footprints

  percival jayne who had listened to this
recital with distended eyes and white face
gave a nervous laugh  that is a very
interesting story but-but you havent got
your man

  oh yes i have retorted peabody
smith with a confident toss of his head
 hes in this room at this minute

   and his name-

   his name exclaimed the detective
pointing a long finger directly at the speak-
er  is percival jayne

  the look on the mans face was terrify-
ing everybody in the room instinctively


argosy-allstory weekly

drew away from him as though he were
some loathsome thing

  he laughed shrilly  youre-youre a
poor humorist smith he mumbled  it
has been distinctly proven that i reached
the house after the murder and was admit-
ted by the butler

   yes admitted the detective  and you
came to the front door by way of the grav-
eled path-the path that you thought would
tell no tales

   but the motive shouted jayne
u what motive could i have had for such
a thing i was to get the business and
the paper you found on the desk transferred
it to me

  smith nodded thoughtfully

   a point well taken but it can be ex-
plained quickly hodge found that you
had been systematically robbing the firm
the discovery changed all of his plans he
told you he was going to destroy the trans-
fer papers and have you arrested besides
you struggled with him to get possession
of the paper two fragments of the docu-
ment were torn off then you struck him
on the temple with your seal ring and he
fell dead

   how can you prove that fantastic
story

   i have here two pieces of parchment
paper that i found on the floor they
exactly fit the document which you after-
ward laid inside the desk for me to discover
later

  jaynes face was horribly distorted and
the cold sweat stood out on his brow
 even if this wild story is true it does not
make me the man

  the detective turned to the chauffeur
who had been listening with wide-open
eyes

   moody you remember that coat do
you see anything like it in this room

   yes was the instant reply  the
coat that mr jayne is wearing is the one
that i saw on the man yesterday after-
noon 

  jayne made one last attempt to wriggle
out of the net of facts which was slowly but
surely enmeshing him

   ladies and gentlemen he said halting-
ly  we-we must use reason is it rea-

sonable that i should bring this man down
here if i had been guilty of this crime i-
i ask you is it reasonable

  before any one could answer peabody

smith made reply

   that was your fatal blunder and you
owe it to your own vanity you thought
you had established a perfect alibi you
are not the first crook who has made that
mistake you felt that it would put the
finishing touch on your work if you would
boldly come to me and ask me to find the
murderer that you imagined would be
the final step in utterly throwing suspicion
from you

    its a lie  shouted the distracted man
 its all a lie  i didnt do it i tell you
i didnt do it

   the detective stared at him out of his re-
morseless steel-gray eyes

   if you were innocent demanded
smith  why did you run upstairs when i
told kelly to get the seal ring on the bu-
reau

   but there was no ring on the bureau
 certainly not that was all a bluff to
clinch my case i knew the guilty man
would attempt to recover possession of that
bit of evidence it was the weapon-if
we may call a ring a weapon-with which
the crime was committed

    i hid the ring unconsciously confessed
the culprit  and i could not find it

   youre telling the truth at last tri-
umphantly exclaimed the detective  you
knew that the wound on hodges temple
would correspond exactly with the seal on
your ring and you hid it but there
was something else that you couldnt hide
 what-what was that shivered per-
cival jayne

  smith grasped his trembling hand he
pointed to the third finger

   it was that bluish mark around your
finger where the ring had been worn its
as plain as the nose on your face it made
the ring conspicuous by its absence and
you couldnt hide that scratch on the back
of your hand you made when you smashed
the pane of glass

  it was after jayne had collapsed and
confessed that chief kelly asked peabody
smith how he got his first clew

immortal frauds careemutumonger

by captain horatio wragge

no goldsmith in the fifteenth century seemed quite so enterprising or so rich as a certain herr
fust he was always inquiring into the merits of any new thing that came along and invest-
ing his money in it his home was in the german city of mentz but about the year  he
turned up in the city of paris and sought an interview with the king

    fusts object as explained by himself was to exhibit a copy of the latin bible beautifully
engrossed by an amanuensis of rare skill the initial letter of each chapter heading was done in red
with ornamentation of perfect taste and yet intricate

    having impressed the clergy with the importance of his manuscript fust succeeded at last in
gaining an audience of the king whose eye was sufficiently trained to detect the beauty of this bible
the usual price of such a treasure was fifteen hundred crowns but in view of his esteem for his
majesty the goldsmith offered to sell it for only seven hundred crowns the king dosed at once
with so eligible an offer the money was paid to fust who set out on his return to mentz

how the manuscript monger hoaxed the king

    on the following morning the archbishop arrived in some haste at the palace he wanted to show
the king a latin bible he had bought only the day before it was beautifully done in what seemed
the usual fashion of the monkish scribes except that the initials worked in red revealed perfect
artistry and infinite pains the king looked in wonder at the archbishops treasure

     but i have one said his majesty  just like it

    this the archbishop could not believe whereupon the king had fusts bible brought into his
study the archbishop was dumfounded when he examined the work it was in all respects an
cxact duplicate of the one he had brought himself for the kings inspection the monarch and the
prelate spent some half an hour in comparing the pair of books they were alike not only in every
turn and angle of each letter but also in the marks of punctuation the archbishop explained that
he had paid some five hundred crowns for the bible a price much below that which prevailed in
those days for a copy of the book of books

    who sold this to you asked the king  i got mine from a goldsmith named fust who hails
from mentz	x

the very man who sold me my copy cried the prelate what can this mean

   the king and the archbishop exhausted every conjecture for a considerable time the
art of printing being unknown to either of them and the books upon further inspection proving
exact duplicates in every page the only possible explanation of the mystery must be that fust was a
wizard

accused of spilling human blood

    the theory seemed so plausible that the king felt convinced on another point the red initial
letters must have been done in human blood this implied that fust had been involved in the
nrnrder of various children whose sanguinary deaths were agitating the city just then the only
thing to do was to get hold of this man fust he had left paris but he had not taken the slightest
precaution to conceal his identity or his movements and in a few days he was captured within a few
miles of the frontier

    in the meantime other copies of this bible began to turn up comparison showed that they
were all alike even to the position of certain letters at the end of a line the proof of wizardry
as thus overwhelming

    fust when thrown into a cell denied empliatically that any magic was kt the bottom of the
wizardry he insisted that he was not concerned in the death of anybody and that the red was


argosy-allstory weekly

good and real ink his protestations were in vain brought back to paris he was duly charged
with being a wizard and the book was shown to the men of the robe who passed judgment
upon offenders of this sort his offense was all the more heinous because his black magic had been
employed upon the word of god

    there was every prospect that fust would be consigned to the flames when he announced that
he would make a full confession a notjary was summoned to his cell he was sworn in the
presence of various witnesses the bible he said had been  imprinted  by movable  types
as he called them and these types had been cut out of smjall pieces of metal a letter to each piece
ot metal after they were correctly set the metal types received a smearing of ink and the face
of the types was pressed against a sheet of manuscript paper by means of a contrivance worked
with a screw

    at first the court officials were inclined to think the man from mentz was practicing some new
deception investigation revealed that this fust had met a man named gutenberg in mentz this
gutenberg arrived in town with the secret of a mysterious art he had already practised in
strasburg the evidence showed that gutenberg could  take the pages from the presses and by
removing two screws thoroughly separate them-the letters-from one another so that no man
rjaay know what it is this seemed to the king when duly reported to his majesty as	a

kind of magic as anything yet charged against fust but the archbishop being an enlightened
man and a friend of learning was greatly impressed by the importance of the new art

     but why asked the king  did the man pretend that he had a beautiful manuscript worked
by a scribe such as never kved yet

    ah sire said the archbishop this fellow has been tricky so long that he cannot go
straight though gods book be in his hand

    fust was accordingly permitted to go back to mentz where he devoted himself to the art of
printing promising a rich reward to any of his workmen who would invent an important improve-
ment this spurred the zeal of a youth named peter schoeffer who devised a matrix by means
of which type could be cast instead of being cut laboriously fust absorbed his employes idea
greedily and when the youth asked for the rich reward the goldsmith said  you shall marry my
daughter the youth was by no means delighted at the prospect but he had to be satisfied and
the wedding bells were soon heard all over the town for the rest of his life fust boasted that he
had got rid of his daughter on the most advantageous terms and his wife would exclaim in
vexation at his notorious avarice and hard bargains this printing is certainly the devils
own art

                             burden our hearts

                           these are the interludes

                          the teasing fingers of the wind

                          the fifes of happiness blow sweetly low
                          midst the reeds of the marsh

      the hole in the wall

  i me ere an our from now
 was bruces parting word of in-

  	 jl struction to bailey as he took the
unlighted lantern and tucked it under his
arm

  upon reaching the alley he paused to as-
sure himself that he was unobserved to-
ward the river he saw the slouching figure of
a late pedestrian who emerged for the mo-
ment in a flood of light at the next crossing
this and the muffled crack of a patrolmans
night stick against the flagstones over in the
swamp were the only evidences of life or
movement

  the first thing he did was to traverse the
length of the alley for the purpose of learn-
ing whether there was a door at the other
end

  carefully feeling his way in the dark-
ness he found that there was one it opened
into a small court and as it was no part
of his program to attract undue attention
from the rear he closed it

  a moment later the blackness melted as
a flood of light from his lantern touched
the grim walls around him one quick
glance was sufficient bruce knew that he
had discovered another trick entrance to the
former gambling house

  it was far from being secretive-just a
plain shallow doorway that had been cut
into the wall on the cracker pot side in
fact bruce found it disappointing at the
same time he could understand how valu-
able an exit of this kind must have been to
the nimble-fingered gentry who devised it
offering as it did two avenues of escape
one direct to the street and the other by
way of the rear tenements

thit ttory began in th argoty-allstory weekly for november 




argosy-allstory weekly

  with mind alert to any one of a dozen
possibilities or disappointments bruce tried
the door

   it opened without any effort swung out
into the alley dean and free

    a bit of luck he chuckled pleased at
the thought of gaining an entrance without
detection by some chance prowler of the
night who might make use of the alley in
order to reach his apartments

   the sweep of the door was the full width
of the narrow alley and the act of opening
it compelled bruce to step back hence-
his surprise-upon moving forward and di-
recting the light of his lantern into the sup-
posed opening to find his way blocked by
a solid wall it was a wall of lathe and
plaster as if some one had pushed the side
of a room to within a foot of the door

   as he stood glaring at the unexpected ob-
struction his eye was attracted by a care-
fully rolled object that lay in the small
opening at the foot of the wall

   it was a white coat such as bartenders
wear

   instantly bruce appreciated the signifi-
cance of his find the coat belonged to
emile connorss bartender had made his
escape during the melee by way of this
secret exit in a hazy sort of way bruce
remembered having seen the twinkle of a
white coat at the rear of the dance hall
following the arrival of the juggling sailor
and his motley crew he had speculated
more or less as to what happened to emile
after the police forced their way into the
cracker pot but this was the first evidence
of his escape

   the white coat would have made him too
conspicuous by far and once having gained
the seclusion of the alley be undoubtedly
hastened to discard it

   repressing a desire to search the pockets
for any telltale bit of evidence that would
prove to be of value in helping to solve the
cracker pot mystery bruce placed the coat
on his arm and renewed his mind to the task
at hand

  stepping back a few feet toward the
street bruce made a mental calculation as to
the distance of the opening from the front

of the building

  his conclusion was that the door was

  directly behind the refrigerator in connorss
  back room

   then like a flash it dawned upon him
  that the obstructing wall was the back of
  the refrigerator it had been lathed and
  plastered all of which to any one who
  might have chanced upon it would convey
  the impression that it was an abandoned
  entrance

   bruce however was not to be diverted
  by the mere looks of things he placed his
  shoulder against the wall

   it moved

   he gave an exclamation of delight and
 as if waiting for the magic word it gave
 wav opening like a hinged door

    a second later he was in connorss back
 room

   even as he turned to inspect the clever
 device the big refrigerator-for such it was
 -noiselessly swung back and completely
 closed the doorway

   as bruce gazed in silent admiration at
 the cleverness with which the heavy refrig-
 erator had been employed to divert atten-
 tion from the door that led into the alley
 it dawned upon him that connorss disap-
 pearance was now explained

   now he understood why it had all been
 so baffling to bailey and himself that first
 night

    standing in the alley with the door open
 and the refrigerator pushed aside it had
 been a very simple matter for the ruffians
 to overpower connors as he lifted his arm
 to light the gas bruce also now under-
 stood why they had failed to find any trace
 of their mode of entry then again the
 speed with which they had spirited their
 captive to the waiting carriage was no long-
 er a mystery

    distressing as the night ordeal had been
 bruce was conscious of an exhilaration of
 spirit the stimulus of success was surging
 within him why not follow his pledge of
 loyalty to the end was he under less ob-
 ligation to connors now than when be ac-
 knowledged the mans right to call upon him
 for assistance

  there were other reasons why be should
 exert one last effort connors alone could
 unravel the snarl of dark motives that
 swirled about the cracker pot and bruce

                          	a
crafty

 was now convinced that tremendous inter-
 ests were involved

   clince or late had tossed him into a
 seething caldron of riot and disorder plot
 seemed to overlay plot and behind it all
 hovered the shadow of something big he
 had lilted to the gage of battle he had
 stretched his muscles under the joy of
 physical conflict and the primitive man
 within him called for more

   besides that a feminine enigma had be-
 come enmeshed within the tangled skein of
 mystery saint or siren-he knew not
 which in fact at the moment cared not
 just now he was satisfied to believe that it
 was the psychology of the thing that lured
 him on

   it is ever thus that men delude them-
sdves for with grim visage and menacing
frown bruce told himself that connors must
be found

   fate who knows a thing or two chuckled
 and echoed the name  connors  with a ris-
 ing inflection accompanied by a sardonic
 grin

 conscience likewise returned to speak a
 few kind words  and how about joie the

 jug

how strange bruce had almost for-
gotten him-and it was for this he had
forced an entrance

picking his way through the jumble of
broken fixtures that littered the dance hall
bruce nude his way to the piatform

 one look was sufficient to proclaim the
 fact that the door leading to the stone cham-
 ber was not in the same position as when
 he had left it

some one had climbed up through the
opening or down into the room below

 he lowered his light so that it would be
 possible to scan the interior of the chamber
 joie was not there

the discovery occasioned no surprise

 on the contrary-he experienced a feeling
 of relief whatever might develop in the
 future his present obligation had been dis-
 charged

retracing his steps through the dance
hail be entered the bar

 if anything the wreck and carnage here
 ws greater than in the dance hall an in-
 discriminate tangle of splintered furniture
  a

 rogues	

   and fixtures even the ancient bar had
   been tom from its fastenings

   gazing at the prostrate symbol of emiles
 strenuous profession bruce suddenly re-
 membered that the bartenders coat hung
 over his arm

  instinctively he went through the
pockets

   they were empty except for a bit of
printed cardboard

   holding it nearer the light bruce saw
that it was a ferry ticket-one that had
been issued by the hoboken ferry com-
pany

   the next moment bruce was all attention

    pass one vehicle was the line that ar-
 rested his attention

   what had emile to do with the passing
of one vehicle over the hoboken ferry

  then came the question  would an
ordinary carriage be classified as a vehicle
if so had emile purchased this ticket
for the purpose of passing the carriage in
which connors had been kidnaped over
the hoboken ferry

   it was quite true that all this was dis-
 counted by the fact that the ticket had not
 been used but this did not detract from the
 major discovery that a ticket of this kind
 had been in emiles possession emile was
 no hack driver

   having made the discovery that emile
was aware of the secret passage and had
recent- made use of it-that very niuht-
why not assume tht he had been a factor
in the arrangement of those details which
provided for the quick removal of con-
nors once he was out of the cracker pot

   bruce gave his fixed attention to the bit
 of printed pasteboard there was a number
 on it

   bj

   his blood quickened as he considered the
 possible value of his discovery

   suppose the ferry company could tell him
 what day and hour that ticket had been
 sold what if it proved to be saturday
 night-the night on which connors had
 been kidnaped

   a counter thought followed hundreds
of vehicles must have crossed that ferry on
the night in question

   this in turn was balanced by two facts


argosy-allstory weekly

either one of which might have a strong
bearing on the problem

  the first had to do with the weather
conditions that night on account of the
fog fewer vehicles would have crossed-
the night having been one of almost im-
penetrable blackness

  the second important fact not to be
overlooked was that the carriage would
have reached the ferry about three thirty in
the morning an hour at which fewer public
conveyances are in evidence

  with the firm conviction that a discovery
had been made which would ultimately
prove to be worthy of his best effort bruce
now sought the street

  looking at his watch he found that his
appointment with bailey was a full half
hour overdue

  it was five oclock in the morning and
the granite towers of the brooklyn bridge
were blocking their huge bulk against the
pink tints of an eastern sky

  the big city was just thrusting its feet
out of bed and legions of work-a-day citi-
zens would soon be on the march

  all of which argued that while it was
one thing to travel about at night with a
giant negress stowed away in a public coach
it was quite another affair to continue the
parade in broad daylight

  it likewise began to dawn on bruce that
his fat woman was fast becoming a  white
elephant

  nearing the section of the block where
he had requested bailey to meet him bruce
saw that the carriage was drawn up to the
curb and some one was blanketing the
horses

  to his surprise upon closer approach he
found that it was bailey

   it is both creditable and humane of
you to show so much solicitude for another
mans property was bruces comment as
he came up behind bailey  but where is
the owner of this outfit

  there was a note of fatalism in baileys
voice as he turned to reply to the question

   right here he answered tapping him-
self on the chest  im the owner

 you gasped bruce you-the
owner

   thats wbat i said

   i dont understand

   you will all right when i explain
then as if the process of explanation re-
quired special emphasis bailey hitched up
one shoulder pushed back his hat and ex-
tended his right hand as a convenient base
upon which to thump his left

   i had to buy this whole blooming out-
fit he proclaimed

   had to buy it questioned bruce

   yes sir-had to put up two hundred
and seventy-five dollars or take to the side-
walk with our fat lady friend

   i dont grasp it-what happened

   everything happened first of all the
hackman got nervous prostration it was
this way after you left us he began to
circle the block and had made something
like seven times around the arena when a
wise patrolman stepped out from a dark
doorway and asked  whats the idea
runnin a merry-go-round or suthin like
that that settled our lease and tenure on
doyles licensed hack  take her out he
bawled just as soon as we made the next
corner  whad you think im running-
a rest cure say bruce i had an awful
time he threatened to drive to the nearest
police station and have me arrested it end-
ed by my purchasing the full equipment
 splendid exclaimed bruce  now
we can wtork out our plans without inter-
ference

   whose plans asked bailey

   ours-i have made a discovery that i
think will help to clean up the entire mys-
tery

   well if it is not going to distress you
too much do you mind telling me where i
blend in on these plans of ours

   certainly-for the next three or four
hours you are going to do the ferries you
are going to ride over to jersey city-then
turn around and ride back after that you
repeat

  with arms folded and legs widely thrust
apart bailey stared at bruce

   me he questioned  im going to do
all this

   certainly

   of course being a clergyman bruce
you dont know a thing about a certain
celluloid dog that chased an asbestos cat
crafty rogues



but you have got as much chance to get
me to do this as that dog had -to catch that
cat listen bruce i wouldnt be left alone
another half hour with this outfit and
whats inside of it for all the money in the
world

  bailey had reached over and taken bruce
by his lapels

   im not going to get any credit for it
bruce but from now on im your little ruth
and xaomi where you go-i go and
heres another thing as long as i have
made an investment of two seventy-five in
this thing why not call a meeting of the
board of directors its going to relieve my
mind a whole lot to find out whats back
of this joy-riding on the ferryboats for the
next few hours

   its simple enough we have got to
keep moving there isnt a plsffe in new
york where we would dare to take this
negress for safetys sake you bought this
antiquated outfit and for the same reason
we have got to keep on the move with it
now my idea is this if you work the fer-
ries it will be easy for the horses and lessen
your chances of being held up by some in-
quisitive policeman in the meantime i
will probably have acquired the information

i	am after it is five thirty now give me
until noon at that hour i will meet you
any place you say

   get it right bruce get it right you
wont have to meet me-ill be with you
every time the clock strikes between this
and noon ill be right where you can take
me by the hand i will

  baileys persistency annoyed bruce he
could think of but one argument it was
a weak one at that and he knew it

   suppose she wakes up he spluttered

ii	what then

   she isnt going to wake up-dont
worry about that

  s if to confirm his statement bailey
  opened the door of the coach

  listen to the beautiful sawmill he
  chuckled with a grin

    it is vulgarly primitive to say the least
   hut tell me-in addition to her snoring-
   bat is the noise i hear

   that said bailey  is the vibration
  of a loose slat in the roof of the coach you

know-in harmony with the ladys respira-
tory organs

   ill admit that the lady slumbers said
bruce  but why so much assurance that
she will continue to do so

   because i know you dont suppose
that i would go frollicking with chance on
anything so serious as the possibilities of
her waking up do you no sir-i know
whereof i speak here-look at these
he held out a small phial to bruce who
took it and read the label  sleeping tab-
lets-sugar-coated-one every hour

   what are you going to do asked
bruce  wake her up every hour so she
can take one

 i should say not i got her loaded
with enough of them to last for eight hours
 i hope it will be all right said bruce
rather doubtfully  at any rate it is time
we moved

 just a minute bruce i want to ask a
question am i a regular member of the
board of directors or just a plain dummy
 you are regular replied bruce with a
laugh

   all right-then the board asks for some
information about this recent discovery that
you have made and what you intend to do
thereupon bruce related all that had
been disclosed by his visit to the cracker
pot

  it was quite evident that bailey was not
impressed by bruces report

   well-what do you think of it bruce
finally asked

   inasmuch as we have been friends for
so many years id rather be excused from
telling you the truth was baileys re-
sponse

   dont let a little thing like friendship
embarrass you said bruce

   oh very well in that case i wtant to
say that of all the hair-brained loose-con-
structed wind-flapping ideas this is the
worst

   then you will not stand by-and see it
through questioned bruce

   certainly i will you need a guardian
and i am going to stick where do you
want me to go

   the hoboken ferry replied bruce
climbing to baileys side


argosy-allstory weekly

  hoboken ferry repeated bailey as he
 pulled the decrepit steeds about face for the
 ferry in question

chapter x

     at the foot of kings bluff

 the hoboken ferry was at the foot of
 barclay street distant about a half
 mile and upon their arrival bruce
 sought the gatemans booth which occupied
 the customary  isle of safety  just inside
 the gates

 the door was opened by a pipe-smoking
 nautical of phlegmatic mien as he braced
 his pea-jacketed shoulder against the door
 post his attitude was  ship ahoy

  can you tell me on what date your com-
 pany sold this ticket asked bruce pro-
 ducing the bit of pasteboard found in
 emiles pocket

 the stolid gateman consulted a book on
 his desk

  last saturday

  which side of the river-hoboken or
 new york

  new york-this office

  at what hour

  couldnt tell you-probably in the
 afternoon

    where can i find the man who was
 on duty at this gate saturday night

  you are talking to him

  do you recall the weather that night
  do you mean the fog

  yes

 for answer the gateman nodded in the
 affirmative

  was the travel very heavy continued
 bruce

  no-we only ran one boat after twelve
 oclock

 what was the name of that boat

  the james rumsey shes in the slip
 now

  are the same deckhands aboard now
 that were on duty saturday night

  same crew what is it you want to
 know

  information about a carriage that may
 have crossed early sunday morning

 you ought to be able to get it we

only made two trips between one and five
in the morning better move lively if you
want to board her she lays up this trip
over and the captain will signal for closed
gates in a minute ask for johnny dar-
ington

  there was no time to return to the street
and hold a consultation with bailey over
the advisability of his remaining on the
new york side until bruce returned and it
was a question whether he would consent to
any such arrangements therefore bruce sig-
naled him to drive in

  once aboard he lost no time in looking
up the deckhand who answered to the name
of darington a middle-aged salty-looking
sea dog even though his foreign voyages
were confined to the hoboken port

   were you on this boat when she made
her runs last sunday morning

   not runs mister-we bumped our way
across visiting-thats what we were do-
ing early sunday morning we hit every-
thing afloat and made social calls at every
pier on the river suffering mackerel-
what a night

   i understand that you only made two
trips after one oclock is that correct

   right mister-and those were about
six too many

   if a carriage crossed at that hour of
the morning would you be apt to remember
it

   not if things went in their regular way
-we carry too many of them but on sun-
day morning yes there was one on the
last trip and shad roe martin drove it

   do you know him

   so to speak yes everybody does over
in hudson county

 on that last trip of ours he had four
life preservers on-all at the same time and
whenever the old rumsey kissed the end of
a pier he was ready to jump into the river
 do you know who was with him

  for the first time the deckhand became
suspicious

   say mister-what are you-a detec-
tive

   no i am just an ordinary citizen in
search of a gang of scoundrels and any
legitimate information you can give me is
going to be of great service
crafty rogues



   scoundrels is right shad roe would
be uneasy in any other company you have
got about all i can give you in the wav of
information that carriage was bunched
with the usual nin of milk trucks and ex-
press wagons that go to hoboken even
morning and they sure kept to themselves
even with all the excitement but one thing
ill gamble oh whoever his pals were-
they came from the morgue

   from the morgue questioned bruce
in surprise

   yes thats a section of the river front
on the jersey shore opposite thirty-fourth
street  a regular nest of dock rats and river
pirates shad roe just naturally fits in with
them on account of his business

   what is his occupation asked bruce

   shad fishing his nets are generally
set in the river just above christopher
street thats where he gets his name

   this place you call the morgue-how
can i reach it

  by going north through hoboken-
then you cross the eleysian fields and con-
tinue on the bulls ferry road

  a few minor directions followed before
the boat reached its slip on the new jersey
side of the hudson and about an hour
later bruce and bailey reached the section
to which they had been directed

  the bulls fern- road on which they
were driving was lifting to make its way
upward and northward through a natural
ravine to the top of the palisades to con-
tinue in that direction would take them
away from the river to their right was a
narrow lane which evidently led to the
water front it likewise seemed to be the
only way of reaching the foot of that
shaggy rock-bound cliff known as  kings
bluff a bold defiant crag which marks
the last stand of the palisades to the south

  as the deckhands final instructions had
been to locate this striking landmark as a
means of reaching the morgue bruce now
directed bailey to drive into the lane

  a clump of trees about one hundred yards
hevond the main road offered a convenient
stopping place and here they halted

   now what questioned bailey

    give you one guess was bruce
de lisles reply

   you want me to remain here until you

reconnoiter

    yes 

   before answering bailey carefully opened
the door of the carriage and peeped in

    liable to wake up anv minute he said
    how do you know

   low pressure no more pep last
time i listened just before driving on the
ferry she was going strong enough to cut
a california redwood

   i do not see how anything human could
negotiate a more violent sequence of
snores than she is delivering just now re-
plied bruce

 thats because you have no ear for ma-
chinery shes running down i tell you
the slat in the roof has stopped vibrating
 dont you think she is good for another
hour

    possibly

   will you chance it

  a good-natured grin of concession was
spreading over baileys face

    just because you ask it ill say  yes
but honest bruce for butterfly chasing
this trip is the worst i ever knew con-
nors was kidnaped in a carriage and a
carriage crossed over a ferry and-
heavens man its a rainbow

  bruce was visibly impressed by the ban-
tering criticism of his friend he wavered

    very well ill bargain with you say-
ing which he took out his watch  if i do
not return in one hours time with some evi-
dence of the fact that we are working in
the right direction we will go back to new
york and turn the negress over to captain
wallers then we will sell the outfit square
accounts and go home

   giddap chirped bailey as he picked
up the reins in an attempt to galvanize the
weary old steeds into a semblance of action
 hold on-what are you going to do
 turn em around so we will be all ready
to say those few sad words of  fare-thee-
well  to hoboken

  five minutes later bruce rounded the
foot of kings bluff and started north over
that historic strip of weehawken shore line
which witnessed the tragic death of alexan-
der hamilton the palisades on one side-
the placid hudson on the other


argosy-allstory weekly

  writh all-the woods tall timber clinging
to the scanty soil amid the bowlders stand-
ing almost as they did when the crack of
aaron burrs pistol echoed among the cliffs

  to the right facing new york was the
shallow cove which bruce knew was the
morgue the grave of many a superannu-
ated canal boat mary janes and alice
anns that had drawn their last watery
breath in the valley of the hudson

  here and there an ancient keel with
splintered ribs lifted from the black mud
and a short distance from the shore were
several of the more sturdy wrecks some of
which had retained their superstructure
even though their backs were bent

  among them was an ice barge with a tell-
tale sag amidship in deck space it might
have served as a good-sized dance hall ex-
cept for the disadvantage of hill-climbing
which would have had to accompany a
waltz fore or aft

  bruce scrutinized this more habitable old
craft carefully some one had made it
snug-evidently a landsman as two win-
dows facing the shore proclaimed work-
manship other than that of a ships carpen-
ter

  a short length of stove pipe projecting
through the one story roof gave convinc-
ing proof of a tenant or tenants and from
this makeshift chimney a drift of smoke was
lifting

  a jumpy sort of footpath made its
crooked way to what was either the bow
or the front stoop of this mud-anchored
craft it was a rickety bridge of stray ships
timber that touched here and there a half-
submerged deck or sunken spar as if anx-
ious to avoid a ducking

  out in the channel beyond the shallow
confines of the canal boat morgue bruce
saw a nondescript collection of shipping a
whale back several coal barges and a tramp
steamer	

  east and north of these was a battle
cruiser riding at anchor and it passed
through his mind that this was some visit-
ing war craft from foreign waters of one
thing he was certain-it was not a united
states vessel

  taking note of the general scene before
him bruce realized how little it had to do

with the object of his visit and an over-
whelming sense of defeat settled upon him

  his hour had expired or nearly so of
what good was ten minutes that was all
he had to his credit before going back to
keep his word with bailey

  retracing the shore path his attention
was drawn to a small boat which was round-
ing the stern of the tramp steamer

  it was making for the shore and bruce
decided to wait

  a few minutes later he saw that there
were two men at the oars

  there was a grassy knoll just behind him
and bruce seated himself there to watch the
approaching boat

  upon second thought he decided to se-
crete himself behind a near-by clump of
bushes

  as the small boat nosed the beach he saw
that the men were foreigners both were
dark-skinned and from the ears of one he
caught the glint of brass or gold

   earrings he mused

  bruce likewise noted the ease with which
they handled their boat it was not the
work of landlubbers these men were of
the sea

  the next moment bruce had the surprise
of his life for these seamen carefully lifted
from the bottom of their boat the strange-
looking chest that eddie carbon had risked
so much to save when he climbed back into
the stone chamber from the underground
passage beneath the cracker pot

   then bruce saw one of the sailors lift the
chest to his shoulder and carefully pick
his way over the footpath to the ice barge
then he disappeared within

   where did these men come from was
the question now in bruces mind

  as if to answer his own question he
looked toward the tramp steamer-the place
where they first came into view as they
rounded the stern of the vessel

  for a second he was confused the
grouping of the ships out in the channel
were not the same as before

  then it dawned upon him the tramp
steamer was moving upstream he won-
dered if these men had been dropped from
her deck before weighing anchor

  another hasty glance and bruce gasped
crafty rogues



in surprise he began to understand the
steamer-in the position he had first seen
it-had completely hidden a rakish-looking
schooner that lay at anchor just beyond it

  his blood quickened at the thought which
followed

   was this captain jakes schooncr

  no-that could hardly be possible as the
captain was supposed to have laid his course
for boston

  wait-his vision was becoming clearer
his mind quicker it was emile who had
informed connors that captain jake had
gone to boston-emile who had been in-
strumental in making way with connors

  he saw it all now the conspiracy from
the first had been to get connors out of
the way to have him leave the cracker
pot on one pretext or another when the
boston lure failed they deliberately kid-
naped him

  but why

  bruce strained at the question then he
thought tiiat he had found the answer

  the scheme-in part-had been to re-
move connors so that the sailors might be
free to raid the cracker pot during his ab-
sence

  but the motive for this-what was it

  the answer to this question also came
the motive was to secure the negress

  a moment later bruce gave up the prob-
lem as he saw the fallacy of his reasoning
saw the absurdity of concluding that cap-
tain jake would bring the negress from the
congo--secrete her in the cracker pot and
then deliberately plan to have some one raid
the place for the purpose of capturing her

  nevertheless a dozen facts fitted this
theory however unreasonable it might seem

  all might be made clear if this prime
motive could be revealed but just now there
were things of greater importance to work
on

  this black-looking schooner out in the
hudson-did it belong to captain jake or
some other skipper

  a final question now swept through
bruces mind

  had connors been made a captive on
captain jakes schooner was he moving
in the right direction after all

  once more he checked up his evidence

the carriage that had spirited connors
away-the chance finding of the ferry ticket
-the vehicle that had been driven by shad
roe martin who came from the morgue-
the location of the latter-and now the pos-
sibility of this being captain jakes
schooner

  the very lane in which he had left bailey
seemed to add a link in the chain of evi-
dence inasmuch as it led direct to the shore

  having reached this narrow country road
he hurried forward literally touching the
high spots only

  a turn of the road brought the tree under
which he had left bailey into view

  driver coach and horses had disap-
peared

  it was undignified but bruce ran to the
spot he thought that he might have mis-
taken the place perhaps there was another
tree just beyond

  no there was the print of hoofs in the
soft earth the circling track of carriage
wheels he could follow them out to the
main thoroughfare there they were lost in
a maize of similar imprints

  there was no room for doubt

  bailey had disappeared

chapter xi

the morgue

for an hour or more bruce paced the
dusty lane first to the maun road then
to the river

  it was an hour of fuming without sleep
the night before his nerves had become
ragged

  to assume that bailey had deliberately
abandoned him was not to be considered
surely a combination of circumstances be-
yond hiscontrol were responsible of this
he was confident but-what were they

  to ease the grind of suspense bruce
once more rounded kings bluff and walked
the shore

  scanning the river he could see no indi-
cation of any change that had taken place
during his absence-either in the morgue
or the lay of the shipping beyond

  one thing however did attract his at-
tention and but for the fact that he was


argosy-allstory weekly

ready to give due value to any circumstance
that came under his observation it might
have escaped him

  a cutter was just steaming away from
the war vessel he had noticed on his first
visit to the shore in design it was de-
cidedly foreign-the narrow smokestack
suggesting a toy engine

  out of curiosity bruce watched the
sprightly little craft as it drew away from
the war vessel

   strange he mused  they are laying
their course direct for that schooner

  as he watched the businesslike little cut-
ter touched the schooners side a line was
thrown to a waiting sailor and some one
climbed up on the deck

 no use i am only wasting time said
bruce  if i was in possession of the mas-
ter key i might make something out of it
 how about picking the lock asked
a voice behind him

  it was bailey and from the warmth of
bruces greeting one might have thought
that they had been separated for years

   what happened was his eager ques-
tion

   arrested for not having a hack drivers
license was baileys answer

   then what

   well after that about everything hap-
pened that could be written into the cal-
endar you can imagine my blood pres-
sure when that chap with the tin star on his
chest climbed up on the seat and said

 drive to the town hall 

   which of course you did

   correct-i did and say can you pic-
ture it there was that black dame inside
ready to come to life any minute it was
just four blocks to the palace of justice and
i lost eight pounds

   did she wrake up

   wait-its worse than that we arrive
and in i go-right up to the floor-worn spot
where they plant crime-stained humanity
and there i stood with one eye on the car-
riage in front of the door and the other one
on the judge wondering was he calloused
or just looking that way so hed make good
honest bruce im cross-eyed for life

   go on im only too anxious to know
what occurred

   oh it occurred all right they have a
wonderful system over here they read it
to you right out of a book no use saying a
prayer or anything then all at once the
wise and merciful judge says  ten dollars
or ten days 

   ten dollars questioned bruce

   ten-thats the price they are asking
now-and i didnt have a cent was flat
as a prairie spent my last dollar when i
bought the miserable outfit

   tough luck was bruces comment

   not half as bad as what followed 
tell you i was dumb-couldnt even say
 much obliged just stood there wonder-
ing how long ten days really was then
all at once the calamity broke that black
hoodoo opened the carriage door and yelled
like mad trues im telling you bruce
i had a fever or something that ran me up
to a hundred and twenty it took seven
policemen to get her out on the sidewalk
and into the station house ye gods if
you could have seen the judge-jabez the
merciful-all the time hes watching the
crimson on my fevered brow  this looks
suspicious-young man he shouts and
me standing there saying  yes sir-yes
sir tickled silly that i had not lost my
voice then i happened to think-suppose
she commences to give this rube magistrate
some of that foreign lingo

   you certainly were in a distressing po-
sition said bruce

  calm yourself-and waitfor the cli-
max there i was  vessing his honor
thinking he might forget about the ten dol-
lars-you know trying to be social like-
when all of a sudden he roars  who are
you-and what does it all mean anyway
right at that minute the fireworks all went
off at once-and the heavens fell that
black beauty waddled up to the desk takes
me by the arm and answers in good eng-
lish  hes mah manager 

   you tell me that she understands eng-
lish and can speak it gasped bruce

   its her pet vernacular-she spouts it
like a fountain wait until you hear the
rest of it the judge looks at her and says
 what do you mean-hes your manager
whereupon cutie steps forward and speaks
her piece  im in vaudeville and hes mah
crafty rogues



   manager-wha kind of way is dis to treat a
   lady and a gemmen here we is proceed-
   in on our way calni like when we gets
   stultified into cout wha for-and how
   come it

        you are fined ten dollars for not hav-
   ing a license says the judge

      for a minute this staggered her then
   it evidently dawned upon her that  stood
   there with my arms folded and had made
   no move to pay the fine at any rate she
   produced a roll of distressingly fat propor-
   tions and said  i gonna pay dat little tax

   i is then we gonna drift away from here 

      did she questioned bruce

      she did but as for drifting away that
   was different  now you will have to take
   out a license said the judge  what i just
   paying for she asked  for not having
   one he replied  now you have got to
   pay to get one

     you win mis tali judge its a double
   gig-fs played em before but if you dont
   mind we gonna move de boat quick how
   much dat last one goin to nick me

  ten dollars more quoth the judge

    but the license cannot be issued until six
   oclock as the town clerk works in new
   york and will not be home before that
   hour 

  where is your friend now asked
  bruce

   in the station house banqueting with
the janitress who is of her color the res-
taurant next door is their base of supplies

   well said bruce  what do you make
out of it

    not a thing-its a joke

   that is where you are wrong this
negress is playing a part and playing it
well

   glad to hear it since i am her man-
ager

   just consider her cleverness con-
tinued bruce  when she discovered that
she had been left behind by eddie carbon
at the tobacco mill she did not want to
be questioned and it would be hard to
conceive of a more brilliant idea than that
of misleading us by her foolish hugo

    come to think of it you are right and
if she wanted to know all about our plans
what better scheme could she devise than

pretending to be asleep i notice that she
woke up at the critical time and am begin-
ning to think that my sleeping tablets had
no effect whatever

    correct-she was probably wide awake
and heard you say that the purchase of the
hackmans outfit had left you broke this
would account for the readiness with which
she paid the fines

    one thing puzzles me said bailey
 i have been unable to figure out why she
climbed up into the cracker pot during that
beautiful row

    that is something i cannot tell you
but one thing is certain she would not hav e
done it if eddie carbon had been down
there with her you will recall that car-
bon had just left the cracker pot before
the arrival of the sailors when he returned
the fight was on and there was but one way
for him to reach the negress that was
through one of the underground entrances
to the stone chamber in which he had left
her he never intended that she should fall
into our hands

    that introduces something new was
baileys comment  the idea of having
some one else find her there has never en-
tered my mind

 but you will have to admit that it is
reasonable think a minute-do you re-
member the bulging eyes on the juggling
sailor when he first caught sight of her
do you recall how he urged his men for-
ward to capture her

 yes

 well there is your answer

 all of which does seem to bear some
evidence of truth but tell me this how
do you account for her lying so glibly
about my being her manager

 that is easy-first of all she wanted to
get away from anything that had to do with
the police and secondly she came mighty
near the truth when she said that she was
in vaudeville-at least that is my impres-
sion

 if you expect me to follow you there
bruce ill need the spot-light

 verv well-do vou remember the go-
rilla 

 you mean can i forget the beast

 in my opinion the brute was her side


argosy-allstory weekly

partner in the business her control over
the animal was perfect and evidently she
could make him do anything she desired
 but how does this square with the
facts if this negress and her gorilla
formed part of captain jakes delivery
from the congo how can you account for
the vaudeville theory and her knowledge
of english

   right there said bruce  you touch
the big mystery i can ask you a full dozen
questions equally as perplexing who is
the young woman that played her end of
the game with the assistance of eddie car-
bon what was in the strange looking
chest that carbon made way with let
me say this bailey we are close to the so-
lution of all these questions do you see
that schooner out in the channel

   yes

   i am ready to assert that it belongs to
captain jake

   all right-go as far as you like one
guess is as good as another

   would you call it guessing if i told you
that i saw two men pull away from that
schooner in a small boat with carbons
strange looking chest

  whereupon bruce related the discoveries
that had followed his first visit to the shore
and declared his intention of stealing out
over the connecting footpath for the pur-
pose of investigation just as soon as night
would lend a hand

   its going to be a great night and some-
how or other the idea of working in the
morgue appeals to me-they wont have far
to carry us said bailey with a grin

  in spite of the grimness of baileys joke
bruce laughed but quickly changed the
subject  i say he asked  how long is
it since you have had anything to eat

   if i consulted my appetite i should say
it was about the time i left grammar
school

  ten minutes later they were seated in
the restaurant bailey had spoken of

  when night fell they had turned into the
lane and were within fifty feet of the shore
when bruce laid a warning hand on baileys
arm  take it easy-i hear voices he
whispered

  with extreme caution they advanced an-
other ten or fifteen feet then crouching low
crept forward inch by inch

  standing in the center of the road were
three men their forms bulking against the
luminous haze that in spite of the night
welled up from the great city across the
hudson

  to the right was a vehicle such as hotels
often employ in connection with their rail-
road service for the convenience of guests
it would accommodate four or more pas-
sengers

  two of the men had evidently just re-
turned from the river and the rustle of their
oilskins could be heard as they moved
about the rain by this time having began
to operate on a business basis

  the third man walked to the head of
his team and swung them closer to the
bank at the side of the road

   howd you get along he asked

   well were back-aint that enough
was the reoly of one

   and dod-rotted mad we had to come
eh lopez growled the other

  the first one grunted an affirmative as he
removed his oilskin hat to shake the water
from it

   which one of you lads has a match
asked his companion

  a moment later there was a flash which
alternately brightened and waned as the
flame from the match dove into the bowl
of his pipe or flared up within the curved
hands of the smoker

  from the position occupied by bruce it
was impossible to discern the features of the
man but a glint of light had been reflected
from the tip of the smokers ear

   the man with the earrings was
bruces thought  one of the sailors wrho
had helped to transfer eddie carbons chest
to the old barge

   what did you come back for ques-
tioned the man standing near the horses

   to find out how long it will take you to
drive to the dock we started from-after
this affair is over

   half an hour was the answer

   thats what i told em but they
wouldnt take my word for it they are get-
ting plumb scairt about the time its going
crafty rogues	

to take trouble is-the whole thing was
to be pulled off this afternoon and theyd
a done it if we could have got alongside
of that barge with a launch now-theyre
worried you see we got to be aboard the
schooner by three its high tide at five
and if that excited bunch of foreigners dont
get under way by that hour-the devil will
be to pay

   what are you fellows going to do-
stay with me asked the man who was
giving his attention to the horses

   not on your life this is going to be
the swellest show ever put over in this port
ive seen the gen-oo-ine thing down in haiti
and i know

    and they are starting it with the finest
bucket of punch ever brewed chuckled the
second man

   where do i come in on this ques-
tioned the horseman

 you dont youre out of it you
stick right here unnerstan right here i
saying which the man and his companion
merged into the blackness as they made
their way toward the river

   come whispered bruce

  with extreme caution they retraced their
steps until it was safe to converse in low
tones then bailey was the first to speak

   what do you make of it

    very little except that they have trans-
ferred something of considerable weight
from the schooner to the barge

   what makes you think so

   the fact that two men were required
to carry it

    well it is only an odd idea of mine but
suppose this  something  walked

 i never thought of that you may be
right the class of conveyance they made
use of to reach the rivet would seem to con-
firm your deduction was bruces response

    thanks what comes next we are
  losing time

    i suggest that we make a circuit through
   the fields so as to avoid the man with the
   horses it will never do for him to see
   us

   a good idea-come on 

     ten minutes later they reached the shore
  by sliding down a gravel bank which ran
  at right angles to the road

  the night was too dark to locate the
exact spot at which the foot bridge leading
to the barge was located but the lighted
windows were sufficient to guide them

  a dull roar of voices greeted them from
across the water as one of the roystering
crowd opened a door on what would have
been the port side of the old craft in its
days of navigation there was something
hideously primitive in both the volume and
tone a ghoulish discord in keeping with the
name of the place shouts and curses-
laughter and song the brew of punch had
evidently been passed

  through the open door a burly figure w as
seen to emerge and walk towrard the bow
of the barge where the footpath joined it

   hes coming ashore whispered bailey
 if that is so we must beat him to the
end of the footpath

   where we will act in the capacity of
a reception committee-yes

   correct-you guessed it and at the
same time we will become our own com-
mittee of safety if it is his intention to
stand guard at the end of that path we have
got to render him a negative factor or give
up the idea of finding out what is going on
aboard that barge

   im for the negative stuff chuckled
bailey

   there is a small platform at the end of
the foot bridge it is about three feet from
the ground if yoi take one side of it and
i the other we can probably surprise him
under the cover of darkness they had
no trouble in making it although bruce
narrowly missed stumbling over a small boat
that had been drawn up on the shore

  crouching low - bruce to the right
bailey to the left-they awaited the ap-
proach of the guard

  when within -a dozen feet of them he
stopped for the evident purpose of adjust-
ing a misplaced plank before venturing his
weight upon it then quickly covered the
intervening distance

  his haste was undoubtedly due to a pair
of unsteady legs as he immediately settled
down on the upper step of the rickety stairs

  he had scarcely touched it when both
men sprang upon him

  there was no opportunity for an outcry


argosy-allstory weekly

   that would warn his companions on the
   barge as baileys hand had closed over his
   mouth before he really knew of his danger

     at the same time bailey had drawn him
   backward-his head striking the planks
   with a resounding thump with equal speed
   bruce had bounded to the platform and
   was upon him his knees on the mans chest
   his hands pinioning the burly fellows arms
   to the flooring

       tie your handkerchief over his mouth
   commanded bruce

       its done said bailey a moment later
     what next

       look for a gun

       i got it was baileys report as he ex-
    tracted one from their captives hip pocket

       now move over to the right and locate
   the small boat i brushed against as we
   made for this platform if you do not find
   a coil of rope in it cut the painter

      this being the quickest method of secur-
   ing a ropes end of sufficient length to bind
   their man bailey lost no time in clipping
   several feet from the coiled line in the bow

    what are we going to do with him
   asked bailey as the finishing knots were ad-
   justed on the prostrate guard

    leave him right where he is for the
 present i intend to have at least one look
 into this mirthful old wreck dont leave
 him for a minute while i am gone and keep
 his gun handy as you may need it

   the advice was excellent as events a few
 seconds later proved

   bruce had started out along the foot
 bridge so that he might gain a vantage
 point from which to peer into the brightly
 lighted windows of the barge and had taken
 but a few steps when there was a crash
 this was followed by a splash and the
 warning clang of a bell aboard the barge

    bailey could feel his hair standing on end

 in the darkness he could only imagine what
 had happened that bruce was struggling
 in the water under the bridge

   once more the door on the barge opened
 but this time a full dozen husky forms
 poured out upon the deck

   the necessity for quick thinking was
 urgent and his first impulse was to leave
 the man he was guarding and rush to
 jbruces assistance

     there was but one thing that restrained
   him he had every reason to believe that
   bruce had fallen into shallow water if
   this was true and he was uninjured it
   would be folly to take any chance with the
   man he was guarding-he had been roped
   in complete darkness and the cumbersome
   oilskins made it impossible to assume that
   the job was a perfect one

     to bailey it was a moment of racking
   suspense

     the ruffians were gathering at the bow
   of the barge and some were just about to
   start shoreward over the foot bridge others
   were inclined to linger as if reluctant to
   abandon the festive scene

     it was when the foremost man on the
   bridge paused and halloed to the guard
    whats wrong that bailey received his
   inspiration

     the question had given him his cue
   that something was wrong the gang on the
   barge knew by the clang of the warning bell
   and this occurred at the moment of bruces
   fall it was therefore reasonable to infer
   that the flooring of the bridge was so ad-
   justed that bruces weight caused it to col-
   lapse and also operate some mechanical tug
   to the rope or wire that controlled the bell

    bailey was now in full possession of both
 his wits and his nerve it flashed through
 his mind that the guard had set his trap
 when he fumbled with the planking a short
 distance from the shore end of the bridge

    the man who was coming toward them
 once more bawled out his anxious  whats
 wrong

   then bailey awoke to action

   pressing the muzzle of his gun to the tem-
 ple of his prisoner he quickly tore the hand-
 kerchief from his mouth

    tell him you fell off the bridge he
 hissed and if you say anything else ill
 blow your brains clean across the hudson

chapter xii

a clanging bell

 to bailey who was bending over the
 man it seemed an eternity before he
 showed any inclination to obey in
 reality the time was fractional
crafty

rogues



  quick-out with it he whispered as
 he twisted the end of the revolver against
 the fellows head with a corkscrew motion
 that made him wince

  i fell off th bridge he finally croakcd
 in tones loud enough for his companions on
 the barge to hear

   a loud guffaw greeted his explanation a
 to the cause of the alarm

    are you hurt questioned the man on
 the bridge

    no

   as if in confirmation of his statement
 that he was all right the sound of some one
 splashing about in the water could be heard
 it was bruce wading ashore

   the guards rough associates were evi-
 dently satisfied as they turned and filed
 back through the open door

   it closed with a bang and baileys hair
 once more laid down in plastered placidity
 it had been standing on end

   bruce had now made his way to the plat-
 form the water dripping from his clothes
 and sloshing from his shoes with every step

    any damages sustained chief asked
 bailey

    nothing except a good ducking thats
 bad enough

    how did it happen

    a section of the flooring was pushed
 i back from the cross piece so it would tip
 the moment any one set foot on it replied
 bruce

    are you going to try it again

    i certainly am in the meantime let
 me congratulate you on your cleverness
 i am proud of you

    so am i any medals

    no-but the night is young keep up
 your good work you may get your deco-
 ration at sunrise

    if we are not shot at the same glad-
 some hour i tell you bruce a human life
 is cheap with this gang of pirates

    no flat notes there bailey buck up
 on your courage i am going to commence
 my trip all over and i want you at your
 best its the unexpected that demands
 resourcefulness and if anything goes wrong
 it will be up to you to think quick

   saying which bruce once more started
 out along the footpath

  upon reaching the trick span which had
throwm him into the hudson he carefully
adjusted the movable section so it rested
upon the crosspiece then he tested it be-
fore going forward

  at the other end of this span he found
the crude mechanicad device which had
been responsible for the ringing of the bell
an upright of wood nailed to the edge of
the plank floor to this a rope was at-
tached

  as a measure of safety bruce cut the
line

  now and then a board would creak as
he picked his way over the makeshift
bridge but the blast from the transatlantic
liner would have been dwarfed to the
squeak of a tin whistle in competition with
the wild medley of riotous joy aboard the
barge

  upon reaching the bow of the ancient
craft bruce found that the windows were
much higher than appeared from the shore
but by climbing to the rail a good viewr of
the interior was possible

  in doing this his head narrowly missed
the ships bell which was fastened to the
superstructure of the barge had the
question of haste been less imperative he
would have taken the precaution of draw-
ing the bell rope to the bow of the barge
and disposing of it inside the rail it was
a strange scene that greeted bruce as he
peered through the dirt-grimed window

  near the center of the big barnlike room
was a brick platform about a foot high and
possibly six feet square serving as the
hearth for a roaring crackling fire just
above it was a great iron kettle swinging
from an old-fashioned crane a huge ne-
gro stripped to the waist was stirring the
steaming contents

  around the boiling kettle were at least
fifteen of the toughest specimens of hu-
manity bruce had ever seen-men of griz-
zled beards and evil countenance they
might have been the very dregs and scour-
ings of the proverbial seven seas all were
intent upon the negros work as he stirred
the pottage all gesticulating and talking
except as they paused long enough to hoqor
the passing bucket of steaming punch a
wave of disgust swept over bruce was


argosy-allstory weekly

this the sccne he had ventured to much to
view-a commonplace orgy of gluttony
had his persistency after all only led to a
steaming kettle of food

  in vain he looked for one familiar face
connors-captain j ake-eddie carbon-
emile with mind intent upon grasping
for something tangible-something that
would not leave him completely stranded-
he began to search each recess and shadow
of the big room if such it could be called
a tangled mass of nets and cordage came
under his observation for the first time
they were hanging from the rafters near
the stern

  at that particular moment it was a val-
uable discovery to bruce as it gave notice
of ownership these nets were undoubted-
ly the property of shad roe martin-the
negro who had piloted the four-wheeled
craft in which connors had been impris-
oned from new york to hoboken and it
was fair to assume that the stalwart black
engaged in stirring the steaming caldron
was none other than he

  the nets were evidently serving as im-
provised curtains to screen certain indi-
viduals who were about to participate in
the barbaric feast or ceremony as all eyes
were now directed toward the swaying cen-
ter then the tangled cordage parted and
eddie carbon came forward amid the wild
shouts of the frenzied crowd in his arms
he carried the quaint-looking chest that
bruce had seen lifted from the small boat
that afternoon when the sailors took it
aboard the barge

  placing it on the deck near the brick
hearth carbon returned to the opening
through the curtain of nets here with
mock ceremony he held up his hand for
silence then with a dramatic pause he
reached over to draw aside the curtain
for the second time the rotting bulkheads
of the old wreck quivered with the volume
of sound that greeted the entrance of a
man who was not very steady on his feet
in fact eddie carbon had to render as-
sistance or he would have fallen to the
deck

  bruce saw a hard-visaged man of fifty-
five or more in the day of his prime-
now passed-he might have been registered

as short and stocky but years of indulgence
at both the board and the bowl had caused
him to settle physically there had been
a gravitation of parts until he resembled
an inverted top aye-a  salty old top 
who looked as though he would welcome
any rewinding that would help him to spin
along for a few years more it was cap-
tain jake

  in his excitement over the discovery
bruce narrowly missed slipping from the
rail his mind swept back to the occasion
of their first meeting at connorss athletic
club back to the student days at new
brunswick when this same captain jake-
the rover-the romancer-would hold the
little group of students spellbound with
wonderful tales of foreign ports of bloody
encounters and weird stories of african
mysteries

  but these memories were thrust back
into the past where they belonged some-
thing of greater importance than the ap-
pearance of captain jake through the open-
ing was about to take place the curtain
was ready to part for the third time a
look of expectancy was upon every face
captain jake had been led to what seemed
to be the seat of honor near the brick
hearth and eddie carbon was engaged in
removing several small packages from the
open chest

  the moving net now proclaimed impa-
tience on the part of the one about to step
forth but even so the spectators were
loath to dispense with the dramatic pre-
lude

  the negro at the kettle waved his hand
toward one of the dark recesses of the
barge and two of his race and color came
forward with crude-looking drums they
took their positions-one on the right the
other to the left of the blazing hearth-
and commenced to beat their barbaric in-
struments as an accompaniment to the
quavering notes they voiced then the
nets were swept aside and bruce saw that
which caused him to question his vision
the giant negress stepped through the
opening

  the very impossibility of it staggered
him it was incredible to think of her
capture at the moment they were banking
crafty rogues	

on her safety disregarding the danger of
discovery he pressed closer to the window
he even attempted to rub away the accu-
mulated dust that he might assure himself
that it was all real

  for a brief space she remained motion-
less and the flickering lights from the open
hearth danced about her huge form then
she slowly came forward-her barrel-like
arms lifted above her head feet shuffling
body swaying in a clumsy attempt to fol-
low the rhythmical beat of the drums

  bruces brain was likewise throbbing in
unison with them how had the negress
eluded both himself and bailey who had
assisted her aboard the barge what was
the significance of the barbaric scene before
him

  in vain he tried to correct what he
thought might be the result of an excited
vision it was useless-confusion had mas-
tered him -an array of what might be
termed half truths now began to assail him
the conversation of the men in the lane
wherein they had referred to their inability
to reach the barge with their launch on
account of the shallow water the convey-
ance waiting at that very moment at the
foot of the bluff all these were directly or
indirectly associated with the latest and
most perplexing phase of the mystery he
was trying to fathom

  the negress was now within a few feet of
the hearth and silence had fallen upon her
devotees or admirers-whichever they
might prove to be

  as bruce pressed forward to peer through
the greasy smoke-glazed window he began
to understand why the sight of the negress
had affected him so strangely surprise
alone would not account for it as he had
received too many of them since becoming
involved in connorss affairs it was her
unnatural size that appalled him this and
her theatric entrance he wondered if in
the excitement of escape from the cracker
pot he had misjudged her monstrous weight
and girth

  perhaps the pane of glass he was directing
his gaze through was distorting his vision
he would try the other window-it was
only a few feet awav in moving along the
rail he forgot that the soles of his shoes were

wet and slippery it was an unfortunate
lapse of memory

  both feet shot from under him and the
law of self-preservation did the rest for he
elected to drop to the deck inside the rail
rather than take a second plunge into the
hudson

  if fate deliberately selected that particu-
lar moment for his fall it was to say the
least splendidly chosen so far as the inter-
ests of those within the barge were con-
cerned whatever the negress intended to
do or say the- were waiting amid silence
then came the crash of his fall and to
make matters worse his feet became entan-
gled in the bell rope a wild clang of the
bell followed

  the hoarse shout of anger and dismay
that arose within the barge must have vi-
brated to the splintered keel of the old
hulk and far quicker than it takes to relate
the deck swarmed with a mob of maddened
ruffians

  it was bruces turn now to do some quick
thinking

  to attempt an escape over the footpath
would be folly a dozen guns might rake
this line of retreat had the advantage of
daylight been with him he might have
taken the risk knowing that bailey stood
at the other end of the bridge with their
prisoners revolver which would have been
of some use in holding back his pursuers 

  this however was not to be considered
and it left but one alternative that was
to slip over the side into the hudson his
decision had been made none too quickly
as ships lanterns and flaming torches began
to appear on deck-a very devils dance of
bobbing lights

  there was no thought of danger in
bruces mind as he pushed out into the
black waters and blacker night his only
concern was for bailey through it all the
latter had remained on the small platform
at the shore end of the bridge guarding his
prisoner beyond the thud of bruces fall
and the clang of the bell he had no knowl-
edge of what actually had occurred that
bruce had succeeded in gaining a view of
the interior of the barge he knew-because
the dim outline of his head at the barge
window had conveyed this intelligence


argosy-allstory weekly

 with every nerve taut he listened for the
 rattle of planks that would tell of bruces
 approach over the bridge

   the seconds-that seemed hours-went
 by not a sound from bruce not even
 the creak of a board or a call for assistance
 lights were now coming toward him over
 the bridge of heavy oaths and impreca-
 tions there were a plenty but no word or
 tone of exultation that would indicate
 bruces capture

   but one conclusion was possible-bruce
 had gone overboard

   for the safety of his friend bailey had
 never a thought he knew that bruce could
 swim like a duck as for himself it would
 be easy to elude the oncoming horde of thor-
 oughly aroused ruffians by moving off into
 the darkness

   but what of his prisoner to leave him
 bound and gagged would publish their
 nights work besides that if his associ-
 ates from the barge failed to find him they
 might be tricked into the belief that he had
 again tumbled into the hudson perhaps
 a little daring and nerve might retrieve the
 bungling errors that had been made once
 more his reputation for quick thinking was
 to be sustained

   he would take his prisoner with him

   a few strokes with his knife and the
 fellows legs were free

   come-and not a word out of you
 quick  bailey whispered

   shoving the man in front of him he
 pushed off into the darkness moving south-
 ward along the shore in the direction from
 which they had approached the barge he
 had every reason to believe that bruce went

 over the rail on that side as his head was
 last seen bobbing against the glare of light
 from that window

  the foremost man from the barge was
now halfway over the bridge and was strain-
ing his calendar of profane epithets as he
loudly called upon the guard for some ex-
planation of the disturbance not from the
guard but down shore-the direction in
which bailey was moving-came an answer-
ing  halloo

  the moment bailey heard it he knew
that another error was to be scored he
was moving into danger rather than away
from it it had been the most natural thing
in the world for him to start back along
the shore in that direction but in the ex-
citement he had forgotten the man who was
waiting at the foot of the lane-the horse-
man who had remained to watch over the
conveyance while his companions sought
the festivities aboard the barge

   the decoration that bailey was to receive
at sunrise volplaned into oblivion his sit-
uation could not have been worse behind
him the mob of enraged cutthroats from the
barge some of whom had now reached the
shore in front one of their number ready
to assist them to his right the tall cliffs
on his left the river

  it was useless to hunt for a position of
advantage on that flat strip of shore there
was none he broke open the chamber of
his revolver to count the number of car-
tridges he could depend on

  then bailey made use of an expression
that was void of delicacy-a copper-lined
classic that befitted the situation the car-
tridge chamber of his revolver was empty

to be concluded next week

by lyon mearson

      it be known that all that is herein-
 after chronicled happened in the days
 before the eighteenth amendment
 was abroad in the land when the name of
 volstead was not one to command the atten-
 tion of kings and the profanity of the pro-
 letariat and when bootlegging was not the
 crowded profession it is to-day

   in one of wildes plays a character upon
 being told that he is lying in the gutter
 remarks that perhaps he is-but he is look-
 ing at the stars which means in every-
 day unallegorical language that a man
 may have ideals regardless of his circum-
 stances a mans body and his brain may
 be for sale but his soul is his own and so
 long as he follows the gleam within him he
 is yet his own man

   such a man was neil macneil superin-
 tendent of construction for the campbell
 building company-the best superintendent
 of construction they ever had or ever hoped
 to have no man could get more out of a
 crew than macneil
 loved by the

     	a

principally because they knew there was
nothing he asked any of them to do that
he could not do himself nothing he re-
quired of them that he had not done him-
self at some stage in his career

  a big rawboned fighting scotchman
ready for a blow or a joke or both acces-
sible to the meanest of his underlings and
unafraid of the most powerful of his su-
periors with a laugh or an oath ever on his
lips-usually both-and with a knowledge
of the building business second to none
that was neil macneil the son of angus
the son of andrew the son of sandy this
was the line of macneils descent men
handy with their fists and with a knowledge
of the real purpose of scotch whisky

   which is where macneils weakness came
in he was an ideal superintendent of con-
struction-when he superintended there
were times however unheralded by any
warning whatsoever-irregular of occur-
rence-when he did not superintend for

no man was better three or four days in a row at such times
men who worked for him he was full to the skin with whisky tasting

                              


argosy-allstory weekly

  of scotch fog and highland heather at such
  times he was apt to be found in any place
  in new york except one-the place where
  his job was

    this weakness of macneils was the
  cause of his losing more than one job and
  he knew he would lose more in the years
  to come but he was a lone man with no
  wife nor child and when the desire for
  strong drink came upon him whisky meant
  more than a job strangely enough how-
  ever the campbell building company had
  never discharged neil macneil though
  there had been threats warnings and plain
  man-to-man talks with old campbell whom
  macneil knew when he was nothing but a
  puddler-and whom he feared about as
  much as a puddler whatever that may be

     the truth of the matter was that camp-
  bell recognized the fact that macneil with
  his faults was a better superintendent of
  construction than he would be able to find
  in many a long days search there were
  delays sometimes in the completion of a
  building on which macneil worked but
  when it was finished man it was a per-
  fect piece of work so macneil worked
  for the campbell building company and
  went off on his irregular bats when he
  pleased-sometimes close together some-
  times many months between

  then came the contract for the building
of the great giltmore hotel-the biggest
thing of its kind seen in this country since
the pennsylvania terminal was finished

it was to be the biggest hotel in the world-
as you know it is over a year was to
be spent in its construction and the lord
himself only knows how many millions of
dollars which millions of dollars you and i
will eventually return to the pockets of the
owners if we havent yet why i knew a
man who only stayed there a week and
when his bill came around he- but we
wont discuss that now we have to chron-
icle the affecting story of neil macneil
and of how neil macneil preserved the
purity of his soul

  neil macneil being the best superin-
tendent of construction the campbell build-
ing company had was put in charge of the
giltmore work old campbell knew that
even if he could not depend upon his su-

   perintendent to keep sober at least when
   the work was finished it would be acceptable
   to any one-and this was an important job

     he had a long talk with macneil before
   the work started it was important to the
   company that the job be finished on time
   there were penalties and so forth it was
   therefore important that macneil keep
   straight he impressed this on him mac-
   neil said he would db his best

                              ii

     the week after excavation work was
   started on the great giltmore plot-it was
   solid rock like a great deal of manhat-
   tan and required an enormous amount of
   blasting in small charges-old campbell
   stopped in at the superintendents shanty
   on his way to the office he wanted to hold
   converse with macneil

     when he entered the shanty there was
   nobody there but tim osullivan assistant
   superintendent-an excellent man but not
   a macneil being old and not able to break
   a pick handle on a mans head with the
   same verve he was poring over the blue
   prints scarce looking up when his door
   opened

      tim inquired old campbell wiping
   his silk hat with the sleeve of his morning
   coat  wheres mac

     tim looked up at him eying the silk hat
 with distinct disfavor to say nothing of
 the disgust with which he regarded the pink-
 and-white spotted necktie

    he is not here boss remarked tim
 shortly and turned to his work again hop-
 ing that would end the matter yet knowing
 that there was no chance

    tim look at me you old scoundrel
 persisted campbell  i didnt ask you
 whether he was here or not-i can see for
 myself he is not here is he- he looked
 at tim significantly

   tim knew what he meant and campbell
 knew that tim knew what he meant

    ye shpeak in riddles misther campbell
 ye shpeak av things beyant me province an
 tis not i-

    shut up is he off on a bat

   fairly cornered tim knew that there was
 no use in lying because macneil himself
dollars and drinks



would have been the first to report his ab-
sence and the reason therefor

   he nodded his head  i regret to report
that mac is at prisint lookin on th scotch
whin ut is smoky misther campbell-a de-
plorable thrait whin beer is so chape an
there is so much irish whisky to be had-

   when did he start tim inquired
campbell placing his silk hat thoughtfully
on his head where it so fascinated tim
that he could scarcely take his eyes off it
when he was finally able to wrench away
his gaze from the shining tile he answered
him

   yisterday noon had it av been
irish-

   never mind i know all about your
irish whisky broke in campbell troubled
he could see that there was to be no peace
of mind for him while the great giltmore
hotel was being erected under the super-
vision of the erratic neil macneil

    hell be back the day after to-morrow
remarked campbell dryly  keep the work
going until he shows up-then tell him i
want to see him at the office he turned
and went out knocking his silk hat against
the top of the door greatly to the joy of
tim osullivan

m

   true to campbells statement macneil
was back at work on the next morning but
one unregenerate and with an awful head-
ache

    tim he asked  has the old man been
around

   tim nodded  he has silk kelly an
all

    what did he say

    he remarked said tim  that ye wuz
th scum av th earth an deservin av no
dacint mans thrust t say nothin av-

    he was right tim interrupted mac-
xeil  who are you anyway to disap-
prove of what a scotchman says what
else did he say

    he said ye wuz t come to th office an
hold converse with him as soon as ye showed
up

   he did did he macneil looked up
  thoughtfully so he was to be discharged
  well all right-it would not be the first

time he knew he was to be discharged-
otherwise campbell would not have asked
him to come to the office he would have
stopped in and spoken to him here on the
job as usual

   as ive told ye often mac if ye wud
only learn to inhale a civilized drink such
as irish-

   forget it young feller me lad broke
in macneil  remember youre talking to
your superior and besides it takes edu-
cation to like scotch whisky-what would
you know about such things with the smell
of the peat bog still in your hair me im
off to the office-ill be back when i return
tim he added with dignity

  campbell in the severe mahogany and
glass privacy of his luxurious quarters
glanced up at the entrance of his superin-
tendent of construction who disdained such
slight things as being announced by office
boys-the young scuts

   hello chief-want to see me he
breezed

   i do mac said his employer shortly
putting aside his pen and assuming his
severest air he gazed at him for a mo-
ment judicially and sternly macneil
gazed back but said nothing

  it was campbell who broke the silence
finally

   mac he said  suppose i were to dis-
charge you

  macneil shrugged his shoulders  ive
been discharged by better men than you
geordie he said if one were to be dis-
charged he might just as wrell be defiant
about it

  campbell laughed outright  mac he
said  youre an irresponsible scalawtag-
and i dont know what to do about you

   then why bother geordie asked
macneil innocently

   well its this giltmore job its on my
nerves mac its going to cost me a lot
of money if it isnt finished on time-and
with you going off and getting pickled every
now and again theres a darned good chance
that we wont get through on time i cant
depend on you mac--thats the long and
short of it and yet theres nobody id
rather have on that work-if i could only
be sure youd stay on the job


argosy-allstory weekly

   oh i will boss macneil assured hrim
 im off the stuff this time for-

   nonsense cut in his employer  ive
heard that so often from you on the morning
after that it doesnt mean anything this
time you have to lay off the stuff-or its
all off between you and me

   have to queried macneil a little
stiffly he was not used to having people
address him in that tone of voice

   yes have to snapped back the other
 mac how would you like to have five
thousand dollars-all in a lump

  the superintendent of construction looked
at him inquiringly  i dont know he
drawled at last  i never had that much
at once-i guess it would buy an awful lot
of scotch-

   no you must lay off the scotch if you
want to get this money ive had an idea
mac im going to make you a proposition
if you dont take a drink for a year from
to-day ill give you a bonus of five thou-
sand dollars if-

   and if i do broke in macneil calmly
 you get discharged said campbell
shortly  get me-discharged

  the other nodded slowly  i have to lay
off for a year-

  to get this five thousand dollars mac
is it a go

   or get discharged

   yes said campbell  is it a go

   its a go geordie you old dollar-
squeezer said macneil but there was a
peculiar unfathomable gleam in his gray
eyes-a gleam that campbell was to remem-
ber later and wonder about  now if you
dont mind i have a certain little job of
work to attend to at the great giltmore
hotel so ill be going along well so-
long-and dont drink any scotch whisky
youre not used to it he flung back as a
parting shot the door closed behind him

  campbell picked up his pen again but
he did not write for a long time he was
thinking

iv

  the news of this curious proposition
spread through the campbell organization-
campbell himself told it to some of his
intimates in the office who in turn told it to

some of their intimates and in a few days
every intimate in the organization-which
included every man in the outfit-knew
about it

  all knew macneil and practically every-
body doubted his ability to earn the money
to say nothing of his willingness mac-
neil was an independent sort but then
again macneil was a scotchman-and to a
scotchman five thousand dollars was five
thousand dollars nevertheless the wise-
acres shook their heads and said he would
never do it there would be some slip at
last-a momentary weakness and it would
be all off because everybody knew that
if macneil once got started on the im-
bibing of scotch-let it be only one glass-
nothing on earth could stop him from go-
ing the route except a sudden disappearance
of the entire earthly supply of that presum-
ably delectable beverage

  but to the surprise of every one-except
perhaps campbell himself who had never
doubted the efficacy of his plan being sure
that the money would be a great enough in-
ducement to the man-macneil was keep-
ing straight and sober and the work went
on magnificently ahead of schedule a good
workmanlike job if ever there was one

  the months swung by in their orderly
rotation one after the other and summer
succeeded spring finally swinging into au-
tumn then winter the great giltmore hotel
ironwork was all up raising its gaunt ugly-
black head twenty-five stories above the
teeming earth alive with derricks red-hot
rivets flashing fifty yards deftly into a pail
five hundred feet above the ground the
pounding of the riveters making day and
night hideous in all the neighborhood a
bare skeleton triumphant above the squat
house that flanked it on all sides ready to
be clothed and turned over to its owners

  and in all this time macneil did not
drink he kept strictly and absolutely
sober much to the wonderment of all even
tim ventured to remark on it once in a
while as to a man who was selling himself
for gold

   some people is so crazy fer money he
remarked to macneil  that they will give
up their indipindince an their honor fer
that same not menshunin no names-
dollars and drixks



   ah what do you know about such
things bantered macneil knowing well
that he himself was meant by this clumsy
innuendo

  many were the jokes hurled at macneil
in those days when it began to look certain
that he was winning the fight he took
them all in good part even campbell con-
descended to comment on it when he
stopped in to see his superintendent

   good boy mac he said  keep up
the good work

   what good work inquired macneil
innocently

   why you know-that offer i made
you-

  oh that laughed macneil but said
no more

  and so the work drew on to its conclu-
sion and it became an accepted fact that
macneil would earn his bonus campbell
always theatrical decided on a spectacular
way of presenting macneil with his check

  the great giltmore hotel finished and
ready to be turned over to its owners on
april  would be completed-so far as
the campbell firm was concerned-on the
morning of the th now it happened
that the th of april was the day on
which macneils year of abstinence ended
-that is if he kept sober until midnight of
that day he had earned the money

  campbell jubilant at the successful con-
clusion of the work announced a great
dance in the ballroom of the great giltmore
for the night of the th of april-a ball
to which were invited the employees of the
campbell building company and their
friends he intended at the stroke of
twelve to call macneil to the middle of the
floor and present him with a check for five
thousand dollars

v

  the night of the ball-it was a gala
occasion for those who worked for the
campbell building company and for their
friends everybody was there early with
the exception of one person-neil macneil
son of angus macneil at eight thirty
when the gayety began he had not yet
come it caused no comment because it
was early at nine thirty he had not ar-

rived but still campbell was not uneasy-
macneil had promised to be there he
knew that he was to get his check that night
-it was common knowledge he would
certainly be there he had promised that
faithfully and macneil was a man who
kept his promises

at ten thirty macneil had not yet come
and neither had he turned up at eleven
campbell turned to tim osullivan re-
splendent in his sunday suit a little restive
 wheres mac he asked

   hell be here replied tim calmly
 rist assured av that-he wud not miss
this here scene av gayety fer annything
im thinkin-not him bliss his sowl
there was much speculation and at
eleven thirty practically everybody had
given up hope-when he came it was tim
who saw him first standing uncertainly at
the door

  mac he shouted and everybody
turned to look

  hatless hair disheveled collar half off
coat unbuttoned face flushed a triumphant
grin was on neil macneils face

  he was in complete possession of the most
glorious jag seen in that vicinity in many a
day he was absolutely and carefully
drunk in a complete silence he skated and
staggered across the hall to where camp-
bell angry and silent awaited him

  carefully he navigated over the slippery
floor to campbell in an expectant silence

   hlo geordie old top he shouted in
a mellow care-free voice  hows evry
little thing-

   mac  burst out the voice of campbell
 this is a helluva way to-

   shall ri me lad sh all rij answered
macneil  jus wanted t show you i
could do it for my own shelf-respeck-thass
all-not for your dirty money nobody can
buy neil macneil-on with th dansh-
let joy be unrefined old kidsh-lesh go
he noticed everybody staring at him silent-
ly he almost sobered he spoke coherently

   i can keep sober because i want to
geordie campbell-but not for any mans
money he said  now that you know
that ill never take another drop of booze
as long as i live

all mable knew

mable scowled as she entered the lit-
tle office and found both mr and
mrs george stuyvesant milburne
there she sensed unpleasantness and
trouble-and mable hated trouble-trou-
ble of any kind she liked things comfort-
able all around accordingly as she
crossed the threshold and camc race to face
with louise she flashed a warning glance
toward george as though to remind him
that she counted upon him fof protection

  there are very few men who could have
found it in their hearts to ignore such a
glance from such a delectable little morsel
as mable was at that instant in her fluffy
black dancing frock that just veiled her fig-
ure without hiding it her frosty white arms

and throat bare dazzling by contrast her
great dark eyes and three-cornered babys
mouth her brilliant fiery scintillating
mop of hair-she was ravishing and she
had that irresistible helplessness about her
george hurried toward her with his most
masterful manner

   dont be alarmed he said  no one
is going to harm you or distress you

  she smiled then gratefully and glanced
curiously at louise louise did not smile
she regarded george and mable with vague
detachment she often viewed perform-
ances that way at the theater

  it was garry then who took the situa-
tion in hand

   we asked you to come here he said
 because we want you to answer a ques-
tion-quite a simple question really but
an important one so please be sure when

this story began in the argosyallstory weekly for october 
the dance of death



you answer it that you are telling the ab-
solute and simple truth has mr mil-
burne left your party during the evening
mable looked from garry to george mil-
bume

   why no-i dont believe so she an-
swered slowly  unless it was when i left
the table to dance

   then you cannot declare upon your
oath that he did not leave the table put
in louise milburne eagerly

   no admitted mable and then added
curiously  why do you ask

  garry and silvers exchanged a question-
ing glance they were undecided about
revealing the truth-but george milburne
was troubled by no such uncertainty

   because guy da costa has been mur-
dered here to-night and they suspect me
of murdering him he said

  she stared round-eyed her thick lashes
brushing her cheek

   murdered she gasped  guy
good heavens and then with a wise
little shake of her bobbed red head  well
i often thought hed be lucky to get away
clean with the deals he pulled off but
why suspect you she protested as that
phase of the matter dawned upon her
 why should you want to murder guy
 he threatened his life-only to-night
-at dinner said garry

   ah-at dinner nodded mable  per-
haps he did then he had an idea that
guy was interested in mrs milburne but
when i saw how upset he was about it i
told him the truth and after that he
didnt give guy another thought he
chuckled over it all the time guy and i
were dancing

   chuckled over what asked louise

   the game guy was playing with you
said mable

   game repeated louise raising her
arched brows

   do you mean that guy da costa was
not interested in mrs milburne asked
garry

   of course not-not redly

  louise regarded the red-haired girl in-
tently

   you seem to speak with some convic-
tion she said slowly

   i do answered mable  you see i
dont want to hurt your feelings but this
seems to be a pretty serious mess and guy
told me all about it only this afternoon
thats funny dont you think he
dropped in at my place about five for cock-
tails and we got talking you know how
you will when youve had a couple of drinks
and youre feeling comfy

  louise did not nod understanding did
not even alter the expression of her face by
a shade she merely waited garry broke
the silence

   well he prompted

   well guy and i-we understand each
other pretty well he always had his eye
on the main chance and so had i and he
was looking out for himself just as i was
when youre depending on the public for
support youve got to look sharp because
somebody else was the favorite yesterday
and theres going to be a new one to-mor-
row you can bank on that some girls
go in for  love  ive always gone in for
something more substantial and lasting-
like money or jewels or furs or stock a
girl has got to look ahead you see and a
fellow like guy too of course he never
expected a finish like this so he was look-
ing to feather his nest against the time
when he wouldnt be able to dance any
more-or somebody else would be getting
the crowd the best way he could figure to
do that was to marry some wealthy girl
katherine kendall was the one he was try-
ing to land

   he told you this cried garry-

   yes he said he was just playing mrs
milburne along for what he could get out
of her-and out of knowing her well he
said hed looked into her affairs and she
had very little money in her own right it
was mostly georges money and mrs mfl-
bume mightnt get a sou if she got a di-
vorce he said he couldnt see himself
taking a chance like that-not with the
kendall girl in the running he said he
was just waiting for the right moment to
stage an elopement

   it isnt true cried louise passionate-
ly  this girl is lying to clear george
dont you see they think if they can
prove that guy didnt love me-george


argosy-allstory weekly

 would have had no motive but i can
 prove guy did love me i have his letters
 -love letters

    sure why shouldnt he write you
 love letters if you wanted them asked
 mable naively li he had nothing to fear
 he knew you would never use them against
 him and they might encourage you to
 write some back to him that he could use
 louise smiled coldly

    im afraid my girl your story wont
 quite convince a jury-against my love let-
 ters-in the light of your relations with
 george

    if youre afraid of anything said
 george  its facing the truth-that this
 rascally sicilian was only using you to fur-
 ther his own ends

    it was the kendall girl he was using
 said louise  to safeguard my reputation
 he told me so over and over again-and
 wrote it to me too

    you persist then in this mad belief
 that i killed him you purpose to press
 the charge cried milbume

    unless i am convinced that the guilt
 lies elsewhere answered louise  con-
 vinced too by unassailable proof

   for an instant he was inarticulate with
 rage then-

    you hell-cat he roared his face
 growing almost purple  youd drag my
 name m the dirt without a second thought
 ytoud flaunt your shame before the eyes of
 the world-from the front of every news-
 paper in town maybe youd go on the
 stand and tell your story you-mott
 thinking about avenging your dirty low-
 down lover instead of what you owe to my
 family and my name and this is what i
 get for picking you out of obscurity and
 putting you where you are i set you too
 high you cant be happy in my class-
 among my friends

   louise observed him with perfect calm-
 ness and some curiosity

    yrour friends she repeated  miss
 -er-scott-and the rest

    you leave me out of this  cried
 mable

 my dear george said louise  the
obscurity you picked me out of was a hap-
py and respectable home in philadelphia

where my family has lived since colonial
days-and the eminence you lifted me to
was the proud place by your side which i
have shared with miss scott and miss -
cott and god knows how many others
really you know for one who spends his
nights in such places as this you are being
most illogical and inconsistent and absurd
when you speak of my dragging your name
in the dust i have been infinitely more
particular and discreet than you have been
-infinitely 

    if i had known all this at dinner time
he answered choking  i should not even
have thought of killing da costa i should
have killed you i wish i had i only
wish i had

    mil bur tier cried silvers horrified
and-

    george gasped mable

    yes said louise  it is really too bad
you didnt my dear george it would have
been better all around-even for me what
a pity you only get these inspirations when
it is too late

   he was speechless

   garrv studying him was unable to de-
cide whether he had been guilty of the mur-
der or not he was precisely the sort of
man who would have felt obliged to cleanse
the stigma from his family name by just
such means-if he had credited guys re-
lationship with louise precisely the sort
to safeguard himself too beforehand by
arranging for mable to supply the neces-
sary alibi and mable would have supplied
it too for a price in spite of her boasted
intimacy with the murdered man on the
other hand their story might be true it
was a difficult problem to decide

   the most baffling thing about life is that
one never knows whether some one else is
telling the truth or not one feels that it
is the truth or one does not one is con-
vinced by evidence or one is not-but one
never really knous we cant creep into
anothers mind and investigate we must
just believe or disbelieve

   a woman says  i love you she says
it with melting eyes and we believe per-
haps we go through life believing - and
everything she says or does seems to indi-
cate that what she has said she means
the dance of death



 but ive never know what goes on in her
 secret mind and heart-only she knows-
 and god

 so now garry stared at milburne-and
 wished that he could see into the mind be-
 hind those angry shifting eyes

   did he kill guy da costa to avenge his
 honor or did he not

   did da costa mean to double-cross
 katherine or louise if he could only be
 made to speak but he was dead his
 lips were sealed for all time who could
 say what his real intentions were

    suppose we send for miss kendall
 said silvers suddenly  and see what she
 has to say in regard to this

    in regard to what asked garry

    this-this controversy she may be
 able to supply just the evidence we need-
 the conclusive proof

    thats not a bad idea chuckled mil-
 burne  bring them face to face eh
 the women da costa loved quite a dra-
 matic scene

    bring her if you like said louise

  as george so cleverly observes-we shall
 have one interest in common at any rate
 wre both adored him

   garry hesitated

    will you go and get her asked sil-
 vers  or shall i send a waiter

     ill go said garry slowly he dread-
 ed the effect of such a trying interview on
 the already overwrought girl but he dared
 not object lest he seem to be striving to
 conceal something he turned and left the
 little office at once but he frowned as he
 entered the supper room and let his eyes
 wander over the dancers

   he saw her almost at once-and cut in

    well she asked breathlessly and so
 appealingly that his heart ached for her
  any news is it over

    not yet he said gravely and winced
   as he saw the light of hope die in her beau-
   tiful eyes

    oh she whispered laying her head
   against him like -a child  im so tired
   so-o tired

   he held her close-so close that he could
   feel her heart beat

    if i could only spare you all this he
   murmured in agony in her ear

   i know she said looking up at him
gratefully there was the brilliant glitter
of tears in her eyes  but i deserve it
ive been so foolish its my own fault-
all of it i deserve whatever happens ive
been so willful and-and i knew better
i just wanted to be wild and reckless and
to court danger i liked playing with fire
i was bored and i was filled up with
silly romances i knew-always-that he
wasnt my kind-that i didnt really care
about him-not really with ail that is best
in me i deserve whatever comes

   he laid his cheek against her hair

   youve been splendid though - to-
night he said  so brave and strong
im proud of you it takes a big person to
admit to having been small any one who
admits that hes been wrong is all right
 dear garry she whispered tearfully
do you think you could go through
another interview-rather a trying one
he asked

    yes she answered and her voice did
not falter though it was an effort to keep
it firm

    louise milburne is here he explained
 and silvers wrants to bring you face to
face

   she nodded

   wtiy not i have nothing to hide
from her or any one ive told all i know
but i dont mind telling it again-or adding
anything that might be of use

    wrell stop near the door then he said
 and slip away theyre waiting in sil-
verss office

   an instant later he opened the door and
ushered her in

chapter xxi

liar cheat and cad

as katherine entered the little office

 louise milburne raised her head
and the eyes of the two women met
appraisingly-rather like swordsmen about
to engage it was not that there was ani-
mosity in either glance it was just that
combatants instinctively gage each other

  one was a woman of the world-world-
ly-a little embittered-very disappointed


argosy-allstory weekly

     in life as she had found it-perfectly poised
   and brilliantly self-assured she was a per-
   fect specimen of her type the other was
   a girl impulsive young with most of her
   illusions intact-and all of her freshness
   with lips slightly parted and eyes wide
   and a little wistful she regarded louise
   and then the others bravely and there
   was something about her apparent inno-
   cence very different from mables there
   was no artificiality about katherine she
   had adopted no pose she was frankly
   herself and so they all realized as she
   stood there waiting - expectant - a little
   frightened but striving hard not to betray
   that

    mrs milburne she said by way of
   greeting to the older woman and inclined
   her fluffy head slightly

    how do you do said louise milburne
   nodding in return  i did not think you
   would remember me-though we have met
   havent we

     yes i remember you perfectly of
   course said katherine

    was she thinking of seeing louise com-
ing out of guys apartment at two oclock
one night garry wondered

     i was quite sure wed met went on
louise slowly  where was it by the
way at poor guys rooms-was it not
he gave such nice parties didnt he

    i really dont know answered kath-
erine  i never went to his parties and
ive never been to his rooms

   no

   no answered the girl emphatically
he asked me-a number of times-and
assured me that awfully nice people went
but i was not especially interested in guys
friends

   louise smiled

    but you liked guy didnt you she
murmured

   u no i didnt like him answered kath-
 erine  he attracted me did you like
 him

    i loved him said louise milburne
with sudden passion

   katherine looked at her-and then slow-
ly round at the others who were looking on
as at a scene at a play-george milburne
silvers mable scott and garry

       im sorry was all that she could find
     to say

       i was planning to divorce my husband
    so that we could marry went on louise

      did guy know of this asked kath-
    erine

      george milburne laughed louises white
     face flushed

      im sorry cried katherine contritely
    i wasnt trying to be funny-or imperd-
   nent i just wondered how far he was re-
   sponsible in your decision to take such a
   step

       do you suppose i would have planned
   such a thing if he had not urged it upon
   me asked louise grimly

       no-of course not i cannot conceive
   of it and yet- oh he was dreadful-
   he was beneath contempt for he was urg-
   ing me to marry him always

       he was urging you repeated louise
    yes-truly i have letters-any num-
   ber of them - begging me we scarcely
   met without his pleading with me to elope
   and when i taxed him with being seen
   about a great deal with you he-please
   forgive me but i must tell the truth
   mustnt i he said that you sought him
   out-that you cared about him-and that
   he was only trying to be kind and not hurt
   you because you cared

     louise laughed softly

     thats exactly what he told me about
 you she said  and that his being seen
 so much with you safeguarded my reputa-
 tion 

      he was not sincere with either one of
 us you see said katherine gravely turn-
 ing to the others  he was deceiving as
 both and god knows how many more

    he was sincere with me cried louise

  i know it

   oh no protested katherine he
 wasnt dont go on fooling yourself-and
 caring he wasnt worth it he wasnt
 worthy of you-or me he deserves what
 he got-and he got it because he was the
 kind of man he was you and i - we
 found him charming handsome romantic
 and we let his physical appeal blind us to
 his lack of real virtues but now-whats
 the use of refusing to face the truth let
 us forget him-the whole incident let us
the dance of death



recognize him for the liar and cheat and
cad that he was

   she spoke passionately with the fire and
intensity of righteous indignation for she
had played fair with da costa she had
been quite frank with him always-and he
had never been

    i believe you hiew that he really loved
me-and you killed him  cried louise
katherine stood staring-speechless -
 why every word youve said convicts
you went on louise fiercely  i believe
you found out that hed been deceiving you
-that it was hopeless-your passion for
him-and you wrere so enraged you struck
him down

  nonsense cried katherine i
couldnt kill any one as for guy - i
didnt really understand him until after-
ward he was dead when i reached that
little room i tell you and i went there
feeling about him as i had felt all along for
months it was only as i looked at him
lying there-and things began to be re-
vealed-that-that i reconstructed my im-
pression of him i dont know how it was
but whatever the spell was that he had cast
over me seemed to pass with his passing
and i saw him plainly for the first time it
was a kind of hypnotism i think and
when he died it left me free and humiliated
and ashamed

    you say he was dead when you readied
the little room asked louise

  yes

   the little room where he wtas mur-
dered

  yes

    you were the first to reach him after-
ward

    yes said katherine

   all this was news to louise she looked
from the girl to the others

    well i was wrong she said  it was
not george who killed him - though he
died because he was going away with me
dont you see it-all of you why its so
plain katherine kendall struck him down
-in a jealous rage-when she learned the
truth

   i am afraid that you are right mrs
milburne said silvers

  nonsense i tell you cried garry

  there wasnt time i was at the foot of
 the stairs she had scarcely entered the
 room when she screamed and i followed
 her in 

  how many minutes elapsed asked
 silvers

 garry reflected

  only two or three said katherine
 with trembling lips  i just went in-and
 i didnt see him i crossed the room to
 the smoking room but he wasnt there
 then i came back again-and saw him ly-
 ing behind the door and i screamed

  that would have taken quite a few
 minutes i should say put in louise

  but i didnt kill him i didnt i
 didnt i whispered katherine hoarsely

 she was near the breaking point now
 garry laid his hand on her arm

  steady  he begged gently

  i should like a few moments talk with
 miss kendall - alone said silvers sud-
 denly

 why asked garry facing him

  never mind why ive been mighty
 patient with you ive run the risk of get-
 ting myself in wrong with the police ive
 given you time to look for evidence ive
 gone just about as far as im going and
 thats flat now i want a talk with this
 girl alone and if youre not satisfied with
 that ill call the police and ill tell you
 one thing thats sure-they wont be as
 easy on her as ill be

  let him talk to me garry why not
 said katherine

 he yielded

  very well he said ei ill wait just
 outside

  and well go back to our table if no-
 body objects said george milburne  i
 need a drink

 he opened the door mable passed out
 he turned to louise

 will you join us my dear he asked
 cynically

 thank you no she answered calmly

 very well my dear just as you
 please see you later

 he was gone

  let me get you a table-in a corner
 somewhere said garry

  thank you


argosy-allstory weekly

  she took his arm for support and went
with him into the supper room where
charlie had a small table set up for her in
a corner-and served champagne

   in the office silvers fixed katherine with
sharp determined eyes

   now he announced firmly  we are
going to get the truth

chapter xxii

a knock at the door

 ve told you the truth declared katli-
i erine earnestly  all of it-everything
i know truly mr silvers

  i dont believe you said silvers
grimly

   mr silvers cried katherine weakly
i dont believe you he repeated
 you can take in this carpenter fellow be-
cause hes in love with you and hed be-
lieve you if you told him the earth was
square but im not in love with you see
im a plain practical man with a lot of
common sense and i say it looks to me
like you killed da costa 

   i didnt protested katherine

   come on now the wisest thing for
you to do is own up to it and get a good
lawyer and trust him and your youth and
your sex and your looks to get you out of
this mess i tell you straight it looks
fishy and youll never get away with this
story youre telling now

   but its true cried katherine

   weve still got men on juries said
silvers  and as long as we have there aint
one chance in a million of your going to
the chair after all da costa vas a rot-
ter and youve got money enough to get a
damned good defense framed up for you
hes dead and nobody much cares as far
as i can see except maybe mrs milburne
and i hate to think what public opinion is
going to do to her if she goes on the stand
and spills the tale she spilled here so
come along give us the real facts i
assure you im giving you exactly the same
advice id give my own girl if she was in
your place the truth has a way of leak-
ing out when you least expect it to-and
in a way you never figured on-and then-

well-everything looks so much worse be-
cause youve been trying to hide things
better take my tip young woman and give
us the dope

   but i tell you i have ive told you
everything i know about the murder
everything

   well maybe he growled disgustedly
 but i dont believe you and whats
more-no jury will believe you either
he walked the length of the little office
disgustedly biting on a cigar his brow
was knitted his eyes glittered thought-
fully

   suppose you werent connected with
this case yourself he said finally  and
somebody came to you with these facts
heres a man found dead a girl hes been
making love to comes out of the room
where he is and says she found him mur-
dered but hes still warm and bleeding
its plain the deed has just been done
and theres no other exit to the room-no
other way anybody could have got out
then added to this the fact that he was
planning to elope the same night with an-
other woman and certain letters of hers
are produced in which she admits she feels
like killing him and shes jealous of the
other woman in question well what
would you say yourself

  she was staring at him

   did you say certain letters can be pro-
duced my letters

  yes said he

   my letters to guy

   yes i have em in the safe yonder
want to see them

   please

  she sat breathless her hands clenched
together while he manipulated the combi-
nation opened the safe found the letters
and brought them to her

   well he asked holding them out in
plain view

  she caught her lower lip between her
teeth and bit into it her eyes were terri-
fied tears slowly filled them

   well he said again  they are
yours arent they

   yes she said throwing up her head
l i wont lie i dont care what you find
out-or what you think- -or what they do
the dance of death



to me im going to stick to the truth and
tell only that they are my letters -written
to guy and i was jealous of louise-and
i did speak about wanting to kill him but
i didnt kill him i didnt  didnt

   she was on the verge of hysterics now
 hold on he cried gruffly tears
 aint going to get you anything

  she buried her head in her arms and be-
gan to sob and garry hovering outside
opened the door and came in in violent
haste he glared at silvers

   katherine katherine he whispered
soothingly laying his hand on her heaving
shoulders and turning then upon sil-
vers shouted  what have you been say-
ing to her

    ive been telling her straight that the
 case against her looks bad-that everybody
 thinks she did it except you-and youd
 think so too if you werent in love with
 her shes got to know how things stand
 man and face the music this show is
 about over

   dont listen to him-dont mind him
said garry to the girl  i believe in you
and ill move heaven and earth to estab-
lish your innocence you just trust me
with her head still hidden she reached
for his hand and clung to it

   well you can do as you like about
that said silvers  after ive turned her
over to the police thats my duty and
im going to do it

   not yet youre not said garry
 you gave me your word you wouldnt
until daybreak and weve got a little time
left before then

    all right but you dont think youre
going to accomplish anything do you
said silvers  i tell you-the further you
go into this thing the worse you make it
look for the girl better get her to plead
guilty and let some good lawyers frame up
a defense for her

 katherine raised her tear-wet face
 no she cried i wont have it
 id rather die maintaining my plea of in-
 nocence than plead guilty and go free i
 didnt kill him and i wont say i did not
 even if i can save my life that way

     brave girl  said garry softly with
   shining eyes

 she smiled at him

  ive been a little fool she said  but
 ive only been foolish not wicked not law-
 less and thats all over now im going
 to settle down into a sensible woman
 youll see

 silvers scratched his head

  i wish to god i could believe her he
 said grimly

  can-and do aid garry

 katherine was rouging her lips again
 powdering her nose fluffing out her hair
 with dexterous little pats and tugs both
 men watched her thoughtfully

  well said silvers finally when she
 had finished  what is the next move
 i give you until daybreak as i said i would
 and ill help you all i can i can be that
 game anyway

 garry stood wrapped in thought

  first of all katherine must go back
 to the supper room of course he said

  must i she exclaimed wearily  if
 you knew how hard it is to grin and dance
 and feel all the time that you must faint
 with the suspense the terror i dont think
 i can stand much more of it 

  you must said garry quietly

  very well she agreed with a catch in
 her breath ill try ill go on until i
 drop

 he laid his hand on the doorknob to
 open the door and usher her back to the
 dance floor

  and meanwhile asked silvers ar-
 resting him

 garry hesitated

 lt meanwhile he said  i dont know
 i must think

 and then there came a knock on the door
 from the other side

chapter xxiii

enter a corsican

garry opened it and confronted a
waiter who stood there somewhat
startled to find silvers not alone

 he was a small dark man with strange-
 ly set dark eyes-eyes set somewhat aslant
 in his face so that he looked always as
 though he were just starting to smile he


argosy-allstory weekly

 had rather a long pointed nose that gave
 him an inquisitive air his mouth was large
 and never quite closed for the rest he
 wore the conventional green and gold livery
 that all the waiters at the king of clubs
 wore and yet he did not look exactly
 like the others there was something
 about him that set him apart-something
 intangible perhaps an air-a way of carry-
 ing his head--a wav of tossing back his
 thick black hair he was a type that one
 would be apt to remember all this garry
 observed in an instant as the man stood
 hesitating in the doorway

    mr silvers please-pardon he said
 somewhat awkwardly and with a decided
 italian accent  i was looking for mr
 da costa

    da costa repeated garry quickly
  what do you want of da costa

   the waiter hesitated scrutinizing garry
  its all right napoleon speak up said
 silvers reassuringly and added to garry
 and katherine  hes da costas personal
 bootlegger and he suspects you of being
 government officials i think

   at that napoleon smiled broadly

    oh no he protested with a gesture
 that appealed for sympathetic comprehen-
 sion  but i saw that mr silvers was
 with friends and i hesitated to disturb
 him for after all it was only mr da
 costa that i want to speak with

    im afraid thats impossible napoleon
 hes-gone said garry

    gone napoleon regarded him with
 round bright shrewd eyes for all the world
 like a bird he turned from garry to sil-
 vers inquiringly  thats very strange
 he said

    strange repeated silvers

    well you see he told me to come right
back explained napoleon  he said he
would wait upstairs in the little room but
i have been up there and the door it is
locked and nobody come when i knock
 i see da costa sent you somewhere
did he asked garry

   napoleon observed him his face was
suddenly masklike he was becoming
aware of something unusual in the atmos-
phere-a strangeness he was suddenly
alert and on guard

  yes somewheres he answered non-
 committally

  where asked silvers obeying a
 glance from garry

 i well you see said napoleon  he
 couldnt go himself because he got to dance
 some more and then there was the under-
 standing that the doors they remain locked

 but napoleon can go out the back way and
 nobody even miss him you see

 he smiled ingratiatingly

  go where asked silvers again

  on the errand for mr da costa said
 napoleon

  what errand

  mr da costa tell me not to tell said
 napoleon  im sorry but mr da cos-
 ta he get me this job see and he tell me
 not to tell nobody

 just the same youd better tell said
 garry  da costas gone-and he isnt
 going to come back and youre liable to
 get into trouble with the police if you dont
 tell what you know

  mr da costa he got in trouble with
 the police asked napoleon

  never mind that where did he send
 you-and what for asked garry
 napoleon shrugged regretfully

  i am corsican he said

  well what has that got to do with it
 asked silvers

  corsican explained napoleon  never
 break his promise

 garry looked at silvers in exasperation

  suppose they put you in jail if you re-
 fuse to tell what you know asked silvers

  i have been in jail lie fore said na-
 poleon casually  probably go again any-
 way sometime maybe american jails not
 so bad italian jails they are jails

 he smiled

  then you persist in your refusal said
 garry

  im very sorry said napoleon  too
 bad i am born corsican

 nobody could have been more polite or
 more obdurate

 napoleon turned slowly to go garry
 stopped him

  wait just a minute answer me this
 then how long have you known da cos-
 ta he asked
the dance of death-



 napoleon turned back with alacrity
 now

   me i have known him years and years
  since italy he said

   you knew him on the other side cried
  silvers incredulously

  yes we was boys together there
 said napoleon  mr da costa he is tony
 costello then corsican too like me

   so his name was not really da costa
  cried garry

  who knows asked napoleon of the
 world at large

  i mean it was not always da costa

  no he was tony costello in italy

  and when he came over he changed
 it asked garry  why

  napoleon frowned

  why you want to know all these
 things are you of the police he asked

  no answered garry  i am riot
 mr silvers here and i are working to
 keep the police out of this so if you want
 to help us-and da costa-youll tell us
 whatever you can

    napoleon was plainly troubled

     how can i help when i dont know
 what da costa has done he asked

     it is not what da costa has done
 said garry quietly  it is what some one
 else has done to him

    napoleons eyes suddenly lighted with a
  gleam of understanding

     ah some one is after him that is
 why he has gone away he cried

     exactly some one desired to kill him
  to-night said garry

    napoleons eyes narrowed he nodded

     that might happen to any man he
 said  in corsica killings occur every
 day where the blood is hot the passions
 are fierce he looked from one to the
 other meditatively  but it is not like
 tony to run away he added  that is
 not the corsican way

    suddenly he drew a long breath his nos-
  trils quivered he threw back his head

     no he cried in a ringing voice  he
  has not run away your english tricked
  me but now i understand some one has
  not only desired to kill him some one has
  killed him

     well-yes garry admitted

   u and you wish to keep out the police
you wish to avenge this deed yourselves
that is the corsican way he nodded ap-
provingly  the vendetta in this i will
help 

    can you asked katherine wistfully
coming forward for the first time

  napoleon smiled broadly his teeth
flashed and from somewhere in the vicinity
of his hip pocket he drew suddenly a stil-
etto wickedly narrow of blade and sharp
and bright

    my blade he said dramatically  will
 drink the murderers blood i swear it
 garry seized his arm katherine shrank
 back with a little cry

    no thanks he said  we dont want
any more killings to turn him over to the
law is vengeance just the same and you
wont have to pay the death penalty

    to the corsican said napoleon  the
death penalty in such an affair like this is
a great honor tony was my friend since
years still to live is pleasanter than to
die i will not use the stiletto there are
other ways

   tf but you have not told us yet on what
sort of errand he sent you said garry

    i cannot tell i have given my word
as a corsican said napoleon  to tell no
one of this errand but i did not promise
not to show what i was bringing back to
him 

   he beamed as he thought of this way
out of the difficulty and produced from his
pocket an envelope opening it he dis-
played its contents

    steamer tickets for two - aboard the
steamship queen of italy cried garry
 made out for mr and mrs antonio cos-
tello

    so he was intending to elope  cried
silvers  but with whom

  they all looked at napoleon he
shrugged

   t when one has money he said  wom-
en are devoted and to tony one was
much like another maybe he had not yet
decided eh

    then you dont think a woman might
have killed him

   napoleon shrugged

   maybe he said  but american


argosy-allstory weekly

  women are not so quick to kill as our wom-
  en of italy not so violent in love not
  so violent in hate i think it was a man
  killed tony-some man he feared when
  he called me to go on this errand-fear
  looked from his eyes

      what makes you think it was a man he
  feared asked garry  might it not have
  been a woman

    no tony was not afraid of women
  he has turned back a knife before this
  with a smile and a kiss and a sweet word
  will stop a bullet-if a woman hold the
  gun but with a man it is different
  garry nodded

    i dare say-yes he agreed but
  how are we going to find the guilty man
  in those-crowded rooms downstairs

     i will find him said napoleon confi-
  dently

   how

  napoleon shrugged

    it is simple i will find the man whose
   nerves are jumping-whose ears are listen-
   ing-whose eyes dart this way and that

  a man who has done a thing like this can-
  not look or act like other men sharp eyes
  can seek him out

   and if you find him-youll come and
  tell me asked garry

   when i find him repeated napoleon

 i will come and tell you

  he turned then without another word
and vanished and as he went his feet-
in soft-soled waiters shoes-made no
sound katherine and garry and silvers
looked at one another

    i am glad he is not on my trail said
katherine  a man like that would stop
at nothing hes dreadful didnt you
feel it dreadful

  garry nodded

   dreadful enough he said  to have
committed the murder himself

chapter xxiv

the hunter and the hunted

silvers shook his head in perplexity

 if he had done it and had got
away he would never have come
back he said  especially with two tickets

  for italy in his pocket-and the boat sail-
ing to-morrow

   ah but thats just what he would have
done-a clever chap like that-to evade
suspicion smiled garry  at first-act-
ing upon impulse-he might have run
away but on second thought he would
have come straight back with the excuse
that guy had sent him on an errand and
he would have protested his friendship for
guy-and would have started in an earnest
search for the murderer

   do you mean that you seriously sus-
pect this man now asked katherine
wide-eyed

  garry shrugged

   i suspect every one-except you he
admitted

  she slipped her hand through his arm
gratefully and stood there clinging to him

    its true said silvers grimly  these
wops will stick each other as quick as a
wink-over practically nothing tuo hot
blood-as napoleon himself said you
never can tell they aint like us at all
and napoleon could easily have got that
steak knife i suppose he wouldnt have
used his own stiletto for fear of it being
recognized

   but had he a reason for killing guy
asked katherine

   thats just it we dont know said
silvers

   well no harm to wait a bit and see
what he does said garry  its a long
way from daylight still shall we go and

dance

his eyes rested tenderly on the girl

 if you wish said she submissively
silvers nodded

 youd better and ill go and have a
few words with a friend of mine down there

i havent seen him for years and thanks
to this trouble ive had to let him sit there
all evening by himself

  they left the office and moved toward
the supper rooms to katherine it seemed
as if the night had already lasted a long
lifetime but the band was still playing
blatantly the musicians were still smiling
cheerfully and bursting into song when
their enthusiasm got too great to endure in
silence the dancers still danced-if any-

                          	a
the dance of death



thing more violently than ever they had
of course been imbibing liquor steadily
some of the men wore paper caps on their
heads and looked inordinately silly in them 
paper tape of various colors had been
thrown and still uttered the floor and hung
grotesquely from the chandeliers in long
festoons colored lanterns bobbed about
and burst one after another with sudden
sharp reports but the waiters kept toss-
ing more in among the tables these grown
up revelers were easily amused now-fas-
cinated by the playthings of their children
and grandchildren

  one gray-haired dowager had abandoned
her dancing partner to go struggling after a
miniature dirigible while her partner--a
youth in his twenties-pursued her amor-
ously one fat man was leaning out with
a cigar held ready and was delightedly ex-
ploding the balloons as fast as he could
he was as pleased over each success as
though it had been a victory on wall
street

  a small dark man who looked like a
south american was doing strange steps
dipping and turning and whirling wildly
to the supreme satisfaction of the very thin
very blond very notorious woman with
him and they seemed quite unconscious
of the fact that they were colliding into
other couples whose angry glances and
murmured anathemas followed them they
seemed to be absorbed in exhausting some
hellish energy that filled them with feverish
unrest

  the room had grown very warm the
revelers had grown noisier some of the
women did not look quite so immaculate or
well-groomed now here one had torn a
length of chiffon from her gown and left it
dragging there one went heedless of un-
tidy hair and there were men with wilted
collars and ties awry the flowers too had
begun to droop

   as katherine and garry joined the
  dancers napoleon took up a position near
  the dance floor and studied the gyrating
  couples with a casual eye that missed noth-
  ing

    although he had as yet no definite sus-
  picions against any of da costas quondam

     	a

associates he knew that the sight of a face
-or a glance swiftly averted-would pres-
ently crystallize various unrelated recollec-
tions floating in his mind now into a con-
nected chain and that this chain would
lead him inevitably to the murderer

  all this may make napoleon appear to
be a clear-thinking individual with more
than an average allotment of intelligence
but such was not the case he was merely
a very shrewd italian of the peasant class
who had lived by his wits all his life and
the peasant class living close to the earth
is apt to have instinctive sense strongly
developed napoleon did not reason things
out-not as a general thing that is he
felt things he exercised a faculty in war-
fare similar to the faculty certain animals
employ

   very few deep-thinking men have this
faculty it is not ordinarily part of the
masculine make-up animals have it and
women and when women have it wre call
it intuition by some means that is never
clear to the logical mind a woman will sud-
denly startlingly arrive at the solution of
a problem and will be right though she
cannot support her decision by arguments
or proofs napoleon had this same ability
-at least to some small degree and so he
felt that if he just watched and waited
something would betray the guilty man to
him if he was in the room

   it was not that napoleon relied upon
miracles he knew enough of da costas
life and da costas friends to know just
which particular individuals in that assem-
bly to study

   moffat i- ielding passed him dancing with
joan he scrutinized them both with nar-
rowed eyes fielding he knew as one of
da costas former intimates-a youth for
whom da costa had often obtained drugs
but napoleon eliminated fielding

   joan he knew as one of da costas cast-
off mistresses but he eliminated joan

  george milburne went by with mable
he studied them a long time dubiously
feeling in milburne a potential  killer
but eventually he dismissed him from his
mind milburnes manner was not the
manner of a man who had guilt on his soul


argosy-allstory weekly

    it does not require a conscience to make
 guilt a burden hard to bear unflinchingly
 it requires only a definite knowledge of the
 possible consequences

   you kill knowing that you are commit-
 ting a crime which is punishable by your
 own death if you are found out this
 knowledge colors your future thoughts
 your future movements your future ac-
 tions you cannot prevent it you are
 alert you are on guard you are look-
 ing for suspicion to be directed upon you
 you are listening for the advancing foot-
 steps of the pursuers you are waiting-
 everlastingly waiting-to be caught this
 shows in your eyes-in the poise of your
 head-in the way you hold vour hands

    napoleon who had killed in his day and
 had helped to trap others who had killed
 knew these things well so he continued
 his search here were these people locked
 in these rooms escape was impossible
 the murderer knew that he knew like-
 wise that there was a dead man on the
 floor above with a knife wound in his
 throat it was a race between discovery
 of that body and the opening of the doors
 he must be counting the minutes you
 cannot sit counting the minutes and remain
 calm while your life hangs in the balance
 you cannot dance and remain indifferent
 outwardly you may retain an appearance
 of serenity but the signs will be there for
 those who can to read

   old mrs chipman jounced by more
 danced against than dancing a sleek-
 haired blond young man from one of the
 english theatrical companies did his best
 to guide her hazardous course once da
 costa had so guided her indeed it had
 been da costa who had first taught her to
 dance but napoleon wasted no time upon
 mrs chipman or her latest consort at
 the most da costa had got out of her only
 a few occasional thousands in cash and
 some presents of jewelry there was noth-
 ing there to furnish motive for a murder-
 no one inclined to commit the murder even
 if there had been a motive mr chipman
 did not care in the least with whom his
 wife amused herself nor how much money
 she spent on her dancing partners he
 could afford whatever she wanted and he

 was still fond of her in spite of her fool-
 ishness after all years of living together
 does create a kind of bond so mrs chip-
 man went ricochetting gayly on her way

  katherine caught his eye next she
floated-in garrys arms-like a thing of
thistledown swept on by a breeze and as
she danced she gazed off into space wist-
fully-with dreaming eyes and red lips that
drooped at the corners she was thinking
how safe she felt with his arms about her
and his lips whispering words of comfort
and encouragement against her shining hair
she had known him for years and yet had
never really known him until to-night-
certainly had never appreciated him before
and the hot color flamed in her cheeks as
she recalled her folly over da costa and
the fact that garry knew of it it seemed
incredible now that she had ever even
fancied herself caring for the dancer-that
she had even for a mad instant hesitated
between garry and him it had been a
kind of enchantment she felt it must
have been and she trembled for her fu-
ture so long as she was free to fall a prey
to others of his ilk she clung to garry at
the thought-clung close-almost desper-
ately reassuring herself with the feel of
him there and he smiled down at her
confidently his heart beating fast to hold
her close like this was to him his dreams
come true for he had loved her all his life
-since first he had seen her a long-legged
girl in a middy blouse with curls to her
elbows there had been no bobbed heads
then he felt as though all that they had
gone through-and all that there was yet
to face-was as nothing if out of it was
born that lasting love between them for
which he had always hoped there are
some men that love lightly and often and
some men that love only once garry was
one of these and napoleon watching
them knew it and realized that this man
would kill for this woman if the need arose
but though he looked anxious-concerned
-he had not the mien of a guilt man nor
yet that of a hero

  there was no one else on the dance floor
that napoleon connected with da costa
and he was disturbed for a moment only
then he bethought him of the others seat- 
the dance of death



ed off among the scattered tables and he
began slowly to traverse the room his eyes
darting sharply left and right

   he noted mrs milburne and passed her
by he noted everton bancroft from
whom da costa had stolen joan olcott
but he was leaning across the table gazing
into the eyes of a younger beauty and in
his dull drink-dimmed eyes and on his fat
smug face there was no sign of guilt

  he went on slowly - meeting with no
success until he came to the little niche
screened with palms where silvers sat fac-
ing bartlett-and as napoleons eyes fell
upon bartlett he stopped suddenly where
he was and stood staring his jaw dropped
his nostrils quivering

   bartlett was very pale and was loung-
ing there calmly but with an enforced calm
that hid a secret uneasiness his ears lis-
tened strainedlv in his eyes was a hunt-
ed nervous look

   here were the signs he had been seeking
and the significant fact was that here was
a man in whom the signs might easily be
weighty with meaning for napoleon knew
that bartlett had known tony costello in
san francisco napoleon knew just how
much bartlett had done for tony and just
how badly tony had treated bartlett not
that he sympathized with bartlett for the
way tony had mistreated him he merely
knew the facts and found in them a motive
and he knew bartlett and felt in him the
courage and strength of a man who might
easily reap his vengeance unaided

he stood motionless - with palpitating
heart-wondering if bartlett would remem-
ber him true he had been only a bus boy
on the barbary coast when tony had first
danced there but men who lived by their
wits as bartlett always had usually had
an uncanny memory for faces

  as napoleon hesitated pondering his
 next move silvers turned round and espied
 him

    here bring me a glass of that martel
  brandy  he called

   napoleon bowed and backed off an un-
   holy joy glowing warm in his breast he
   knew that silvers did not drink he
   guessed that the brandy was intended for
   bartlett and he had a tiny white powder

in his wallet that would be tasteless in the
brandy and that would pay da costas
debt to bartlett more quietly than a stiletto
wound but just as effectively

   napoelon had been carrying the powder
for a long time against just such an emer-
gency as this

chapter xxv

the innocent and the guilty

silvers had felt some alarm upon re-
joining bartlett and finding him
crouched down in his chair with vague
eyes and a colorless face but bartlett had
met all of his inquiries with shrugs of un-
concern and it w-as not until silvers sug-
gested the martel brandy that bartlett dis-
played any interest whatever he was fond
of old brandy-indeed in regard to liquors
he had the discriminating taste of a con-
noisseur and  martel  tempted his
palate beyond endurance besides there
was the chance that the fiery stuff might
lend him strength it was stimulating and
sustaining always so he smiled and yield-
ed when silvers proffered it

   the brandy ordered silvers abandoned
the subject of bartletts health observing
that he did not like to dwell upon it and
attempted to catch bartletts interest by
returning to the matter of the murder
again it was uppermost in his mind any-
way and he thought it might keep bart-
letts mind off his own condition it did
he noted that at once with satisfaction
he recognized the light of quickening in-
terest in bartletts eyes as soon as he began
to speak

   well he said it looks as if weve
found the woman-the one who did da
costa i mean 

    yes prompted bartlett

    got hold of some letters that  settle
 it  think funny how a woman can look
 as if butter wouldnt melt in her mouth and
 still have hell-let-loose inside her

    some-fast woman asked bartlett
 no - thats the strangest part of it
 one of the wealthiest girls in town-a so-
 ciety girl

 well said bartlett  i guess it doesnt


argosy-allstory weekly

    make much difference what class theyi
    born into-its whats inside em will count
    in the end and then he added with ap-
    parent irrelevance  shell be able to ex-
    ert influence and wealth in her behalf any-
    way  

       it  be a nine days wonder when it
    gets out said silvers  front-page stuff
    -and it ii ruin me here this has been
    an unlucky night for me all right-first
    losing my biggest asset-da costa-and
    then getting into a mess like this on my
    opening night here

      ive got a little put by said bartlett
    contritely  if you get in over your head

       oh ive got a little put by myself
 thanks just the same silvers assured him
 with a wink  but i dont mean to cut
 into that if i can help it-not in times like
 these if i can only handle this affair
 right i might have my losses taken care of
 for me but it takes tact you wont mind
 if i leave you again will you i got to
 keep my mind on this affair until its set-
 tled

     thats all right i kind of like to sit
 here quietly by myself bartlett assured
 him  and just look on

 fine cried silvers nodding you
 just make yourself comfortable and if you
 cant get anything you want let me know 
 he was off again bartlett gazed after
 his squat figure reflectively

   make yourself comfortable there
 was something almost ludicrous in that
 parting injunction as though he could
 possibly make himself comfortable there
 sitting stiffly upright when he ought to be
 bandaged and in bed and sitting there
 under the constant strain of their investi-
 gation - fearing lest at any minute they
 find his trail-fearing lest the napkin slip
 down at an unguarded moment and the
 blood stain be revealed-fearing lest his
 paltry strength give out before he had suc-
 ceeded in dragging his weary body home to
 safety

 make himself comfortable da costa
was more comfortable he thought lying at
ease up there under his skimpy white cov-
ering he feared nothing he dreaded
nothing he suffered nothing the great
silence had engulfed him

      and suddenly bartlett got an odd idea
    he wondered if it might not have been
    wiser to let da costa murder him surely
    he would have been happier-out there in
    the hereafter-knowing that his enemy was
    here fearing dreading suffering and then
    -if there was a future life-it would have
    been da costa who would have had to face
    his judges and exonerate himself

       bartlett had never thought about te fu-
    ture life he scorned himself now for
    thinking of such rubbish and told himself
    that his loss of blood had muddled his
    brain-that his weakness was responsible
    it had given him fancies

      the idea of judgment and a hell in
   which spirits burned eternally and a
   heaven where harps were played no he
   really could not credit those things nor
   yet the strange life of which conan doyle
   and others were telling let the subject
   be he would know in time-and take his
   medicine like a man whatever it might be

     napoleon arrived-bearing a single glass
  of brandy on a silver tray it was a small
  glass filled almost to the brim with a bur-
  nished brown-gold liquor crystal clear
  the white powder that he had carefully
  stirred into it had dissolved perfectly leav-
  ing no trace it was tasteless too and
  without odor the bouquet of the brandy
  was unaffected but the effect of the
  brandy was tremendously reenforced
  death lurked now in its golden drops

    above the tray napoleons face smiled
 ingenuously like a childs he set his
 precious burden down

    brandy he said and stood aside
 waiting

    thanks said bartlett to him na-
 poleon was just a waiter like other waiters

 he did not suspect him he did not even
 closely observe him he reached out and
 took the brandy glass in his fingers-stud-
 ied the color with a connoisseurs pleased
 glance sniffed the bouquet

    and his mind-easily influenced by pass-
  ing impressions now because of his weak-
  ness-went drifting back through the years
  to a girl that he had known and loved once
  when he was young-a fresh young thing
  with cheeks like spring blossoms and danc-
  ing brown eyes the brandy recalled her
the dance of death



because he had been particularly fond of
the old french brandy that her mother had
and he had made that his excuse for going
often to the inn her mother ran the inn
and the little nichette served she wore
the wooden shoes of the peasant and a
very crisp white cap and bartletts gran-
deur had impressed her tremendously he
had made a  killing  on the ponies and
had decided to see europe and he had
made another killing at monte carlo and
was spending money like a king no one
else spends money like a king because no
one else comes by it so easily and bart-
lett who had always made capital of other
peoples weaknesses knew how to appeal
to nichette he had told her stories of
the world beyond brittany - stirring her
imagination he had given her a string of
shining beads for her white throat a glit-
tering comb for her bright hair and she
had given him her foolish little heart in ex-
change for these baubles he remembered
her white arms round his neck-her danc-
ing eyes that could so swiftly fill with tears
-her voice

  napoleon waiting impatiently to remove
the brandy glass when bartlett had drunk
from it and wash it himself lest some trace
of the white powde linger fretted at the
delay

  why did he not drink

  did he suspect

  did some instinct warn him of danger

   his dark eyes studied bartlett critically
but bartlett unaware dreamed on he
had forgotten the brand- as one forgets the
messenger that brings glad tidings but he
was still fingering the glass absently and
his eyes rested upon it as a crystal gazers
rests upon his crystal napoleon waited for
a moment eager for the reverie to be ended
and his vengeance accomplished but still
bartlett did not drink and then charlie
passed by summoning the loitering napo-
leon with a commanding wave of the hand
napoleon dared not disobey charlie nor
dared he court suspicion of his actions by
lingering in bartletts vicinity though he
was anxious to reclaim the brandy glass
when it was emptied in order to cleanse it
thoroughly himself before it fell into any
one elses hands however there was noth-

ing for it but to go now and return as soon
as possible but he was determined not to
go before putting the spur to bartlett ad-
vancing quite near he leaned down to
arouse the dreamer and said in a voice
grimly significant

  good night mr bartlett

  then he turned and vanished swiftly
through the palms leaving bartlett staring
after him bartlett was vaguely aware that
there had been something subtly menacing
in the waiters mien but he was at a loss
to account for it and as he pondered the
matter he concluded that he had imagined
the menace-that he had been aroused so
suddenly from his musings that he had not
seen nor heard clearly

   he lifted the brandy glass to his lips with
a little sigh of satisfaction but he did not
drink for before his lips had touched the
glass he was interrupted suddenly a girl
broke through the screen of palms that shut
off that niche from the rest of the supper
rooms and leaning heavily upon his table
for support stood white and panting it
w as katherine

  she had been dancing with nettleton
again and his love making which had been
growing more insistent as time passed had
suddenly become unendurable everything
had suddenly become unendurable and she
had broken away from him to seek covert
like some helpless little animal who is be-
ing hunted and pressed too close

   for an instant she stood there silent
white trembling breathing hard her eyes
gazed out darkly appealingly then
gradually she recovered control and mur-
mured 

    im so sorry to burst in upon you like
this but i didnt know any one was here
i was running away

    thats quite all right said bartlett
with a tremendous effort he rose and
bowed gallantly  wont you sit down
until you feel better

  she looked at him-this pale burned-out
looking old man in his courtly attire of
other days-and graciously nodded there
was something quite pathetic about him
she thought

   thank you you are very kind she
said sinking into the chair opposite him


argosy-allstory weekly

   he resumed his seat then with a little
sigh

   to bartlett this was the beginning of an-
other charming adventure his life had
been rather full of charming adventures-
and some that were not quite so charming
-but one forgets unpleasant things easily
he felt that luck was still with him-that
this lovely young thing should have come
at just this time-to cheer the weary time
of waiting before he could be free to go
he saw in her coming an omen-a fortu-
nate omen and being superstitious - as
all gamblers are-he felt suddenly very gay

    you are more than welcome he said
 please stay as long as you like it is as
quiet here as anywhere in this-this bed-
lam and if you feel inclined to talk i
feel more than inclined to listen i am
alone you see and a little lonely

  she thought him quite charming as
many women before her had so simple and
quaint and old-fashioned-like a ghost out
of some dead long ago and that in tang-
ling something about him that suggested
mystery - tragedy - that appealed to her
strongly

    still she said slowly  it must be
very interesting to sit here and look on at
all this with the perspective your years
give you you have seen so many changes
come in the world and you can make com-
parisons

   yes he admitted nodding  things
are different than they used to be-on the
surface at any rate i mean the manifesta-
tions are different but underneath of
course nothing ever changes the same
things are fundamentally true to-day that
were true yesterday-and a thousand years
ago these dances one danced different-
ly years ago but the same impulse made
one dance-thesame spirit was in it our
music was different too but it appealed to
our more sentimental generation as your
jazz music appeals to you and these very
modem people-why they are all loving
and hating and fighting and competing and
sacrificing themselves and each other-and
dreaming and dying and living as we did
in our day-as columbus did in his day-
as adam did in his day

   how weary god must be said kath-

erine  looking on at it all-over and over
and over-always the same

   i dont know said bartlett  it
must be wonderfully interesting to see it
work out like a game of chess in which
the figures move themselves there are
only certain moves they can make in every
situation but the situations they get into
are quite their own affairs you and i for
instance we did not deliberately plan this
meeting and yet whatever we have done
up to this moment has made this meeting
happen why

   i dont know said katherine  do
you think it is for some purpose

   i think everything happens for some
purpose said bartlett  though we often
cannot fathom what the purpose is

   she was silent thoughtful and bartletts
fingers toyed idly with the brandy glass

    its a little frightening she said at
last  to think that every lightest thing one
does has some bearing on all the future
things that are to happen i dont know
that i like your theory exactly

   perhaps not one never likes respon-
sibility smiled bartlett  but that would
be the only logical way wouldnt it

   i dare say she agreed and she
sighed  how seriously we are talking-
and how strange to be doing it in a place
like this  she cried and added swiftly im-
pulsively  and what a relief it is

  he nodded

    if you will pardon my saying it it must
be-to you he said  you are not really
the sort of girl who would care for this i
think

   but i always have cared for it-until
to-night  she replied  to-night some-
how it seems different its as if i were
seeing it for the first time

   but that is quite a common experi-
ence he assured her  we walk along a
certain street every day for years without
particularly observing the buildings until
something calls our attention to one of them
-and suddenly we find ourselves regarding
it as though for the first time something
has evidently called your attention to all
this to-night or you might have gone on
thinking you liked it-for years

   yes die said and then she went on
the dance of death	

slowly considering him interestedly  you
dont belong here either you know you
are as out of place as i am

   i dont belong anywhere much my
dear he answered  at least -  have
never quite found out where i do belong

i have been drifting about for years-try-
ing to figure it out you see so many
kinds of people are mixed up inside me
one part of me belongs one place and one
part belongs somewhere else and these
various elements are always at war among
themselves i am about one-tenth artist
and one-tenth explorer and one-tenth
christian and one-tenth pagan and twro-
tenths sentimentalist and two-tenths
cynic and the rest gambler you can im-
agine what a task it must be to keep all of
those strange boarders living together in
one boarding house

    yes but all of us have the same prob-
lem to solve dont you think so

   perhaps more or less thats what
makes us interesting to one another i sup-
pose if we were all consistent and could
be relied upon to do a certain thing in a
given situation wed bore one another a lot
wouldnt we as it is wrere mostly all
mysteries-even to ourselves

  she nodded

   i am to myself i know i startle my-
self at times-and shock myself-and hor-
rify myself and sometimes im proud of
myself but not as often as id like to be
outside things influence one dont you
think opportunity makes heroes

   yes but according to my theory the
hero has been working tcnvard that oppor-
tunity for years one thing leads to an-
other and the way you acquit yourself in
one situation determines the nature of the
next one cause and effect you see the
murderer does not literally hang himself
but when he takes life he sets in motion the
machinery that in the end inevitably
hangs him

    inevitably she repeated curiously

    perhaps i should have said  inevitably
wrecks him some escape hanging but
 think none escapes punishment he
smiled  that he said  was the sage
in me talking you see but i assure you

that if put to the test the fool in me would
kill his man just the same undeterred by
the sages knowledge

   then said katherine  that is be-
cause the governing part of you has never
been strong enough to control the various
other elements one must be master of
these contrasted parts of one it is good
to be a sentimentalist at times-an artist
at times-a cynic at times-a sage at times
-and at times even a fool but one must
be strong enough to give way or hold back
as one wills one must not let any side of
one grow stronger than ones will
il how wise you are he smiled

   i always am smiled katherine
 when i have just completed some folly
he studied her

   odd he said  that we should be sit-
ting here so companionably-like old old
friends - understanding each other and
yet--you so near the beginning of life and
i so near the end of it

  her eyes grew darker her color faded
 who knows about life she said  i
may be nearer the end than you

   not likely he said thinking of the
wound in his side-and the dead man up-
stairs-and the imminence of the police
and then he added with a defiant grin
 not that i mind in the least

  she looked at him wondering if he could
mind as little as he seemed to

  i mind she admitted i am terri-
bly afraid of dying i dont know hew any
one can face it-endure it of course there
is nothing else one can do but go through
with it when ones time comes but not to
know what is going to happen to go out
alone into nothingness it frightens me
she leaned there upon the table opposite
him white shaken with her hands
clenched fighting for breath it had been
a hard night bartlett saw that she was on
the verge of collapse and leaning forward
he laid one band upon hers and lifted the
glass of brandy in the other he held it
out toward her feeling that her need for it
was greater far than his

  here drink this he murmured
gently

  and submissively katherine drank it

it was plowing time along the west shore
of the hudson-time of earth turned
up again in fields beyond that stretch
of tracks where the expresses go very fast
and the accommodations very slow carry-
ing their country passengers from little town
to little near-by town almost from farm to
farm the country seasons through there
was no express stop near if a farmer-or
a farmers wife-should ever want sudden-
ly to make a swift escape from well-known
things he couldnt his train would still go
halting halting as if from habit at the lit-
tle stations where he had always gotten off
before only a mile at a time a mile at a
time would that home railroad let him go
spun out for a little way and then another
little way like a spiders web and just as
easy to be broken would his journey be

  the car was warmer than it needed to be
for the half-cool half-warm early april
day which lay sunning brown and blue
and faintly green outside those passen-
gers who had been coming for two hours
or so through the still living placidity of
that countryside at noon were growing



drowsy hypnotized with the silence of the
car the warmth of april sun made hotter
by the window glass

  the pullings-in to stations the leisurely
pullings-out the gentle stirrings of the one
or two who got off or got on the lazy in-
terchange of conductor and station masters
grew rhythmic now it was early after-
noon-that warm and quiet time this
ride might last forever-it was the type and
symbol of all country trains running in
drowsiness through the quiet land-the
land of utter peace where the earth was be-
ing turned again as had been done so
many many springs in fields

  the eternity of the land the unceasing
quiet movement of its life were here

  there were several middle-aged women
comfortable placid neighborly farmers
wives of many years standing among those
who came and went they had won
through to this place where even in plow-
ing time their children grown and the
noonday dinner over they could take an
afternoon now and then for generous visit-
ing scant shopping one of them had a
plowing time



small basket covered with a napkin-jelly
or soup or buttermilk for some one sick
there was something of rich content about
these women worn and shapeless though
they were as if they had taken to them-
selves that unimaginative motherness and
kindness which is the earths now that her
travail and her wistfulness are done there
were sitting heavily together drummers
with their great square nonconformist
satchels up in the front were two country
lawyers from whom floated now and then
a legal term they were idly sleepily in-
termittently speaking of a recent case
there were like a clump of late or early
flowers in a garden brown and lonely but
for them a white-skinned red-haired ma-
ture country girl with two little children
in her arms and beside her another girl
smaller and less beautiful than she but
better dressed all huddled in one seat
and there were the few who had come
through for obscure and unimaginable rea-
sons on a local train

  to catch so slow a train it did not seem
that any one would have to hurry but sud-
denly noisily wildly one did come hurry-
ing suddenly from the newness of the
spring and the oldness of its coming and
into the drowsy timelessness and whispering
stillness of that car the immediate present
active angry uncontemplative made swift
invasion and every person in the car
looked up blinking as from a daze-every
person except the girl with red hair and the
girl with her for them since they had
gotten on a few stations back unnoticed
particularly byr any one there had been no
daze no drowsiness no sense of time as be-
ing any other day than this and for the
swift and furious invasion no matter how
much they had tried to think the opposite
they were not altogether unprepared
straight silent unwinking defiant holding
the children tight the red-haired girl await-
ed the attack and watched the man lunge
down the aisle to her

    the flying automobile a more or less
  dilapidated flivver which reached that lit-
  tle station just as the train was pulling out
  was the first fast-moving thing the windows
  of the train had shown it swerved and
  slowed and the man hurled himself out and

at the train pulling himself up easily onto
the front platform of the car he was
young and middle-sized and not over come-
ly except for his strength and his intent
unconscious breathlessness he was in over-
alls and the blue shirt turned in on his
brown chest made him match the april sky
and fields in color he was so hot that his
hatless roughened hair was damp about his
temples

  xo one had known before how hot a day
it was but he was also terrible as angry
people are and the whole car went out flow-
ingly in sympathy to the girl odd they
had not noticed her before-so strikingly
different and brave and beautiful she looked
now to their sudden concentrated gaze her
face white as a summer clod above the old
dark winter coat and beneath the warped
black strawr sailor hat which was pinned
onto the flaming curling hair just anyhow
in her left arm she had the smallest child-
a baby-and her right was about the little
boy three years old or so the other girl
her backer in the fight her eyes round with
horror and fright sat protectively between
her and the aisle

  he shook his fist as he came thundering
down the aisle

   get off this train he shouted  get
off this train right now where do you
think youre going-stealing my money and
my children

   theyrre my children-and i aint go-
in to get off this train im through said
the red-haired girl stony defiant tight-
lipped

  and suddenly the smoldering flame was
out of the hold and up through the hatches
for all the world to see howr would it
end what could be saved suddenly
the things which had been secret and un-
said were shouted loudlyr in a railroad
train on a peaceful sultry april afternoon
how strange that these two should have
chosen this setting for their scene should
have come so far and picked the slumber-
ing torpid slow-moving train to be their
brief surprising battlefield drama mov-
ing through the countryside on the after-
noon  down-train

  the audience came in more closely
  standing in the aisle leaning forward in


argosy-allstqry weekly

their seats the conductor and the train-
man came down the car from opposite ends
curious tolerant only mildly worried
they had been on that train so many
many years the shouting and confusion
grew unintelligible the angry excited shout-
ing of the man the stony defiant sulky
answers of the girl the occasional shrill
protests and comments of the other girl
who seemed now to be really rather in the
way the murmurings of the other passen-
gers the important interruptions of one
of the lawyers who kept assuring her that
her husband would not be allowed to take
the children away from her the gruff
kindly directions of the old conductor

   the girl sat large immovable a lovely
miserable stone a red-haired white-skinned
sphinx what chance had the angry shout-
ing damp-haired boy against her and
yet in him there was some strain of power
some strong thing-affection cruelty te-
nacity instinct heredity environment who
knows what-that would go on that would
not stop what chance had the defiant
lovely sulky woman so hurt and proud
and fierce with her children clinging to her
neck and arms and skirt against him
what chance had either of them against
the children who had been crying from the
first in loud and pitifully frightened whim-
pers

    stop the train  shouted the man to the
conductor  stop the train she took two
hundred and fifty dollars of my money

    well you never gave me any to spend
she answered

  it was to him only that she spoke-she
would have endured torture rather than
tell her story to any of these people of
whose presence she was so bitterly con-
scious that he could say this thing to a
conductor and yet it was for him as if
the conductor was not there

  suddenly he leaned over and took the
baby from her arms holding the wailing
little creature so that its clothes were all
up around it in a bunch it clutched wildly
at its mothers warped black sailor hat as it
went and with her arms both out to try to
get the baby back she did not straighten
it that poor black hat warped and
crooked and old

  if she had had a new hat lately would
she have been so wildly resentful so stub-
bornly cold  would she have hated him so

  he started running down the aisle hold-
ing the baby and the two women started
after him the little boy clinging to his
mothers hand on the platform it began
all over again the conductor and trainman
keeping them from falling off and repeating
chat the train could not be stopped until a
station came the lawyer kept reassuring
the girl who seemed however very little
interested in what he said

  then all of a sudden the worst was over
in some mysterious way they were back in
the car the other girl next to the window
this time and the boy half-sitting on the
arm of his wifes seat leaning over her
his anger was gone but the terrible earn-
estness and intentness and unconsciousness
of his surroundings had endured with a
strange almost awe-inspiring persistency
the red-haired girl still sat rigid but there
was some change intangible and slight in
her she was still defiant and sulky but
she was no longer a sphinx she was a wom-
an now-a girl-and pretty well worn out
there was a strange pitiable tiredness about
the man too as if the struggle had been
going on for hours instead of crowded min-
utes he was talking more softly now and
the audience had somewhat withdrawn
suddenly his voice rang out clearly in de-
termination and appeal  katherine i will
not leave these children

  and she did not answer but held them to
her looking up at him it had come to
that then-to the realization that unless
she went back one of them must  leave
these children and how could that be

  he repeated it in an unconsciousness of
every one except his wife so deep so hon-
est that even the hovering lawyer drew
away women who had drawn together to
watch could not meet each others eyes and
the old conductor muttering something to
himself walked off toward the door there
was a cadence and a beauty to the words
so that they sounded like a vow so that the
cadenced rhythmic almost terrifying
phrase sounded as familiar as if this were
a scriptural repetition - something which
men had always said at certain times
plowing time



  the children had grown quieter quick
as only little children are to tell a change
of mood then as if a spell were broken
as if the anger and the stress and the high
intensity had suddenly fallen away from
him he said quite naturally and with a
start of recollection and surprise

   katherine you must come now- left
my horses in the field

  the whole car heard and there was a
little rustle of relief and yet of consterna-
tion he had left his horses in the field
and their minds went back remembering
and piecing out the tale the machine he
had jumped out of after his chase how
about that somebody elses probably
and how had he found that she had gone
had he gone in to dinner which was not
there had some one run to him how
had it been no one aboard this train
would ever know except those two he
had left his horses in the field a look of
utter weariness of indifference of some-
thing almost like relief came over kather-
ines face what chance had they against
the house the land the horses they had
left against the earth itself - they who
were servants of the seasons bound to the
slow wheel of the year

  the train was slowing up-was it only
between two stations quite close together
that they had come and they were get-
ting out the father holding the baby with
its best clothes still rumpled up and
bunched katherine went reluctantly and
yet without a protest ignominiously the
friend trailed after them the swift es-
cape the brilliant coup in which she was
to play so large protective and belligerent
a part had failed and katherine seemed
almost to have forgotten that she was there

  the passengers quiet now watched the

little procession drag itself across the cin-
ders in iront of the station-they watched
katherine particularly-beautiful kather-
ine with the red hair and the warpv hat
how would it have been for her if she had
gone on would she ever again try to get
away had she really hoped a little that
he would come would he understand
better now how it had been for her would
she have a new hat soon

  the slow train moved on the passen-
gers settled back and the drow se sank grad-
ually again upon them only the lawyer
must make comment to his companion he
made it cheerily as if this were a little
thing an ordinary thing a rather amusing
thing-one to be treated indulgently and
as if he himself were a connoisseur in the
art of delicate adjustments if it had been
he himself who had brought things to this
happy settlement he could not have been
more complacent and very likely he
thought it was

    theyll be all right he said a little
loudly through the settling hush  just
some little spat started em off i suppose 

  the others were very still the woman
with the napkin-covered basket was staring
thoughtfully out of the window something
between a decorous horror and a startled
understanding-was it something resem-
bling recollection on her face could there
have been for her as well in some distant
other spring an april afternoon

   it had been only a little while-ten or
fifteen minutes at the most it was still
early afternoon that the slow down-train
was passing through outside were still
brown fields blue sky and faintest april
green over the land-the old old land to
which no changes but the recurrent and un-
changing seasons ever come

the water city

the men around the table were now
all on their feet one of them picked
up a huge metal goblet and flung it
at mercers head the last remaining bit
of reason mercer had left fled from him
without thought of what he was about
he raised the metal cylinder his thumb
found the little button and pressed it hard
he waved the cylinder back and forth before
him

  it was over in an instant mercer relaxed
his pressure on the button and staggered
back he was sick and faint from what
he had seen-with the realization of what
he had done flames were rising all about
him the room was full of smoke he
held his breath finding his way back some-

how to the stairway with the agonized
screams of the men ringing in his ears he
caught a glimpse of aninas white face as
she stood there where he had left her

   good god anina go back go
back im coming

   he tripped near the top of the stairs and
fell in a heap onto the platform below
but he still held the cylinder clutched tight-
ly in his hand

  anina groped her way down to him he
gripped her by the arm he was trembling
like a leaf the crackling of the burning
house above came down to him the cries
of the men were stilled

   come anina he half whispered
 hurry-lets get away anywhere home
-out of this cursed city

  lua was still in the boat her calm
steady glance brought mercer back to his

the fire people



senses they shoved the boat out from
under the house and in a moment more
were heading back through the city the
building they had left was now a mass of
flames with a great cloud of smoke rolling
up from it a woman stood on the front
platform an instant and then screaming
flung herself into the water

   the city was in commotion faces ap-
peared at windows girls flew up and gath-
ered in a frightened flock circling about the
burning building boats miraculously ap-
peared from everywhere lua was steering
their boat on its tortuous way between the
houses she put the boat nearly to full
speed and as they swept past a house
nearly collided with a punt that was cross-
ing behind it

   mercers nerves were still shaken he
handed anina the light-ray cylinder

    here-take it anina i dont want
the cursed thing shoot it up into the air
somebody might try and stop us thatll
scare them careful you dont hit any-
thing 

   anina played the light about in the air
for a time but soon there were so many
girls flying about she had to shut it off a
few minutes more and they had passed the
last of the houses swept around the bend in
the river and left the frightened city out of
sight behind them

   they had left the river and following
close along shore headed for the bayous
that led up to the great city the storm
bad now entirely passed leaving the day-
light unusually bright and a fresh coolness
in the air the sea was still rough al-
though not alarmingly so and the boat
made comparatively slow progress it was
two hours or more-to mercer it seemed a
whole day-before they were nearing the
bayous anina was sitting by his side in
the center of the boat lua was steering

   you hungry ollie the girl asked
smiling

   mercer shook his head he had forgot-
ten they had intended to eat in the water
city

    i very hungry soon ave-

   she stopped abruptly staring up into the
sky ahead of them

   mercer followed her glance a little

black blob showed against the gray off to
one side two other smaller black dots ap-
peared

  whats that cried mercer alarmed

  they watched a few moments in silence
then mercer took the cylinder and flashed
its light into the air

   if its anybody connected with tao
that ii show theyd better keep away he
explained grimly

  anina smiled  tao people cannot flv
ollie

  a few moments more and they saw what
it was and within ten minutes they had
landed at the mouth of one of the bayous
and miela and i were with them

chapter xxv

preparations for war

the months that followed were the
busiest i think of my life i began
by a complete reorganization of
this government of which i found my-
self the head for the doddering old coun-
cilors of the late king i substituted men
whom i selected from among those of the
citys prominent business men who cared to
serve

  the personnel of the police force i al-
lowed to remain for i soon saw they were
inclined to act very differently under me
than under my predecessor the various
other officials of this somewhat vague or-
ganization i subjected to a thorough weed-
ing out

   the net result was chaos for a time but
far more quickly than i had anticipated i
had things running again i made no radi-
cal changes except in personnel i at-
tempted to do nothing that was outside the
then existing laws and no new laws were
passed but from the very first i made
it clear that i was not one to be trifled
with

  within a few days after i was put into
power i interviewed fuero and his scien-
tific confreres i found them a body of
grave men who represented the highest type
of the nation they made it plain to me at
once that they would not concern them-
selves in any way with government affairs


argosy-allstory weekly

two years before they had recognized taos
menace and had been preparing for it by
the manufacture of large quantities of war
material which in case of extreme necessity
they would turn over to the government
this armament as miela had told me they
guarded themselves not trusting it even to
their workmen

  the scientific men i understood now
were among the richest in the nation owing
to the widespread use of their industrial
appliances it was only a portion of this
wealth that they were expending in the
manufacture of armament

  i demanded the release to me of this war
material i explained them my plans and
told them in detail of taos visit to earth
they held several conferences over a period
of two or three days but in the end i got
what i asked for

  so much for affairs in the great city i
recognized during these days the possibility
of an armed invasion from the twilight
country i was better prepared to meet it
now should it come and i at once took
steps to be warned as far in advance as
possible to this end i had girls patrolling
the narrow sea not only on our shore but
over in the twilight country as well and
 was satisfied that if tao made any move
we would be notified at once simulta-
neously with all this we devoted ourselves
to the unification of the nation for in very
truth it seemed about to disintegrate here
it was that the girls were of the greatest
assistance

  we organized them into an army which
consisted of fifty squads of ten girls each
with a leader for each squad all of these
girls were armed with the light-ray cylin-
ders with this  flying army  mercer and
 made a tour of the light country cities
we wasted no time with formalities but
rounded up taos men wherever we could
find them and transported them uncere-
moniously back to the twilight country
shore

  in two or three of the cities-the water
city particularly-there was a show of re-
bellion among the people but our light-rays
cowed them instantly and in no instance
did we have to kill or injure any one
through miela i made speeches every-

where it was not my wish to hold the
country in sullen subjection and to that
end i appealed to their patriotism in this
coming war against tao and the twilight
people this aspect of the matter met
with ready response and everywhere our
meetings ended in enthusiastic acclaim

  we started now to raise an army of
young men which we proposed to transport
across the narrow sea for land operations
in the twilight country before a week
had passed i saw by the response that
came from my various proclamations that
conscription would be unnecessary with
this tangible evidence of the coming war
the patriotism of the people grew by leaps
and bounds the fact that the girls of the
great city were not only in favor of it
but were actually already in sendee-a
thing unprecedented in the history of the
nation-brought the sympathies of all the
women with us strongly

  through the governors of each city i
raised a separate army of young men offi-
cered by the older men most of whom had
taken pari in past fighting each of these
little armies as yet without arms was
drilled and held in readiness for orders from
the great city

  i had during all this time selected as
man able men as possible from among
the great citys population and given them
over to fuero and his associates for train-
ing in the use of the light-ray rockets
the larger projectors protective measures
against the ray and many other appliances
which i understood only vaguely myself

  it was after our return from the tour of
the different cities and before the recruiting
of the young men was fairly under way
when like a bombshell came the news from
our flying patrol that a fleet of armed boats
was coming down the river from the lone
city the attack from tao was at hand
and our preparations were still far from
complete we had our army of girls in
active operation and that was all taos
boats would reach the light country shore
in a few hours there was no time for
anything but the hastiest of preparations
we decided then to call the army of girls
and meet the boats in the narrow sea
turning them back if possible
the fire people



   i have now to explain the method of de-
 fense against the light-ray in theory i
 only vaguely understood it in practice it
 was simple and like most defenses only
 partially effective

   bob trevor has already mentioned it-
 the suits of black cloth he saw in the mer-
 cutian camp in wyoming it was not as
 he had afterward supposed a dye for fab-
 rics instead it was the thread of a worm
 -like our silk worm-which in its natural
 state was black and was impervious to the
 ray by that i mean a substance whose
 molecules increased their vibration rate
 only slightly from a brief contact with the
 ray

   it was only partly efficacious for after an
 exposure of a minute or more the intense
 heat of the ray was communicated it
 then became partly penetrable and any-
 thing close behind it would be destroyed

   we had under manufacture at this time a
 number of protective devices by w-hich this
 substance might be used boats had in
 the past been equipped with a sort of
 shield or hood in front making them more
 or less impervious to a direct horizontal
 beam of the light	v

   tats boats which now threatened us
 were so protected i was informed by the
 girls who reported them recognizing the
 probability of an attack by us from the air
 they also had a covering of the cloth like a
 canopy above them but as may be read-
 ily understood such protection could be
 made only partly effective

   i had already manufactured at mielas
 suggestion a number of shields for our girls
 to carry while in flight these consisted of
 the fabric in very light almost diaphanous
 form hung upon a flexible frame of very
 thin strips of bamboo it was some twelve
 feet broad across the top narrowing rapidly
 into a long fluttering tail like a kite

   there was nothing rigid about this
 shield its two or three bamboo ribs were
 as flexible as a whip with the veiling-it
 was hardly more than that-fluttering be-
 low them almost entirely unsupported in
 weight the whole approximated one-twelfth
 that of a girl not at all a difficult amount to
 carry

   within two hours after the report came-

 it was near midday-we were ready to start
 from the great city to repel taos attack
 our forces consisted of some six hundred
 girls each armed with a light-ray cylinder
 and a shield this was the organization i
 have already mentioned fifty squads of ten
 each with a leader and fifty other girls the
 most daring and expert in the air who were
 to act independently

  we had two platforms protected by the
fabric and with a sort of canopy around
the sides underneath over which the girls
grasping the handles could fly mercer and
anina rode on one platform and miela
and i on the other all of us were dressed
in the black garments

  on each of the platforms we had mount-
ed a projector of higher power than the
hand cylinders although of course of much
less effective range than those the mercu-
tians had used in wyoming

  thus equipped we rose into the air from
the castle grounds in the great city with
a silent awed multitude watching us-as
strange an army- probably as ever went
forth to battle

chapter xxvi

the battle

we swept out over the great city
flying in the battle formation we
had used many times before on our
trips about the country mercers platform
and mine were some fifty feet apart lead-
ing behind us in a great semicircle the
girls spread out fifty little groups of ten
each with its single leader in front below
a hundred feet perhaps the fifty other girls
darted back and forth keeping pace with
us the aspect of these girls flying thus
to battle was truly extraordinary the
pink-white flesh of their bodies their limbs
incased in the black veiling their long
black or golden hair and the vivid red or
blue feathered wings flashing behind those
wide fluttering flimsy black shields-it
was a sight the like of which i never shall
see again

  there was almost no wind for which i
was thankful as it made our maneuvers
in the air considerably less difficult when


argosy-allstory weekly

we reached the narrow sea our patrols re-
ported that tao s ships were stiu in the
river waiting for others from the lone
city to join them we hastened on for
 wished to meet them as near the twilight
shore as possible

  we believed from the reports our girls
had brought us that the enemy would have
some twenty or thirty boats most of them
similar to that in which mercer and anina
weathered the storm on the way to the
water city

  we assumed that the men in the boats
would be armed with the hand light-ray
cylinders these projected a beam not over
four inches broad and had an effective range
of about five hundred feet the boats prob-
ably would carry large projectors also
they might be set up in the boats ready for
use or they might not

  what range they would have we could
not estimate though we hoped we should
encounter nothing more powerful than this
one miela and i had on the platform its
beam was about twenty inches wide its ef-
fective radius something like a thousand
feet

  we did not expect to encounter the very
large projectors we had some in the great
city with a range of something like ten
miles and others of lesser range that spread
the ray out fan shape but these were ex-
tremely heavy and we were confident it
would not be practical to mount them in
the boats

  we sighted the enemy in the narrow sea
just before the twilight shore was reached
the first intimation we had was the sight
of one of the narrow beams of red-green
light flashing about in the twilight as we
crept closer at an altitude of some two
thousand feet we saw the dim outlines of
the boats in the water below

  there were i made out some ten or fif-
teen in sight they were heading out into
the sea in single file miela and i had
carefully discussed the tactics we were to
employ mercer understood our plans and
we had three or four girls detailed to fly
close to the platforms and carry our orders
about to the leaders of the various little
squads

  we sighted the boats when we were about

a miie away and as i have said at an alti-
tude of some two thousand feet they must
have seen us soon afterward for many light-
ravs now began flashing up from them

  so far as i could determine each boat
seemed armed only with one mounted pro-
jector these i believed to be of somewhat
similar power to our own our first move
was to poise directly over the enemy rising
to an altitude of twenty-five hundred feet
the boats kept straight on their way and
we followed them circling overhead in
lengthening spirals but keeping well out of
range

  i had ordered that none of the rays be
flashed at this time and it must have been
difficult for the men in the boats below to
see us in the dusk shrouded as we were in
black they sent up a rocket once it
mounted above us in a slow flaming arc
hung poised an instant and then descended
plunging into the sea a mile or so away
we heard distinctly the hiss of its contact
with the water and saw like a quickly
dissipating mist the cloud of steam that
arose

  we were not armed with these rockets
for to discharge them from the platforms
would have been impractical but tfe did
not fear them being used against us even
if true aim had been possible we could
easily avoid their slow flight

  the protecting canopy below the sides
of our platform made it difficult to see what
was going on below us miela and i lay
prone with our heads projecting over its
forward end in this position we had an
unobstructed though somewhat limited
view the girls earning us could see
nothing they were guided by watching
the other girls flying near them and by
mielas constant directions

  for some ten or fifteen minutes we cir-
cled about over the leading boat the
twilight shore was now almost over the
horizon the boats showed as little black
patches on the gray-black of the sea but
the lights flashing up from them were plain-
ly visible

  the boat that led the line was quite
perceptibly drawing away from the others
already it was a thousand feet or more
ahead of the nearest one following we

                           	a
the fire people



waited through another period this lead-
ing boat was now beyond range of the
others and being isolated i decided to
attack it

    miela i said  tell them all to main-
 tain this level you and i will go down
 at that first boat have them all remain
 up here tell mercer if anything goes
 wrong with us to act as he thinks best

  we waited while these commands were
circulated about mercers platform swept
close over us and he shouted  we vcont
stay up here

  i persuaded him finally and then we
directed our girls to circle slowly down-
ward with our platform i ordered a slow
descent for i was in -no mind to rush
blindly into range of their ray

  we drooped down in a spiral until at
about fifteen hundred feet i ordered the
girls to descend no farther so far as i
could make out now this boat was pro-
tected from above by a broad overhanging
canopy its sides evidently were open or
nearly so for we could see now the smaller
rays flashing out horizontally

  the large projector was mounted in the
bow beyond the canopy its beam obvious-
ly could be directed into the air for it was
now swinging up toward us but in the
horizontal position its range was limited to
an arc in front of the boat i saw then
that our play was to attack from a low
level since only in that way could we ex-
pect to reach a vulnerable spot in the boats
armor and i believed that if we could
keep behind it they could not reach us with
their larger projector

  we swooped downward almost to the
water level and reached it a thousand feet
perhaps off to one side of the boat and part-
ly behind it the smaller projectors flashed
out at us but we were beyond their range
the projector in the bow swung back and
forth and as we skimmed the surface of
the water heading toward the boat it
turned to face us

   what followed happened so quickly i had
no time to consult with miela she directed
our flight i turned the current into our
projector and tried to bring its beam to
bear on the boat we approached within
some eight hundred feet of it darting back

     	a

and forth sometimes rising a hundred feet
or more sometimes skimming the surface
but always keeping behind the boat as it
turned in an endeavor to face us

  my light-ray beam hit the water fre-
quently with a great boiling and hissing
sending up clouds of steam that for a
moment obscured the scene once or twice
our opponents beam flashed over us but
we were beyond its arc before they could
bring it directly to bear

  i grew confused at the rapid turns we
made the dark outlines of the boat with
its twenty or thirty flashing red and green
lights seemed everwhere at once i swung
my projector about as best i could but the
swiftly shifting target seemed too elusive
once as we dropped suddenly downward i
thought we should plunge into the hissing
roaring water below again the opposing
ray swung directly under us as we darted
upward to avoid it

   i cant make it miela i said
 hold steady toward them if you can

  she did not answer but kept her face
over the platforms end and issued her swift
directions to the girls once as we tilted
sharply upward i caught a glimpse of a
black shape sweeping past overhead it
was mercers platform flying unswervingly
toward the boat its red-green beam steady
before it like a locomotive headlight we
turned to follow my own light swung dan-
gerously near mercer and i turned the
current off hastily

  the wind of our forward flight whistled
past my ears mielas directions to the girls
rose shrill above it i caught a glimpse
of the darting lights of the boat ahead
then when we were hardly more than six
hundred feet away mercers light picked
it up i saw the little lurid red circle it
made as it struck the boats canopy top
and roved along it end to end mercers
platform darted lower and from that angle
his light swept under the canopy a mans
scream of agony came to us across the
wrater the lights on the boat were ex-
tinguished only the yellow glare of the
flames rising from its interior fittings re-
mained

  then a moment later the boats stern
rose into the air and it slid hissing into the


argosy-allstory weekly

water leaving only a little wreckage and
a few struggling forms on the swirling sur-
face

  we swung sharply upward again mer-
cers platform-its light now extinguished-
swept directly over us his exultant voice
floated down

   we did it alan we did itl come
on up

  we rose to the upper air where the girls
were still circling about the other boats
were keeping on their course spreading far-
ther apart now to be out of range of each
others projectors i had hoped they would
turn back with this catastrophe to their
leader but they did not

  i consulted hastily with miela and then
we gave the order for a general attack
allowing each of the leading girls to act as
she saw fit

  like a great flock of birds we swooped
downward upon our prey spreading out to
attack all the boats at once the girls now
turned on their hand lights-a myriad tiny
beams darting about in the semidarkness

  i cannot attempt to describe the scene
that followed it can be imagined perhaps
but not told in words as we swept within
range of the lights that swung up from
below to meet us i saw a girl flying alone
pass directly through one of the red beams
it seemed to strike her sidewise in an in-
stant she had passed beyond it i saw the
dim outlines of her form as she fluttered
onward wavering and aimless like a wound-
ed bird and then she fell turning over
and over as with one wing she strove vainly
to support herself until at last wrapped in
the sable shroud of her shield she plunged
with a great splash into the sea

  the flashing light-rays all about us now
seemed mingled in inextricable confusion
the girls must have passed through them
frequently protected by their shields and
i know our platform was several times
struck by them from below the absence
of sound was uncanny only the whistling
wind of our flight the flapping of the girls
wings and the hissing of steam as our rays
struck the water accompanied this inferno
of light

  we swept beyond the boat we had sin-
gled out passing five or six hundred feet

above it and in the effort to avoid its ray
turning so that i was unable to bring mine
upon it as we rose again beyond it i
saw a boat off to the left in flames a
dozen girls had rushed upon it darting in
among its smaller rays to where their own
would be effective but there was only one
girl above it now struggling brokenly to
maintain herself in flight the boat sank
with the roar of an explosion of some kind
but in the sudden darkness about i could
still see this lone wounded girl fluttering
onward

  we were not far away i pointed her
out to miela and instead of swinging back
we kept on toward her we contrived to
pass close under her and she fell abruptly
almost into my arms i stretched her out
gently on the platform and turned back to
miela who was kneeling behind our pro-
jector

  we were now nearly half a mile from
the nearest of the boats several of them
evidently had been sunk and two or three
others were sinking one i could make out
heading back for the twilight shore above
it the lights of our girls following showed
vivid against the dark-gray sky where
mercers platform was i could not tell

  miela gripped my shoulder

   see alan-there she pointed off to
one side  one of the boats tries to es-
cape

  we were now some five hundred feet
above the water half a mile beyond us
all its lights out one of the boats was
scurrying away on across toward the light
country for some reason none of our girls
seemed following it

  miela issued a sharp command we
swooped downward at lightning speed and
barely skimming the surface flew after this
escaping enemy whether its larger pro-
jector had been rendered inoperative or
many of its crew killed or whether it
thought merely to escape us and make a
landing in the light country i did not
know

  whatever the reason no lights showed
from this boat as we drew after it i had
our own light out when we came close
within range i flashed it on suddenly we
were flying steadily and i picked up the
the fire people



boat without difficulty raking it through
from stern to stem under its protecting
canopy i could see the canopy drop as its
supporting metal framework fused in the
heat of the ray flames rose from the in-
terior wooden fittings the boats stern
seemed to melt away as the thin metal
was rendered molten the water about it
boiled under the heat a cloud of steam
then rose up obscuring it completely from
my sight

   i switched off the light we continued
on rising a little the steam dissipated
directly below us on the bubbling swirl-
ing water a few twisted black forms bobbed
about we were so close now i could see
them plainly i looked away hastily

  we swung back toward the twilight
shore rising sharply there seemed now
only one boat afloat far above it i saw
a tiny black oblong that i knew was mer-
cers platform a swarm of other dots
with the tiny pencils of red light flashing
from them showed where the cloud of girls
were swooping down to the attack now
that we were out of the action i had op-
portunity to watch what was going on more
closely

   this last engagement seemed to last less
than a minute the girls darted fearlessly
downward among the rays that swung up
from the boat scores of them were hit

i could see their forms illuminated for an
instant by the lurid red and green light
some passed through it safely many fell
but those who got within range hit the
boat without difficulty its lights went out
suddenly and a moment later it sank the
girls lights flashed off and they rose again
into the air-tiny black shapes circling
about mercers platform

  the scene now seemed suddenly very
dark peaceful and still a great weight
lifted from my heart though it still re-
mained heavy with what i had seen i
turned to miela her face was white and
drawn

    we have won my girl i said

   she smiled wanly

   we have won but oh alan that
women should have to do such deeds
her eyes shone with the light of a soul
in sorrow

   pray to your god now my husband
that this war may be the last for all time
in all the universe

chapter xxvii

the siege of the lone city

our losses totaled nearly a hundred
and fifty girls we brought back
with us on the platforms but six
wounded i shall never forget that hour
we spent searching among the wreckage-
those blackened twisted forms of what had
once been men and women i shall not de-
scribe it

  of all the boats avhich tao had dis-
patched on this ill-fated expedition only
one escaped to return with news of the dis-
aster i was glad now that one at least
had survived for the report it would give
would i felt sure dissuade tao from mak-
ing any other similar attempt at invasion

  our broken little army made its way
slowly back to the great city we went
not in triumph but indeed with all the
aspect of defeat the people received us in
a frenzy of joy and gratitude to the girls for
what they had done

  this first battle took place as i have
said just after we four had returned from
our tour of the light country and before
the recruiting of the young men was fairly
under way to this recruiting it proved an
extraordinary stimulus the girls having
been in successful action stirred the young
men of the nation as probably nothing else
could and all over the country they came
forward faster than they could be enrolled

  it was two or three days after the battle
that miela came to me one morning with
the wounded girl she and i had rescued in
the air

   we have a plan-sela and i-my hus-
band she said

  the girl seemed hardly more than a sweet
little child-fifteen or sixteen perhaps it
gave me a shock now to realize that we
had allowed her to go into such a combat
one of her blue-feathered wings was bound
in a cloth its lower portion i could tell
had been burned away

   never will she fly again my husband


argosy-allstory weekly

said miela  for she is one of those who
has sacrificed her wings that we might all
be safe from the invader

  she then went on to explain that now
while this feeling of gratitude to the girls
ran so high among the people the time
seemed propitious for changing the long-
hated law regarding their wings i had
not thought of that but agreed with her
wholly

   i called the people into the castle gardens
that same night never had  seen such a
gathering we allowed fully ten thousand

	come in the rest we were forced to send
away

  miela made a speech telilng them that in
recognition of the girls services in this war
i had decided to allow them henceforth to
keep their wings unmutilated after mar-
riage we exhibted this little girl sela
as one who had given her power of flight
not as a sacrifice on the altar of mans
selfishness but in the service of her coun-
try then sela herself made a speech in
her earnest little child voice pleading for
her sisters

  when she ended there may have been
some unmarried men in our audience who
were still against the measure-doubtless
there were-but they were afraid or
ashamed to let their feeling be known
when the meeting broke up i had ample
evidence of the peoples wishes upon which
to proceed

  within a week my congress met and the
law was repealed we informed the other
cities of this action and everywhere it was
met with enthusiasm

  enlistment and war preparations went
steadily on but despite it all there were
more marriages that next month-three
times over-than in any before i had
now been in power some three months and
the time was approaching when we were
ready to make our invasion of the twilight
country we had been maintaining a rigid
aerial patrol of the narrow sea but no
further activities of the enemy had been
threatened

  the expedition when it was ready num-
bered about a thousand young men each
armed with one of the hand light-ray cyl-
inders fifty officers and about fifty older

men in charge of the projectors and rock-
ets who for want of a better term i might
call our artillery corps there was also the
organization of girls and a miscellaneous
corps of men to handle the boats mechan-
ics to set up the projectors and a commis-
sariat

  the thousand young men represented
those we had selected from the several
thousand enlisted in the great city all
the rest and the many thousands in the
other cities we were holding in reserve

  we took with us on this invading expe-
dition only small-wheeled trucks on which
to convey the larger projectors and storage
tanks and other heavy apparatus for the
lone city river ran directly to the point
where we planned to conduct our siege

  some forty large boats were required to
carry the men ammunition and supplies
mercer and i with anina and miela trav-
eled as before through the air on the two
platforms with the girls we crossed the
narrow sea without incident and entered
the river

  several hours up the river narrowed and
entered a rocky gorge four or five hundred
feet wide and a thousand feet deep wits
almost perpendicular sides along one of
these ran the lone city trail we passed
through this gorge the river here flowed
with a current that amounted almost to
rapids our boats made slow progress fi-
nally we emerged into an even wilder coun-
try almost devoid of trees here we made
our first nights encampment

  noon of the next day found us approach-
ing the lone city we did not need to sur-
mise now that tao would be warned lor
far away on the horizon ahead we saw the
beams from his great projectors mounting
up into the blackness of the sky some
four miles from the lone city the river
we were ascending swept on to the right
this was its dosest point to the dty and
here we disembarked there were several
docks and a few houses but we found them
all deserted

  the lone city was particularly well suit-
ed to defense even though the lay of the
country was such that we were enabled
to approach here within four miles and
establish our base in comparative safety
the fire people



the country was wild and rocky with few
trees the river bed lay in a canon from
where we landed a valley so deep and nar-
row it might almost be termed a canon
also led up to the city

  this valley was some two miles wide
with a level floor and precipitous rocky
sides towering in many places over a thou-
sand feet above it stretched a broken
plateau country the valley had many
sharp bends and turns as though in some
distant past it had been the bed of a great
river that had eroded its tortuous course
through the rock

  the lone city lay shut in at the bottom
of this valley between two of its bends

it was a settlement of perhaps ten thousand
people the only city in the twilight coun-
try with one exception on this hemisphere
of mercury

  we established our field base here at the
 river and i devoted the next few days
 to informing myself of the exact lay of
 the country and the methods of defense of
 the city tao had provided

    i found this defense the height of sim-
plicity and for its purpose as effective as
it well could be a vertical barrage of
light surrounded the city extending up-
ward into the air with the most powerful
projectors some ten or fifteen miles and
with those of the spreading rays forming
a solid wall of light at the lower altitudes
there were no projectors past the first turn
in the valley toward the river-where they
could have been directed horizontally-and
none of them on the cliff tops above the
city thus although we could not get over
this light-barrage we could approach it
closely in many places

   taos tactics became immediately evi-
  dent he had thrown an almost impregna-
  ble barrier close about him and trusting
  to its protection was making no effort to
  combat us for the moment with any moves
  of offense

    my first endeavor was to find a position
  on top of the cliffs from which the city
  could be reached with a projector it was
  practically the only thing to do the city
  could not be approached in front from the
  valley floor its entire surface beyond the
  turn was swept by the light-rays ap-

  proach from below in the rear wtas likewise
  barred

  had the barrage been not so high our
girls might have flown over it and dropped
bombs or we might have sent rockets over
it and dropped them into the city neither
of these projects was practical the girls
could not fly over that barrage it was too
cold in the higher altitudes nor could
we send rockets over for rockets sent
through the light were exploded before they
could reach their mark

  the projectors along the sides of the city
were located for the most part a hundred
feet or more back from the base of the
surrounding cliffs this allowed them to
cut the cliff face at the top it will be
understood then that we could approach the
brink of the cliff in many places but never
sufficiently near to be able to direct our rays
downward into the city

  these cliffs wrere exceedingly jagged and
broken they overhung in many places
great rifts splt them ravines wtound their
way down many of these with small stunt-
ed trees growing in them a descent from
the summit to the floor of the valley had
we been unimpeded by the light would in
many places not have been difficult

  during the next week we succeeded--
working in the prevailing gloom-in estab-
lishing a projector at the mouth of a ravine
which emerged at the cliff face hardly a
hundred feet from the valley bottom this
point was below the spreading light-rays
which swept the cliff top above we
mounted the projector without discovery
and flashing it on suddenly swept the val-
ley with its rays an opposing ray from
below picked it out almost immediately
and destroyed it killing two of our men

    the irregularities of the cliffs made sev-
  eral other similar attempts possible we
  took advantage of them and in each case
  were able to rake the valley with our fire
  for a moment before our projector was lo-
  cated and destroyed one which we were
  at great pains to protect was maintained
  for a somewhat longer period

   i believed we had done an immense
 amount of damage by these momentarily
 active projectors although our enemy gave
 no sign


argosy-allstory weekly

  we then tried dropping rockets at the
base of the lights in the valley there were
few points at which they could be reached
without striking the rays first but we per-
sisted sending up a hundred or more most
were ineffective a few found their mark
as we could tell ba sudden  hole  in the
barrage which noever was invariably
repaired before we could make it larger

  these activities lasted a week or more
it began to look as though we had entered
upon a lengthy siege i wondered how long
the citys food supply would last if we set-
tled down to starve it out the thought
came to me then that tao might be almost
ready for his second expedition to the earth
was he indeed merely standing us off in
this way so that some day he migh depart
in his vehicle before our very eyes

  tao began to adopt our tactics with-
out warning one day a projector from a
towering eminence near the city flashed
down at the river encampment that we
were not entirely destroyed was due to the
extreme watchfulness of our guards who
located it immediately with their rays as
it was w e lost nearly a hundred men in the
single moment it was in operation

  we then withdrew our camp farther away
down the river to a point where the con-
formation of the country made a repetition
of this attack impossible a sort of guer-
rilla warfare now began in the mountains
our scouting parties frequently met taos
men and many encounters swiftly fatal to
one side or the other took place but all
the time we were able at intervals to rake
the valley without fire for brief periods

  mercer constantly was evolving plans of
the utmost daring most of them indeed
amounting practically to suicide for those
undertaking them but i held him back
our present tactics were dangerous enough
although after the first few fatalities we
succeeded in protecting our men even
though our projectors were invariably de-
stroyed

  one of mercers plans we tried with some
success there were some places in the
light-barrage that were much less high than
others ave devised a smaller rocket that
could be fired from the platforms mercer
took it up some twenty thousand feet and

sent several rockets over the light which
we hoped dropped into the city

  a month went by in this way we were
in constant communication by water with
the great city receiving supplies and reen-
forcements of men and armament and
then gradually the situation changed over
a period of several days our hand-to-hand
encounters with the enemy grew less fre-
quent finally two or three days went by
without one of them taking place

  we became bolder and prepared to es-
tablish several projectors at different points
for simultaneous fire at a given signal the
light-barrage in the valley remained un-
changed although now its beams held
steady instead of sometimes sw inging to and
fro we dislodged one of its projectors
with a rocket making a hole in the bar-
rage which this time was not repaired
and then to our amazement the lights one
by one began to die away we ceased op-
erations waiting within half a day they
had all vanished like lights which had flick-
ered and burned out

   mercer unthinking was all for an instant
attack we could indeed have swept the
valley now without difficulty but there
were thousands of people in the city-non-
combatants women and children-and to
murder them to no purpose was not the sort
of warfare we cared to make

  it seemed probable that tao had evacu-
ated his position the valley beyond the
city led up into the mountains toward the
dark city almost on the borderland of the
frozen wastes of the dark country tao
had protected this valley from behind so
that we had been unable to penetrate it
without making a detour of over twenty
miles this i had not done although had
the siege lasted longer i think with our next
reenforcement we should have attempted it

  with the extinguishing of the lights our
long-range activities ceased we anticipated
some trick and for several days remained
quiet our girls could have flown over the
city but this i would not allow fearing
that a ray would bring them suddenly down

  miela and myself occupying one of the
stone houses down by the river held a con-
sultation there with mercer and anina

  mercer as usual was for instant action
the fire people



   we might as well march right in he
declared  theyre out of business or
theyve gone-one or the other

   to the dark city they have gone i
think anina said

   i think so too mercer agreed

   ill go in alone on foot i said  and
find out what has happened

  but miela shook her head

   one who can flv will go more safely i
shall go

   not you my sister anina said quiet-
ly  warfare is not -for you-now that
you can understand can you not i shall
go

  mercer insisted on accompanying her
and he did pan of the way waiting while
she flew close over the city it was several
hours before they returned reporting that
the place was almost in ruins and that tao
and his men had fled some time before
leaving the light-barrage to bum itself out
the next day with our men in the black
cloth suits of armor marching up the valley
and the girls with their black shields flying
overhead we took possession of all that
remained of the lone city

chapter xxviii

the end of tao

the scene of desolation that met us in
the lone city was at once extraor-
dinary and awesome it seemed im-
possible that our rays acting for so drief
a period could have done so much dam-
age the city was nothing more than a
semicivilized settlement of little flat-topped
stone houses our rays striking these had
discharged harmlessly into the ground but
the interiors had been penetrated through
windows and doors and everything inflam-
mable about them as well as about the
streets had been destroyed

  the people had taken refuge in cellars
underground and in caves and crevices-
wherever they could find shelter but even
so there were a thousand dead in that
city that morning and rapidly spreading
disease would shortly have killed them all
they came out of their hiding places little
by little as we entered the streets and stood

about in groups staring at us sullenly they
seemed mostly old men and women and
children the younger men having fled with
taos army they were heavy-set apa-
thetic people with broad heavy faces
pasty-white skin and large protruding eyes
we were in the lone city nearly a month
burying the dead doing what we could for
the people and destroying or removing the
apparatus tao had left behind him

  the lone city before the banishment
of tao had been one of the most primitive
settlements of the twilight region it was
in the other hemisphere that the twilight
country was more densely populated but
since this lone city was so close to the
great city it had become the scene of taos
exile

  this region about the lone city was
of the most barren of the whole twilight
country- its people were almost entirely
meat eaters back toward the dark coun-
try great bands of animals like caribou
roamed living almost entirely in dark-
ness they had little power of sight and
were easy prey to hunters

  their hides which wtere covered with
short white fur provided clothing a form
of candle was made from their fat and
used for lighting and their flesh provided
food the dark city some two hundred
and fifty miles away was the center from
which most of these animals were obtained

   then thats where tao has been get-
ting his supplies from mercer exclaimed
as we heard all this from one of the twi-
light people  and thats where be has
gone now

  tao had indeed withdrawn to the dark
city we learned positively and more than
that we learned that he had factories there
as well as here we found in the lone city
some eight of the interplanetary vehicles-
most of them almost entirely completed
the fact that tao had abandoned them so
readily made us believe he had others in
the dark city

  there seemed a curious lack of appli-
ances for protection against the ray this
we attributed to two causes-that tao had
managed to take most of them with him
and that his supply of fabric came from
distant cities on the other side of the globe

within a month after we had occupied the
lone city we were again ready to start for-
ward it had been an irksome month for
mercer and not a day had passed without
my receiving a truculent declaration from
him that we were fools to allow tao to es-
cape so easily

  our occupation of the lone city was to
continue on this second expedition farther
into the twilight country  took with me
a much smaller and more select force we
had before us a land journey of some two
hundred and fifty miles through an un-
known barren country in which it would
be difficult for us to maintain ourselves
so i was determined to be burdened with as
few men as possible

  our force consisted of all the older men
trained in the operation of the larger pro-
jectors and rockets a variety of mechanics
and helpers men selected for their physical
strength a corps of young men to the num-
ber of fifty and fifty girls

  we did not take the platforms for i
assumed it would be too cold for the girls
to make sustained flights against this cold
we provided ourselves well with the white
furry garments of the twilight people i
need not go into details of our march to
the dark city it occupied some three
weeks we met with no opposition pass-
ing a few isolated settlements whose inhab-
itants rather welcomed us than otherwise

  this region we passed through took us
almost to the ill-defined borders of the dark
country it was not mountainous but
rather more a great broken plateau with a
steady ascent each day it grew darker and
colder until at last we entered perpetual
night it was not the sort of night we know
on earth but a stygian blackness

  we used little torches now of the light-
ray current and our little army trudging
along in their lurid glare and dragging its
wagons piled high with the projectors pre-
sented a curious and weird picture the
country for the most part was barren rock
with a few stunted trees growing in the
ravines and crevices there was an abun-
dance of water

  we encountered several rainstorms and
once during the last week it snowed a little
except for the storms the wind held steady

a gentle breeze f om the colder regions in
front blowing back toward the light coun-
try behind us

  during the latter days of our journey
i noticed a curious change in the ground
it seemed now in many places to be like
a soft chalky limestone which ran in pock-
ets and seams between strata of very hard
rock i called mielas attention to it once
and she pointed out a number of irregular
shaped small masses of a substance which
in daylight i assumed might be yellow
these were embedded in the soft limestone

   sulphur she said  like that on your
earth there is much of it up here i have
heard

  the dark city occupied a flat plateau
slightly elevated above the surrounding
country and on the brink of a sheer drop
of some six or seven thousand feet to an
arm of the polar sea

  our problems now were very different
from when we had laid siege to the lone
city the conformation of the country al-
lowed us no opportunity to approach closer
than two or three miles to the barrage of
light we must expect we could not reach
the city from these nearest points with our
projectors

  there were many lateral ravines de-
pressed below the upper surface of the main
plateau and though the light-rays from the
city directed horizontally would sweep
their tops we found we could traverse many
of them a considerable distance in safety
but from the bottoms of them we could
only fire our rockets without specific aim
and our projectors not at all

  only by the most fortuitous of circum-
stances did we escape complete annihilation
the first moment we appeared within range
we had no idea what lay ahead-although
the guides we had brought with us from the
lone city informed us we vvere nearing our
destination-and the scene remained in
complete darkness until we were hardly
more than five miles outside taos strong-
hold

  then without warning his lights flashed
on-not only a vertical barrage but a hori-
zontal one as well-sweeping the higher
points of the entire country around for a
distance of twelve or fifteen miles
the fire people



  we were at the moment following the
bottom of a narrow gully had we been on
any of the upper reaches of the plateau we
would undoubtedly have been picked out by
one of the roving beams of light and de-
stroyed

  we camped where we were and again for
several days i attempted nothing devoting
myself to a thorough exploration of the
country about us the dark city appeared
impregnable beams of light from taos
larger projectors were constantly roaming
about the entire plateau that surrounded
it and every higher point of vantage from
which one of ours could have reached them
must have been struck by their rays a score
of times a day

   it will be understood of course that any
place where we could mount one of the
higher powered projectors a task of several
hours at best and strike the city must of
necessity be also within range of their rays
for theirs were as powerful as ours upon
observation i felt convinced that should we
attempt to mount a projector anywhere on
these higher points it would be sought out
and destroyed long before we could bring it
into action

   that this was taos stronghold and not
the lone city now became evident i
could readily understand why he had re-
treated here fully four times as many
projectors as he had in operation in the
lone city were now in evidence those of
shorter range and spreading rays kept the
entire country bathed in steady light for
several miles around him while the larger
ones-a hundred of them possibly-roved
constantly over the black emptiness be-
yond

  from our encampment we could advance
but little farther fortunately retreat was
open to us and once beyond the circle of
steady light we had no difficulty in mov-
ing about in the darkness even though mo-
mentarily we frequently were within range
of the single light-beams had they chanced
to swing upon us

   this was the situation which even mer-
cer agreed appeared hopeless we explored
the brink of the precipice below which lay
the sea it was a sheer drop of many thou-
sand feet although a descent might have

been made closer to the dark city cer-
tainly it was not possible at any point we
could reach we sent our girls down and
they reported that from below it appeared
probable that access to the ocean was had
by the dark city some miles farther along
they went but a short distance for taos
lights were occasionally sweeping about
and more than that they could make but
very short flights owing to the cold

  to starve tao out appeared equally as
impractical as a direct attack with our
little army we could not surround the city
on a circumference of some eighty miles
we might indeed have barred the several
roads that entered it but it seemed probable
that if tao wanted to come out he would
come for all we could do to stop him and
yet to starve him out seemed our only pos-
sible plan

   well have to send back for reenforce-
ments i told mercer miela and anina
at one of our many conferences  an army
of several thousand if we can maintain it
up here

  and then the very next day mercer and
anina came forward with their discovery
we had set up our encampment of little
black fabric tents in a ravine some six miles
outside the city securely hidden by sur-
rounding cliffs above us across the black
sky the greenish-red beams of taos light-
rays swept continually to and fro miela
and i were sitting together disconsolately in
our tent reviewing the situation when mer-
cer and anina burst in they had been
roaming about together exploring the coun-
try and came in now full of excitement and
enthusiasm to tell us what they had found
we two were to accompany them they
would tell us no more than that and as
soon as we had all eaten we started off it
would be a trip of several hours mercer
said and would take us around to the
other side and partly behind the dark
city

  we followed no road but scrambled
along over the open country picking our
way as best we could and using the lights
from the city to give us direction the two
girls half walked half flew and mercer and
i with our ability to take huge leaps made
rapid progress


argosy-allstory weekly

  the night was black-that unluminous
blackness that seems to swallow everything
even objects near at hand we made our
way along using little hand searchlights
that threw a red glare a short distance be-
fore us

  we kept down in the gulleys as much as
possible avoiding the higher places where
taos long-range beams were constantly
striking and passed around in front of the
dark city keeping always at least five
miles away

  we had been traveling two or three
hours and still mercer and anina gave us
no clew to what we were about to see it
began to snow huge soft flakes soon lay
thick on the ground

   mercer where are you taking us i
exclaimed once

   you shall see very soon now anina
answered me  what we have found ol-
lie and i-and our plan-you shall under-
stand it soon

  we had to be content with that an
hour later we found ourselves well around
behind the dark city and hardly more than
four miles outside it a great jagged cliff-
face two hundred feet high perhaps front-
ed us we at its base were on compara-
tively low ground here with another low
line of cliffs shading us from the light-
beams of the city

  mercer and anina stopped and pointed
upward at the cliff a huge seam of the
soft chalky limestone ran laterally for five
hundred feet or more across its face i
saw embedded in this seam great irregular
masses of sulphur

   there you are sjid mercer trium-
phantly  sulphur-stacks of it all we
have to do is set fire to it with the wind
blowing this way-right toward the city-
his gesture was significant

  the feasibility of the plan struck us at
once it was an enormous deposit of free
sulphur from this point the prevailing
wind blew directly across the city the
sulphur lay in great masses sufficiently close
together so that if we were to set fire to it
in several places with our small light-ray
torches wre could be assured of its burning
steadily and its fumes without warning
blowing directly over the city- i shud-

dered as the whole thing became clear to
me

   good god man-

   that  smoke em out declared mer-
cer waving his hand again toward the cliff
 i ask you now wont that smoke em
out

   taos men-yes mielas face was
grave as she answered mercers triumphant
question  it will do that ollie kill them
all of a certainty but that whole city
there-

  mercer stared at his feet toying idly with
the little torch in his hand

   can you think of any other way to get
at tao he asked

  anina met my eyes steadily

   there is no other way she said quiet-
ly  it must be done it is your world-
your people-we must think of now and
you know there is no other way

  we decided at last to try it once we
had made the decision we proceeded as
quickly as possible to put the plan into
execution we moved our encampment
farther away well out of danger from the
fumes

  we mounted several of the projectors in
positions where their rays could reach the
surrounding country and the sky although
not the city itself then ordering our men
and girls to hold themselves in readiness for
whatever might occur we four went off to-
gether to fire the sulphur

  the wind was blowing directly toward
the city as we stood at the base of the cliff
a silent little group i think that now at
this moment we all of us hesitated in awe
at what we were about to do

  mercer broke the tension

   come on alan-lets start it off xow
is the time-a lot of places at once

  we flashed on our little light-rays and
in a moment the sulphur was on fire at a
score of different points we drew off a
few hundred feet to one side and sat down
to watch it in the darkness overhead
taos red beams swept like giant search-
lights across the inky sky

  the sulphur started burning with tiny
little spots of wavering blue flame that
seemed many of them about to die away
gradually they grew larger spreading out
the fire people



slowly and silently in ever-widening circles
under the heat of the flames the sulphur
masses became molten turned into a vis-
cous dark red fluid that boiled and bubbled
heavily and dropped spluttering upon the
ground

  slowly the blue-green flames spread
about joining each other and making more
rapid headway-a dozen tiny volcanoes
vomiting their deadly fumes and pouring
forth their sluggish boiling lava the scene
about us now was lighted in a horrible blue-
green glare a great cloud of thin smoke
gathered hung poised a moment and then
rolled slowly away-its deadly fumes hang-
ing low to the ground and spreading ever
wider as though eager to clutch the un-
suspecting city in their deadly embrace

   the entire face of the cliff was now cov-
ered with the crawling blue fire lapping
avidly about with its ten-foot tongues we
drew back staring silently at each others
ghastly green faces

    lets-lets get away mercer whis-
pered finally  no use staying here now

  we hurried back to the nearest place
where one of our projectors was set up
the two men guarding it looked at us anx-
iously and smiled triumphantly when miela
told them what we had done we stood
beside them a moment then miela and i
climbed to an eminence near by from
which we had an unobstructed view of the
city

   the light-barrage still held steady the
individual higher-powered projectors as be-
fore swung their beams lazily about the
country we sat partly in the shelter of a
huge bowlder behind which we could have
dropped quickly had one of them turned
our way

    soon it will be there miela said soft-
ly when we had been sitting quiet for a
time

   i did not answer it was indeed too sol-
emn a thing for words this watching from
the darkness while an invisible death let
loose by our own hands stole down upon
our complacent enemies

  a few moments more we watched-and
still the scene before us showed no change
then abruptly the lights seemed to waver
some of the beams swung hurriedly to and

fro then remained motionless in unusual
positions as though the men at their levers
in sudden panic had abandoned them

  my heart was beating violently what
hidden tragedy was being enacted behind
that silent barrier of light i shuddered
as my imagination conjured up hideous pic-
tures of that unseen death that now must
be stalking about those city streets enter-
ing those homes polluting the air with its
stifling noisome breath and that even at
this distance seemed clutching at my own
lungs

  i suppose the whole thing did last only a
moment there was little in what we saw
of significance had we not known but we
did know-and the knowledge left us trem-
bling and unnerved

  i leaped to my feet pulling miela after
me and in a few moments more we were
back beside the projector we had left with
mercer and anina suddenly a white shape
appeared in the sky over the city it passed
perilously close above the shattered light-
barrage and came sailing out in our direc-
tion

  mercer jumped for the projector but i
was nearer and in a moment i had flashed
it on

  its tao mercer shouted he-

  it was one of taos interplanetary ve-
hicles rising slowly in a great arc above us
i swung our light-beams upward it swept
across the sky and fell upon the white
shape the thing seemed to poise in its
flight as though held by the little red circle
of light that fastened upon it boring its
way in then slowly at first it fell faster
and faster it dropped until it struck the
ground with a great crash--the first and
only sound of all this soundless warfare

  it was three days before the great sul-
phur deposit we had ignited burned itself
out the lights of the city had all died
away and blackness such as i never hope
to experience again settled down upon the
scene

  we approached the dark city then we
even entered one or two of its outlying
houses but beyond that we did not go for
we had made certain of what we wanted to
know
	argosy-allstory weekly

  i remember my father once describing
how when a young man he had gone to
the little island of martinique shortly after
the great volcanic outbreak of mount pelee
i remember his reluctance to dwell upon
the scenes he saw there in that silent city
of st pierre-the houses with their dead
occupants stricken as they were sitting
about the family table the motionless
forms in the streets lying huddled where
death had overtaken them in their sudden
panic that same reluctance silences me
now for one does not voluntarily dwell
upon such scenes as those

  a day or so later we found the inter-
plan etarv projectile which had sought to
escape amid its wreckage lay the single
broken form of tao-that leader who plot-
ting the devastation of two worlds for his
own personal gain had at the very last de-
serted his comrades and met his death alone

chapter xxix

the keturn

there is but little more to add with
the death of tao and the changing of
the law concerning the virgins wings
my mission on mercury was over but i
did not think of that then for with the
war ended my position as virtual ruler of
the light country still held mercer and
me occupied with a multiplicity of details
it was a month or more after our return
from the twilight country that miela re-
minded me of father and my duty to him
 you have forgotten my husband but i
have not your world-it calls you now
you must go back

  go back home-to father and dear little
beth i had not realized how much i had
wanted it

   what you have done for our nation-
for our girls-can never be repaid alan
and you can do more in later years per-
haps but now your father needs you-
and we must think of him

  i cast aside every consideration of what
changes would first have to be made here
on mercury and decided in that moment
to go

   but you must go with me miela i

said and then as i thought of something
else i added gently  you will wont you
little wife for you know i cannot leave
you now

  she smiled her tender little smile

    whither thou goest i will go my
husband she quoted softly   for thy
people shall be mv people and thy god my
god 

  we were ready to start at the time of
the next inferior conjunction of mercury
with the earth at our combined pleading
and with the permission of his associates
fuero was persuaded to take command of
the nation during my absence and i felt
i was leaving affairs in able hands

  lua refused to accompany us but she
urged anina to go and the little girl was
ready enough to take advantage of her
mothers permission

  though he said nothing i shall never
forget mercers face as this decision was
made

  the vehicle in which miela had made her
former trip was still lying in the valley
where we had left it we went away pri-
vately only lua and fuero accompanying
us out of the city

  lua parted with her two daughters
quietly her emotions at seeing them go
she concealed under that sweet gentle re-
serve which was characteristic of her al-
ways

   promise me you will be careful of her
alan she said softly as she kissed me at
parting

  we landed in the chilean andes with
that patient statue of the christ to welcome
us back to earth the trans-andean rail-
road runs near it and we soon were in the
city of buenos aires the two girls with
wings shrouded in their long cloaks walked
about its crowded streets with a wonder-
ment i can only vaguely imagine we had
only what little money i had taken with me
to mercury i interviewed a prominent
banker of the city told him in confidence
who i was and from him obtained neces-
sary funds

  we cabled father then and he answered
at once that he would come down and join
us we waited for him down there and in
the fire people



another month he was with us-dear old
gentleman leaning over the steamer rail
trying to hold back the tears of joy that
sprang into his eyes at sight of me little
beth was with him too smart and stylish
as ever anti good old bob trevor whom she
shyly presented as her husband

  the beach at mar del plata near buenos
aires is one of the most beautiful spots in
south america and on a clear moonlight
night with the southern cross overhead it
displays the starry heavens as few other
places can on this earth

  on such a night in february  mer-
cer and anina sat together on the sand
apart from the gay throng that crowded
the pavilion below them the girl was
dressed all in white with a long black cape
covering her wings her beautiful blond
hair was piled on her head in huge soft coils
and over it she had thrown a filmy y-
blue mantilla that shone with a soft luster
in the moonlight and seemed reflected in
the blue of her eyes

   mercer in white flannels sat beside her
cross-legged on the white sand with a new-
ly purchased hawaiian guitar across his lap
from the band stand in the pavilion down
the beach faint strains of music floated up
to them the moon silvered the water be-
fore them a soft gentle breeze of summer
caressed their cheeks the myriad stars glit-
tered overhead like brilliant gems scattered
on the turquoise velvet of the sky

   anina chin cupped in her hand sat star-
ing at the wonderful heavens that all her
life before had been withheld from her
sight she sighed tremulously

    i want to say this is a night mercer
declared breaking a long silence

    its-its beautiful she answered soft-
ly  those millions of worlds-like mine
perhaps-or like this one of yours she
turned to him  ollie which of them is my
world

   you cant see it now anina its too
close to the sun

  again she sighed  im sorry for that
it would seem closer perhaps if we could
see it

   youre not sorry you came anina
you dont want to go back now

   not now ollie she smiled into his
earnest pleading eyes  for those i love
are here as well as there i have miela and
alan-and-

   and mercer leaned forward eagerly

   and mielas little son-that darling lit-
tle baby we must go back soon and see
miela she will be wondering where we
are

  mercer sat back  oh he said  yes
we must

  the band in the pavilion stopped its mu-
sic mercer slid his little steel cross-piece
over the guitar strings and began to play
the haunting crying music of the islands
the music of moonlight and love after a
moment he stopped abruptly

   anina that little song you sang in the
boat that day-you remember-the day wre
went to the water city sing it again
anina

  she sang it through softly just as she had
in the boat to its last ending little half-
sob

  mercer laid his guitar on the sand beside
him

   you said that music talks to you
anina-though sometimes you-you dont
understand just what it tries to say i feel
it that way too-only-only to-night-now
-i think i do understand

  his voice was very soft and earnest and
just a trifle husky

   you said that it was a love-song ani-
na and it was sad because love is sad do
you-think love is always sad he put
out his hand awkwardly and touched hers
 do you anina he whispered

  her little figure swayed toward him she
half turned and in her shining eyes he saw
the light that needs no words to make its
meaning clear

  the timidity that so often before had
restrained him was swept away he took
her abruptly into his arms kissing her hair
her eyes her lips

   love isnt-always very sad is it
anina

  her arms held him close

   i-i dont know she breathed against
his shoulder  but its-its very-won-
derful

  the fate of ex-champions

ell i see where kink constantstein which he
used to be kink of greece is out of a chob
with a tough winter coming on i dont even
know if he was a good feller when he had is
or not i never knew no kinks in a personal
way but i never heard nobody speaking no
good about them there is a lot of knocking
going on in this woild and you wouldnt know
how to take some of the knocks a lot of
people is knocking me but i never pay no atten-
tion to them on account i am too big a feller

     i am kind of sorry for this feller constantstein on account it might be hard for
him to get it another chob when a feller is out everybody is bolting the door on him
and when he is in everybody is inwiting him to sit down and take it a load oil his feet

    maybe an ex-kink is chust like a ex-champeen and a ex-champeen is the lone-
somest feller in the woild the only ex-champeen that people had any use for at all
was chon l solomon which he was the best box fighter of them all until a young
feller by the name corbett hit him on all of his chins at the same time and knocked
him cool then chon l solomon became chust an ex-champeen and people wasnt
so glad to see him only they never told him so n account chon l solomon hit them
first always and then asked them what they done him and why when they would
come to at the hospital

     i dont know what netionality it is that chon l solomon was but there was lots
of solomons in lithuania where i come from and some of them is relations of mine
maybe chon l solomon was one of them though lots of people has told me that they
thought he was an irisher and that they seen him in a st petricks day parade that
dont mean nothing on account i was wunst in a st petricks day parade myseluf

i	marched in it for protection and you couldnt blame me if you lived in that neigh-
borhood		

  even to-day there is a feller up in harlem which whenever he would get a couple


izzy kaplan s kolumn



drinks of slivowitz would come to me and say izzy you are a good feller and i
would let you shook the hand which it shook the hand of chon l solomon

    you never hear of a feller who esks you to shook the hand which it shook the
hand of chim corbett or chim jeffries them two chims is chust ex-champeens and
ex-champeens is nix they are chust like some feller which he failed in business and
you walk on the other side of the street when they are coming of course before you
get cool to the feller you find out whether he made a little something or lost the whole
business on the failure on account some failures chust means that a feller is brenching
out on a bigger scale and it would be a rotten mistake to think that a feller who is
making a failure for business reasons is really broke

     but i am speaking of fellers which they really got foolish and aint got nothing
left like an ex-champeen box fighter the other night i w-as at a box fighting and
bettling nelson which he used to be champeen box fighter tries to climb into the
rink so that he would be introductioned but a cop chased him out of the place
wunst everybody wanted to be introductioned to bettling nelson but when he is an
ex-champeen nobody would want to talk to him at all

    maybe the reason why is that when a feller becomes an ex-champeen he is going
to be an ex all his life and everybody knows it it is different in any other business
on account frinstance if i should have a rotten season and become an ex-photografter
the chances is that later on i might be right back in business again

    box fighters and kinks they never come back when a box fighter gets it on
the chin the best he can hope for is that wunst in a while they wrould say  well he
was a good feller when he had it and maybe thats the best which this mr con-
stantstein which he lost his kink chob could expect

    well i hope they will never be saying that about me what i want them to be
saying instead  izzy kaplan is a good feller and he has still got it i never want
to be one of those exes even a kinks exes

 sometimes  

they wouldnt
even admit
that you was
a good feller
when you had
it from what
they told me
this feller
con stanstein
would be chust
as w elcome
like smallpox
around a
greek restau-
rant to-day
and they
wouldnt even
give him a
bowl of soup

never come back

 nick the greek which
 he runs it a restaurant
 in harlem was all the
 time tolding me how
 he seen kink constant-
 stein wunst when he
 was in the old country
 and he showed me the
 wery het which he
s

argosy-allstory weekly

threw it up in the air when the kink was passing by and he never would trust no
cleaning feller with that het on account he wanted to keep it in the femily it was a
derbys het but since this last business in greece when kink constantstein precti-
cally went into benkruptcv nick the greek is wearing a new soft het and he told me
confidential that this feller constantstein always was a faker and never was on the
level with nobody not even himseluf

     look at this feller manuel which he used to be kink from the portugeeses he
has been out of woik so long that people is saying that he was nothing but a loafer
prectically all his life i never knew no portugeeses so i couldnt get no line on what
kind of a feller he was when he had the chob nobody remembers nothing about
him except that he is out

     with the politicianers it is the same way the chob wouldnt last and when it is
gone it must be hard on an ex getting used to getting the gone-by the toughest
thing must be to be an ex-senator when chust when he gets used to making it a speech
all the time he couldnt get nobody to listen excepting maybe his wife on account
she is so used to it that she could listen without hearing nothing like i would listen
to adwice from my old man

     thinking about this kind of business is good to keep a feller from getting too
fresh i read that when they are getting a new kink they would holler  the kink
is dead long live the kink it makes me think that some day they might be holler-
ing  izzy kaplan is failed three cheers for moe koenigsberg then i am noth-
ing but an ex-photografter nothing but a loafer chust like this feller constantstein
honest i am getting sorrier for that feller every minuite

     everybody becomes a nix when he is an ex everybody excepting one feller chon
l solomon they are still tolding howr they shook it the hand that shook it the hand
of chon l solomon

    adwice to the lovelorn-yes abe marritch would cure you but if you
have seen some of the fellers that it has cured maybe you would chust as soon not be
cured-i k

admira tion

                        its not so much the looks of her

though shes the loveliest ever

                         nor is it just the way she has

                        though shes most awfully clever

                          its not her voice her grace her height

                       though she cant be beat by another

                           its just the feeling thats out of sight

                        when i think im not her brother
