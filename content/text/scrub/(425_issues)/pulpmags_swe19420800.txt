coursed down Linda's spine as she came out of the pool and heard Rosita say, “So this is my competition!" blue, his tan so attractive!” Linda breathed. “Say, woman, what’s wrong with my shoulders and my tan?” Don demanded. He threw back his shoulders, preened like a giant peacock. “Not a thing, goof-you’re marvelous!” Linda laughed indulgently. Don wouldn't be bad looking, she thought with a start of surprise, if he had clothes like Brent Leeds. She had never paid any particular attention to Don. A big, good-natured chap, with an unruly shock of wavy blond hair, Don ifsually wore shabby grey slacks and a nondescript sweater when he came in for his mail. He frequently stopped to tease her, his brown eyes lit with mischief, his wide, generous mouth curved in an engaging smile. Sometimes in the evenings he came down to the inn to argue politics with her Uncle Nat, and loneliness often drove Linda down to the lobby to listen. “Can’t understand a fine young chap 7 SWEETHEART STORIES like Don living the way he does,” her uncle often remarked with a puzzled shake of his head. HER UNCLE wasn’t the only one who wondered why Don Muirhead lived alone in the lovely old white Colonial house, Hillcrest, its broad acres and rolling green lawns skirting the winding river. Its doors had always been wide open, its windows ablaze with light, when his father, the famous Senator Muirhead, and his beautiful mother were living. Now the front windows were boarded up, its wide door bolted, and Don camped at the back, with only an old Irish woman to come in by the day. The gossips couldn’t decide whether the old Senator had given most of his money to charity or whether he had invested un- wisely. They did, however, wonder why Don didn't sell his valuable property, sur- rounded as it was by the showy extensive estates of the exclusive summer colony, and get out into the world and do something worthwhile. Linda herself considered it a wicked waste of time-a big husky six-fooler put- tering around a garden! “I’m a chemist, curious child,” Don had teasingly replied when she questioned him. “I’m experimenting with a new plant food. Wander up some day and get an eyeful of my super-special sweet peas.” Call it what he would, to Linda it was still puttering. No, Don definitely wasn't one to whom she would give a second glance or thought. “What does Brent Leeds do besides make a name at polo?” she now asked. “Still mooning over that guy?” Don lift- ed an amused eyebrow. “Why should he do anything when papa makes Leeds’ tires?” “Who was the stunning blond with him?” she continued. “Rae Johnson.” ‘‘From that red stone mansion on the bluff?” “That's the old homestead. Rosita spends most of her summers at Bar Har- bor. It’s much, much too slow around here for that young lady. She’s just floated in for the weekend, she said” “Are they engaged?” Linda asked, her heart racing over that question. “If she is, it probably won’t be for long. She changes her fiance every season.” “Oh!” Linda didn’t realize what relief lay in that syllable. “So! ” Don folded his arms, stood gazing down at her. “So that’s who it is! That’s the goon you’ve been mooning over!” Linda flushed, but managed a scornful laugh. “Don’t be silly, Don! I haven't time to laugh. This is my busy day.” QUICKLY she turned her back to him. She’d hate to have Don or anyone else guess how completely she had fallen in love with Brent Leeds the first time he had strolled into the post office. His deep, thrilling voice, asking lazily for his mail, had stirred something deep within her. She had tried to laugh at herself, but it was useless. Each time she saw him, it was worse. Not that he had spoken two words to her. None of the young people from up on the Hill glanced twice at her. That was what hurt. Although she had been voted the most popular girl at school, the past two years had been lonely, unhappy ones, first the long, heartbreaking care of her father, then, after his sudden death, the long, hope- less search for work. It was with new hope in her young heart that she had accepted her Uncle Nat’s invi- tation to come live at his inn and help him in the post office. Now she would really begin to live! Ocean Heights, she knew, was brimming over with eligible young men. young men whom it would be easy-and smart-to fall in love with. For Linda was determined not to allow herself to fall in love with a man without money. She had had her fill of poverty. And there were countless young men around in expensive sports clothes. They drove up in gleaming cars, ran into the post office on their way from the country club. But-they had eyes only for the sleek, smartly groomed girls at their sides. A COACH FOR LOVE No one stopped to chat with Linda. No one but Don, and of course he didn’t count. He broke through her bitterness now. "You don’t mean to tell me Brent Leeds hasn’t had an eyeful of you! A cute little trick with copper curls and luscious curves?” He closed one eye, his head on one side. “Of course, one doesn’t get a very satisfy- ing view through that small wicket. Now, if he once got a glimpse of you in your bathing suit-” Linda gave him a withering glance and turned back to sort her mail. Don must have seen her swimming in the river at the foot of his orchard. That was her only recreation, the only sport availabl? to a girl who “didn’t belong.” Dor me closer to her window. “Hi, Lind;-, I’ve just had an idea! How’d you like to make Brent Leeds sit up and take notice?” “How’d I like a couple of yachts?” Linda retorted scathingly. “Listen, Funnyface, I’m serious! You’re pretty smooth in the water, as I suppose you know.” “I learned to swim before I could walk,” Linda said drily. “How are you on diving?” “If I could once get on that slick diving board and tower at the country club pool, I’d show you!” she replied vehemently. It made her boil every time she went by that ornately walled pool and read For Members Only. “All right, you shall show me!” Don said. “I still have my Life Membership card kicking around somewhere. Dad do- nated that land to the club. He was a char- ter member. It joins our place, you know.” Linda’s large grey eyes opened wider. Her heart skipped a beat at his next words. “That’s what attracted Brent to Rosita -her swimming. He had never noticed her until she won the club championship.” He eyed Linda speculatively. “You know, Funnyface. you have everything Rosita has.” “A lot of good it does me,” Linda replied sadly. “That’s why I think it would be great sport to put one over on some of those small-time snobs that hang around the club.” It must be hard, Linda thought with a stab of pity. Hard to have once belonged on the top, and then to have had to step down. Don couldn't help but be a little bitter and envious, although this was the first time he had showed it. “Brent doesn’t look like a snob, Don,” she said defensively. “Oh, I didn’t mean Leeds. He’s a good sport. Tops in his class. Otherwise I wouldn’t be offering to pinch-hit for Cupid. “Why this sudden interest in my heart affairs, Don Muirhead?” Linda demanded skeptically. “Maybe it’s the Boy Scout in me,” he grinned, then sobered. “My main idea is to make Rosita Johnson work for the Silver Cup this year. Dad donated it and it’s a honey. Several of the town girls have tried for it every year. But they’ve never won it.” "Rosita, with her nose in the air, sails in here just before the Championship Meet each summer, and without the least effort walks off with the trophy again. She’s done it for four years. This year, if she wins, she keeps the cup-and takes it away from Ocean Heights.” “She must be good,” Linda said wist- fully. “She is.” Don’s voice was grim. “Darned good-and she knows it! But I think you could beat her-with a little coaching.” “Swell chance!” Linda scoffed. “Who’d coach me?” “I might,” Don said shortly. “I used to be pretty fair myself.” LINDA gave a start. “Muirhead-Muir- head!” she said reflectively. Then her eyes widened. “Don, you weren’t Speed Muirhead, of Yale, who broke all long- distance records four years ago?” she de- manded excitedly. “That’s what they called me,” he replied carelessly. “My dad was a famous swim- mer in his day. I never did come up to him.” Speed Muirhead, puttering among the 9 SWEETHEART STORIES flowers! It just didn’t make sense, with the whole world crashing all around him! Linda gazed with renewed exasperation at the lean, tall young man lounging on the window ledge. “Are you game, Lindv? Would you en- ter the contest?” Don asked. “Will I? Oh, Don!" Linda sighed rap- turously. “To swim in that marvelous pool, to dive from the tower-why, I’d risk an arm and leg!” “To win the prize you want-the pretty Leeds boy-you’ll need both of your lovely limbs,” Don said sardonically. Linda loftily ignored that. “Don, do you truly believe I could do it-beat Rosita?” Linda’s voice was uncertain. “You’d better-if you want Leeds,” Don replied grimly. “Leeds likes winners -the belle of the ball, the leading lady, the star attraction. In other words, he goes for the one all the other boys are buzzing around.” He arched one eyebrow quizzically. “The big chance comes afterwards. It’s a quaint old local custom, you see-the Swimming Champion and the president of the club leads the grand march at the Rose Ball that follows.” “And the president is-” Linda held her breath. “Brent Leeds,” Don answered. AN ICY trickle crept down Linda’s spine. “Oh, Don, I couldn’t! I’d be scared silly! Besides, I haven’t the clothes. I-” Don interrupted with a snort. “Don’t tell me a smart gal with red hair and fire in her eyes would let a little thing like that stop her! As for clothcs-” He paused, wrinkled his forehead. “How are you with a needle?” he asked abruptly. “Not bad-not bad at all with a darning needle,” she said cryptically. “But it would be a bit difficult to whip up a dress out of flour sacks, and I’ve used up all our drapes.” Don chuckled. “I was just thinking about the couple of trunks filled with dress- es up in our storeroom. You should find something you could use.” “Don! You’re not really serious!” He soon convinced her that he meant every word he had said. He wanted the Muirhead Silver Cup to stay in Ocean Heights. He would coach her every day. He would arrange with her uncle to relieve her of her duties. And he’d let it be under- stood she was a summer guest at the inn. And he considered Brent Leeds just the man for her. He made that very clear. The first week he gave her workouts in the river at the foot of his private pier. Then he announced they’d try the pool. He inspected her faded swim suit with a dubious eye. Linda laughed. “Don’t fret, darling. I’ve bought a new suit-one that will knock your eyes out.” “Brent’s, you mean, Funnyface. Don’t waste any of your hard-earned dough on me.” “You put girls in the same class as your garden pests, don’t you?” Linda asked curiously. Don shrugged. “Haven’t time to bother with them,” he said carelessly. She was simply a means of keeping his precious cup at home. Don had made that very clear. Not that she cared, she assured herself. Don had none of the attributes she wanted in a husband. He could continue to putter around with his secret formulas in his top- floor laboratory, for all she cared. Her face was flushed with excitement as she prepared for the club pool the next day. She had blown her entire Christmas check from her uncle that she had been carefully hoarding. She had bought a stunning green swim suit, with helmet, sandals and cape to match. Green, she knew, brought out the copper lights in her curls and set off the creamy tint of her skin. Don helped Linda through the gap in the dividing hedge into the club house grounds. The doorman who guarded the sacred portals of the swimming pool greeted Don like an old friend. Linda stepped inside, gave a little gasp, stood quite still. It was so beautiful! Multi-colored tiles gleaming beneath the crystal water, pink marble steps leading up to the white iron tables that nestled A COACH FOR LOVE beneath gay umbrellas. Miniature palm trees grew in giant tubs, hanging baskets spilled gay flowers and graceful vines, tropical birds swung in gilded cages. Her quick glance searched the tables. Brent Leeds was nowhere in sight. Her heart took a nosedive. Later she decided his absence was cause for gratitude, because she nervously fum- bled several of her dives. “None of that, young lady!” Don said. “You’ll have to wear confidence like a pull- over sweater to impress a top-notcher like Brent. He likes smoothies. I’ve heard him whistle softly over a sweet double jack- knife of Rosita’s. You’ll have to work on yours.” Linda swallowed a sharp retort. She was getting slightly fed up with his constant harping on what Brent Leeds liked. Per- haps he didn’t really think she could at- tract anyone as marvelous as Brent Leeds. She’d show him! With flaming cheeks she ran out 011 the springboard, flung her head high, then dived off in her favorite swan dive. A ROAR of applause came from the spectators. She felt all eyes upon her as she sprang up the ladder. Several young men clamored for intro- ductions after she emerged. Don presented her as an old friend. She smiled provocatively at each in turn. Hadn’t Don said Brent always went for the popular girl? She’d need every bit of build-up she could get. “Going to be around all summer, I hope,” one lanky youth said hopefully. “Oh, yes.” She paused, then laughed audaciously and said, “I’ve come to capture the swimming trophy!” She left them all staring and tripped off to the dressing room. “Well done, Lindy,” Don approved. “That will set the tongues wagging. You'll attract plenty of interest from now on.” “Until I fail,” Linda said in a small voice. She clutched at his arm. “Oh, Don, what if I shouldn’t win it after that wild boast? I must have been mad to say that! ” “You’d better win it, you little redhead,” “Your formula didn’t work-not the way you intended,” Linda said. SWEETHEART STORIES Don said grimly, “after all the time I'm spending on you!” “I’ll be too busy to get over to the pool tomorrow. Brent Leeds will probably ap- pear. Do your stuff and watch him sit up and beg. Keep your head. If he suggests lunch, tell him you have an appointment. 111 tell Mrs. Riley to lay an extra plate for you.” ‘■You don’t think I'd accept his first invi- tation. do you?" Linda cried, her eyes flashing. Don ignored her indignation. His eyes narrowed thoughtfully. “Let's see, I think the proper formula with Brent is one part come-hither to two parts hard-to-get.” He pulled his shabby car up to the inn. Linda jumped out before he completely stopped. She turned and faced him with flushed cheeks. “Don Muirhead, you make me sick- you and your silly formulae! You might give me credit for a little intelligence!” She flounced into the inn, his laughter following her. LINDA felt the curious glances and heard the buzz of whispers lhat followed her entrance into the club the next day. She was poised on the springboard, ready to dive, when something made her pause and look up. At the side of the pool, not ten feet away, stood Brent Leeds. Brent, tall and breathtakinglv attractive in plaid jacket and white flannels, his hand- some blond head tilted back, his eyes upon her. Their glances met and locked. She felt the blood mounting her cheeks, but couldn’t tear her glance from his. This was the moment she had dreamed of, planned for, worked toward. Brent Leeds was seeing her, really seeing her, for the first time. A slight tremor shook her, then she drew a deep breath and sent up a little prayer. She had to be good, so much depended upon it. “Bravo! Bravo!” Brent cried, as she came up from a perfect swan dive. He was waiting for her at the end of the pool, reached down and helped her up. “Beautifully done! Beautiful!” he said softly. “Why haven’t I met the Diving Goddess before?” “Sure you haven’t?” she asked, slowly lifting long lashes, smiling mysteriously. “I’ve often seen you.” “It must have been from a distance,” he replied with conviction. Seeing three pur- poseful young men approaching, he said, “Let’s get away from the mob. We’re lunching together.” Linda smiled demurely. “Kind of you, Mr. Leeds, but I have an appointment. I must hurry.” Smiling at him over her shoulder, she hurried into the dressing room. Don hailed her from his back door. “Hurry up. slow-poke, I'm hungry.” So was Linda, but she had difficulty in eating the leathery steak and the greasy potatoes that Mrs. Riley served them on one end of the kitchen table. “I’ll have to speak to the butcher about his steaks,” Don said, frowning at his. I’d like to speak to the cook, Linda thought grimly. If this was the way she looked after Don, it was a wonder he didn't die of dyspepsia! Don certainly needed someone to look after him properly. “Leeds turned up, didn’t he?” Don asked. “He did. Made quite a fuss. Asked me to lunch,” she replied absently, noting that he had pushed back his plate, half finished. Poor Don, who had been used to the best, having to put up with this! “Don,” she burst out, “I'd like to do something in return for all you’re doing for me. I can toss a mean waffle and make coffee that will start your nostrils quivering. How about letting me come over and get lunch for you after my daily workout?” Don looked up sharply. She added quickly, “I'm sure Mrs. Riley has too much to do. She could do with a bit of help.” One eyebrow shot up. “Isn’t thar just like a girl! Let her get one foot in your house and she wants to take possession! Nothing doing, Lindy!” He grinned, hold- ing up both hands. “Can't have any girls messing around my bachelor diggings!” A COACH FOR LOVE Linda sprang up, grey eyes flashing fire. “If that’s the way you feel, I shan’t bother you any longerl” “Sit down, Redhead!” Don laughed. “Kind of cute when she’s all het up, isn’t she, Mrs. Riley?” Don appealed to his housekeeper, who had just entered with a discouraged-looking pie. LINDA obediently sat down again, won- dering why it was impossible to stay angry with Don. He was certainly the most irritating man she had ever known. “Want to see the old house while you’re here?” he inquired casually when they arose. He opened the door of the dining room, crossed over and pulled aside heavy drapes, letting the sunlight play on the gleaming mahogany and heirloom silver. He guided her into the library with its intricately carved mantel, its deep, com- fortable chairs, and on to the drawing room. She caught her breath in wonder at the exquisite taste and quiet elegance of its furnishings. Antiques of great value, she was sure. “You’ve never considered selling any of these?” she asked hesitantly. “No,” he replied quickly. “Quaint of me, no doubt, but I’m rather attached to this old stuff.” He ran a gentle hand over the satin of the Queen Anne sofa. “Of course, this doesn’t compare with Leeds’ new white leather and chromium,” he said, avoiding her eyes. “What makes you think I’d prefer the latest and most extreme modes?” she asked sharply. “Don’t all the girls?” he asked with a shrug. “But I must get up to my lab. I’ll show you where the storeroom is. You can help yourself to anything you like in the trunks.” He left her at the storeroom door and went on up the stairs, whistling gaily. 66T>ad news travels fast lindy lou -- don greeted her at his

white clouds sweep across the sky when they crossed over a small wooden bridge he stopped the car there he said thats better which meant that brents arm was now about her shoulders drawing her close shed decided what to do about this so she said i think ill have a cigarette brent he laughed the good old smoke screen but he gave her one and as he lit it with a silver lighter she felt very daring and sohisticated so youre going to capture the silver cup he said over his cigarette shouldnt be a bit surprised the gallery is all for you did you know that lindas mind was on the rose ball she was picturing herself in the dress she had found in the trunk a cobwebby affair with cascading tiers of creamy lace she was picturing brents face when he saw her ready to lead the grand march with him she let him kiss her it seemed in- evitable there under the whispering trees but she didnt want him to hold her close long that made him laugh linda brooks youre the sweetest thing ive met in a dozen of moons im crazy about you do you like me linda do you ummm-i guess so she said breath- lessly pulling away not good enough a guess isnt he as- serted pulling her to him again there were more stars now and dimly linda could see brents smooth blond hair and his ardent eyes she said in a laugh- ing husky voice make it quite a lot then brent her heart was pounding crazily a whole lot he insisted well that would be telling  nervously she reached into her cape pocket for her compact but it wasnt there i guess ill have to let the famous brooks nose shine she said quickly oh no you wont take this tte pulled one from his pocket a very splendid compact red enamel with rosita johnsons initials in gold culled from last nights date when you a coach for love wouldnt go you see what happens when youre obstinate linda suddenly felt the queerest hollow ache some place close to her chest i have a lipstick here some place too siren red if i recall correctly suit it will have to she said with a defiant laugh she powdered her nose outlined her trembling lips in brilliant red but she didnt feel daring nor very happy either don wouldnt do that she was very sure- kiss one girl and talk about another but then don wasnt interested in girls he had made that very clear come on honey one more kiss and then well get going quietly she submitted shed have to play the game according to brents rules if she were going to hold her own against rosita she felt her first sharp twinge of distaste for this love game she was waging she gave a mental shrug she wasnt going to back down now that she was well started she wasnt a quitter ton saw brent drive off with rosita - the next morning and said whats the matter linda didnt fumble any of your plays last night did you remem- ber my formula dons glance was pene- trating she flushed hotly you want to watch your step now that youve got him interested he admonished severely something seemed to snap inside linda ill tell you what t dont want she flared i dont want to be pushed around every moment why lindy child youre developing nerves that will never do don shook his head what i started out to warn you was that rosita is working under a coach at a neighboring pool shes con- centrating on speed-she knows you have her there so dont let up on your prac- tice dont worry i wont let you down she snapped ill keep your precious cup in the village for you and she did work worked until don called a halt she returned without his knowledge and continued her practice when night came she longed to creep into bed and stay there but when brent tele- phoned and demanded that she go dancing with him she didnt dare refuse hed take rosita if she did and she knew now that she could win brent-if she could keep him away from rosita she was too exhausted to feel the same thrill that had swept over her at his first embrace it wont be long now she remind- ed herself when she had to force herself to go out with him the contest would soon be over the morning of the contest don brought her a huge feather fan this went with the dress one demure smile over that and the man is yours linda swallowed a sharp retort don neednt be in such a darn hurry to shove her into brents arms thanks don she finally said youll be at the ball wont you wouldnt i cut a pretty figure in these clothes he struck a humorous pose in his grey slacks and sweater you might take your dress suit out of moth balls she suggested in annoyance or out of hock he added with a grin and left her she stood gazing after him don would be a stunning figure in evening clothes she reflected so tall and broad and straight she shrugged impatiently why waste time thinking about him she would keep her mind on how stunning brent would look tomorrow night and how proud hed be when she captured that cup she didnt dare let herself contemplate a possible failure the big day dawned clear and sparkling she started out armed with quiet confi- dence in the dressing room excited girls clus- tered around her rosita is out for your blood shes been working as she never worked in all her lift working up her speed at the sundale  sweetheart stories pool a little blond shrilly announced go in there and take it away from her linda shes always had things too much her own way a former schoolmate of ro- sitas added we used to say at school that she wouldnt attend even a funeral if she couldnt be the corpse one of rositas friends had entered un- noticed even if you win i wouldnt count too heavily on winning brent with the cup ros johnson has too big a hold on him she said maliciously a wave of revulsion swept over linda but the warning whistle made her forget everything but the impending contest don surprisingly smart in white flannels put an encouraging hand on her shoulder youre going to win you know im ex- pecting it of you he said confidently before she could reply the starting sig- nal sounded for the first dive rosita fum- bled that one but linda felt dons ex- pectant eyes upon her and put all she had into it the applause reached the sky her sec- ond wasnt quite so good and the third they tied on the two scores were even at the end of the diving section of the pro- gramme next came the long distance races when the contestants lined up linda found her- self beside rosita brent came up behind them put a hand on a shoulder of each of them go to it girls ive placed my money evenly he said lindas anger spurred her to a furious ef- fort she ended nearly three feet ahead amid the deafening roar of applause on the next lap they tied for rosita her color high her eyes black pinpoints was putting everything she had into the effort when the final and deciding race came linda knew it was hers rosita was tiring getting short of breath as linda stood poised she looked for dons encouraging smile but he wasnt there she searched through the crowd in vain while she was wondering at the hollow feeling that gripped her rosita approached spoke her name ive a bargain to make with you she said very low and intense i know its brent youre after the cup means noth- ing to you  want that cup let me win this race and ill go away ill leave brent to you linda caught her breath it would be that easy slacken her effort and have a clear field with brent after all what did she care for a silver cup she opened her mouth to agree to the pact but no words came instead a shiver of revulsion shook her she was sick of the whole business fighting and scheming and bargaining for a man why shed have to go on fighting the rest of her life to hold him after she had won him she was sick of the very name of leeds don had dinned that name into her ears until she had wanted to scream and don expected her to win he had given generously of his time and efforts to that end she couldnt let him down that one thought stood out startlingly clear above the confused whirl of her emo- tions she had to win for don sorry miss johnson but ill have to do my best win or lose my coach ex- pects it of me the whistle blew rosita gave her one brief glance of fury and dived in tensely the gallery watched they seemed to feel there was something at stake beyond a sil- ver trophy t osita was fighting madly to get ahead linda used every ounce of strength she could summon to keep abreast of her steadily desperately she fought on she had to win she couldnt let don down there were only six feet to go and ro- sita was a few inches ahead when the truth struck linda with a bang she was in love with don new strength flowed into her veins as joy surged through her one arm flashed up dug deep into the water and she was in one split-second before rosita she was being pulled up amid the wild- est of cheers brent had his arm around her smiling broadly as he saw the pho- tographers with cameras focused their way then he was helping her through the a coach for love crowd that pressed close urging her to hur- ry and dress linda however was looking for don he was nowhere in sight he hadnt come to congratulate her    tvfumbly she dressed slipped out of a  side entrance jumped into a taxi to avoid brent and hurried home you didnt win her uncle said glum- ly after one look at her face oh yes i won she replied listlessly i-i guess im just played out her lips trembled and she fled to her room flung herself on the bed sobbing don hadnt cared enough to stay he had probably hurried home to his precious laboratory the moment he knew his cup was safe his coaching job was done and he was through with her the man she loved was content to turn her over to an- other man she jumped up angrily washed away her tears and recklessly applied her bright- est rouge and lipstick at least he shouldnt guess she cared with her color high and her eyes fever- ishly bright she dressed for the rose ball the creamy lace whirled about her feet her mothers pearls her one precious pos- session encircled her white throat with hands that shook only a little she fastened the cluster of waxen gardenias in her cop- per curls she stood very still clasping her hands tightly together as she studied the result she was lovely she hadnt dreamed she could look like this she need not fear rosita tonight this is what you have always wanted she reminded herself as brent assisted her into his shining new car why did you run away from me to- day he reproached her and drew her close pressing his ardently demanding lips on hers she forced herself to respond this was all that was left a girl couldnt go through the rest of her life alone because the man she loved didnt love her you know im not going to let you es- cape again brent whispered were go- ing to run away together right after the dance im mad about you linda dar- ling she tried to lift her lips to his but something stronger than her will pulled her away from brents imprisoning arms oh no you arent brent you think so now but youd soon find out how wrong you are brent believe me id only make you terribly unhappy are you crazy or just playing coy brent asked harshly you dont think ill stand for any funny business after the way youve led me on im sorry brent she said miserably i thought i did love you you did dazzle me youre so handsome so dashing so awfully attractive- what made you change your mind he asked somewhat mollified i found i loved another man she said simply ump was all he murmured and jammed his foot down on the gas in silence they drove to the country club wait until you see rosita in her new golden gown one of the girls greeted her in the powder room shes out to steal your man quietly linda entered the ballroom stopped inside the door until she caught rositas eye then she beckoned to her rosita will you lead the grand march with brent i dont feel well besides thats your place i dont belong there she said simply without another word she quickly slipped out on to the moonlit balcony she stepped back into a shadowy corner stood there numb and cold as the strains of the stirring march began her back turned to the colorful scene inside she had done it thrown away her chance cast aside all the gay carefree times the life of ease and luxury the fun she might have had with brent but it wouldnt have been fun that was the trouble nothing would be fun without don and shed have no further excuse now to see him she clenched her  sweetheart stories icy hands together closed her eyes as if to shut out the desolate glimpse of the future someone stepped out on the balcony she moved further back into the shadows linda-linda where are you don it was a whisper all she could manage she could only stare at the tall striking figure in faultless evening clothes a white gardenia in his lapel he stepped close captured both her hands linda i was sorry i had to run away this afternoon i had a message a government official was waiting at the house ive been tied up with him ever since excitement underlay his words linda why arent you out there with brent he asked softly placing a gentle hand beneath her chin forcing her to face him she shut her eyes she couldnt stand it don so near so dear so infinitely dear she opened her eyes and faced him your formula didnt work-not the way you intended don are you sure brent proposed didnt he he asked urgently linda shrugged wearily oh he pro- posed but i didnt want him a sob caught in her throat let me go don let me go oh no-not yet little one he said softly then laughed triumphantly not until i make sure my formula didnt work exactly as i hoped it would didnt an overdose of brent leeds wear you out-prove as i hoped it would that he wasnt the one for you linda gasped don muirhead was that what you were trying to do she cried furiously definitely  he answered cheerfully but linda- his voice softened he cupped her chin in both of his lean clever hands linda the important question is -did it show you who the right one is yes linda whispered her heart pounding afraid to believe the light in his eyes she said don you dont mean- that i love you of course darling it seems ive always loved you linda stepped back her eyes flashing fire joy relief exasperation struggled for expression then why didnt you say so long ago she demanded and get turned down he said with a wry grimace i had to get that glamour boy leeds out of your system first so his elaborate indifference had been only part of his scheme hed probably even put mrs riley up to serving that aw- ful meal to enlist her sympathy she didnt care-she didnt mind anything being poor having don putter around with chem- icals-as long as don loved her theres no room in my heart for any- one but you linda whispered happily her arms going around his neck it was sometime later when the earth stopped reeling dizzily and the stars and moon settled back in their places that don asked how would you like a honeymoon in washington angelface i have business down there business she asked wondering yes and heres a secret for my bride alone my real secret formulae are for the department of munitions the flower garden the playing poor and shutting up the house were to ensure privacy-secrecy that wont be necessary any longer my experiments will be conducted in the gov- ernment laboratories oh don arent you wonderful linda said breathlessly she had already forgot- ten she had ever considered him otherwise don only chuckled and drew her closer perennial no fragile love is this of ours to wither like frost-biiten flowers it too can stand the wintry blast and bloom anew when war is past eloise wade hackett  w ay v  on eating peanuts as if she didnt know chris had walked -- out of the little knotty-pine real estate office across the street and now sat holding down the other end of the park bench with his big sprawly frame well she was through finished washed up shed take no more dictation from that goon the idea of him expecting her to take down all that slush to sheila wayne along with his business letters business my eye hed never be a business man if he lived to be a hundred and shed never get anywhere working for him either oh well nothing like a big fat bag of roasted peanuts to make the world look different no crack no smack no crunch lady youre to be congratulated kay turned her red-bronze head and looked at him-at him-and through him chris sat with his elbow resting on the back of the bench his palm flat against his dark tan cheek he wore no hat and the breeze ruffled his blond hair his blue eyes called her any number of little so- and-sos but his smile denied each in turn  sweetheart stories he looked so exasperatingly naive that she wanted to push his face in on second thought she held out the bag of peanuts chris was allergic to peanuts and he was fond of them too it was a dirty trick he declined no thanks monkey but po ahead i like to watch you eat them its as good as a trip to the zoo your hpt-that nail polish-the way you pop those peanuts into your mouth kay bent her head and searched in- tently among the hulls-which she had put tidily in the bag-for more peanuts so he didnt like her hat and her nail polish her eyes smarted and for a second she couldnt distinguish between the peanuts and the hulls what was wrong with her hat and her nail polish very carefully kay closed the bag she folded down the dog-eared flaps neatly desperately she began to wonder if leaving chris alone in that office was the thing to do hed get another girl of course hed pick his own and heaven only knew what hed pick and she had promised his father- it wasnt chris she was thinking about she told herself stubbornly glaring at the peanut sack but his father his father had known her when she worked for mc- clellan hed come to her with a good proposition kay im opening a real estate office for chris i want a girl in that office who has initiative a good business head and spunk there wont be much business at first because ive got to go east but ill set you two up and i expect some results by the time i get back now youve known chris a long time and you know he needs an example first his mother spoiled him since then women have always hung on his neck and theres one named sheila wayne who writes him letters that- keep her off his mind will you t ay had taken the job been glad to get it but a fine chance she had had to keep sheila wayne off his mind when chris spent half his time dictating love letters to her that he wouldnt even trust her to mail an hour ago kay had come to the end this isnt my job-taking down all this tripe she had flashed blindly she had stumbled to her feet slammed her note- book down on his desk caught up her hat and purse and here she was now that her anger had cooled-pea- nuts always helped to put her in the right mood-she remembered his father and her job she couldnt walk out no matter how much she wanted to shed given her word and shed have to stick until his father got back then shed let him take over and straighten things out chris was no realtor look at him shed quit and walked out and he had fol- lowed her as if he had nothing to do but sit on a bench and watch her eat peanuts what would he do tomorrow and the day after oh lord kay got up from the bench chris rose lazily she swung around and faced him all right you win she looked him square in the eye come on back to work work i said not crooning to honey- colored hair and honey lips she turned on her heel and walked rapidly away from him shoulders stiff and straight head high her heart thudding crazily she flung the bag of peanuts into an ashcan as she passed she felt a little sick chris was right behind her she heard him chuckle once it took every bit of self- control she had to keep from turning around and slapping his face inside the office as she started to take off her hat chris reached out and grabbed her shoulders perked her to him and held her tight her hat slid over one ear she didnt have the strength to shove it off his gaze rested on her lips then he pulled her closer bent his head and kissed her his kiss was long and deep and hard and real she relaxed and returned his kiss ferv- ently and then she hauled off and hit him you beast you beast she cried he let go of her and she fell back against her desk there a gentle tap came on the door i say a tenor voice sang out are you  hearts for sale back yet is anybody home and a man a little man with not much hair wearing glasses his hat in his hand stepped inside the office and stood beaming at both of them i have a piece of property he an- nounced with a slight bow that i should like to sell its that two acre piece known as the wilmington knoll im prepared to pay a five hundred dollar bonus if you can sell it for me for cash in ten days kay was in her chair had her hat off a filing card before her her pencil poised before he stopped talking and chris- chris had turned his back on the gentle- man and was deliberately walking out the door nphe little man gazed after him and then a looked back at her surprised in- digestion kay said pointing her pencil after him really the little man stared fasci- nated he gets these attacks every day right after lunch kay reeled on trying to look concerned as the sweet purring sound of chris new motor started up in the street he does the little man began to look alarmed now say i know a doc- tor- the wilmington knoll kay askeo sweetly just a minute lets look at the map but she stumbled a little as she got up her blood was still singing so loud her heart thudding so hard against her ribs that she couldnt see the map even when she stood before it when kay got home that night she passed tow-headed carrie evans coming out of the house as she went in she pulled off her hat and stuck it on the sur- prised carries head dont say i never gave you anything she said to the startled carrie and went on into the house the bottle of nail polish she handed over to her younger sister julie what struck you julie looked flabbergasted dont i have to swipe this color any more kay went to bed with a wet towel on her head ill never take a job like this again she told herself furiously let the office go to blazes let him marry sheila wayne let him rot if i wasnt born so darn con- scientious id quit now then she lost herself in the remembered ecstasy of his kiss it was the sound of her mothers tired footsteps in the hall that brought her back to reality that five hundred dollar bonus mr merrick would reward her if chris closed that deal she must see that they did it somehow next morning kay sat at her desk checking over a list of prospective buyers chris father had left them after a while she lifted her eyes and stared through the window at the cars as they flashed by on the boulevard she gazed dreamily for a moment at the tall palm trees behind them at the roll of green hills behind the palms marvelous spots for the rambling ranch house type of home oak-dotted land for the stately colonial tucked away alcoves for the artistic cottage type here was op- portunity here was business beautiful opportunity wonderful business and there was chris- where was chris she glanced at her wristwatch now why hadnt he shown up didnt he know she had been hired as a decoy to attract him to work she reached for the phone and dialed his number the phone rang and rang and rang she let it ring she even laid it on the desk and let it go on ringing a n hour after she finally hung up chris telephoned he was in the city he informed her by that time she had her little piece ready things had been happening-or were about to chris she told him mr jessup and his wife and his wifes mother will be here at one-thirtv to see the wilmington knoll you know them and they know you so they say i told them you would be here to show it to them will you sell it to them chris sweetheart said chris you sell it to them you get cockleburs in your socks sweetheart stories and be a go-cart to a couple of fat old women up a hill you wax eloquent and expound the beauties of nature to three dead pans and explain all about cesspools to the old sourpuss chris- lock up the office sweetheart and run along youll enjoy it but what are you doing chris who me he chuckled im down here writing a letter to sheila a horn tooted in front of the merrick real estate office kay looked out and there sat mr jessup at the wheel of a big black sedan in the back seat sat two large imposing looking women oh-oh said kay aloud gathering up her things she picked up the paper with the direc- tions written on it locked up the office and went out to the car im going to show you the property she announced brightly beaming at all of them then she met the hostile gaze of the two women in the back seat retreating she glanced uneasily at mr jessup he was leaning over to open the door for her he looked uncomfortable i thought mr merrick was coming he said kay braced herself a very important business matter came up mr merrick was detained in the city he was very sorry she tried to look as sorry as chris was supposed to have felt i like mr merrick very much mrs jessup leaned forward to remark pointedly as kay got in the front seat with mr jes- sup who was looking admiringly at her ankle i think mr merrick is such a fine young man yes said kay she closed the door as if she were hauling chris in beside her by the neck oh excuse me i didnt mean to slam it she said to the startled mr jessup whose eyes had jumped to her face she drew a deep breath just take the next street and turn to the right the four of them stood on wilmington knoll and looked down on the valley kay happened to look down iust then at the merrick real estate office on the boule- vard there were several cars parked in front of it the door was still closed but in the rear stood a group of men by the hitching post a tall figure in riding clothes stood beside a sorrel horse kays heart side-slipped chris chris and his horse- and he was supposed to be in the city on important business kay glanced quickly away mr jessup mopped his brow the wom- en puffed heavily now mrs jessup said wheezing a little isnt that mr merrick down there by that horse tay pretended not to hear its such a magnificent view she said waving her arm and theres always a breeze she turned her head avoiding the view of the officc and smiled brightly too much of a breeze i fear grunted mr jessups wifes mother groping for her fluttering silk scarf what do you think of it dear mr jessup asked his wife pretending not to see the wind whipping kays skirt above her knees lets go down said mrs jessup theres a cocklebur in my stocking its driving me crazy the automobiles were gone from in front of the office when kay got out of the jessup car you might as well go around and at least say hello to mr merrick roscoe hearts for sale advised mrs jessup mother and i will wait here she gave kay a curt nod and looked away kay dismissed walked up the path and let herself in the office mr jessup went around to the rear looking for chris in- side kay walked over and dropped into the chair behind her desk then she looked down and saw the package it was a nice fat blue-checked bag of roasted peanuts she resisted the impulse to hurl it through the window pulled open a draw- er dropped them m and shut it after a while the jessup car drove away and chris stood in the doorway well she said when she could speak your father gets home next week chum her voice was gay but tears of anger hurt humilation and disappointment spangled her lashes chris stood there much too tall for the door frame his head bent forward a little in his brown riding breeches his beige shirt open at the throat his blond hair ruffled by the breeze he looked like some- thing to pray for instead of swear at dont take it so hard sweetheart he grinned eat the peanuts chris she said evenly they liked you if you had gone up there with them you could have sold those two old women that whole range of hills they didnt like me i couldnt have sold them a gold brick for fifty cents so you admit it he said im sur- prised she stiffened just what do you mean admit what chris grinned at her behind his eyes she saw something he wasnt going to say that you couldnt have sold them a gold brick for fifty cents he told her then laughing he turned and went out she didnt know when he rode off on the horse well anyway that was the kind of a business person he thought she was she was there trying to make a business man out of him and she couldnt sell a gold brick for fifty cents she got out the bag of peanuts she munched them slowly  tay spent the rest of the afternoon --telephoning other prospects for the wilmington knoll but there was some- thing wrong with it for everybody too much cash too much wind on a knoll too much driveway to put in up to the house views get tiresome when you look at them for three hundred and sixty-five days there werent enough trees exhausting that list she began calling up persons interested in other properties some were out others not ready to make up their mind some said definitely no others had bought chris didnt come back to the office ready to go home kay dragged herself wearily out to her old jalopy she felt beaten depressed she had not done any of the things she had promised chris father she had failed the only really vital thing that had happened was that chris had kissed her and even that didnt mean anything he was in love with sheila wayne next morning when kay reached the office she found a note stuck in the door it was signed c smythe i saw that property last night you telephoned me about yesterday-that chicken farm down by the river im deciding this morning will give you a ring kays spirits lifted ah today was go- ing to be different it was at ten oclock mr smythe telephoned he had decided not to buy the property he had bought some stock in a horse ranch instead a gentle timid voice called next did they have any prospects yet for his prop- erty the wilmington knoll oh yes indeed kay braced herself several parties were very much interested in fact mr merrick practically-well- considered it sold a half hour later chris called to say he was in the city at the bank bank kay asked vaguely whats that chris chuckled chris she said will you please come out here and get to work i mean it chris sweetheart stories howll it be if i drop around later for a pep talk sweetheart he asked then well see what we need chris she said bitterly is a couple of salesmen you mean somebody who can sell a gold brick for fifty cents she hung up kay alone at her desk lifted her eyes from her work she saw a coupe parked at the curb it was light orchid color footsteps tripped along the walk then the door was pushed open a bit of pink fluff with wide blue eyes that fairly batted masara fringe at her hovered on the thres- hold like a cherub could vall tell me where i could find mistah christopher merrick im-she dimpled-sheila wayne kay grabbed her desk and hung on some one who looked like veronica lake maybe but surely not this powder puff that some ill wind had wafted off a dresser and blown in the door hes not in kay said in fact hes out of town kay stiffened out of the corner of her eye she saw chris long maroon convertible drawing up in front of the office directly behind the orchid coupe she felt rather than saw chris heave his big frame over the door and come swinging up the walk she heard a little squeal from sheila and she dropped back limply against her chair qheila chris exclaimed exultantly  he made a veritable dive for her it was shameless the way he seized her why sheila my pet he yelled when did you get in he half dragged half carried her over to his desk sat down and pulled her down on his knee well sheila sheila kay turned her back on them a stiff rigid formidable back honey why didnt you let me know chris coaxed this was followed by a long silence then kay cant you go somewhere else dont mind me kay said choking i only work here goodness gracious sheila cried does she really work here chris in this cute little old place oh i love it chris honey its just like you im so proud of you angel are you chris asked laughing yes i am then a whisper oh kays all right chris said out loud she just takes her job seriously thats all you know when kay was a baby sheila they never let her play never let her play sheilas voice was a wail no they didnt even give her a rattle they just taught her to shake her head and listen to her brains it was a great sound it fascinated her shes been listening to them ever since is that what shes doing now sheila asked the telephone on kays desk rang kay reached for it her fingers got it by the throat she strangled it chris merrick she said real es- state the voice that came over the wire made her heart leap she pressed the receiver tighter against her ear kay wheres that son of mine i just got in by plane called the house hes left he couldnt be working could he no said kay firmly nothing like that she paused trying to find the right words remember what you warned me against-that southern exposure well- that occupies attention at present what what are you talking about theres nothing i can do about it she went on sweetly you mean-you mean he fumed that that little nincompoop sheila wayne is there that hes with her yes she said even more sweetly i cant get him to sell or give it away at any price ill be right out there he stormed you just wait until i get there thank you kay purred well be glad to see you whenever you call at the office i am sure mr merrick will too she put down the phone she patted it then she reached in the drawer for the last of the peanuts hearts for sale titr merrick made it out in less time than kay believed possible he paid the cab driver waved him on to the house with his bags then he burst up the path and exploded in the door a man of action drive and apoplexy chris he thundered kay smiled she turned around in her chair to enjoy the scene chris was stand- ing the bit of fluff hovered beside him they both looked flustered and extremely uncomfortable well barked the older man where is she he seemed to catch himself hello blossom didnt expect to see you here wheres your mother when did you get in he looked around as if he ex- pected to see somebody emerge from some corner where is that sheila wayne who has been writing you those asinine

and run along like a good girl the old boys home now and i want to talk business he began shoving the dimpled blossom toward the dtfor when he finally had her through it he pulled it shut and locked it then strolled over to his own desk and began pulling papers out of his pockets and tossing them down exit blossom mudd alias sheila wayne he grinned sold the horse ranch to nolan the banker this

demanded two seconds later kay stared straight ahead he waited zombie he said isnt there she didnt move yes she said ha  she got up chris pulled her back down she said ha again but very differently halfway through the kiss her eyes flew wide open then they closed again fresh peanuts sang the man coming along the walk in front of them fresh peanuts fresh roasted peanuts but his best customer didnt hear him unexpected bridegroom by adelaide humphries sweet youll never un- derstand-all of a sud- den i was afraid o you ellen said shakily it was silly of her of course but all evening she had avoided dancing with carson-and he was aware of it when her eyes met his now and then she saw that he was angry his jaw set that glint in his eyes that warned her he could not be stalled off much longer her heart stirred under a soft sweet excitement and the color deepened in her face she was dancing with dick gordon when suddenly carson spoke at her elbow im cutting in gordon he said his tone daring dick or anyone else to argue that point unexpected bridegroom dick laughed and stepped back okay fella-put down that gun the gals all yours he registered mock terror yet there was respect in his attitude too men always respected carson youre darn right the girls mine said carson as dick moved away then for ellens ear alone and the sooner she real- izes that the better for all concerned its mid october and the garden is not at its best and its just my luck that there isnt even a skeleton of a moon but howd you like to go with me-look at me will you please and answer-to look at it just the same ellens heart was hammering queerly and her smoke-grey eyes were starry but she managed a littlelaugh and answered shak- ily the sun parlor would be cozier for a late october night dont you think the question is is it as secluded as the garden what i have to say to you re- quires the utmost quiet and privacy car- son warned her his tone still grim then the sun parlor is the solution ellen laughed and led the way the sun parlor had been carefully glassed in and was pleasantly warm gay with chintz and wicker bright with grow- ing plants in ivory-painted containers ellen turned to face carson laughing flushed trying to deny the mad sweet clamor of her pulses as she gave him a gay little bow the creamy lace of her gown sweeping about ruby-tinted slippers her shining dark head bowed so that the fra- grance of the gardenias tucked into the black curls above her ear swept up to him breathlessly does this please milord she asked with mocking gaiety its a beginning carson admitted cau- tiously and now see here whats all this nonsense about your avoiding me as though i had the measles or were a tax collector youve been dodging me very effectively all evening and ive had just about as much of it as im going to take ellen laughed but her smoky eyes could not quite meet his what nonsense she protested a trifle breathlessly im the hostess and ive got to see that my guests are being amused then youre slipping badly because this guest isnt amused at all carson told her grimly and put both hands on her shoulders turning her about so that the light fell full on her charming piquant face he asked quietly is it because im going into politics because if it is then ill step out of the mayoralty race before the cam- paign gets any hotter tjllen said breathlessly youd give that up when it means so much to you just because i might not like it and her hand went up to his where it gripped her shoulder theres nothing in the world i wouldnt give up if you asked me to he said with convincing simplicity i admit that the thought of being mayor and having a hand in cleaning up the politics of a city that my grandfather and yours and a lot of swell old pioneers fought to build means a great deal to me but not one millionth part as much as you do youre my heart darling youre the reason i was born and grew up youre the girl ive loved since i was a kid and that ive always wanted for my wife so whatever you say goes- always there were tears in ellens eyes and she swayed a little toward him as she whis- pered oh my dearest dear carson its like that with me too his arms closed about her and drew her hard against him he kissed her as though the touch of her mouth were cool crystal clear water and he were dying of thirst but after the first long enchanted moment he held her a little away from him and looked down at her frowning ellen if its like that why the blazes have you been giving me the bums rush all evening he demanded ellens laugh was soft shaky and she stammered sweet-youll never under- stand the weird and crazy things a girl in love feels you see all of a sudden i was afraid of you outraged indignant bewildered he re- peated that afraid of me well of all the-good heavens ellen im carson-re- sweetheart stories member the guy who used to carry your books to school for you and fight your bat- tles when you were a long-legged brat with hair ribbons and a temper that sizzled and youre afraid- i know it sounds idiotic she admitted but all of a sudden tonight while i was dressing-just in between two strokes of the hair brush-something in my heart said why you zany-youre in love with the man and darned if it wasnt true when i stopped and thought about it and then you came in with your usual air of the conquering hero-stop squirming darling of course you do-well anyway believe it or not there i stood and said to mvself all wide-eyed and everything why-car- sons a stranger i dont even know him and i was suddenly shy of you because i knew i loved you so much i was completely at your mercy i wasnt me any more i was yours oh darling dont laugh at me i know im a fool but i do love you so ter- ribly whos laughing demanded carson huskily his arms tightening about her for two cents id burst into tears right along with you because angel darling i love you too-so terribly much a fter that of course they lost track of time then after a little he asked her anxiously sure you dont mind my getting mixed up in politics its some- times a rather messy business and more than a little on the scandalous side you know oh but it shouldnt be darling and it wouldnt be if more men like you-young and able and courageous and with enough money of your own not to be tempted by the opportunities for graft-would get into it she protested eagerly if people who are willing to vote for just anybody would stop and think and vote only for people they could trust to handle their own per- sonal business affairs and if more respon- sible worthwhile citizens would run for of- fice as a public and civic duty politics could be cleaned up in no time it would have broken your grandfathers heart- mine too-to see a racketeer practically running this city everybody knows mike morelli is really the power behind all the political rottenness in this town yet nobody does anything about it carson kissed her moved by her eager- ness and her sincerity she was still in the circle of his arms for a long lovely mo- ment and then she stirred and said un- easily but its going to be dangerous dar- ling we both know mike morelli and his gang arent going to give up easily theyll fight with every crooked dirty weapon they can lay their hands on dont you worry about that dear carson answered confidently thats why ive insisted that our party give me a tick- et fairly bristling with young men who dont scare easily were all looking for- ward to a swell time cleaning up this town making it the sort of place well be proud to have our children live in deeply touched ellen clung to him a lit- tle more fiercely and hid her face against his shoulder because it would be too ut- terly silly to burst into tears just because she had suddenly realized a little how beau- tiful it would be to have a child that was hers and carsons later when the party was over and she was alone in her big comfortable room she sat for a long time making no move to go to bed she was fiercely glad now that she had kept her secret that cheap pitiful lit- tle secret that she had so nearly revealed to carson several times it would be easier to tell him to share the shame with him but it was a part of her punishment for the thing she had done that she must bear the ugly memory of that episode in secret only three people had known her father don hartlv and herself her lather and don were both dead and so the secret must forever remain locked in her heart it would hurt carson to knew it and telling him would serve no purpose whatever ex- cept to steal a bit of comfort for herself but that would be at the price of pain and shock to carson a price she was unwilling to exact rphe best people in crescent city flung themselves headlong into the city cam- unexpected bridegroom paign for civic cleanliness and decency once thoroughly aroused men and women who had turned up their socialite noses at the mere thought of politics were working industriously to defeat the notorious mor- elli machine and to put into office car- son shane and a hrtnd-picked group of courageous young men who had suddenly discovered politics was amazingly good sport ellens engagement to carson a surprise to nobody because they had been going about together since ellens return from a northern school two years ago had been announced shortly after carson had an- nounced himself as a candidate for mayor they were going to be married the day after election and as the honeymoon was to be spent at carsons hunt ing lodge on the carolina coast the problems of her trous- seau more or less adjusted themselves for ellen and she was free to put all her wak- ing moments into the business of helping carson gi himself elected to clean up cres- cent citys disgraceful political conditions a week before the election there was a banquet a crowded noisy affair held at crescent citys best hotel attended by two hundred or more of carsons supporters and campaign workers ellen as carsons fiancee was in the very thick of things at the speakers table beside carson she sat listening to the after-dinner speeches tired but keyed up by her excitement her eyes roamed the huge room passing from face to face of friends and acquaintances and then suddenly it seemed a though she had received a stunning blow between her wide incredulous eyes for across that crowded room she looked into a lean narrow weak- ly handsome face and blue eyes that met hers as though in cynical amusement her hands clenched beneath the table edge and every drop of color drained from her face leaving it paper-white beneath her light makeup she set her teeth against a dead- ly faintness that threatened her and for a moment closed her eyes it couldnt be possible it just couldnt be she told herself frantically fate couldnt play her so shabby a trick don hartley was dead he couldnt be here across the room grinning at her cynically she wet her lips with her tongue and forced herself to look again but now the seat where the man had been sitting was empty slowly painfully life came back to her sick stunned heart and the paralysis left her limbs what a fool she was she told herself shakily getting all wrought up be- cause of a fancied resemblance carson was saying swiftly whats wrong darling youre ill- she pulled herself together and smiled up at him with stiff lips im only tired she insisted and overcome by all the ex- citement carson did not fall for that excuse he said tm going to have old bill drive you straight home youve been working too hard you wont mind if i dont take you home-ive a conference certainly i mind she said i mind like the dickens but since i would marry the mayor knowing how important he is what can i do her attempted lightness was not entirely convincing and carson tucked his hand be- neath her arm drew her with him out to the sidewalk and put her into his car youre to drive miss mowbray home bill he told the smiling middle-aged negro who swung the door open and if vou dont drive carefully ill have vour life carson bent to kiss ellen not caring in the least that the sidewalk was thronged with amused but friendly spectators but as she lifted her head for his kiss ellens eyes saw beyond his shoulder the face of a man who stood a little to the left of the hotel entrance beyond all shadow of doubt the man was don hartley an evil shadow out of the past that brought her cheap tawdry little secret to ugly clamor- ous life once more the man smiled at her sardonically and lifted a finger to the brim of his hat in mocking recognition  ill as he swung the car away from the curb glimpsed her pallid face in the rear-view mirror and asked anxiously is anything wrong miss ellen wrong everything was going to pieces  sweetheart stories no no bill-im just tired thats all she stammered yessum-you been working mighty hard miss ellen said bill with the free- dom of an old and privileged servant whose familys affairs are his closest concern dis is de finest thing that ever happened to this town mr carson and them other gentle- mans going into politics this town got so bad honest folks wasnt safe to make a living or walk the streets after dark nothing must stop mr carsons being elected bill-nothing ellen burst out aint nothing going to miss ellen- don you worry about that bill answered comfortingly she said goodnight to him at the gate and hurried up the walk to the big com- fortable old white house where she had been born and had grown up and where she and aunt martha now lived as she let herself into the house she heard the clamor of the telephone in its closet beneath the stairs a cold hand clutched her heart as she lifted the receiver and said hello somehow she had felt it would be don a voice she had hoped never to hear again said lightly well darling-nice to hear your voice again no need to ask how you are i saw you at the banquet and youre more beautiful than ever she writhed beneath the memories that voice brought up and she couldnt have spoken if her life had depended on it after a moment that hated dreaded voice said sharply are you there ellen i-yes what-what do you want well thats more like it she heard his faint chuckle and her heart shook at the thought that once she had loved that easy chuckle don said i have to see you and at once its very important oh no no she couldnt have con- trolled the sick revulsion in her voice if her life had depended on it oh like that eh and now his voice was sharp threatening well thats just too bad because im going to see you whether you like it or not ill let you name the place but the time must be no later than ten oclock tomorrow morning she was silent a long moment sick and shaken then she said coldly but surely we have nothing to discuss thats your mistake darling don said and she shivered at the sound of that endearment in his hated voice well make it ten oclock tomorrow morning at the owls nest on the river road youre un- known there im sure and our interview can be entirely private but dont fail to be there darling or youll be mighty sor- ry tllen sat very still for a long moment with the dead telephone in her hand before she put it down and went slowly to her own room there she huddled face- down across the bed in the darkness and for one of the few times in five long years let herself go back in memory and the past came back whipping her with stinging lashes of shame and futile remorse she had been away at school and she had been barely seventeen it was a very strict old-fashioned school to which her mother and grandmother had gone so it had been taken as a matter of course that she should go there too she had met don hartley one afternoon when she and two other ven- turesome girls had broken bounds and sneaked off to the nearby town to see a show given by a cheap stock company don had been the leading man and his cheap rather florid good looks had made an enormous appeal to the excited girls she had believed herself madly in love with don he had seen the three girls and managed to meet them afterwards it had been the excited impressionable girl had believed a great romance there had been letters she had developed an amazing in- genuity at slipping away from school to be with him and her letters had been the silly innocently adoring letters that romantic school-girls write to good-looking actors when he had told her that the stock com- pany was disbanding and he was returning to new york she had been appalled and heartbroken they might never meet again he had told her sadly that was a thought she couldnt endure so when he very care- fully led up to the suggestion that she elope with him she didnt hesitate a moment unexpected bridegroom thats crazy talk im not wife i never was ellen sa perately they had been married by a fat tobacco-	was beginning to be a little frightened un- chewing justice of the peace in a little up-	easy that feeling grew when she and stale village his thin sour-faced wife and	don parked the roadster-which was hers a grinning hired man were the witnesses	-before the shabby old hotel and were and even by then some of the rosy glamour	shown upstairs by a grinning bellhop to of the elopement was vanishing ellen	the bridal chamber it had hideous red  sweetheart stories carpet a rickety brass bed a maple dresser sagging at an incredible angle because one of its casters was gone something about her smart striped luggage sitting chum- mily beside dons shabby battered pig- skin bag had sent terror to her heart she was tired and uneasy the excite- ment had waned and the romance was wearing a bit thin but she tried fran- tically to tell herself that she was madly in love with don of course she was and she was thrilled to bits at the thought of being his wife she had to be it was too late to be anything else she told herself as don caught her close in his arms and kissed her as he had never dared kiss her before his caressing too-eagcr hands frightened her yet she dared not protest after all he was her husband and this- this was her marriage she all but cried out in sharp relief when there came a peremptory knock at the door and don swearing let her go and opened the door a plump blond flashily made up wear- ing a sleazy satin dress-a woman whom ellen recognized with difficulty as the very amusing character woman in the stock company plays-thrust her way into the room the scene that followed sickened ellen because the frowsy blond was dons wife and she screamed shameful unprint- able epithets that made ellens flesh creep ellen remembered hearing don say sharply shut up you fool havent you brains enough to see what im after the kids old man is rich hes a millionaire hell pay plenty to hush this up and get her out of it without a scandal why the devil didnt you hold off until morning the blond looked startled her anger fading as she turned to ellen is that on the level she demanded sharply is your old man a millionaire no ellen said faintly from an abyss of shame and humiliation not anywhere near it theres only the income from a trust fund about five thousand a year even now five years afterward she burned at the memory of dons fury they hadnt tried to stop her when she had fled from the room and down to her roadster she telephoned her father from the next town and he came for her as he listened to her stammered tear-choked story he looked older tired and a little sick but he didnt reproach her he sent her north to a school where no one knew her and he made her promise that she would keep the secret of the elopement later he told her that don was dead he had found a newspaper story about the death of don hartley in a train wreck so far as she and her father were concerned the matter had been buried with the past and then her father died leaving her alone but for aunt martha she hadnt told carson it had seemed an insult to their love and that she could ever have imagined herself in love with don hartley now seemed incredible and that she had actually married him was in- tolerable she fell at last into a brief sleep of utter emotional exhaustion illen awoke in the morning to face the ordeal of her life she was thankful that she could drive her own car and that it was a roadster of an inexpensive make so that there were hundreds just like it in crescent city there wasnt much likeli- hood that anyone she knew would see her going to the notorious owls nest nor would her parked car outside that unsavory spot be recognized a stout bald-headed man wearing a soiled shirt and an even dirtier white apron was behind the bar when she went in with- out waiting for her to speak he jerked a thick thumb toward the stairs and said hes expectin you first door to the right her cheeks burned beneath the look in the stout mans eyes but she hurried past him and up the dingy stairs don was standing at the open door of the dingy pri- vate dining room and he did not speak as she came up the stairs he merely stood back grinning a little as she followed him into the room well he said then his eyes taking her in from the top of her smart little hat to the tips of her shining patent leather slip- unexpected bridegroom pers you have grown up havent you you were cute at seventeen-but youre beautiful now ellen said through her teeth why are you here what do you want of me his eyebrows went up and he said dryly just wont be friendly eh you want it the hard way ok then well get right down to business youre to have carson shane withdraw from the mayoralty race- at once she stared at him startled but thats out of the question-i wont do it oh yes you will or ill have to enter suit for divorce and name him as co-re- spondent said don quietly his eyes never leaving hers perhaps a little suit for alienation of affections too might net me a few pennies ellen laid a shaking hand on the edge of the table supporting her trembling body against it her eyes met his with a wide stunned gaze there was a terrible convic- tion about his words a conviction she fought wildly with stammered words thats crazy talk im not your wife-i never was you were already married he grinned at her that was your lit- tle mistake darling he explained very foolish of you to accept her statement without proof the blond was not my wife -wed never been married-so your mar- riage to me was legal and quite binding incidentally it still is of course rthe room spun about her and ellen thought she was going to faint only she mustnt faint she warned herself she set her teeth hard in her lower lip and after a moment she could stammer faintly i dont believe you youre lying i have all the proof required he said at the proper time i shall present that proof with your letters and all the rest of it that is if youre going to be stub- born and make that necessary she could no longer doubt what he was saying there was an inescapable air of conviction about him she was still this mans wife his wife she shivered studying her don sensed the exact mo- ment when she reluctantly began to believe that he was speaking the truth and he went on briskly there are certain people here in town who do not want to see your boy friend elected mayor if he withdraws now the entire ticket of young crusaders will collapse and the opposition candidate will be elected by a landslide which is exactly the way certain-er-friends of mine want it to be now there are two ways for shane to pull out he can do it willingly because you ask it of him hes pretty crazy about you and hed do it if he knew that by pull- ing out he could save you from a rather messy scandal and himself from a suit the second way is for you to be stubborn then ill go to the oppositions newspapers with my story and file my suit immediately you know as well as i do that the better element of the town-the church crowd the womens clubs the civic organizations who are backing shane-will be horrified to learn that he has been running around with a married woman whose husband has at last caught up with him well-whats it going to be ellens throat ached speech was beyond her everything don had said was so hid- eously true carson would withdraw is she asked him and scandal and gossip would inevitably bring a wave of reaction against him that would defeat him desolation swept over her as she faced the ugly inescapable truth to ask carson to sacrifice his political career for which they both had held such high hopes-to ask him to forego the chance to rid the town of mike morelli and his infamous gang-to make it easy for that gang to go on bleed- ing the city terrifying the people- yet if she didnt ask carson to withdraw both he and she would go down in the scandal don threatened she straightened after a long moment and said huskily youll have to give me a little time to decide to think dons face twisted unpleasantly theres not a heck of a lot of time left he remind- ed her grimly the election is next tues- day but ill give you twenty-four hours be here tomorrow morning at ten and remember i hold all the winning cards so dont try any funny business sweetheart stories she turned from him without a word and went down the stairs and out to her car she remembered nothing of the drive back to town morellis plot-for undoubtedly if was his plot-hinged on her closeness to carson the whole thing was aimed at her the whole force of its attack was that car- son loved her so carson was to be de- feated by the girl he loved by her ellen mowbray she wasnt conscious of the thought processes by which she reached her decision dimly in the back of her mind and in the aching depths of her heart she had known that devision was inevitable there was nothing else she could do she stopped her car in front of a drug store that bore the familiar blue and white telephone sign first she telephoned car- son grateful for the shelter of the booth that concealed her tears  darling she said when she heard car- son s voice youve got to trust me im going to do something that will hurt you terribly for a little while-maybe for a long time but you must believe that  love you and that there isnt anything else i can do its the only way- oh darling darling she put down the receiver against car- sons frantic questions she stood for a moment clinging to the telephone trying to master her emotions and then she lifted the receiver again and called crescent citys foremost newspaper the one that was backing carsons cam- paign to the hilt is this the city editor she asked surprised that her voice could sound so steady so calm this is ellen mowbray if you will send a reporter out to my house i have a story for him if youll tell him to hurry it will still be a scoop the other papers wont know about it until-ten oclock tomorrow morning rjphe afternoon paper came out with an -- extra shortly after noon an extra that screamed aloud the fact that ellen mow- bray daughter of one of the citys pioneer families and engaged to carson shane was announcing that she had been married for almost five years the news hit the town with a stunning force ellen had given the story whatever glamor she could a runaway marriage a lovers quarrel two people in love but both too stubborn to admit it the marriage a secret her own return to school sup- posedly authentic information of the bride- grooms death the secret bride locking the whole story deep in her heart-and now their unexpected meeting the discovery that their love burned as brightly as ever and this belated announcement of their marriage less than an hour alter that extra hit the streets ellen was locked in her own room refusing to answer the telephone to talk to anybody denying herself even to carson who of course was at the house within a few minutes of that incredible ex- tra ellen let aunt martha come in an aunt martha who was pale and stern well you can come out of hiding she said grimly though i must say i dont blame you a more shameful affair ive never known but hes here downstairs and it looks as though hed come to stay ellen turned a white ravaged face and tortured smoky eyes to aunt martha he she repeated but even as she spoke she knew and her heart seemed to die a little more your-devoted bridegroom said aunt martha and there were anger and contempt and a deep burning hurt in her voice hes brought his baggage with him-if you can call a battered ok valise baggage ellen had a moment of panic oh aunt martha-send him away get rid of him  aunt martha with no hint of softening detached ellens clutching hands and stood back with the gesture of one who washes her hands of an unpleasant situation ill have nothing to do with the affair or with him she said sternly youve dis- graced your whole family-treating a fine man like carson shane the way you have you ought to be ashamed of yourself-but unless i miss my guess youll pay for it many times over before youre through playing fast and loose with carson i think youll find everybody feels just as i do about it unexpected bridegroom she went out and closed the door firmly behind her tllex sat still for a long stunned mo- ment she had not thought of that- that people would think she had been mak- ing a fool of carson getting herself en- gaged to him while she was still uncertain whether or not she was free people would argue that there must have been something shameful about her marriage or there would have been no reason for keeping it so secret she heard footsteps on the stairs then a knock at her door she stared at the closed door bereft of speech after a moment of waiting the door opened and don stepped into the room ellen cringed a little from the look in his eyes as they swept over her and don laughed i got tired of waiting for you to come down and the old battle-axe told me this was your room- he announced casually i have to admit darling that you just about threw me for a loop when you an- nounced our marriage it was frankly about the last thing i expected you to do- and of course morelli is raving like a mad- man ellen pulled herself together with an ef- fort and said shortly why did you come here i mean-you cant stay here no and where else would a devoted husband stay except with the wife whom hes found after all these desolate years he demanded a triumph and insolence in his voice frankly darling i was tickled to death to find that you still loved me- i dont-i dont she cried wildly a cruel gleam dawned in his eyes for a moment and he said smoothly oh then it was just what morelli thought-an at- tempted doublecross ellen caught her breath and stared at him fearfully don went on after a moment of course with the story you have already giv- en the newspapers my suit for a divorce and alienation of affections would be just twice as effective against shane morelli thought of that right away ellens heart turned to ice she was as much in their power as ever she had given them still another weapon with which to strike at carson and once again there was only one way out she drew a long hard breath pulled her slender body erect and said thinly i see you expect to stay here to be taken care of-or else carson will be wrecked thats putting it bluntly don admit- ted entirely without shame but frank- ly darling the worlds been pretty tough sledding of recent years you have a very comfortable home here-whats more nat- ural than that your husband should share it with you and why cant we make a go of things after all you were in love with me- ellen said swiftly i loved you five years ago or thought i did but this is today i see said don with the air of one who wishes to be fair well darling well dispense with love and all that for the pres- ent and now suppose you have my lug- gage sent up to whatever cubbyhole a not- too-welcome husband is to be assigned ellen stood still for a long moment but there was no fight left in her she was beaten there was only one faint and lone- ly shred of comfort through her present misery and pain she had saved carson from defeat ton was established in a comfortable room across the hall the mad incred- ible afternoon finally waned the storm of telephone calls died down aunt mar- tha tight-lipped stern with disapproval had been persuaded not to carry out her bitterly expressed intention of leaving in- stantly for a spot in the old ladies home the two elderly servants who had known and served ellen since childhood had looked wth lowering sullen faces upon don and dismissed him openly despising him dinner was a very strained and unhappy meal don came down to it freshly shaven neatly brushed but the moment he stepped into the living room he set the pattern of the days that were to come ill have to apologize for my shabbi- ness he said airily heedless of aunt mar-  sweetheart stories thas stem and outraged disapproval im afraid ive grown careless about clothes- but now that i have found my bride again things will be different i daresay you have accounts in town darling ill run down and do a bit of shopping tomorrow aunt martha bit back stinging words ellen dropped shamed eyes and set her teeth old dennis came to the door to an- nounce dinner but before he could do so the front door never locked swung open and carson came in his face white and grim and set his eyes angry and bewil- dered ellen caught her breath on a gasp of shock and dismay aunt martha folded her hands and looked self-righteous and don surveyed carson with a smile in which there was obvious malice ah shane glad to meet you  said don holding out his hand ive seen you about of course and heard some fine things about you awfully decent of you to call and con- gratulate us carson looked him carefully over from head to foot ignoring the outstretched hand turning away from him without a word he said to ellen what the devil is this all about theres something suspi- cious and smelly about the whole affair i dont believe you were ever married to this man- would you care to see complete proof don cut in savagely furious at carsons manner still ignoring him carson said to ellen you can tell me you are married to him and you can tell me that youve finished with me but you cant tell me that you dont love me for i know better- see here shane you cant talk to my wife like that don snapped shouldering his way between them and carson as though the thin edge of his self-control had required only that to snap them drew back and planted his clenched fist beneath the point of dons jaw don sprawled heavily backward among the wreckage of a small table laden with some of aunt marthas most cherished bric-a-brac good boy carson  aunt martha cried joyously ive been dying to do that all afternoon  carson looked down at ellen and she had to set her teeth hard in her lower lip to control its trembling she could not tear her eyes from his stern bewildered gaze though her own eyes filled with tears carson said suddenly huskily sorry darling turned on his heel and strode out of the house sure that he was gone don got to his feet cursing viciously in the doorway old dennis his eyes dancing with glee managed to keep his face straight and said happily dinner am served don glared at the old man but dennis looked blandly back at him and don knew with a helpless fury that the servant was rejoicing over carsons blow and the swell- ing bruise on dons jaw ellen dared not meet aunt marthas eyes instead she turned and led the way without a word to the dining room tn the morning it was a vast relief to both ellen and aunt martha when don elected to have his breakfast in bed across the breakfast table sunshiny with a bright cloth and yellow pottery they looked at each other in ellens eyes a dumb stricken plea in aunt marthas an angry helpless bewilderment and stern disapproval ive been making a list ellen will you do the telephoning or shall i asked aunt martha when dennis had served breakfast and the swinging pantry door had closed behind him ellen looked up startled a list tele- phoning about what aunt martha snorted hasnt it oc- curred to you yet that youve got to intro- duce your friends to this-this prize-pack- age of a husband youve suddenly dug up that is if youve got any friends left after the scandalous way you behaved about the whole business ellen stared at her stricken i thought a reception would solve the problem nicely aunt martha went on grimly though how ill manage to stand beside that-that creature and not kick him soundly is more than i can see unexpected bridegroom ellen cried sharply a reception oh no aunt martha i couldnt i just couldnt dont be an idiot snapped aunt mar- tha her nerves on edge see here ellen cant you realize what a hornets nest youve pulled down about your ears by sud- denly producing this gigolo and announcing blandly that youve been married to him five years meanwhile youve been going around with carson your engagement to him announced your trousseau bought- even the church and the minister and the honeymoon arranged had you stopped to realize that the spare room is already filling with wedding presents meant for you and carson that the decorators have almost finished with the bungalow carson bought and is preparing for you and then all of a sudden without a moments warning like-like a third-rate vaudeville magician reaching for a white rabbit you drag a sleazy thing like don hartley out of nowhere and say blandly oh i forgot- ive already got a husband i just mis- laid him a few years ago  ellen listened panic in her eyes she could not deny the truth of her aunts vig- orous words whereupon aunt martha went on just as vigorously youre a beautiful girl and popular it stands to reason youve got enemies-people who have been jealous and resentful of your beauty and your popularity-jealous perhaps most of all of carsons love for you dont you realize they are going to pounce on this story with great glee and tear you to pieces theyll ask questions and find their own answers-and you can rest assured that the answers will be to your discredit the only thing left for you to do is carry your head high behave as though you were madly in love with the silly vicious man and give the lie by your boldness and frankness to all the scandalous stories therefore youve got to have a reception to introduce your once-upon-a-time friends to your hus- band now lets hear no more nonsense on the subject  tllen was on her feet trembling her face as white as the crisp collar of her print morning frock her eyes wade and tragic i cant do it aunt martha it doesnt matter what people are saying i just cant go through with that she cried wildly aunt martha eyed her without a hint of relenting of course she said grimly im only a crazy old woman without much sense but after all i brought you up from childhood and im damn fond of you a blind deaf and dumb man could see there was something terribly wrong with this all- of-a-sudden marriage business maybe if you cared to tell me about it we could find a way out for a moment ellen was tense terribly tempted to confide in aunt martha to tell her of dons threat inspired by morelli and of her desperate attempt to keep car- son from being hurt by her own youthful folly but she set her teeth hard in her lower lip knowing that she dared not trust aunt martha who adored carson and de- spised don and might impulsively and un- der the spur of her emotions betray the truth to carson he of course would in- stantly withdraw from the race-and that wouldnt help no it was her own trouble and she had to fight it out alone she drew a long breath and said with a forced quiet im sorry darling but i cant tell you not now later perhaps but i can tell you that immediately after the election don will be going away and then i can get a divorce aunt martha said something but ellen didnt wait to hear what it was instead she sped out of the dining room and toward her own room but at the foot of the stairs she came face to face with don wearing a shabby bathrobe and grinning at her with an expression that told her he had heard at least a part of her talk with aunt martha he jerked his head toward the closed dining room door and said so low that it reached only her ears i heard that little crack about my going away immediately after election sorry my dear but youre quite wrong about that i like it here a trifle dull of course but the old place is quite comfortable and the food is wonder-  sweetheart stories ful i think youll find it hard to divorce the model husband i shall become for ill see to it that you have no grounds what- ever for a divorce ellen felt that she could stand no more tears were near the surface and it went distinctly against the grain to burst into tears before an enemy so she thrust her way past him and achieved the quiet and seclusion of her own room she had had a little fear that it might not be easy to rid herself of don once the election was over and carson safe from anything morelli and his gang could do to block his campagin to clean up the city but she had not dared face that fear she had tried to put the thought behind her- to deny it but don had brought it to the front and crystallized it from an uneasy fear to a definite threat she had put her- self completely in his power in her impul- sive frantic effort to save carson ellen steadfastly refused to permit the reception aunt martha insisted was strictly necessary if she was ever to hold up her head again against the storm of whispers and dark ugly gossip and questions that swept the town on the heels of her sudden wedding announcement she knew that aunt martha was right that she was being talked about always to her discredit friends and acquaintances either avoided meeting her the few times she went out or else cornered were distinctly cool and frankly hostile yet she could take what scant comfort was possible from the thought that their hostility toward her had caused a further reaction of sympathy for carson and insured his election on election night she settled herself at the radio in the living room immediately after dinner and was oblivious to every- thing save the election bulletins coming in every little while when aunt martha who clashed with don almost every time they were in the room together went to bed in helpless fury about ten don settled him- self across the room from ellen with a new york newspaper from the first bulletins that came in carsons victory seemed assured shortly after midnight the morelli-backed opposi- tion conceded the victory and the radio fairly rocked with the noise of carsons enthusiastic supporters there was a mo- mentary confusion and then the announcer said briskly ladies and gentlemen we will now hear a few words from carson shane the mayor-elect mr shane ttllen sat tense and still listening her heart going out wordlessly to the man she loved but had deliberately hurt ladies and gentlemen said carson and ellen who knew him and loved him so well knew that he was tired nervous keyed up to an unusual pitch i want to thank you for what you have done for me for the hard work youve done but most of all for your confidence in me i am deeply grateful to you all-but if you dont mind i am going to confess that i feel my thanks-and yours too if you will-are due most of all to the self-sacrifice of some- one who is not here someone who had she not made that great sacrifice could have cost me the election-though she should know that no election no honor or privilege could ever mean enough to me to justify the thing she has done i am as you must all of you know referring to miss ellen mowbray ellen sat perfectly still rigid and white unable to think she heard the little con- fusion of voices that greeted her name there in the down-town hotel a great many of you have known miss mowbray almost all her life carson went on a little grimly you have been sup- posedly her friends-some of you her ad- mirers yet when a few days ago she ad- mitted to the newspapers that she had been married for five years to a man whom none of us had ever seen before and that for reasons which seemed good to her she had kept the marriage secret-then i say you one and all swung around and decided that there must be something outrageous some- thing scandalous back of her behavior all these years even i who love her more than anything in the world and should have trusted her implicitly refusing to be- lieve there could be a shameful thought in her heart or her lovely head-even i be- unexpected bridegroom lieved for a little that she had betrayed me as well as herself say what the blazes ails that guy whats he after ellen was startled out of her rigid ab- sorption by dons angry snarl -learned less than an hour ago car- son was saying when ellen once more caught his voice that miss mowbrays alleged marriage was not legal because at the time it was performed hartley was al- ready married to another woman he had believed the mowbiays a wealthy family and counted on a huge slice of money to keep the scandal of the elopement a secret when he discovered that the mowbravs were unable to pay the amount he demand- ed and with the authorities closing in on him for some of his more minor crimes he managed to disappear in such a manner as to convince the mowbravs that he had been killed in a train wreck along with other members of a road show the crowd in the hotel banquet room were so still that carsons voice seemed to reverberate in that stillness carson went on after a moment some- how hartley discovered the mowbray resi- dence undoubtedly he has kept track of the girl whose life he might have ruined but for the arrival after the elopement of his wife he came here intending to blackmail the girl but he fell in with some of the morelli crowd and became their tool his threat was that unless i withdrew from this campaign her reputation and my own would be destroyed-a threat that could only be effective to a girl like ellen deeply and sincerely in love and willing to make any sacrifice for the man she had intended to marry and so she revealed herself to you whom she believed her friends as the wife of a man who is wanted by the law in various states for various crimes chief among them forgery bigamy and fraud so i think that to ellen mowbray goes most of the credit for the defeat of the notorious morelli machine- on snapped off the radio and turned on ellen raging i ought to break your neck for this you doublecrossing- he was badly frightened she saw he turned for the door intent only on flight but as he jerked open the door two men stepped into the room both armed and both with the unmistakable look of officers despite the fact that they were not uni- formed it was then that ellen fainted when she became conscious of what was going on about her carson knelt beside her his arms around her and aunt martha was anxiously chafing her wrists shes coming around aunt martha said carson in keen relief shes all right though she ought to be spanked within an inch of her life for not trusting us enough to confiide in us she certainly should said aunt mar- tha warmly carson looked into ellens eyes and said curiously angel face didnt you know that was what a fiance was for-to give a girl a helping hand when things began to cloud up ellen drew a shivery breath and for a moment hid her face behind her hands how-how did you know she asked one of morellis mob came to me when he saw how the election was going and wanted to be taken care of after i got in office and to prove his good intentions of serving me he spilled the whole story and it was easy enough for me to accept the proofs he offered because ive known almost since the first that there was something wrong in back of the whole incredible busi- ness and that none of it was your fault then-im not really his wife of course not darling-and you never were carson said tenderly youre to forget every bit of it it never happened it was just a bad dream and the first thing tomorrow morning you and i are go- ing to be married- ellen said uncertainly im-im a no- torious woman now can our mayor afford a notorious wife carsons arms tightened about her if youre notorious then thats the only kind of wife this mayor wants he said and the ardor and tenderness of his kiss gave her the deep thrill of the happiness she had never expected to know again  ol sdventure jathryn keete e marcia curled her feet under her in the huge tapestry chair and watched her older sister isabel dip her long fingers into the jar of mud pack this date must be important if the hours of preparation were any gauge isa- bels face wore a greenish grey mask under a turkish towel when the phone rang without moving her lips isabel breathed you answer it pretend youre me this stuff is beginning to sting marcia swung down her slim legs this was an old ritual to her no one could distinguish between their voices she wished with a regretful sigh their physical differences were less apparent they were the same height but isabel had an arrest- ing walk that turned heads her clothes were ultra sophisticated and her hair was a halo of golden curls which earned her the nickname of honey beside her marcia was a colorless shadow her light-haired prettiness obscured her wide dark eyes too big for her white oval face she disdained lipstick and eye shadow all the little deft artifices isabel revelled in because isabel invariably kissed her and said softly you are sweet just as you are kid one glamor girl is enough in this family the telephone in the hall jangled in- sistently and marcia picked up the re- ceiver a voice out of the past said honey this is steve carradine remember this is a ship-to-shore call so ill have to be snappy honey darling it was good of you to come steve whispered brokenly the gallant adventure steve her voice broke over his name just as her heart had broken a year ago honey are you there the urgency of his tone leaped at her she steadied her heart and said slowly yes this is honey oh steve how are you not so hot ive been wounded in hawaii and the hospital ship is steaming into los angeles harbor you told me once if i ever came back youd meet me remember she spoke for isabel yes i remem- ber his voice wobbled but maybe it was the connection will you honey its frightfully important i just want to touch you marcia could hear isabels slippers pad- ding over the polished floor she cupped her hand over the mouthpiece and whis- pered its steve carradine his ship is com- ing into los angeles he wants you to meet him vo no isabel forgot her clay  pack little cracks spread from her mouth tell him i cant tell him i died tell him anything but i cant be there isabel waved her hands in a frantic denial in marcias other ear steves hesitant tones said its all right honey if you cant for some reason tears blurred her eyes and she dashed them away impatiently she sang id like to see anybody keep me away after the connection was broken she thought how cruel she had been steve would build up his dreams of isabel at the gangplank the wind tumbling her fair hair her eyes full of promises and what would he find marcia almost lost in the crowd fibbing that isabel was out of town that she was going to be terribly unhappy be- cause she had missed his call although the lies would be glib enough they would not be convincing because marcia had re- peated them too frequently to any suitor that isabel was evading at the moment  marcia followed isabel into the bath- room and sat on the edge of the tub while she impatiently splashed water on her face isabel snapped now dont start work- ing out on me hes been injured well im sorry of course but i cant meet him ive a weekend party you knew that you had no right to promise so just get out of it the best you can without speaking marcia rose and slammed the bathroom door you didnt argue with isabel you just did what she said but the defiant noise of that banging door relieved her mounting tension in her room marcia poked about her closet she wore her new tan gabardine suit not that steve would notice and a wide cart- wheel hat with a streamer that made  her sixteen instead of eighteen she thought back over her last glimpse of steve the big hulk of his body his smooth black hair and the incredibly long lashes which shaded his blue eyes she remembered his mouth best it was grave contradicting all the happy-go-lucky charm of his face he had been rushing isabel to death and marcia then sixteen adored him steve treated her like a playful puppy he brought isabel orchids and marcia candy he gave isabel his mothers old-fashioned diamond ring and to marcia a ridiculously big rag-doll to sit on her bed when isabel hedged at setting a date for the wedding he flung out of the house in a rage hard jawed grim-lipped and enlisted in the army he avoided them like the plague they heard he was trans- ferred to hawaii after a time thick fat letters came for isabel picture post cards for marcia and then nothing for either of them now steve was coming home the dock was jammed and the boat was in the gangplank had been lowered but no one had yet descended the waiting lines of ambulances sent a wave of panic through marcia steve said he was wound- ed his voice on the phone had sounded anything but weak sweetheart stories and then the soldiers came down in an eager rush their bandages white medals serious faces laughing faces all but steve marcias heart rocked that meant he would come down on a stretcher she saw him then apart from the rest at the top of the gangplank he turned his head from side to side searching for isabel marcias eyes stung what could she say to him he gripped the rope railing at both sides each cautious downward step echoed in her slowly throbbing heart marcia didnt realize she was pushing her way through the crowd she didnt know the tears were running down her cheeks she refused to face the dreadful certainty of it then she heard a blue-caped nurse say calmly one more step sir then youll be all right she had to face it steve was blind those laughing blue eyes gazing into the crowd were sightless the horror of it made her dig her clenched fists against her mouth to stifle the bitter moan marcia forgot that she was going to ex- plain about isabel she flung herself into his arms crying steve steve the most beautiful smile in the world touched his lips he gathered her close against the rough khaki of his jacket she could sense the frantic shaken beating of his heart or was it her own he whispered brokenly honey honey it was good of you to come some of marcia died then to him she was isabel honey words trembled on her lips to correct him and then she couldnt utter them others were coming down the gangplank and she withdrew from steves arms guid- ing him out of the way but she held tight to his hand its warm pressure giving her courage to say steve is there somewhere you must report he smiled not today with quiet decisiveness she said im taking you home the crowd parted to let the slender wide-eyed girl and her soldier through no one thought he was blind his eyes were clear blue and if she led him very care- fully there might be moments when steve would forget too in the taxi steve referred to his injury with a rueful smile the doctors say this blindness wont be permanent the optic nerve isnt shat- tered but the blow my skull took i won- der that it wasnt i have to go to the hospital every day for examination in fact i am supposed to live there the words came out slowly painfully and for a fleeting instant he looked desolate marcia caught his hand and rubbed it against her cheek you wouldnt like that no if i were ill or if there was some physical disability i could stand it but to go groping around in the dark- his face grew tortured i tell you its been hell honey titarcia thought desperately if isabel could see steve shed forget her week- end party isabel has a heart- under that smooth surface steve reached it once aloud she said then well only go to the hospital on the appointed hours youll live home with us ill be your eyes until you get back your own darling  steves outstretched arms sought her and she slipped into their circle as if she belonged there his head bent seeking her lips it was she who kissed him giving him all the warm love that had been stored in her heart he dragged her to him in a hard hurting grasp and she clung to him kissing him terribly over and over because she knew she dared not do this ever again when steve lifted his head his mouth was stern his straight brows were frown- ing is it pity honey i couldnt stand that i love you steve no matter what you do no matter what you are there was no doubting her sincerity his face cleared if i werent sure this blindness will pass i wouldnt take your love i wouldnt take it for one minute her faintly husky voice said i know you wouldnt thats why i am going to get you settled at home where there are  the gallant adventure things you remember that old antlered hat-rack the hall has been done over but we couldnt part with that he threw back his head and laughed some of the tension in marcia eased she was doing the right thing even if isabel was dubious and refused at first to fall in with her plans she would have to recog- nize the logic of surrounding steve with love and tenderness and understanding steve was saying i remember that fireplace where the flue wouldnt work for anyone but marcia her heart stood still she moistened her lips with her tongue to say something re- assuring like good old marcia or sweet kid isabels pet expressions but they wouldnt come out steve turned his head toward her is she still a gangling kid long legs and big eyes does she still mother stray kittens and cry in the movies so thats what he thought of her just a silly kid with an effort she said coldly marcia hasnt changed -good im anxious to buy her one of our double sodas he didnt notice her wince though his arm rested across her shoulder he traced her nose with a brown finger they tell me you get a sixth sense in your finger- tips i havent so far i know you are honey by your voice and your straight little nose your kiss is different but then you were always ducking my kisses and keeping me at arms length so i didnt get to know them very well her breath was a sob oh steve i- he gave her a swift smile i know your kisses now ive thought about them dreamed about them ive even fought a fresh non-comm in hawaii over them the war does funny things thats the first time you ever kissed me she longed to cry thats the first time i ever dared she drew a deep shuddering breath if they would only get to the house isabel would take over this situa- tion that was getting out of bounds isa- bel was expert on kisses she didnt reveal the agony of her heart with her lips and that would be the only way steve would be able to detect the difference between them in his present darkness steve was leaning forward eagerly a challenging smile lighting his face waiting for her mouth to come down on his again it was the hardest task in the world to deny him to deny herself the very touch of his hands sent her pulses leaping she forced a gay laugh greedy this is a public conveyance but there was no laughter in her wide dark eyes there was fear and panic these were isabels kisses she was taking so high-handedly this was isabels steve if he ever learned that gangling kid of a marcia had imposed upon his sightlessness if he ever thought he had revealed to her the hidden despera- tion of the black trip home on a hospital ship he would be furious he would hate her he would consider her beneath con- tempt the taxi drew up at the old white frame house she was glad steve couldnt see the peeling paint mounting expenses isabels clothes her own schooling had tightened their income to the snapping point steves steps were firm on the flagstone path he climbed the three steps as if he remembered them his curved clean-cut mouth ifted in a grin ill bet marcias hockey stick is parked in this corner she said coolly marcia is going in for tennis this year marcia put steve into the big tapestry chair with a cigarette in one hand and an ash tray in the other and started toward the kitchen isabel had stopped wearing steves ring months back but she had never returned it it was in a box in her top drawer at the doorway marcia paused her heart cold and shriveled im going to prepare dinner a steak some of the things you like best do you remember the first dinner you had here he thought a minute i cant recall what it was exactly but i remember mar- cia cooked it she was majoring in domes- tic science she cried because the steak was burnt and the potatoes hard as bul- sweetheart stories lets but i ate every last scrap of it and dried her tears on my napkin she stoood mute her pulses quickening that he remembered there would be no burnt offerings this time it would be perfect isabel was probably lying down but the savory odor of coffee would awaken her marcias throat thickened with fright isabel would be furious when she found steve in their library she would lash out in resentment at a spoiled weekend party with tip mal- lorys crowd but when she saw steve her anger would curl up around the edges and she would play her part like a thorough- bred and steve was too new to blindness to sense the pity perhaps marcia was wrong in believing isabel no longer loved him reckless careless her constant dates might only be covering the fact she still carried the torch for steve carradine marcia built up a beautiful picture of isabel flinging herself into steves arms his tanned face aglow with love only to have it shattered by one small white note on the chipped poreclain table in the kitchen a note that said in isabels perfectly formed letters tip has picked me up may be gone all week tell steve hello for me and better shooting next time iss marcia covered her face with her hands and her shoulders shook uncontrollably she had depended on isabel she couldnt go out to steve lax in that big chair with the smoke curling about his black hair and say pm marcia the gangling kid ive pretended to be isabel hoping every- thing would be fixed up between you but isabel is off on a date with tip mallory of the shipyard mallorys she couldnt say that she couldnt say my heart is dripping tears because now is the time you want the one you love she could only stand there dry-eyed staring bleakly at the green grass the first early spring flowers budding and sweet and know steve could see nothing at all and then she heard his stumbling step saw his hand groping for the doorway and her heart turned over within her his palms grasping her shoulders sent an over- whelming emotion tumbling through her there was a forced sternness on his brow i found you by instinct for lord knows i dont smell any steak what kind of a mess hall is this in a lightning flash she knew she would keep up this pretense until he saw with his own eyes she was marcia and when he put her from him in repulsion she would have this memory to cling to his arms his lips the thought of helping him through this darkest hour and this was the time to make him depend on himself her voice held a lilt youll eat when youve earned your keep in the right hand drawer is a cloth in the left is silver she led him ever so gently to the cabinet he was amazed when he found forks and knives he said astounded youre not a seeing-eye dog by chance his hand touseled her hair she said softly im a seeing heart steve swiftly he swung around his arms went out to her and with shameless im- petuosity her young eager mouth was close to his at the moment she felt no dishonor in accepting kisses meant for isabel she felt only the desire tingling their pulses leaping through their blood she gave him the sweetness of her lips gave it gladly freely they ate before the fire the fire that only marcia could coax into flame the steak was rare and the little potatoes dotted with parsley and butter there were beaten biscuits and a tart salad across the table steve beamed marcia has been teaching you to cook again all the warmth inside her chilled her position was so precarious a slip of the tongue and steve would suspect as his fingers acquired that sixth sense his mind would become keener he would puzzle over little things inconsequential phrases and string them together  the gallant adventure later she sat at his feet with her head against his knee watching the ribbons of flames only half conscious of his voice crazily she built castles steve and she married their house their own particular heaven this shining moment she would always have so long as she lived steve talked of his school days his college career the time as a boy of seven he was ill for months with typhoid in a hospital it had made a tremendous impression on that small lad he was wound up as if deep within him was a coil of words that ached to be said far into the night when the fire had died down to a dark red ember marcia decided then on no half way meas- ures she would be isabel she would wear steves ring she would be everything that he desired and when steve could see again -she gave a long shuddering sob steves head jerked up are you crying honey the pain about his mouth ter- rified her the little pulse in her throat was ham- mering frantically it took all her self control to say quietly i wasnt crying steve i cried when you went away i cried when we heard of pearl harbor and i didnt know about you im not crying now maybe i was yawning darling we ought to go to bed marcia put steve in the guest room she turned down his bed chattering nervously while he smoked a final cigarette in the chintz chair by the window she clicked off the light and crossed the hall to her own room her heart ravaged with pain her ears strained to steves movements he stumbled once and swore softly then he chuckled as he got into bed and called goodnight honey she couldnt sleep she could only go over in her mind each hurting memory knowing she would not have changed one step in the morning she put the haunting ghosts of worry and fear from her she knocked on steves door carrying his breakfast tray he was fully dressed he smiled delightedly this is the first time ive gotten my clothes on without anyones help when she set the tray before him he refused it im not going to get used to such service id rather sit opposite you at a table so marcia took the tray back her high heels clicking and steve followed her to set the table he said im beginning to know your step theres a little skip in it tltarcia froze recalling isabels smooth glide and tried to put it into practice but it escaped her and was too slow for the hundred and one things she had to do this morning she said brightly what time do you report to the hospital at two then well go to the barbers first he ran an exploratory hand up his neck do i look that bad no but i do it will give you a lift while you are waiting for me and ill drive you to the hospital in plenty of time fortunately isabel had not taken the old roadster tip mallorys crowd would have had hysterics over it but it would take steve and marcia any place they wanted to go they would eat outdoors tonight marcia decided while the hairdresser cut her hair into feathery upswept curls and when she finally surveyed her finished self in the long mirror she was amazed and de- lighted she hadnt isabels smooth perfec- tion but she had her own individual love- liness steve would be pleased even if his eyes could not gaze on her he would sense this new beauty hours later after the doctors at the hos- pital had peered into steves blank eyes through strange instruments marcia was glad she had chosen the cathedral stillness of this secluded spot the earth was a carpet of green velvet against the silence was the sleepy chirping of birds high in the trees steve at her side carried the small branches that marcia gathered his mouth sober he said that was quite an ordeal they put me through at the hospital but i didnt mind it one old fellow fussed over me so long im beginning to be doubtful for a fleeting instant his face went grey  sweetheart stories her heart went out to him but she wouldnt soften him she said calmly this is only the first day steve there must be plenty of exam- inations before they decide on the proce- dure i know they mentioned a doctor gardner the best eye specialist in the country when he returns hes to go over me she thought dismayed suppose steves sight never returns and put the jarring idea from her as swiftly as it arose fearing her uncertainty might creep into her voice and wing its way to steve he needed all her strength her courage her belief youll see again she said firmly he moved his hands in a positive gesture in a different voice he said of course i will ill get back into active service again too would it help to talk about it no i just want to get back where i belong they didnt touch upon his misgiv- ings again soon the sticks were laid for a fire and the crackling branches sent up a blue smoke hamburgers sizzled upon the skillet in steves steady sunburned hands marcia spread rolls with thick pats of butter knowing she would never sniff the pungent fragrance of wood smoke with- out remembering vividly this moment there was a hurting in her throat she forced words through it are you happy steve the glow that spread over his face was her answer she added hastily that was a silly question so skip it he said unexpectedly i had to lose my sight to really know you you werent like this last year her face shimmered with tears she was glad he couldnt see them last year was last year her voice was blurred he grinned shrugged last year you were a little flirt you led me on and put me off you laughed when i was serious you said you didnt care one scrap about me but i loved you her cheeks felt hot it was isabel last year it was isabel this year that he loved she felt racked with agony she had no right to warm herself in the flame of his love for another she had no right to feed that flame with hope and desire for when he saw again it would die to ashes and she would have to watch it die her eyes grew big and honest gazing into the future she said softly i loved you last year i love you now always remem- ber that steve they went home in the crisp cool star- light marcia drove and steve stretched beside her in a contented silence how long it would be she did not know in her in- domitable hope she determined to lock each day into her heart until the next but you cant chart your days into nar- row little channels and expect them to stay there she discovered two days later it was about ten oclock she and steve had dawdled over breakfast marcia in a yellow housecoat that brought tarnished gilt to her hair and golden lights in her brown eyes its full skirt whispered at her heels as she cleaned up the breakfast nook steve had gone back to his room to make his bed when the door bell rang the queerest feeling of doom gripped her drained the color from her cheeks shadowed her eyes isabel returning isa- bel who would never countenance this fan- tastic interchange of personalities for a full moment she leaned with her forehead against the door wondering if she dared run up those steps and confess to steve to plead for his understanding to face his heartsickening contempt the bell pierced her anguish it was too late for explanations she flung open the door it wasnt isabel the little gasp that escaped her was for the reprieve it was mrs scott who lived across the street in a house very much like this mrs scott had been helpful and kind during the lin- gering illness of marcias mother she had kept a watchful eye on the girls while they were becoming adjusted to a motherless grief-stricken household at this moment marcia did not care to see her morning caller but she remembered those things and smiled the gallant adventure last year you were a little flirt you said you didnt care a scrap about me steve grinned the panic within her still held her so that she barely followed her visitors voice commenting on the early spring rain mar- cia grasped the arms of her ladder back chair and prayed that steve would not come sprinting down the stairs for mrs scott was sure to say marcia dear and steve would know mrs scotts little round face was wrinkled with distress she clasped and unclasped the catch on her purse and it made a clicking sound in the stillness my dear she said and paused mar- cia jerked to attention she saw her old friend fumbling for words and rejecting them finally she began again my dear i have no right to say this so you must forgive me you must not keep this soldier here i know there is nothing wrong i know you are doing a fine brave thing to help him but people talk theyre buzzing now you cant defy gossip in a daze she recalled mrs scotts de- parture the doorknob was cold to her touch and as hard as the lump that was her heart her throat was dry as she bid her goodby for a long time marcia stood inside the door there was a pall in the room if she let it it would settle over her heart she would not permit scandal to frighten her into sending steve away he needed her now she needed him if he returned to a hospital he would lose that new self reliance that was giving bouyancy to his step if she let him go now her brief bright glimpse of heaven would be gone just a few more days until this great eye specialist gave his verdict how the people would talk if they knew the game she was really playing sweetheart stories upstairs she could hear steves swift movements she sat small and serene in a chair the skirt a splash of gold at her feet there was a fixed defiant gay- etv in her smile for no one was going to disrupt the pattern of their existence if there were unpleasant rumors she would close her ears to them if she ex- perienced snubs she would hold her head high and proud and ignore them steve came down the stairs his steps made no sound on the blue velvet carpet as they carefully picked their way for an instant he paused on the landing against the brightness of the oval win- dow his dark brows were met in a troubled frown and he ran his tense fingers through his smooth black hair his tortured voice came to her i was a fool a thoughtless fool he descended the remaining steps like an old man she rose went to him swiftly her hands outstretched you heard steve oh im sorry- the grim set lines about his mouth did not relax i never gave a thought to anyone but myself it seemed so right to come home to you it was right it was selfish it seemed right to share my anxiety with you and our laughter and our silences it seemed almost as if we were married all i have given you is censure lifted eyebrows and whis- pering i wanted to give you the world wrapped up in a ribbon  his mouth twisted with bitterness and her heart went out to him will you marry me steve it was queer the way the words came out be- cause she didnt mean to say them yet they were quiet and determined she added hastily not to protect me from wagging tongues they dont matter but because you love me because you want me the uncertainty on his face made her half faint he drew back from her and for an unforgettable moment his mouth worked i wanted to wait until i had the right to ask you that honey until i could see my bride she flung back her head and a sob caught her shook her why steve when we have so much to share now why must we wait why must we ask for more when we have everything why must we wait for to- morrow when we have today oh steve if you should ever regret if you should stop loving me id give you your free- dom her mouth quivered with the un- speakable words of her deception now was the time to tell him his hands pressing her shoulders made her go limp he was saying if i should stop loving you darling do you know what it is to be falling into a bottomless pit and have someone jerk you to safety do you know what it is to be in a thick black- ness and suddenly there is a glimmer of light you cant see it but you know it is there thats what your love has done his voice shook he swallowed i was on the crumpling edge of self control when your voice came to me on the phone she drew a deep chaotic breath her voice isabels voice did it make any difference so they were married in a little church marcia had attended all her life marcia in her graduation gown of white shirred net with a tight little-girl bodice and a wide flowing skirt wearing the finger tip veil that had been her mothers marcia had said to steve is there some friend youd like to ask he had thought a long moment and then shook his head he was so tall so distant above her handsome in his uni- form firm-jawed and incredibly happy he said i would have liked marcia to be here too bad shes had to stay so long with your aunt she was grateful steve could not see the confused red in her cheeks as she heard the lie she had told him two days before repeated he had asked why mar- cia was away from home and she had told him that she was visiting a sick aunt in seattle he had been content with that and it  the gallant adventure turned her sick with shame that she must lie yet that too passed and she forced all the little nagging doubts of fear into the background for she was determined to make steve happy so only mrs scott was at the wedding she had an awful quaking moment when the minister said do you marcia take this man- outside the riveting from across the street shook the tiny church steves hand in hers jerked involuntarily the low voice of the minister was lost in the noise and marcias breath came out in a re- lived exhausted gasp steve belonged to her now they cel- ebrated by cooking their dinner over a fire as they had done that first night in the grove of trees when it was dark they came back to the house marcia pushed back the chairs in the library and turned on the radio and they danced there was a great deal of bumping and laughing suddenly they were laughing no more steves arms were tight bands and she was dizzy with his nearness without a faltering step he carried her up the wide stairs she was helpless in his embrace she could not think she was glad to surrender because she loved steve so terribly and he loved the girl he thought she was her heart was singing through the days that followed long hours spent in the hospital steve undergoing endless examinations picnics in out-of-the-way places the old roadster nosed out of the blue dancing in the library to the radio or just sitting before the fire her head against his knee while he tumbled her fair hair inside she was fiercely glad that she had married steve fiercely glad for the love that had fallen to her not so with steve he was restless dissatisfied with the slowness of his re- covery doubtful of the doctors findings his face was serious pained then isabel returned more beautiful than ever and triumphant it was a day steve was at the hospital marcia had driven him in she was to pick him up  at four now her eyes went black and wide with shock when isabel dropped her coat on the chair and hugged her isabel sang pack your things kid i am going to marry mr tip mallory if you please and we are saying goodby to poverty forever  marcia dug her nails into her palms for control her voice when it came was a small shaken whisper i married steve oh isabel he thinks i am you abrupty isabel sat down and marcia poured out the whole story in a quick ruthless tide she spared herself noth- ing the raw ache within her eased with the words to confide in someone to find some justification for what she had done isabel gave her none she said all too logically marcia darling you cant get away with it youve just got to tell the truth you cant go on forever lying to steve not as i remember him hes a stickler for honesty he wont tolerate double-crossing thats why we quarrelled and he joined the army and you love him the tumult of marcias anguish was in her face i cant tell him now then i will it isnt fair to him nor to you to go this way no i dont care for myself let me have a little more time-until this eye specialist sees him oh isabel hell never forgive me i dont believe he will isabel said slowly she hugged marcia with fierce loyalty if steve carradine breaks your heart ill-ill tell him something for a long instant marcia buried her face in isabels shoulder the desire for truth battled with her engulfing hope that steve might fall in love with her until she was so deeply a part of him the de- ception would not rock his whole existence she knew at last the futility of her wish- ful longing marcia lifted her chin ill tell him when he sees this specialist if his case is hopeless ill never tell him ill go on living a lie and making him happy her words were clear and unwavering sweetheart stories isabel shrugged marcia youll be the one to suffer not steve but if you wish i promise not to say a word ill get out of the way and when the final blow-up comes you come to me because you wont be able to fool him forever simply because he is blind the shaft drove home drove deep into the torment that was sleeping in her breast that she had tried to lull into a false security ill chance it she said stubbornly isabel was gone for good only a few limp gowns hung in her closet and her room held a faint exotic perfume the devastating thought struck marcia that she would slip out of steves life just as surely and as completely she would be just a bitter memory somehow she got through two awful days of mental anguish and grim recrim- ination steve sensed her inner turmoil it was at breakfast he pushed back his chair with a harsh scrape his mouth was set and miserable he said i can appreciate how terrible it is to be married to a blind man he couldnt see the wretchedness of her eyes or her lingers plucking nervously at the bright flowered tablecloth it isnt that steve she steadied her trembling voice what would you think if i told you i hadnt been entirely truth- ful she chose her words carefully she was holding her breath awaiting his an- swer there was a bitter twist to his mouth i would say i am not surprised you lied before you were engaged to me and dating a man named barney shore marcia vaguely remembered barney he was one of the boys isabel had danced with and kissed goodby and never given another thought to with swift insight marcia realized now that isabel had nev- er been in love with steve even when she was wearing his ring or she couldnt have given her kisses so casually steves accusing voice went on barney carried your picture and received your letters and yet a passionate loyalty to isabel swelled within her she cried jerkily goodby kisses to soldiers what a little thing to resent my lord little her head lifted proudly ive never asked a man to marry me but you his mouth grimaced what kind of marriage is this built on pity and his self-loathing turned itself on her he wanted her to suffer as he was suffering illogically unreasonably dont you sup- pose i can feel you are restless and un- happy that you lie awake half the night tense you talk of truth dont you think i know our marriage was a gal- lant gesture you now repent in his present frame of mind it was useless to explain the telephone rang and marcia leaped to answer it welcoming the interruption the message was brief she had just re- placed the receiver on its cradle when steve entered it was the hospital she told him ex- citedly dr gardner is there for a few hours if you go immediately- thriving steve to the hospital she realized hopelessly the whole situation had been taken out of her hands if the operation was not successful and she should reveal her true identity to steve he would not believe her he would think it another fantastic lie concocted by isa- bel to extract herself from a distasteful marriage when they were in the hospital wait- ing for dr gardner steves mouth was a jagged line of expectancy he kept lighting cigarettes that he did not want his trembling hands revealed his nervous- ness marcia slim and straight stood at the desk giving his case history to the white-capped nurse she could only pray that this surgeon was more expert than the others that god-given genius was in his fingers steve was at her elbow looking like a lost child now that his great moment was at hand she laid her warm hand on his arm in sympathy and understanding the gallant adventure the nurse said to marcia your name please unthinkingly she replied marcia car- radine your relation to the patient his wife steves sudden grip on her arm was hurting the oddest expression flitted across his face it was as if she had turned a knife in the most vulnerable part of his body a brick red suffused his face unwittingly she had told him bluntly and without a softening word of explana- tion an interne was beckoning without speaking steve turned to follow him marcia caught at steves arm her bright mouth trembled steve- with a kind smile the interne said you may have a few minutes with your wife steve never paused he said brutally we have nothing to discuss with stricken eyes marcia watched the elevator climb steves black hair his blue eyes staring straight ahead the long khaki clad length of him his feet set far apart bracing himself for the next blow she had the queerest feeling she would never see him again never hear his voice never see his mouth curve into a smile if he died he had denied her the right to weep if he came out into darkness again he would renounce her just as cruelly as he had a moment before vet she couldnt go home unseen she slipped into the solarium and wait- ed somewhere in this same building steve lay under the white hot glare of the op- erating theater the lights came on automatically and she stared unseeingly into blackness out- side for hours or was it years a nurse came in and broke the spell of waiting horror you must go home mrs carradine you can do no good here spent and lifeless marcia shook her head im waiting to see dr gardner when hes free hes gone flew east an hour ago it was over then that hopeful opera- tion no one had told her no one even knew she was here her heart beat pain- fully can you tell me how lieutenant car- radine is ill see the nurse never came back each time marcia inquired at the desk the answers were vague she went home at last for three days she endured it waiting in the solarium for the call that never came there were dark shadows under her eyes she couldnt remember when she had eaten or when she had slept she saw pity in the eyes of the nurses sharp scrutiny in the glances of the doctors for the first time she faced the dreadful truth steve did not want her blind or seeing it didnt matter he did not want her she never returned to the hospital she remembered isabels insistent demand that she come to her marcia couldnt this was something she had to suffer alone in silence because she alone was responsible she drew some scant comfort in walking the paths that she and steve had so joyfully explored memory stabbing at her heart a week with steve she had tried to cram it with a lifetime of living che was digging in the side garden  when he came to her two weeks later she didnt hear his firm step although the thought of him was so vivid it was not startling to feel his hands on her elbows drawing her to her feet whirling her around to face him his eyes were bluer than she ever remembered them and clear and sinking deep into hers as if they were going straight down to her heart marcia- his voice was ragged you are all right steve they took the bandages off this morn- ing why didnt you send for me she whispered why did you deny me the privilege of knowing how you were i wanted to be able to come myself i wanted to be able to see you to stand sweetheart stories on my two feet and tell you i love you marcia i love you steve ive always loved you he said slowly i know that you loved me way back when you were just a youngster you used to look at me with your heart in your eyes as if i were a god i discouraged you laughed at you tried to think of you as a baby i thought i was in love with isabel but it was you i wanted to take care of i asked isabel to marry me but it was your love and laughter i carried in my heart oh my dear when i came back i was so busy feel- ing sorry for myself i didnt think clear- ly i should have known it was you but i didnt i should have known isabel would never have made such a sacrifice for she never loved me a man sees his whole life when they clamp that ether cup over his nose i saw you in my heart-a brave gallant girl who would marry a blind man to give him courage and confidence his voice was torn youve given me that youve given me something else the knowledge that i love you as you love me i clung to your love those dark days when i wouldnt let them send for you i wanted to come back well and strong seeing you as you are his voice broke if the operation hadnt been successful i would have come back somehow just to hear the sound of your voice to touch you my darling i cant live without you she lifted her face to the warmth and tenderness in his it was no sacrifice our marriage she said her voice husky love isnt sacrifice its knowing all the little things its giving with your heart see- ing with your heart there was vision in his blue eyes at last and love in his heart there was en- chantment in his lips against her mouth enchantment that she dared to take be- cause now it was meant for her tides of memory i love the oceans mighty roar the white gulls eerie notes the curving sweep of foamy shore the rocking dipping boats and dear to me are leaning spars above the blowing sail the silver sheen of frosty stars the challenge of the gale why must i haunt the lonely sea where once we walked apart oh restless tides eternally you break against my heart nancy buckley  furlough kisses by margery woods you do have a habit of popping up where youre not needed dont you micheles eyes said from the observation platform lynn barry watched the clipper being towed in to the dock jeff was aboard after almost a year with the eagle squadron jeff was coming home-to fight he had written with his own gang a stiff breeze tried to snatch lynns cocky felt hat from her golden curls the hat like her eyes was gentian blue she had bought it for jeffs homecoming though she wasnt in love with him nor would it do her any good to be i like you jeff used to say as a person but heaven save me lynn from ever getting that way over a career gal heaven had saved him for three years he and lynn had been joint owners of beauvais inc with never anything more sweetheart stories romantic between them than i like that hat beautiful they had bought beau- vais perfumes and cosmetics at a time when business was bad and monsieur beau- vais himself eloped with another mans wife jeff had been doing publicity for beau- vais then and lynn was office manager almost at once the business began to click they did it with the blue lady lynn said they needed an arresting new package so they worked out the blue lady and jeff did her in clay using lynn for his model modeling with clay was jeffs hobby the blue lady was all rhythmic flow- ing lines her lovely figure scantily draped her head tilted joyously the original now stood on lynns desk she and jeff were superstitious about the blue lady they thought she brought them luck the clipper wallowing like a tremendous bird was being tied at the dock lynn ran downstairs and waited by the gate peo- ple turn to look at her she was not so much beautiful as vivid and arresting honev-blond hair contrasted with dark brows and lashes her skin was the color of rich cream her mouth wide and ex- pressive passengers began trickling through the gate stretched on tiptoe lynn saw jeffs rusty brown head his hazel eyes searching for her he looked thin and tired lynns heart turned over with unexpected tender- ness lynn he was kissing her jeff oh it is good to see you  a little shakily she drew back and gazed at him and you his eyes were warm oh lynn you look so cared-for lovely-and so normal  she knew what he meant-after europes nightly blackouts rubble where tall build- ings should be danger and sudden death but jeff was turning to a thin dark girl beside him michele this is lynn didnt i tell you she was beautiful but she is the girl had a faint ac- cent her lips were smiling though her dark eyes seemed to measure lynn with faint hostility who on earth was this michele girl lynn was suddenly jittery in her very bones but jeff had begun to explain michele and i met in lisbon she had been there nine months imagine i was able to help a little in getting her on the clipper how like jeff lynn thought warm- hearted jeff always lending a hand to someone in distress you might say that lame ducks were his hobby jeff and michele cleared the customs and all three took a taxi for new york theres the skyline jeffs voice had a warm tone look your fill michele theres nothing else like it in the whole world oh the girl exclaimed it is mar-r- velous  oddly enough jeff turned to lynn michele was born in new york her father was american and her mother french micheles last name you see is bradley her father died when she was quite young and micheles mother took her back to france after hitler took over the poor kid had a heck of a time proving her american citizenship but she finally did and got as far as lisbon too bad lynn felt shame for her first distrust of the girl it was so dreadful micheles voice broke i cannot talk of it i am alone you see-quite alone jeff patted her hand dont you wor- ry michele well look after you see here lynn have you still the same apartment why yes then youll take michele wont you the poor kid is broke a french woman befriended her and gave her money for passage home but staying so long in lis- bon- of course lynn told him ive plen- ty of room thank you michele said with her charming accent it will be only until i go to hollywood michele jeff explained has done some theater work and a lot of dancing so a good agent should be able to help her  furlough kisses of course lynn agreed though she felt rather skeptical as they turned into park avenue jeff took a deep breath look michele isnt it wonderful people going about their business as usual no boarded-up windows or piles of rubble but were going to forget all that know what i want lynn a three-inch steak-and darn soon he glanced from one girl to the other you two must be about the same size will you lend michele something to wear the poor kid hasnt a rag of course lynn felt terribly let- down she had dreamed of an intimate dinner with jeff of catching up on what had happened this last year now michele would be there in lynns apartment michele looked at the great bowl of irises and yellow snap- dragon at the deep comfortable chairs and the view from a wide window mar-r- velous she exclaimed lynn ran bath water for the girl when she did not even open her one shabby bag lynn laid out silken underwear then flung open the door of her wardrobe lets wear dinner clothes michele- something simple she took down a yel- low organdie do you like this its a bit tight for me and should fit you per- fectly michele held the organdie to her shoul- ders it is nice but- turning back to the wardrobe she selected an apple-green taffeta if you do not mind i will choose thees one lynn did mind for the apple-green was new helplessly she watched michele place it upon the twin bed which had been as- signed to her lynn and jeff were lunching at the marguery he had been home now for five days and that morning theyd had a long business conference with much talk of priorities and what-not although jeff was impatient of business and anxious to fly again he expected his commission in the air corps to come through almost any time the marguerys arbored summer dining room was cool and charming jeff looked at his watch im taking michele to an agent at three lynn you know shes looking better already she should i buy my clothes at the best shops lynn retorted lynn surely you dont mind micheles borrowing a dress here and there oh not at all lynn was sorry she had brought up the subject yet some per- verse demon made her pursue it a dress here and there would be swell but michele takes practically your whole ward- robe without so much as a by-your-leave thats terrible jeff was shocked though you musnt be too hard on her michele is as eager as a child a very shrewd child lynn thought michele was determined to have her own way-or else this time however lynn did hold her tongue and jeff began talking about his commission he wanted to get on a bomber but had never flown one so there would be a training period of some weeks lynn felt both excited and frightened about it she had a sudden need to know his thoughts-know what went on inside him how does it feel jeff-up there she asked wonderful his eyes were dreamy its beautifully free and sometimes of course frightening i cant quite describe it lynn then his face grew grave there is the other side-your friends being shot down an empty place at mess-but after a while you get a furlough and sort of forget her skin was all icy prickles friends shot down-and it could have been jeff himself spend your furloughs in london in london he agreed there would be a girl perhaps-a kiss- his tone was lightly cynical a kiss she didnt like to think of those furlough kisses from girls in london   jeff walked back to the office with lynn leaving her at the elevator he said ill be around and take you gals out to din- ner sweetheart stories suddenly she rebelled a threesome al- ways a threesome- thanks she said but i have a date  a date why not havent i always had dates lynn left him looking startled and dis- pleased she would phone paul morton paul was something-or-other in his fathers ship building plant and wouldnt be draft- ed he had a passion for building a house and had asked lynn to marry him but whether for herself or to pore over blue- prints with him she didnt quite know on the way home that evening lynn stopped and bought a dress it was white satin beautifully molded to her curves with no shoulders and puff sleeves it made lynn seem very sweet and clinging as if she had just stepped from an old-fash- ioned picture frame sprawled on her own twin bed michele watched lynn dress going dancing she asked enviously so far they had dined only at small no-dance places oh yes lynn answered hoping jeff would come in time to see her even her eyes tonight had taken on a sort of dreamy softness suddenly michele exclaimed he shall take me dancing and sprang up to fling wide the wardrobe doors the black she muttered no the pink net with only straps as usual she did not even ask her hostesss permission but just took what she wanted lynn was boiling mad but she only tucked a honey-gold curl into place and ad- justed a bow with long streamers she had just picked up a silly blue taffeta cape designed for show rather than warmth when the doorbell rang thank heaven it was jeff lynn he looked surprised i-ive never seen you like this i mean tonight youre really super-duper thanks dont look now jeff but i think you and michele are going dancing i seem to have given the gal ideas still gazing at her jeff didnt seem to hear again the doorbell rang this time bringing paul morton paul was a dark chap taller than jeff but less rugged when they were introduced the two men eyed each other warily as she and paul left the apartment lynn remarked very clearly lets go to el mo- rocco paul we havent been there for ages there jeff couldnt help hearing at el morocco paul got a table near the dance floor they had cocktails ordered dinner and danced but all the time lynn was waiting if jeff wanted michele to himself he wouldnt come otherwise- lynn watched the door forty-five min- utes passed-an hour she had almost giv- en up when they came jeff had changed to a white dinner jacket and looked won- derful michele looked pretty in an elfin helpless sort of way may we join you jeff asked and sud- denly lynns spirits lifted so michele was ordering a martini and roast duck michele was dancing with jeff and doing it lynn had to admit beau- tifully ever since jeffs return lynn had been alternately happy and depressed and she had blamed it all on michele but present- ly when she and jeff were on the dance floor jeff holding her close every nerve and fiber of her being seemed to come alive confused and disturbed she was silent shed never felt this way before with jeff back at the table lynn concentrated on paul but she was still disturbingly aware of jeff even when she and paul were doing a smooth rhumba she could scarcely keep her eyes from jeff and michele when the dark girl deliberately let her hair brush his cheek lynn felt a sharp thrust of pure jealousy the whole evening was like that dancing wtih jeff lynn would feel once more that heady excitement and be- tween times was only a period of waiting finally it was past midnight and lynn said come on jeff lets have a brandy at the bar it was brazen she thought but she must have him all to herself a few minutes furlough kisses so they were at the bar cradling brandy glasses in their hands and looking at each other a little oddly as if all at once they had become different people silver palms jeff glanced about and cockeyed zebra-striped furniture its crazy but nice i used to long desperately for something like this and for the sort of gal you seem to be right now soft and sweet it-its hot in here want a breath of air they went outside ard down the almost deserted street they walked slowly lynns arm through jeffs their fingers in- tertwined its like a dream he said an inter- lude between- though he didnt finish lynn knew what he meant between the war in eng- land and the war somewhere else they walked on not talking very much lynn felt breathless and waiting waiting for what finally at a darkened doorway jeff drew her close the shadows closed about them as jeff held her close lynn could feel the wild thud of hi heart answering her own youre so srveet he whispered like something a man dreamed up lynn could no more keep her arm from creeping about his neck than the moon could keep from rising later in shame she wondered if she had been too bold inviting his kiss anyway they clung together blindly there in that strange doorway their lips seeking and hungry as if this sudden urgent need for each other could never be satisfied it was reckless unbelievable-and heavenly it left lynn stirred to her very bones finally jeff was holding her like a precious thing whispering against her hair youve a fire i never dreamed of lynn in that war-torn world over there a man goes nearly crazy with wanting something like this a queer iciness slid through her veins what had he called this oh yes an interlude and how lightly he had spoken the other day of furloughs a girl perhaps- a kiss moving away from him she steadied her voice carefully wed better go back michele will be annoved and paul and paul as they started up the street she thought kissing in doorways my girl-and furlough kisses at that you should be ashamed the next day jeff didnt appear at the office until after noon all day lynn in a honey-beige dress with brown leather flower and belt had wailed for him all day she had tingled to the remembered magic of his kiss suppose he had meant that kiss after all suppose like herself he was suddenly in love finally he came he sat on a corner of her desk looking at her a faint smile on his mouth we had fun last night he said didnt we he picked up the statuette of the blue lady here she is our lady luck re- member the day i modeled her-how i said you had nice bones but no fire guess i was wrong about career gals well i wouldnt say that i can still take my career women or leave them so that was it angry tears stung her eyelids it had been only a furlough kiss jeff got up and walked about the office i left michele at the hairdressers and am to pick her up again in half an hour new york has the poor kid so bewildered that she simply cant find her way about lynn had planned to be soft and very feminine but here she was all criss-cross again and here was her unruly tongue ex- claiming wouldnt it be a good idea if michele learned to find her way about she cant expect you to play nursemaid in- definitely lynn you do hate her dont you i dont hate her but the girl has to earn her own living so why not face facts to begin with she hasnt a thousand-to-one chance of making good in hollywood-the country is full of girls who can dance pretty well and act a little i could get her a job in a shop somewhere or perhaps doing some kind of war work sweetheart stories the kid isnt very strong jeff took a turn up and down the room i dont think anything like that would work out i	worry about her lynn shes been through so much and now what will hap- pen to her i-i have a sort of idea- almost defiantly he stopped at the desk looking down at her i thought i might make my insurance over to michele then if i did check out she would have at least a few thousands to get started in holly- wood if i did check out for all her incredu- lous anger those words turned lynns blood to ice jeff sturgis she cried have you lost your mind oh of course i wouldnt expect you to understand but i do understand lynn sprang up facing him furiously i understand only too well cant you see jeff that you dont have to worry about michele in france some kind woman cared for her and gave her passage money home in lisbon you took over it will be like that always michele has only to let a few tears drip and some dope will come to her rescue dope jeffs face hardened well im glad to find out at last what you really think of me jeff i didnt mean- skip it he was looking at his watch i have to go now and i-ill make other arrangements for michele jeff her hand was on his arm please dont im sorry for being so bad- tempered perhaps-perhaps i was only jealous you jealous he gazed down at her scornfully thats a hot one when he had gone lynn buried her face in her hands a long dry sob shook her you idiot she whispered oh you pre- cious big-hearted idiot tn the end michele remained with lynn a on the following day there came a strangely addressed letter ordinarily the mail came after lynn had left for the office but she had overslept so when she finally came downstairs the mailman was just leaving and there was a letter addressed not to michele but to miss vinnie brad- ley with a return on the back to some park avenue address the wrong bradley lynn thought then faintly suspicious she jotted down the address in her notebook by computing numbers she figured that address would be not the fashionable section of park ave- nue bht the cheap one further north that evening lynn mentioned the letter oh that one michele answered it was not for me lynn was dining with paul that night he brought some blueprints and had them spread all over the floor when jeff arrived jeff grinned at them skeptically lynn thought darn it he feels certain i wont marry paul-and he wouldnt even care she had a dull sort of evening and made paul bring her home early she went to bed but again she couldnt sleep for michele and jeff were still out lynn imag- ined the girl in jeffs arms being very thor- oughly kissed furlough kisses or would it be different with michele tormented by jealousy lynn turned over for the tenth time and pounded up her pillow finally michele came lynn heard her say goodnight dar-r-ling at the door hello michele turned on one of the dressing-table lights you are still awake i just got in lynn fibbed with an elaborate yawn we had champagne michele stretched her arms luxuriously that jeff he is wonderful i think i shall marry him lynn has he asked you lynn kept the aw- ful panic from her voice no michele flashed her a mysterious glance but soon he will he has the most crazy notion of giving me his insurance if he is killed but what would people think no that i would not like how lightly she spoke of jeff being killed a look of avarice crossed micheles dark face while he is gone she said i will help you run the business maybe i could be-what you call the receptionist  furlough kisses over my dead body lynn thought and her body felt dead at this minute-numb with fear whether jeff loved michele or not he was putty in her hands hadnt he always been a pushover for lame ducks that night lynn didnt sleep and next morning the shadows under her eyes made her look very fragile and appealing jeff came in at the office for a little while going to get married he asked rather stiffly lynn shrugged perhaps so the boy friend could go for a career wife so it seems lynn answered lightly well im scarcely worried you just arent the type to settle on a connecticut hilltop and raise a flock of children this time lynn managed to hold her tem- per thats what you think she said air- ily and jeff gave her a startled glance after walking to the window and back he remarked i offered to make michele my beneficiary and she refused that shows how wrong you were about her  perhaps she- she broke off flushing what were you going to say again lynns reckless tongue betrayed her perhaps michele wants you to marry her marry he repeated oh no i wouldnt be a bargain for any gal if i didnt come back okay but if i did come -all shot up or something- jeff dont lynns eyes looked al- most black in her white face he perched on the corner of her desk heaven save us beautiful i didnt mean to scare the daylights out of you thats just a chance we all take im not worry- ing but you-but we- impulsively she drew his hand against her cheek as he bent and brushed her hair with his lips she longed with every fiber of her being to be held close in his arms then he was saying i like that collar lynn it makes you look like a little girl thanks her throat ached and her eyes smarted with tears darn it now she had given him the idea of marrying michele then jeff was leaving he had to see if his comission had come through it ynn had no time for tears she was too busy being the efficient miss barry who managed beauvais inc so competent- ly jeepers she thought career gals cant even have a broken heart decently around four oclock however there was a lull and then fear caught up with her she remembered micheles purposeful look as she said i think i shall marry him lynn opened her notebook and found that address on park avenue she set a straw cartwheel on the back of her head went out and hailed a taxi the bradley address proved to be a shabby apartment house only one step re- moved from a tenement she questioned a thin boy who had just come through the door and stopped to light his cigarette sure he said there were bradleys on the third floor but he didnt know one called vinnie lynn had started to go past him when he stopped her hey  he said perhaps you mean the one that went to hollywood lynn turned i dont think    wait how long ago was that the boy screwed up his face remember- ing oh-perhaps three or four years i didnt live here then would she be a thin dark girl but then youd hardly know she could be the boy admitted both of her sisters are dark and kind of pretty- such great big eyes you know big eyes-yes michele had those all right lynns heart had begun to thump harder she thanked the boy who walked off down the street lynns finger hovered at the bradleys bell but did not ring it if vinnie and michele were the same per- son mrs bradley would scarcely admit it -and shed be sure to tip off her daughter taking michele by surprise was important so lynn went away without inquiring fur- ther this time she took a bus as she rode downtown the situation seemed reasonable one moment and fantastic the next obvi- ously the girl known as vinnie had had no sweetheart stories luck in hollywood suppose then she had somehow wangled her way to paris with the idea of coming back with a french accent and a phony background that stunt had been used before-and success- fully in her more hopeful moments it seemed to lynn that micheles french accent did slip occasionally when she opened the door lynn heard jeffs voice hi he called hurrying to meet her my commission came through and im leaving on monday for texas oh jeff lynns throat closed with tears blindly she crossed the living room flinging the cartwheel hat on a table and pretending to look in the mirror as she ran her fingers through her curls i cannot bear it michele was curled in a big chair i cannot have him go and leave me all alone  her voice broke lynn swallowed her tears turning around she drew a long breath alone she repeated but look michele havent you sort of misplaced a relative here and there youve a whole flock you know over on upper park ave- nue-including a mother and father micheles eyes were wide and startled what-what are you talking about oh dont stall lynn cried hotly ive just been over there michele turned to jeff and tears rolled down her cheeks jeff she cried i didnt mean to lie but i-i couldnt be a burden on my f-family they have so much to bear and i have tried so hard since i was thirteen i have slaved to make some- thing of myself burying her face in her hands she wept as if heartbroken jeff went and patted her shoulder thats okay he comforted i knew it all the time michele lynn simply could not believe this hor- rible nightmare she saw michele gaze at jeff a smile breaking through her tears darling michele cried jeff darling and springing up she flung herself into his arms how did you know looking embarrassed jeff held her light- ly on the clipper i asked to see your passport and you made some excuse so i grew somewhat suspicious these days a guy has to know the people hes sponsor- ing later here in the apartment i man- aged to get the passport and take a peek from that i pretty well reconstructed your whole sory it proved anyway that you were okay and if you didnt want to tell me the whole story that was your busi- ness oh jeff michele gazed at him ador- ingly your faith means everything all my life jeff people have thought the worst of me even so lynn told her bitterly you do seem to get on my pet she went into the kitchen and got herself a glass of orange juice she was standing in the window staring blindly across the street when jeff came out micheles packing he said not a bad idea lynn turned to face him and she didnt know her way around new york she said scornfully jeff sighed lynn youre perfect and you just cant understand other peoples weaknesses michele is a born actress she had played her part so long she really believed it lynn choked on tears of mingled rage and defeat michele finished packing and she and jeff left taking her one bag a bit reproach- fully she thanked lynn for her hospitality from the door lynn watched them go her heart in her eyes as she noted the familiar breadth of jeffs shoulders when she saw him again he would be in uniform her eyes blurred with tears she under- stood so much now-why after he went to england she had been afraid to open a newspaper-why she had been restless and depressed and the men who took her out hadnt mattered at all and now she had only memories she walked about twisting her hands together in agony the tears slipping down her face she thought i could have had him perhaps i could have pretended to be just another lame duck no i couldnt either im not the type to pull an act hed have to take me as i am and he doesnt really like me at all     furlough kisses rphe next day lynn went through the motions of being manager for beauvais inc and waited for jeff he didnt come on the following day the same thing hap- pened probably he and michele were mar- ried and honeymooning somewhere lynn ached with loneliness if she only could touch jeff feel his cheek against hers the warm strength of his arms - but no michele would have all that michele remembering how michele had planned to help here in the office lynns mouth set she thought ill sell out-ill marry paul but she wouldnt of course paul with his blueprints seemed pretty wooden and dull lynn glanced through the paper planes shot down-not jeffs thank heaven-a practice blackout maybe she could be an air raid warden she was called out front to satisfy an exacting customer yes madame this is very good for dry skin    no madame we use astringent   she felt like say- ing the heck with you madame what could anyone do with a face like yours that night lynn took the blue lady home with her it stood upon the coffee table a symbol of the years when she had been so close to jeff never realizing that she was in love with him forgetting din- ner she wandered about the apartment tried to read wandered again it was almost dark when the doorbell rang jeff lynn tnld herself her heart beat- ing wildly but it couldnt be jeff but it was and he was in uniform dizzily she saw his wings and the two silver bars on his shoulder a captain she said hi captain hi though he saluted proudly jeff had the sheepish air of a small boy caught in some devilment where have you been she asked try- ing to sound casual getting married or something no thank heaven he walked over to the coffee table and picked up the little statuette lady luck lynn she almost failed me this time you were right oh lvnn how right you were about what lynn tucked her feet under her on the sofa about michele lynn i did consider marrying her she seemed to-sort of expect it but i put it off and this after- noon we were having cocktails in twenty- one when along came a repulsive-looking flashy sort of man he knew michele she tried to shush him but he was tight and wouldnt be shushed so the whole thing came out a third-rate ham actor he took her to paris that was how she got there oh jeff when they got there she apparently pulled a fast one and hes still mad about it he told her off right there in twenty- one and i saw her at last lynn for the cheap little adventuress she is lynn said youre swell jeff but too big-hearted for your own good its a nice fault though her voice was suddenly husky for he was looking down at her in a new disturbing fashion lynn he said why did you bring the blue lady home i-i though she couldnt tell him the answer was in her eyes then he too was on the sofa drawing her into his arms lynn he cried ever since that kiss ive been tormented by you day and night be a career girl if you like sweet be anything-only marry me before i go oh jeff as if i wouldnt as they clung to each other in a sudden feeling of oneness their kisses had a new tenderness and a deeper passion finally lynn drew back to look at him jeff-oh darling i thought that first was only a furlough kiss it was he drew her close again but all my furlough kisses will be yours from now on lynn and speaking of furloughs were getting married on this one married right away thats an order lynn asked softly straight from the captain to the cap- tains lady jeff said and lynn answered him with the flame of response to his kiss she liked orders from this mans army  deloued ouea emice de uo ore if the big frame house on vine street could have had any human reactions it would have hidden its face and trembled with foreboding ann tennis and tod morgan were both rushing home from college on the heels of two letters and to make it worse they were heading toward the same home ann re-read her letter on the train and at every reading became more angry if possible she and tod had kept up a con- tinual battle since they were children dear ann her mother had written ive put off telling you for three months knowing how you felt about tod morgan his father and i were married very quiet- ly danny and sam seem to get along marvelously- sure ann thought bitterly her brother danny was seventeen and just a kid in high school nothing ever worried him very much but im different she stuffed the letter in her purse and grasped her overnight case stalking towards home like a warrior advancing towards the scene of battle it was only a short distance and she hadnt wired her mother she was coming danny sighted her from where he slouched on the porch and shouted a greet- ing he descended upon her with a bear- hug that almost tripped her hey nancy the enemy is upon us he called to his mother the new mrs morgan came hurrying out and cried nervously you should have wired us dear and wed have come to meet you never mind it wasnt far lets go in i want to wash up i feel wrinkled and grimy looking unhappy her mother hurried along behind her nancy morgan was a small attractive woman in her late thirties she had light brown hair and large expressive grey eyes her son danny looked like her but ann was quite different ann was dark with silky black hair and dark eyes nancy had always been just a little in awe of her lovely young daughter for ann was serious forceful and very dynamic is he here ann demaned abruptly who darling her mother asked timidly she was smoothing out the wrinkles in her daughters jacket you know who i mean tod morgan now ann dear i hope you arent go- ing to be difficult yc each other as far back as i can re- member you dont expect me to whoop with joy because youve married his father sam and i considered all that her mother said he didnt think it was im- portant we wouldnt have sent for you but he was ordered to stay away from the office- poor sam ann exclaimed more kind- ly hes really a dear too bad tod couldnt be more like his father sam has been ordered to rest so we had to curtail our spending ann had the grace to feel a little guilty she had rather over-done her spring buy- ing her trunks were filled with smart new clothes sam and i pooled our money and bought the mill since he had that tract of north hill timber oh nancy ann wailed miserably if youd married into any other family but the morgans and what asked a cold voice from the door is the matter with the mor- gans tod her mother gasped uneasily i thought you were with your father  sweetheart stories i was he leaned a crooked elbow against the door and rested a surprisingly flaming red head against his palm his grey eyes were like cold steel as he glared back at defiant ann ann flashed you might have knocked before entering her eyes were so dark that they looked like pieces of black vel- vet why enter your voice can be heard all over the house in case anyone were interested enough to listen to nancy he said the trusty julia says dinner is ready lets go down nancy urged her wor- ried eyes on her daughter ann turned her back and went to the window go on i dont want any dinner im not hungry no wonder tod snapped with a disposition like yours it probably turns your stomach ann started to retort but danny inter- rupted her by calling grab the extension in the hall charlie walters is calling all right but lower your voice theres no use telling the neighbors she waited until tod and her mother went downstairs before lifting the receiver hello charlie she said and was really glad that he had called danny said you were coming his voice boomed happily over the wire to her so suppose we do dancing im still pretty crazy to see you ann bit her lip and sat thinking for a minute charlie was good company an evening at home promised to be trying there would be dannys playful remarks sam goodnatured and grinning in amuse- ment nancy fluttering about like a dis- turbed mother hen and tod superciliously superior in her present frame of mind she knew she couldnt endure it he said dont you want to see me darling of course she said without enthusi- asm but she wasnt so sure of that char- lie had developed into something of a prob- lem before she left she had certainly come home to a nice mess she hung up the receiver with a sigh she was tired and hated to take the trouble to dress but she at least had a new dress for the occasion royal blue vel- vet with silver clips for trim at the shoul- ders it made her dark eyes look deep purple a warm shower and a quick rub helped to lift her spirits she brushed her black curls until they looked like silk and then slipped the gorgeous new dress over her slim young shoulders her arms were bare and her hands were small and soft she knew that she looked quite lovely she knew oddly enough that it wasnt exactly all for charlie- she caught up her white fur jacket and switched off the light as she closed the door of her room softly behind her she found the family in the library she said gaily hello sam welcome into the family she patted his big shoulder under the brocaded smoking jacket going out dear nancy asked regret- fully i had hoped wed all be together this first evening youd better be glad shes not stay- ing danny contributed with an annoy- ing grin it would only lead to blood- shed ann didnt say anything she just stood at the door and looked at them sams big frame in the big comfortable chair with little brown haired nancy close be- side him tod with his long legs stretched towards the fire and danny slouched on a stool beside him cozy and comfortable but she had no place there she was too much of a disturbing element and it made her feel sad and irritated without tod she would have belonged too she drew down her crimson mouth and lowered her long silky lashes with a face as pretty as anns it was hard to look dis- agreeable she dropped a light kiss on nancys soft cheek and said goodnight sam and left them charlie had a new car it was waiting at the curb in all its grandeur charlie was a tall young man with blond hair brushed smooth and a broad face with a big mouth and even white teeth  beloved enemy this is a surprise charlie ann said sweeping her hand toward the car it looks as if youre coming up in the world  he grinned to manage a contracting business you dont have to go to college that had been rather a sore spot with him charlie had wanted her to stay at home so they could get married ann had hated saying  but she hadnt been at all sure she loved him harlie suggested well drive down  into the valley there isnt anything to do here in pottsville ive spent most of my time out of it since ive been made manager of darwin construction if we have time ill drive by and show you the apartments were building ann smiled and let him brag a little she thought of that conversation the next day they did have a good time the music was low and charlie was a good dancer the swing band was one of anns favor- ites charlie looked nice in his neat blue suit and shiny patent slippers but ann suddenly found that she was too tired to enjoy herself charlie took her home very reluctantly and he was a little sulky when she didnt want him to kiss her shed never objected before but when his face came close to hers she just didnt want him to touch her she couldnt explain it she was relieved when he drove away and she headed for the library a light was still going and she wondered who was waiting up for her through the open door she spied dan- ny sitting with his back against one arm of the easy chair with one long leg swing- ing over the other side he was wheezing a low tuneless little whistle his hair was surprisingly brushed flat and his ears looked freshly washed and shining she noticed that he had on a clean blue pull-over sweater insomnia danny she asked idly nope just waiting for company at this time of night she asked dubi- ously sure tods girl friends coming down he just got the wire and hes gone down to meet her nancys up getting her room ready huh ann grunted i didnt know tod had a girl friend danny clucked ill say he has and shes some babe he has her picture her names polly norton and she dances in a chorus i guess they plan to get mar- ried old sam nearly fainted but our gallant nancy came to the rescue and smoothed over the troubled waters ann almost dropped her white fur jacket she had never thought of the high spirited tod marrying it hit her with such force she almost staggered danny watched her and remarked grin- ning which goes to show you cant trust your own grandma whod have thought of tod falling for a blond babe in the chorus ann went up the stairs without answer- ing this was certainly one for the book and she couldnt understand why she didnt like it she wanted to think it over and find out that is if she could come to any conclusion which she doubted things happened fast there was a crunch of wheels on the drive a car door slammed ann sat still and listened a few minutes later there she heard a high excited voice in the hall saying oh mrs morgan youre just like i thought you would be tod has told me all about you ann closed the door hurriedly and sat down on the edge of her bed she felt tired and miserable she hated the world in general and herself in particular it almost sounded as if she were jealous but that of course was certainly out of the question perhaps things would look different in the morning tut they didnt she awoke to a damp and chilly morning the house was cold and unearthly quiet ann jumped out of bed and slipped into a green wool dress with gold metal buttons she blushed her hair vigorously and tied it back hastily with a narrow velvet ribbon of the same color  sweetheart stories she found tod below in the dining room just finishing his breakfast wheres nancy she asked of the smiling julia julia was the maid of all work and her teeth shone sparkling and white in her fat goodnatured black face she said laws honey you know how your mamma hates to get up in the morn- ing it was true nancy had only complied as a concession to her daughter have some bacon tod offered shov- ing a platter absent-mindedly across the white cloth towards her he was half buried behind the morning paper ann could just see the tip of his red head orange juice and toast julia she or- dered ignoring him the paper came down and he observed her with more interest cuting down on your figure that wouldnt be necessary she snapped glad that the sheer wool dress fitted her so becomingly im not trying to get in the chorus now look here tod exploded his eyes were as sharp as cold steel youre slapping at polly and you dont know a thing about her youre just being a cat so suppose you just leave her out of it he slammed down the paper shoved back his chair angrily and stalked out of the dining room ann had the grace to admit to herself that the remark was really uncalled for but this morning she felt like fighting tod neednt make remarks like that to her he certainly wasnt what you could call agree- able she didnt have to meet polly- oh mrs morgan youre just- just a dripping line she shrugged drank her orange juice and then tossed down the white napkin shed just decided she would go down to the mill and see how things were going an hour later she found danny and tod talking in sams private office they looked surprised to see her well sherlock she said crisply what have you found upon your tour of inspec- tion what are you doing down here tod asked rudely as he got up grudgingly and offered her a chair im going to help run this business just in case you havent figured that out for yourself in the meantime and what tod said emphasizing each word vehemently do you know about the lumber business just as much as you and its as much my business as yours considering my mother sunk all her money into it danny said oh for petes sake stop snapping at one another and lets see if we can figure what can be done about this situation tod picked up a pencil and reached for the papers before him as i see it we have a yard full of lumber and canceled contracts ann said well people are still build- ing she was remembering her con- versation with charlie and the new apart- ments little orders wont help to get us out of the red weve got to have a big one danny said thats right he got up and went to the door im going out to talk to old stan hes been worried for the last few days the big saws have been acting up and you cant depend on them hes been showing me things says i have a natural flare for mechanics he added with studied carelessness stan- ann repeated thoughtfully you mean the big fellow with the large family sure danny nodded hes got ten kids and hes plenty proud of them his wife aint feeling so good now so he tells me- well for goodness sakes  ann ex- claimed disgustedly whats the matter tod snapped i suppose you dont like a big family well it looks to me- ann began heatedly oh for petes sake- danny inter- rupted her why are you two fighting you arent having a family thats right tod agreed he was  beloved enemy silent while danny went whistling out of the office ann stared at tods back and felt a mo- ment of panic hed marry polly and have lots of children theyd be freckled faced and red-headed the boys would have that crazily quirked brow just like their father theyd all have quick tempers and eyes like grey mist when they were in a good humor but be cold as steel when they were angry about something im going out tod said sharply and went out slamming the door of the office i wonder where hes going she thought probably back to the house on a pretext of consulting sam but really to see polly hed better tend to this business she added grimly forgetting that that was what she had come down for herself she got out of the swivel chair and went out into the outter office to see sams secre- tary fussy little miss simpson if you were going to run a business you had to know something about it shed show this smart tod morgan miss simpson was a small woman with a tired homely face she wore a crisp white shirtwaist and a black skirt just a little longer than the current fashion is there anything i can help you with miss ann she asked and smiled through the thick lenses of her rimless glasses ann sat down and listened while she ex- plained a lot of figures that she was sure were quite important it sounded dull and anns head ached a little miss simpson said we had two contracts pending either one would have cleared enough to take care of the stock on hand mr morgan was rather doubtful of this one on darwin ann jumped and sat up quickly miss simpson went on explaining these bids were too low but if completed on a certain date there was to be a cash bonus now this other one on shipley was for federal housing tod took that- im just interested in this ann inter- rupted but miss ann- miss simpson be- gan but ann didnt hear her she took the contract and rushed back into sams office jammed on her smart green felt hat and tore into her jacket she dashed past miss simpson before that surprised little mouse could utter a word and was out of the office leaving her staring helplessly ann look around quickly and spied dan- nys battered looking roadster he called it the mayflower and it certainly looked it she felt a little silly riding in a car with dont park here and not a dope in a car load painted in glaring white letters across the sides but she was in a hurry and couldnt afford to be choosy she drove across town to the darwin office she parked on a side street and hoped no one would see her getting out of that monstrosity she was lucky enough to find charlie walters in his very impressive office he looked very handsome and quite at home behind the polished brown desk why ann im delighted to see you he exclaimed she took the contract from her pocket and spread it out before him this isnt a friendly call charlie she advised him i mean business he looked down at the paper and then seemed a little at a loss for a moment oh that- he said doubtfully- were still thinking it over she saw it wasnt going to be easy she changed the subject quickly and soon they were laughing and talking about personal things and enjoying themselves an hour later she looked at her watch and cried look ive got to be running if you knew how important this was youd settle it now and be done with it he said marry me ann and lets for- get this business no she said stubbornly dont you have the authority to sign these contracts charlie that was hitting below the belt because she knew his pride of course ann i will but i think youre taking an unfair advantage-mixing sentiment with busi- ness he took up the pen and scrawled his name at the bottom hurriedly sweetheart stories would it do any good to say that youre the loveliest thing that ever happened she let that pass but she didnt feel that entiment really had anything to do with is hesitancy and she didnt like it when he tried to kiss her as she was leaving her feet fairly flew down the walk and she climbed into the mayflower in relief glad to get through that interview it left a bad taste in her mouth and she couldnt explain it she and charlie had been good enough friends before but this seemed a little different maybe she had been un- fair-but he seemed so odd so evasive about it the mood passed and ann felt a lift as she neared the office she put her hand into the pocket of her tan sports coat and felt the paper crackle it gave her a re- newed feeling of satisfaction she guessed that this would show tod morgan who was capable of running the morgan mill company office she didnt stop to an- alyse why showing him had taken on such grave importance she parked the mayflower at the main entrance and jumped out slamming the door in her hurry she felt like the con- quering hero as she bustled into miss simp- sons office and waved a gay hand at her she burst into the inner office without knocking again she found tod and danny in deep consultation there were several papers spread out in front of them beloved enemy there you are she said triumphantly and tossed the paper on the desk before them danny picked it up and unfolded it his change of expression was swift and dis- turbing well holy cow he ejaculated what is it tod demanded leaning forward the darwin contract ann snapped or shall i read it for you danny clapped his hand to his head and almost howled for petes sake ann why didnt you tell us what you were doing why should i her tone was frosty they certainly werent reacting as she had expected you wanted a contract didnt you yes but not this one tod barked their credits too shaky youre saying that to be hateful no hes not danny informed her quietly were in a mess now for sure tod got the contract from shipley then it looks like were all set she ventured inside she was raging they were certainly lacking in consideration a fine thing when youre sided against by your own brother we cant fill both these orders tod remarked and darwin wont let you wiggle out of this one well have to try danny suggested put on a double shift and throw a crew up on the north hill timber sam was saving lets go home and eat something tod insisted im hungry and tired and i had one hell of a time with old shipley he turned a cold stare on ann speculatively i dont imagine you used the same tactics on charlie he said with a half grin xd morgan she flashed i think youre the most hateful spiteful and conceited person it has been my misfor- tune to meet his remark had been too near the truth for comfort oh save it until after youre married danny said rudely and slammed out tod made it worse by throwing back his head and shouting with laughter she gave him a withering look and stalked out  the house on vine street seemed charged with excitement sam was sitting out on the lawn and ann could see his regal white head above the back of the wicker rocker there was a wool robe over his knees and he looked dignified and pleasant in his blue smoking jacket polly was with him she looked like a ray of sunshine as she danced around on the grass for him she had on a bright pink dress with a tight waist and full short skirt and her yellow curls bobbed gayly about her slender young shoulders they could hear her laughing and it sounded like the tinkle of little silver bells tod smiled indulgently looking at him ann felt her heart suddenly turn over nancy was in the hall to meet her ann she smiled happily polly is out with sam and shes the sweetest little thing imaginable shes as pretty as a picture and not a day over seventeen shes never had a home her parents died young and im so glad shes enjoying this ann smiled at her mother but it looked a little sick she felt tired and grumpy and ill tempered the boys hadnt appreciated her help and now it seemed that her mother was getting along nicely without her too nancy didnt notice her mood in her own excitement wash up dear she begged julia has lunch almost ready ann went up to her room and hated her- self thoroughly she got up and determined- ly looked at her own reflection in the mirror the black hair was just as silky and shiny the red lips just as full and crimson but her mouth drooped at the corners she felt ashamed for she looked quite disagreeable and to make it worse she had an odd let-down feeling she slipped off the green wool and got into a pale blue dimity with pink ribbons it didnt exactly fit her mood but she wanted to look pretty as soon as she got it on she felt better she was a pretty even if she was older good heavens shed never compared herself with another girl before jiteeting polly wasnt the ordeal she had imagined it they came face to sweetheart stories face in the lower hall and polly let out an exclamation of delight at sight of her oh youre ann dannys sister what gorgeous black hair it looks just like the silk my grandmother used to use to em- broider ann smiled back into her excited blue eyes and warmed to the girl unconsciously polly was genuine and not the least effected she really meant it dinner turned out to be quite fun pol- ly had a quaint gift of imitation and she kept up a running fire of chatter with a sprinkling of wit she mimiced her man- ager with his broken english and finished up by imitating tod and danny she kept sam chuckling from his chair at the head of the table and nancy smil- ing happily beside him danny watched with bewitched eyes and tod laughed indulgently and saw that julia kept pollys plate filled although she ate scarcely anything after lunch the famliy moved towards the library but tod took his hat followed by the adoring polly ann looked after them and felt her knees weak and her heart pounding painfully she stared at the back of tods shining red head as if shed never seen him before she was in love with the brute and she was helpless to do anything about it in love with him why i always have been she thought the next few weeks were a maze of work and worry the morgan mill fairly teemed with activity the yards were full of trucks hauling in freshly cut logs and load- ing out with the finished lumber ann under the guidance of miss simpson found that there was more work than they both could accomplish danny was busy with stan inside the mill and tod had little time to spend inside the office once when she was so tired she could drop and her eyes ached from checking the rows of long figures tod strode in like a breath of fresh air anns spirits lifted her nose was shiny her white collar rumpled and her hands were smeared with ink he stopped beside the desk without a word and looked whimsically down at her  ann felt her heart begin to swell and her eyes became misty he gave her shoulder a friendly pat and then passed on through into the office and that was the last she saw of him before evening why did she have to find she loved him just when hed found polly and polly was so sweet that night in desperation she went out with charlie but she was sorry she had because she was so tired she begged off and came home early she just couldnt dance a step when her heart was aching no one was even fun without tod sam had retired but nancy was sitting in his rocker and beside her was tod and polly tods head was in pollys lap and she was sitting on a heap of pillows polly put one finger to her lips and said shh poor darling hes simply worn out he needs a wife to take care of him the words burned across anns heart with fresh pain and she suddenly wanted to be close to her mother not that nancy would know what was wrong with her or even if she did could do anything about it but they couldnt talk now a nn felt frightened ard lonely she said i think ill go up to bed and fled from the sight of tods head against polly she met danny in the upper hall and he looked cross and sleepy in his terry robe and leather slippers he was just hanging up the telephone receiver tod up he asked yawning stans home and theres trouble with the ma- chinery- ann nodded hes down stairs with polly a pained expression flashed across dan- nys face and was gone in a minute ill dress while you tell him he suggested tod must have been awakened by the phone for he was standing beside the door with an arm about polly the little honey blond head came to his shoulder and she was rubbing her face against his arm i heard the phone he said as soon as he saw ann whats the bad news ive been expecting it beloved enemy he listened to her explanation and then objected when she insisted upon going with them she wasnt exactly dressed for the occasion she wasnt she had to admit she had on a crisp yellow organdy with a skirt full of tiny ruffles it had open butterfly sleeves and was tied with tiny blue ribbons with her dark hair in a long wave against her shoulder she looked very lovely and for the first time she thought by tods ex- pression that he realized it when danny came down ann threw a long blue cloth coat around her shoulders she caught up the full skirt and slipped into the car between tod and danny being so close to tod made her feel a little light- headed and crazy the seat was narrow and she could feel his hard young body against her side he had put an arm across the back of the seat she thought shakily id like to lean my head back against his shoulder just like any love-sick school girl but wouldnt tod be astounded the very self-sufficient and quarrelsome ann going suddenly weak all he would do would be to make some crack probably she sat very stiff and straight beside him and he didnt seem to notice her at all his mind was on the business ahead at the mill they filed into the quiet building the workmen were standing about smoking and talking something had gone wrong with the power system danny threw off his coat and went to work i wish stan were here he said regretfully where is he tod wanted to know wife sick again ann deduced sagely tod gave her an impatient look as much as to say he supposed she didnt approve so she shrank back in the shadows why do i always have to say the wrong thing she wailed to herself unhappily i suppose quarreling is such a habft with us that even if we could get married wed forget that there was such a thing as love and quarrel right on out to the end of it well tod didnt want her probably that was why she had felt so quarrelsome toward him all these years  she stood around for awhile and felt miserable and unwanted going back into the office she put her head down on tods desk and let the tears slip through her long black silky lashes i love him she unwillingly admitted i love him so much thats all i can think of and even if tod wanted me i couldnt bear to hurt polly shes such a baby she must have finally dropped off to sleep for it was some time later that she felt a hand on her shoulder and an amused voice saying wake up sleepyhead im going for a cup of hot coffee and ill take you home with me she jumped up in fright and swayed a little she had been dreaming that she was falling she caught frantically at tods sleeve to steady herself his arms went around her and he pressed her against his shoulder poor baby he said gently i guess i startled you be still for a moment until you get your eyes open his face was against her hair and her crazy heart tripped and then flung itself against her ribs and began pounding trembling she held on to him afraid to let go the excited blood rushed over her like spreading fire tod wasnt someone you could touch casually he was lightning fire and danger packed in one her yellow organdy was crushed and the black hair was tumbled about her flushed face the blue cloak lay in a little heap at her feet she shivered and tod put his hand on her bare arm here let me get your coat youre shivering he stooped still holding her with one hand and lifted the garment he slipped it around her and pulled it under her chin then he put a hand on the silky black head and then pulled her close and kissed her the pressure was light at first-she knew he had intended it to be merely a friendly gesture-but at the close contact he seemed to lose his self-control and crushed her against him anns lips were warm and sweet under his and she returned fire with an equal warmth until her head rang sweetheart stories tod drew back and looked down at her his face looked puzzled youre sweet to kiss ann he said wonderingly then ruined it by adding sweet to kiss when youre not busy quarreling a nn brushed his hands aside and rushed from him down the hall and into the car before he could follow her he had looked surprised and a little embar- rassed she felt she just couldnt stand it if he started apologizing she felt like laying her head down and howling at the futility of it the next morning nancy didnt wake her around noon polly came peeking in her door and said darling are you awake may i come in and talk to you polly looked like an escaped sunbeam her orchid print was of soft material and clung to her perfectly rounded young fig- ure her honey gold hair was loose and swung in a cloud around her slim shoul- ders she came in and perched on the edge of anns bed and said honey its a crime to look as pretty as you do in the morning and i simply adore that darling rose bed jacket you look just like a picture done in technicolor ann smiled at the extravagant praise and stretched like a lazy kitten have you ever been in love polly asked her unexpectedly ann sat up in surprise and looked at her of course she answered simply polly swung one slender foot childishly and her blue eyes were thoughtful does it leave you mixed up with all kinds of un- certain feelings ann nodded love hadnt brought her any joy or pleasure but it had left her uncertain and confused all right polly sighed i was afraid youd say it was just because im so young that i dont know my own mind ann said no i dont think that has anything to do with it if you love someone you just do and it changes the world for you and not always as you imagine or want it ann thought of tods kiss and a longing to be loved nearly set her wild still you couldnt wreck a beautiful house of dreams for a girl like polly not if you were real- ly a person of honor and not if the per- son you loved was tod morgan and you never even knew what he might be feeling about you polly continued when i think of him i feel all trembly inside and i cant wait un- til i see him and then when im near him i feel all fluttery and funny- oh i guess its love ann said laugh- ing at the childish description laughed even though there was a pain hidden be- neath it well polly began and then said has- tily oh i forgot to tell you nancy said julia was fixing your breakfast ann jumped out of bed and peeled back the covers she was glad to get off the subject of love the thought of tods com- ing marriage wasnt something she could think about calmly shed certainly have to go away somewhere and she was in a panic for fear her emotion betray her to the family she went down to the mill and found that operations had resumed tod came striding through the office in his dusty brown cords and boots and paused to speak to miss simpson he looked tired and worried ann was busy hanging up the blue cloth coat and tried to keep her back to him she straightened her gray wool dress with the leather belt and red yarn trimming he was saying this loss of time just about finishes our chances of having a full order on both contracts we didnt have enough time anyway to make tomorrows deadline miss simpson said and well be left with a large supply on hand and we cant afford that he sighed well we wont worry about it until it is a certainty nphe rest of the day and the long night a was like a nightmare it was a losing battle and they both knew it to make it worse word was sent for someone to come up to the tract of north hiil timber tod  beloved enemy couldnt leave so danny went up to see about it stans wife was worse and he couldnt leave her so the machinery took that occa- sion to get balky tod rolled up his sleeves and tried to find the trouble ann watched while he got streaks of grease on his face and across the spotless white shirt she wore a pair of slacks of hunters green with belted jacket she stood close to him hoping to get a little comfort out of it and not caring if the place was full of grease he said i wish id have been smart and studied mechanics in school when i had a chance to then you just as well send the men home i simply dont know a thing about this ann did reluctantly and then when the lights were snapped off the mill looked pitifully cold and deserted tod led the way into the office and flung himself into a chair and yawned loudly he was so sleepy he was groggy go home to bed ann suggested tim- idly ill stay and watch for danny tod shook his head and stretched his long legs in their brown leather boots he should be back any minute he loked at his watch see its almost day- light maybe thats danny now ann ex- claimed startled at the pounding that came from the front entrance she flew to the door but when it was opened there stood an excited miss simp- son she was enveloped in a long black coat of an indefinite shape her hat was askew and she looked in a flurry of excite- ment oh she panted the most awful thing has happened ive heard through a friend of mine that charlie walters has left town and that darwin has been thrown into bankruptcy well tod scratched a tousled red head and grunted thats good and bad we couldnt fill their order and now were left with what we have on hand and no way to meet the payroll  ann felt sick lets go home she said faintly they were outside and just leaving when danny drove up in the rattling mayflower whats wrong and why are we shut down he yelled ann came over to the car beside tod where he stood with one foot on the run- ning board and squared her shoulders its my fault she admitted i was in too big a hurry to show how smart i was ive been like that all my life she added bitterly i fussed with tod just to show him i was superior and ive loved nancy to distraction but ive always dom- inated her unmercifully shut up you nitwit danny growled i want you to listen we arent broke- not the morgan milling you havent given me a chance to tell you what i found out up on the north hill tract tod was looking at ann and not paying any attention to danny you arent to blame for what happened ann he said i am because i was all het up to manage the place before you got a chance at it say danny exploded will you two dopes be good enough to listen that north hill tract that sam has been sav- ing turned out to be walnut he had their attention now and he laughed excited- ly no wonder it wouldnt do for your federal housing the government wants it for gunstocks yes yes of course breathed the as- tonished miss simpson now please take me home i feel the need of a little stimu- lant- ill take her danny offered and they jerked away in the trusty mayflower ann was very still as they drove home and stopped beside the white picket gate on vine street tod turned to her gravely ive just discovered something rather astounding she hoped he wouldnt harp back on the subject of charlie ive just found that life would be in- teresting and full of spice if a guy like me had a gal like you to work along beside him sure wed fight but wed kiss and make up oh well theres no use thinking about it his voice shook a little sure i remember-theres still polly sweetheart stories he turned in the seat and looked at ann and her throat hurt at what she read in the bewildered grey eyes a mist sprang over hers my darling he said gently why couldnt we have found out about this sooner ann just sat there there were no words with which to answer they had wasted all their precious time quarreling when they should have been loving would it do any good if i said i loved you he asked hesitatingly and that i think youre the loveliest thing that ever happened she dropped her brimming eyes and shook her dark head no we musnt it will only make it harder tod lets keep this love of ours sweet and untar- nished polly trusts you and we have no right to be selfish they got out of the car and walked slowly forward ann felt as though her heart were dying their steps sounded so loud to her strained ears that they were almost deafening nancy was in the hall come into the library she cried and her voice was shak- ing ann thought desperately i hope she isnt going to scold us this was so new and terrible that she felt she couldnt dis- cuss it with anyone even the white-faced nancy tod turned nancy towards him come on he ordered her out with it it cant be as bad as you think it is oh dear nancy wailed but it is its the children children ann repeated it was very confusing you know dan and polly theyve eloped and left me to tell you  ann suddenly sat down because her knees were too weak to hold her she put her head down on her arm and began to cry weakly when you just have built yourself up to be self-sacrificing and then have your happiness tossed unexpectedly back in your lap its very upsetting now dont you worry about that nan- cy tod was saying just let me handle this please nancy ann heard the door close on her mothers retreating figure tod dropped down on a stool beside her he pulled her over into his arms and held her stop crying sweetheart he said gent- ly according to the rules this is the happy ending and with your face all wet with tears how do you expect me to propose romantically she laughed a little as she mopped her face with his big white handkerchief if tod was going to kiss her she certainly didnt want anything to spoil it tvtothing did when his mouth came  down over hers time stopped and her heart set up a terrific clamor his kiss was like charged lightning and sent heady ex- cited little thrills racing over her he raised his head whew he ex- claimed honey that just about did it i guess by now you get the idea that im pretty crazy to marry you she hid her flushed face against his neck and said oh tod well have such terrible children he laughed uproariously well kids wouldnt be any good without tempers and then by the way what started us quarreling in the beginning he added of course i knew that at least it brought me to your haughty atten- tion and took your mind off of charlie i never liked that guy she fell her crazy heart lifting happily it started when i was ten in school and you sat behind me-you used to poke me in the back with a pencil and id ignore you- was that it sure i remember i put a little frog down your back figuring it would get me some attention- it did ann admitted but lets not bother with the past tod im anxious about the future id just rather youd kiss me darling he did it took a long time and he didnt need any other invitation nancy finally looked in and smiled in relief  no time far sailors by jan holland beginners penny told the sailor scornfully take the outer edge penny knew a number of items that went together and made sense good common sense like ham and eggs like hot dogs and mustard like thanks- giving and mince pie she could under- stand them get a warm comfortable feeling out of thinking about them even while she laced and tightened the white skating shoes over her slim ankles for a spin that would take the kinks out of her office-cramped legs they sounded right but a sailor and a girl that item was different that was a combination that made her amber eyes turn almost black with anger that made her wide sweet mouth into a straight red line that made her wish with a quickly swallowed sob that she had never met andy martin a slim-hipped ensign in navy blues he could have said couldnt he wait for me penny only two years and the navy says ok for new ensigns to mar- ry wait for me and she would have waited but andy martin who laughed easily had loved as easily and then sailed away and a girl with soft blond hair and a sweetheart stories quick warm heart who had been in the years they had grown up together pal adviser finally sweetheart-well a girl like that could watch and wait in vain for a certain ship that never nosed its grim prow into the same navy yard again ill never she thought grimly with a tug at the cowhide laces go through that again never ive no time for sailors penny stood up from the bench snapped back one foot to release the spinning wheels then rose on her toes like a dancer and was off in a smooth glide that rushed faster and faster until she seemed a carved figurehead straining against rush- ing wind her flowing motion made the other skaters in the big rink seem to stand still head down she rounded the curve of the polished oval with a smooth shift of balance-and decided she could do with tightening her right shoe she turned out one foot to slow her slippery progress the floor rose-smacked her with vi- cious force the ceiling lights swung in a complete arc and there was the clash and clatter of skates making quick de- tours to keep from running over her her single impression was that a mack truck had hit her before she fell she had felt the impact of something big and hard and very close jam against her as she had slowed then had come the blitz -and a million stars testified to the fact that her brain and her back had been jarred out of all proportion to being flat- tened out by a mere fall that whooshing sound was her breath as it crowded back into her protesting lungs and that iron grip under her arms must come from a crane-the kind that lifts hugh bales of stuff onto waiting decks at the wharf the stars receded-maybe they were just the lights that swung back to the ceiling where they belonged she was aware that she had been picked jp aware that someone was holding her upright she was aware that she looked up into a pair of contrite blue eyes in a tanned face and an uncertain smile that made a very pleasant thing of his broad mouth her hands stung where they bad hit the floor and the blood still sang in- side her ears she made a brave begin- ning of a smile her lips tremulous with the effort not to wince then her clear- ing eyes became angrily aware that the slim muscular body was encased in a tight tunic that bulged over an expand- ing chest that the endless legs wore bell- cuffed trousers that this mack truck that had run into her this iron crane that had swung her up off the floor as though she were a feather-was a sailor a sailor who was saying gosh-you skate like the wind i never thought youd veer course  she moved swiftly skated backward until her knees encountered the bench against the wall and sat down beginners she scornfully told his towering figure take the outside edge there was a quick change in the eager eyes above her pennys scrambled wits recalled the blue marbles she had played with as a kid they were like his eyes which raked her from the top of her tousled hair down the slim lines of her beige covert suit to the tips of her wheeled shoes he missed nothing probably not even the racing of her heart so you dont- his voice was delib- erate maddeningly slow -you dont like sailors my mistake he wheeled touched his finger in mock salute and was off in a glide that took him swiftly out of hearing so he missed the gasp of surprise that widened pennys eyes and made the blood change her delicate skin to the soft rich pink how did he know that her eyes followed the weaving figure of blue through the maze of skaters-those shoulders broad enough to block a door moving with easy grace the fair head held above them as though he were reaching for the sky blood scorched her cheeks again boy can he skate she said the grudging words out loud but in the noise of the rolling skates no one noticed and she had called him a beginner-a rude remark even when it was true in a moment she was on her feet brush- ing her suit into smooth lines again over  no time for sailors her hips wanting to be trim and cool and perfect when those cold eyes came travel- ing her way again they had to when he had circled the room and was on the home stretch she was a swift arrow in the moving stream of skaters just before he reached the bench cutting into the nar- rowed inner circle of skaters she knew that her tawny head would move faster even than that fast company-that more than one pair of eyes moving above slow- er feet would look admiringly at her as she flowed past maybe that pair of cool ice-blue eyes might find it hard not to watch also she found those eyes looking down on her head pacing her finally matching her rhythm they went once around the com- plete rink ignoring each other spots of color were high on pennys cheeks if this sailor or any sailor thought she was going to notice him he was mistaken she had wasted enough time on the navy lesson one she sternly reminded herself is that sailors love lightly and often les- son two-that ensigns do the same henceforth shed walk-or skate-an even line alone her heart would be carefully boarded up and marked closed youre penny warren he was say- ing swaying to her slightest change in rhythm he was looking straight ahead so that she couldnt see his eyes even after he had startled her with this announce- ment into looking up at him you use the north elevator at the custom house and get off at the sixth floor ive inquired just for the record-im dirk petersen assigned to the recruiting station on the second floor i just wanted you to know that i wasnt staging a pickup she lost him at the curve because she skated on and he skated out she couldnt stop to turn-it wasnt allowed-and she couldnt skate with her head turned like a turkey looking back she would only run into disaster again when she came back to the spot where he had disappeared she went through the line to the bench but there was no sailor there only the memory of a pair of big hands that had the strength of steel and were very gen- tle only the memory of a hard big chest against which she had collided and been shaken up there was something else miss- ing too the little sign over her heart heart that had been marked closed the big white arrows lettered join the navy wound from the entrance of the custom house through the black- tiled halls up the rotunda of the wide stairs to the second floor penny had ac- cepted them always as she had accepted the bustle and excitement that were constant in the corridors since december waiting for the elevator her eyes fol- lowed the signs curving up the stairs no wonder the boys who streamed up those stairs with eager faces and grim mouths found the invitation irresistible it was all she could do to keep her own feet from running up too a quick grin shadowed her lips as she stood in the little puddle of rain she had brought in with her her eyes darted up and down the cor- ridor sailors it seemed never used the elevators their long blue-clad legs made quick work of the steps instead if dirk petersen came barging in this morning while she waited for the elevator to stop for her shed act as if she had never set eyes on him the fact that she had tossed in her bed the night before and had dreamed she was tossing on the high seas-a big blond sailor warning dont veer course-had nothing to do with it he wouldnt know-and she would never tell him at the same time each time she thought of his accusing so you dont like sailors  her face burned and she longed to find out how he knew the way he said it it sounded as though she were unpatriotic or snobbish or rude-or all three she stopped scowling and flashed her sunniest smile as the elevator stopped  morning miss warren yall look just like an angel in that white thingamajig covering your head taint tar from the truth either the old man mutttered deep in his throat and his gnarled hand made sweetheart stories a barrier across the space where penny stood so that the wet clothes of the in- rushing crowd would not touch her pen- ny made herself as small as possible against the wall of the elevator she didnt want anyone to notice that jerry was taking care of her he was such a dear later at the noon hour she stood at the entrance of the building out of sorts with the weather it seemed hardly worth- while to take her usual saturday brisk walk for lunch at her favorite tearoom with a shrug she ducked her head rushed around the corner toward the drug store she was inside the door breathing hard from the tussle with the wind and the rain throwing back the white hood of her raincoat before she saw that the place was full of sailors with her pale skin peach-blown from the exertion her eyes wide with surprise and uncertainty she looked particularly lovely a chorus of voices hailed her over here honey-chile    make way for a stream-lined job and a dozen other obvious but good-natured invitations panicky she turned toward the door her face scarlet a shadow loomed beside her and a deep voice with a laugh in it said very loudly pipe down sailors and in the same loud voice as though for their benefit ok penny lets go the door was opened by a hand above her head her elbow was grasped firmly in a big warm hand and she was outside again the rain felt wonderful on her hot cheeks as she realized that it was dirk petersen who had saved her from the joshing at the same time she realized that he had his nerve with her-calling her pen- ny-taking her in tow as though he owned her at the corner however when he let go her arm and said stiffly youll be all right now the boys didnt mean any harm i knew you didnt like sailors she realized with a shock that she didnt want him to go at all he would have left but her voice stopped him she turned squarely toward him her mind racing how do you know she asked furiously that i dont like sailors what makes you so sure just because- from his towering height he looked down at her the white transparent rain- coat pulled close to her slim waist was unbuttoned her dress the color of a daffodil stalk was open at the throat and caught with a large topaz pin in a sharp v at the base of her throat dirks eyes didnt quite reach the point of the pin they lingered on the chin tilted up to him at the corners of her mouth where the hidden dimples etched slight shadows the icy film in his blue eyes slowly melted maybe the warm june rain fall- ing softly around them had something to do with it ill tell you how i know he said ive watched you for the last three weeks -since ive been detailed here youre darn sweet to that old crippled man who runs the elevator you never run by the newsboy outside the door without buying a paper-lots of times you dont even wait for change youve kept that re- volving door from spinning too fast be- hind the back of people older and slower than you youre always doing some- thing nice for someone you like people my kind of a girl so- he took a deep breath -so when you acted like a spoiled brat just because i skated into you i knew it couldnt be me that made you mad his eyes traveled soberly down the long blue length of him and came back to her it must have been the uni- form   tte watched the bright color flame high in her cheeks watched her wet her lips with the tip of her tongue before she stammered thats not true-that is- you dont understand- the words dwindled and died away what could she tell him her honesty made her admit to herself that he had spoken the truth but to put it that way -to make it look as though she despised the uniform of the united states navy- why why it made her hate him  no time for sailors she found her tongue again youre so smart-you add everything up and make it come out right-for yourself but youre not smart enough maybe i dont like men in uniform maybe i have a very good reason not to like them maybe i have reason to believe that a man in uni- form thinks a girl is fair game just be- cause he has other things on his mind he forgets the rules he thinks the war is like a big football game-fun excite- ment glamor color cheering crowds-and goodbye ill be seeing you she had to stop for breath and to swal- low the angry lump in her throat she looked away quickly so that she had an excuse to biink her eyes shed be darned if shed cry so she missed the expression on the big sailors face missed the smile that came out of hiding on his wide mouth her chin was suddenly cupped in a gentle hand turned upward toward him again gosh he said softly what a heel that sailor was the look in his eyes added and what a dope she twisted away he wasnt a sailor no it was quick hopeful an ensign she added and was im- mediately sorry oh it had a flat sound he didnt move but penny had the distinct im- pression that he had stepped away new he asked penny made herself busy shaking out the folds of her wet raincoat yes she answered shortly there was another breath above her it wasnt a happy sound hell be back said dirk matter-of-factly she looked up at him quickly her eyes hopeful though she wasnt aware of that how did he know how did this man know so much he had been clever in analysing her reaction to him yester- day maybe he knew even more than he told well- he twisted the pancake sailor hat in long fingers well-i guess ill take my walk walk she was making conversation like a silly kid because she still didnt want him to go away in the rain sure he grinned at her and it sent a glow through her that she would have to recapture later-now she had to keep on talking it was fun exciting sure he repeated dont you like to walk in the rain mans holiday isnt it she laughed and it was a lovely mingled with the warm misty rain the smell of wet lilacs from the vendor at the corner and the wet swish of taxi wheels hurrying past look out with the lightest touch he had lifted her out of the way of splash- ing a taxi churned up for a split second she had the impression of having wings they walked toward the parkway it was his favorite walk he told her-out toward the river where he sometimes helped kids fish with their home-made fishing lines or just lay on the grass and watched students from the university practice in their long graceful sculls they were developing into a good team he told her sometimes he timed their stroke oh yes-to her quick look of question- ing-hed rowed at college by the time they reached the river penny was hungry they had stopped at a stand on the way bought apples which penny had stowed in the bag she car- ried a bag of pretzels which to pennys delight dirk had made disappear some- where under the tight confines of his blouse without showing and a handful of choc- olate bars which he carried carefully in- side his hat penny found herself holding her hands deep inside her pockets for fear shed give in to a crazy desire to find out with her fingers whether his hair was as smooth as it looked he spread the newspaper which he had kept tightly rolled up under one arm un- der a big tree and sitting under it they ate ravenously the smell of fresh wet leaves of a river in the rain would stay with penny as long as she lived to be brought out and savored whenever the first year of the war should be mentioned to be remembered with a deep stirring of sweetheart stories the senses that day she had come to know dirk petersen-sailor im off duty until four he told her crushing a pretzel to make crumbs around the base of the tree for birds who would forage later then im on detail again until eight- he looked at her expectant- ly-like a little boy who wants a cookie but wouldnt ask for it she laughed at him all right sailor ill be at the skating rink practicing that stop you interrupted yesterday i thought she said shaking her head rue- fully that a ton of bricks had hit me he helped her to rise no- he con- tradicted her his voice low and his hands were warm holding both of hers tightly -no the ton of bricks hit me she had to look up so she could laugh it off but the laugh caught in her throat at the look in his blue eyes-as though a thousand candles had been lit in their depths burning deeply steadily she was close again to that broad hard chest thudding now with the beat of his heart-the thought scudded through the turmoil in her head it steadied her pulled her thoughts back into focus so that she pushed gently against him with her hands so that she could whisper dont spoil this- the candles in his eyes blazed flickered and were gone his hands were very gen- tle as they released her then were very busy tidying up the place where they had sat with his back turned he rolled the damp newspaper into a tight wad and said above the crackling of the paper forgot my rank i guess it was like a slap in the face pennys hand flew to her mouth-andy she had forgotten all about him and dirk had remembered for a moment as he released her she had been sorry that he hadnt kissed her that he hadnt brought those eager firm lips down on her trembling ones -even though she had begged him not to now she was fiercely glad he had listened what a sap she was  he would have thought her an easy mark-ready for a kiss with any man in uniform for some deep urgent reason she wanted him to think well of her she couldnt bear it if he thought of her she couldnt bear it if he thought of them as just a sailor and a girl-any girl she waited for him on the path with a little smile for him that told him nothing that didnt even admit that she had heard that rumbling forgot my rank- they had to hurry after they found out what time it was so that there wasnt much time for talking as they went toward the bus lines among the people there all they could manage was see you later with a grin that was white at the edges from dirk and a you bet that was apology and gratitude and something infinitely softer from penny the house was orderly and cool and very quiet when penny let herself in half an hour later she took off her raincoat in the hall stepped out of her shoes so that she wouldnt track mud over the carpet and stood staring at herself in the little mirror over the hall table for quite a while be- fore she became conscious of the white pa- per with penny scrawled across it staring at her from the table top darling her mother had written andy martins in town-his ship came in today-hes coming for you at six ive laid out your chiffon have fun dont stay out too late she had to sit down quickly so she sat on the floor and read the note again his ship came in today call for you at six- she waited for the excitement she waited for the wild sweet racing of her heart to tell her that andy was home again that he was coming for her andy but it didnt come there was a barrier- something held it back penny pushed the rumpled hair off her forehead bit her lip dug the nails into her palm something was wrong wasnt it something- of course she had a date with dirk she scrambled to her feet shed call him- explain then she realized she didnt know where to call him all she knew was that he was on detail it could mean any- thing no time for sailors up and down the hall she stalked she pulled off the heavy silver bracelet she wore -a favorite gesture when she was upset or tired or trying to think-and twirled it on her finger then came to the mirror again penny warren she told her image youre the two-timingest most scatter- brained thing that ever walked use your head its more than a place to park a permanent like a child counting she enumerated the facts on her slim fingers andy martin is your best friend hes home again he wants you to go stepping with him you cried your eyes out because he went out of your life didnt you well -hes in again so what so youre stub- bing your toes over the fact that you have half a date with a sailor who walked you through the rain and fed you pretzels and apples-and i might add didnt even kiss you she ran up the stairs came short of scalding herself under the shower to take her mind off her problem nibbed her slim lovely body into a contended glow and emerged from her room at five minutes of six looking like a slender flame-from the top of her shining amber curls down the exquisite shadings of the billowy chiffon that went from the yellow of candlelight at her shoulders to the deep orange heart of a fire around her feet the bell whirred on the stroke of six- it was andy martin who had taught her uncompromising promptness-and she flew down the steps lollypop the silly childish name came out in a stronger deeper baritone than shed expected andy had grown old- er in six months then she was scooped up and hugged to within an inch of her life he put her down finally let me look at you gosh youre pretty freckles gone hair piled up thinner than you were-good i like em lean-and a bit of an all right drag for an old man of the navy lets go tte snapped the brimmed cap on smartly held out the long weightless cape she had dropped on a chair the cape was made of layers of chiffon to match the dress when penny wore it she looked exactly as though some fairy godmother had waved a wand and covered her in shim- mering gold he drew her toward him penny he said huskily you havent kissed me she looked up at the handsome face above her at the dark eyes that burned in the deep sunburn of his face this was andy-proud strong very sure of him- self-and her heart began that wild ham- mering she had looked for and couldnt hear an hour ago demanding arrogant his mouth sought hers when his lips would have seared hers with the flame she used to know she turned quickly and it was the cool ivory of her cheek that he kissed he laughed put one finger under her chin to bring her face back again punish- ing me is that it beneath the banter there was hurt in his eyes suddenly she was ashamed ashamed that she should withhold so small a thing as a kiss when he had come running to her as soon as his ship was in what a miser she was what an unthinking prig she was she lifted her sweet mouth to him her eyes shining i missed you andy she said and thought of the sleepless nights the hard-fought days when the mail brought nothing for her they danced and had dinner at the bentley small brilliant and exclusive other naval officers off andys ship were there all deeply sunburned chasing fun and hilarity as though it were the most important things in their lives penny cut in on admired lavishly complimented wondered whether the last six months had made so little impression on them as not to matter or on second wiser thought was it that they wanted to forget as quickly as possible what they had done what they had seen it was while she repowdered her nose and took a deep breath of the cooling air on the balcony high above the city streets that she tried to straighten herself out long ago-or was it only yesterday -while she was skating she had told her- sweetheart stories self that she was through with the navy she had convinced herself that andy mar- tin had taught her a valuable lesson that all her tears after he had gone without saying a word to secure their future was so much water washed under the bridge that she was a smarter and wiser girl shed vowed she would have no time for sailors in her life and on top of the vow had come a tall sailor with a head of pale gold with gentle hands with deep understanding and knowl- edge in his llue eyes who had knocked the vow right out of her mind-as easily as he had knocked her feet out from under her at the skating rink well she had stood him up-through no fault of hers hed never look at her again now he had a strict sense of sportsmanship of sticking to simple truths of analysing a situation from all angles he would probably come to the conclusion she hadnt been worth looking for hadnt been worth the gentle- ness with which he had treated her she flung her head up to the clearing sky it had stopped raining but the air was still reminiscent of the rain-sweet air of ihe afternoon shed forget him easily enough-except when it rained that is if she could forget the words he had said sitting under the dripping tree i put my own seal on things i love penny back home theres a dog thatll tolerate others feeding him but his nose will point toward the east every day while he waits for me theres a sloop tied up in the lake that kicks like a broncho if anybody but me tries to steer her he had laughed as though it were a bit silly and the girl i love will wait for me- when i find her his incredibly blue eyes had blazed into hers does that sound silly to you-or stupid penny had re- assured him lightly although her throat had been tight of course his girl would wait he had been about to kiss her and she had stopped him pennys heart stood still for a blinding second would his kiss have been his seal on her she shivered as though the june night had turned cold and with a swish of her skirts turned hastily to go in andy a scowl on his handsome dark face was watching for her watch in hand detail-penny-down at the yard some silly service dance im officer of the night hurry please they flew down the broad street to the navy yard in a powerful navy car an undistinguishable sailor at the wheel sitting close to her in the rear of the car andys arm was around her shoulders drawing her to him his voice dropped below the purr of the motor was langorous with the cocktails he had had with the quickening of his senses which her near- ness aroused penny knew that tone andy she murmured the driver- he didnt listen penny i couldnt for- get you i tried- pennys shoulders stiff- ened and the dark hid the burning on her face but i couldnt he laughed you know a naval officer is better on the loose -maybe thats why the navy wouldnt let young ensigns marry for two years-until they got something out of their systems i guess but thats changed now maybe he was sensing the indignation that was drawing her away from him his voice hurried its not public yet lolly- pop but the navy abandoned its rule that officers cant marry for two years after they receive their commissions ive two weeks in port penny darling lets get married -tonight she had to answer him she couldnt just sit there like a bump on a log expecting him to know what she was thinking ex- pecting this ride to last forever so that she wouldnt have to come to a decision there were two pennys riding in the big car beside andy martin one a freckled long-legged girl with sunburned hair saying earnestly ill marry you when i grow up andy if youll just drag me to your hops please andy and the other penny slim grown-up who had cried stormily into her pillow be- cause andy martin had not asked her to marry him but who because of something that had come into her life within the last no time for sailors twenty-four hours couldnt for the life of her say now yes andy darling i want to marry you he expected her to say it as he had a right to expect her to say she turned her face swiftly into the hol- low of his shoulder her eyes tight her teeth clenched dont tremble darling andy was saying and dont hide your face i want to kiss the bride she gave him her lips but she kept her eyes closed she tried to shut out the pic- ture of those lips that had said tenderly what a heel that sailor was nys bewildered eyes swept the sea of blues all these boys-all sailors in her drifting chiffon evening dress she was a target for hundreds of eyes most of the girls invited for the dance by uso organizations were in street clothes pen- ny walked close to andy andy stalwart handsome very severe very much officer- of-the-night this was glamor romance color the world in which andy moved would always move drag me to your hops andy please she had once coaxed he was annapolis with the heredity of her hands were tight fists hes not hes not she stormed at the silent blond shadow riding on the other side of her a shadow who jeered he didnt care what happened to you when he went away-hell go away again and youll wait and won- der what hes doing she sat up with an angry twist of her shoulders the car was stopping andy was straightening his tie smoothing his hair he muttered you better powder your nose-well be on parade it brought pennys senses back fiercely glad that they were at their destination she stepped from the car her head high her slim shoulders thrown back proving to herself that she was glad she was going to be ensign martins wife the big recreation hall at the navy yard literally swarmed with sailors pen- navy in his blood he would always fol- low the sea she was grateful that greetings check- ing with the officer he relieved took andys time it gave her a chance to accustom herself to the sweep of admiring glances that came at her whichever way her eyes moved she breathed deeply    and looked straight into a pair of eyes so blue that they caught her breath so coldly furious that she winced as from a physical rebuff dirk here he came slowly forward as though against his will as though he didnt want to come his eyes were so glacial they sent a chill over her bare shoulders dirk she breathed im sorry did you go to the skating rink sweetheart stories yes dirk i didnt know where to reach you- she was begging him to believe her forgetting where they were knowing only that it was important that he be- lieve it wasnt her fault decent square- my kind of girl-he had called her dirk- she began again and wasnt aware that andy was beside her until the sudden stiffening of dirks tall figure the snapping to attention in the presence of an officer told her dirks eyes as they swept to andy had that opaque quality andys voice was stiff annoyed is this man bothering you penny penny looked up quickly no she said too eagerly no of course not this is dirk petersen-dirk asked me to dance with him it was an inspiration and the blood rushed up into her face andy gave his consent with a curt nod his brows scowling his eyes not quite trusting she swept away in dirks arms forget- ting to look back reassuringly at andy forgetting everything except the fact that she would have an opportunity to explain he held her as though she were made of cardboard-and he of steel the blood drained from her face what a fool she was what did it matter to him what she had to say from the distant ex- pression on his face from the stiff man- ner in which he danced was sure he didnt want to hear any explanations i want a drink she said abruptly dirk steered her expertly to the back of the hall where the canteen had been set up mobbed now by clamoring sailors and laughing girls dirk watched her silently as she sipped her pop she put down the bottle with a little crash lets get out of here for a minute dirk i want to talk to you please dirks eyes glanced for a second across the crowded room to the musicians stand where they had left andy a little smile that wasnt humorous tightened the cor- ners of his mouth lets go he said outside there was a tiny wooden porch with a bare rail not romantic not even inviting the wind from the navy basin mold- ed the soft dress against pennys figure the moon had come up very pale-shed- ding just enough light to gild pennys hair and dress and sandals and turn her into a little gold statue-just like her name dirks eyes followed the moonlight on her as though to store the picture of her away for many voyages his voice expressionless slow i went to the rink when you didnt come by eight-thirty i knew you wouldnt be there a girl like you doesnt get to places late i phoned your house and there was no an- swer so i came down here because a sailor can get awfully lonesome wandering city streets there was a heartbeat of silence then so ensign martin was the one who forgot the rules who made you distrust men in uniform pennys cheeks stung she started to say something he wouldnt let her ensigns are permitted to marry now he said quickly his voice rough very an- gry is martin going to marry you there was threat in his voice as though he were challenging something hostile and was not afraid penny tried to speak but the tears in her throat made it hard to do anything but swallow she tried again t- and she saw dirk through a blur she knew sud- denly-and too late-what it would mean to be sheltered by a mans deep sense of honor to depend on him for strength to follow him where he would lead because he had set his seal on her she knew and was desolate because it had come too late her tear-wet eyes were turned up to him her fingers laced tightly in each other to keep from touching him when andy ap- peared the scowl was a dark ridge across his sunburned forehead his lips a grim line he ignored penny petersen he snapped as dirk became ramrod straight before him you know the rules yes sir you know that enlisted men may not take ladies out of the hall without orders he looked from penny to dirk an un- pleasant smile touched his mouth  no time for sailors yes sir there was a moment of silence through which he two men measured each other the blond sailor a tower of suppressed energy the officer very scornful very sure of himself penny didnt realize that she was praying dirk wouldnt hit him dirk didnt move but his muscles seemed to have turned to rock report to your quarters petersen  the words snapped coldly as though dirk were beneath notice andys head inclined slightly and a figure appeared out of the shadows to stand beside dirk-a figure wearing an mp on his sleeve a sharp breath escaped penny he wouldnt-just because they had stepped out for a minute cuddenly she was a whirl of color be-  side dirk i asked dirk to take me out she told andy furiously i-i felt ill it was a lie but instinctively penny knew that an officer couldnt countermand orders already given without good reason and penny knew she would fight for dirk no matter how she had to do it because she knew she loved him-and his seal was on her andy looked down into her eyes she faced his fearlessly what he saw there made the anger die out of his face made him pale he kept up the pretense you should have told me he said shortly i would have seen that you were taken home -safely his eyes flicked in the direction of dirk im sorry you behaved this way penny you should have thought of my oosition- his position that would come first always she would come last she made her decision quickly and took a deep deep breath to sustain her i want to go home andy she said fearlessly her shoulders proud with dirk petersen goodbye andy and good luck -always she held out a firm slim hand for a moment she was afraid he wouldnt take it afraid he would say something she would never be able to forget goodbye he said at last and touched her hand she might have known of course that years of precise training in form that a generation of tradition would keep that dark head proud those clipped words steady she waited for dirk to bring her wrap she waited until they were in the taxi be- fore she let the tears come she was crying for penny warren the girl who cried once because a man had gone away without say- ing wait for me now that girl was crying because when the man did come back all she could say was no im not having any she didnt love him a pair of large gentle hands with great l- tenderness cupped her shoulders turned her tear-stained face to him pen- nys lips parted her eyes sought his the thousand candles were lit again penny he said softly there wont be any gold braid to be proud of-no posi- tion of officers lady to live up to-but therell be all my love darling forever and ever and when i kiss you penny and set my seal on you-a tender grin lid up his face-itll be for always no turning back penny-ever she was close against his big chest again her arms were around his neck her face eagerly turned to his their lips met clung -held as they snatched at stars and at peace and at glory when he let her go again there were tears in both their eyes for always he whispered for always she breathed they had to sit straight beside each other their fingers warm and close as the taxi swung into the lighted city streets she looked up at the fair head above her at the eyes which adored her there is a dog who watches isnt there dirk she asked shyly and a sloop that bucks like a broncho and a low white house that looks out at the water he continued for her say- his voice was eager with excite- ment ill show you a stop for your skat- ing that i figured out from my skiing penny youll love skiing on our hills ill love everything she said ill love everything so long as you love me i knew id find you some day shep said huskily and i knew

the gal got there was a bit different in a hospital ambu- lance no less cupid is certainly stream- lined these days she ripped the paper out of the type- writer and rang for jimmy the office boy tell them to put this at the bottom of my todays column she ordered crisply they can cut out that item about the stuyvesant fowlers acquiring one of the lions at the zoo for a household pet jimmy said yes miss graeme in a respectful tone and went racing off sweetheart stories monetta shut the office door and went over to the mirror in the corner of the room she was remembering something that shed always been too busy to notice before jimmy was girl-crazy he played up to everybody with skirts on except monetta he treated her like a-a ma- chine an echo of sallies furious words came to haunt her youre a mechanical ma- chine of other peoples emotions she looked at her reflection in the mir- ror dark eyes bright and alert with long curving lashes a straight little nose and a generous mouth sleek glamorous- appearing dark hair with blue-black lights in it a good make-up job a slim round- ed figure beautifully clad in a sleek black frock which cost eighty dollars at a madi- son avenue shop perfect legs and slim ankles and small feet smartly shod theres nothing the matter with the way i look said monetta to her reflec- tion and i have plenty of boy friends to take me places i could go out every night in the week with a different man if i wanted to im a fool to pay any attention to sallies ravings the number-one telephone had been ringing away monotonously for quite a while impatiently monetta went over and said monetta graeme speaking in her crisp businesslike voice a mans tone came back to her mock- ingly oh is it the famous monetta graeme you sound exactly as i thought you would selfish sexless and awfully awfully career-woman  monetta gasped well she began furiously he went on i think youre a louse miss high-and-mighty smart monetta graeme get that a -o-u-s-e something that burrows in and bites nastily some- thing that never comes out in the open to find out what harm her beastly bitings do you listen to me miss gossip-mon- gering graeme you broke up my sisters marriage with your baseless beastly in- nuendoes my sisters husband has left for reno and my sister is contemplating sui- cide im going to get you for what youve done ill get even with you for this if its the last thing on earth i do get that im giving you this warning because im more fair than you i believe in warning first before i strike which is more than you do you female termite bang went the phone hurting monettas ear as she put it back on the cradle her hand shook a little shed been running the most popular gossip column in manhattans after- noon newspapers shed done a lot of good -helped a lot of people but there were some who hated her and she was used to threats but this was different the man hadnt sounded like a crank he was in dead earnest his voice was deep and charming she would have liked his voice very much indeed if he hadnt been saying such awful things she shrugged just to show herself she didnt care then despite herself she went burrowing through the weeks gossip clippings which sallie had cut out and clipped together for monetta for refer- ence she couldnt find anything that could have referred to anyones sister except the crack shed made about paulette par- ker taking that weekend trip to atlantic city with that bogus count the police had caught up with the count and so the story of paulettes foolish indiscretion had come out monetta closed her eyes the better to think things out it was a trick of hers she thought honestly maybe it was my fault that the cops landed on count ra- felli at atlantic city my column gave them the tip-off that he was there and up to his old tricks of blackmailing a rich foolish young matron out of her jewels because shed sneaked away with him the police had caught the pair just as the count was dropping his glamorous line and getting down to business by de- manding paulettes diamond bracelets so they nabbed the count and paulette will have to appear against him she cant get out of it but she shouldnt have been marry in haste so silly about the man her husband would have found out about it anyhow even if i had kept my hands off the count al- ways works his blackmail both ways-on the wife and the husband too nphoroughly out of temper with the day and herself she closed her type- writer and went to her dressing cubicle and put on the smart new hat with the wisp of attractive veil that had a heart in black sequins just over the left corner of her mouth the hat shoppe had donated the hat be- cause shed given them a plug in her col- umn awhile back she slipped into her sleek black coat and caught up the shin- ing purse-sent by the bag store-and the lone black suede gloves with her initials in white across the backs shed bought those herself the telephone rang and for a minute she was tempted not to answer it but she told herself she was being a chump so she drew a deep breath and said hello mcnetta graeme speaking it was dinky larrabbee he said plain- tively what gives beautiful ive been out here in this ratty outer office for a full half hour waiting for you had you forgotten im taking you to the flyers cocktail party at cynthias monetta had forgotten she was awfully glad now that there was somewhere to go she said sorry dinky press of business you know be out in a jiff she thought as she put on brilliant lip- stick dinky larrabbee is rich and social register and hes crazy about me so that proves im not a flop as a female but monetta had to be honest even with herself so she told herself dinkys wild about publicity you can give it to him lamb thats the only reason he gives you such a rush stop fooling yourself dinky sort of bore that out the minute she arrived he said you look ravishing darling not even looking at her then i hope some of the other columnists spot us together at this brawl sweet i love to be quoted as being the escort of the super- duper monetta graeme monetta smiled wryly and went to the cocktail party monetta got around a lot she had to in her job and it was easy because she was amusing and witty and entertaining she always got bids to everything worthwhile usually she loved parties they were such fun but there was something the matter with this one perhaps it was because dinky drifted away from her the moment he saw that fluffy deborah durham who was play- ing ingenue in city stars the way he looked at debbie was something very dif- ferent from the calculating expression in his eyes when he gazed at monetta stew edwards came over and kissed her and told her she was looking ravishing it seemed to be the stock phrase that afternoon he said got any off-the- record dirt darling and waited expect- antly but there didnt seem to be any sparkle or wit in monetta that day instead of telling him a barbed amusing story about somebodys folly she said bluntly do i lack sex appeal stew stew said of course not darling you have been lapping em up havent you better go home and sleep it off love and he drifted away ttor the first time in her colorful life  monetta was left standing entirely alone on a sort of little marooned island right in the midst of a crowd that was having a good time she felt panicky and looked around wildly for a lifeline she found it clear across the room was a man star- ing fixedly at her he had big capable- looking shoulders and he was taller than any other man in the room his eyes were blue and the light glinted in his blond hair he had a fine head a rugged sun-bronzed face but it wasnt any of those things that attracted monetta to him as if a magnet were pulling her his way it was his mouth it had strength and humor courage and candor and sweetness just now that mouth seemed to say to monetta watch yourself gal ive  sweetheart stories been waiting for you all my life when i kiss you youre going to stay kissed for keeps perhaps if all those things hadnt hap- pened that day to make monetta less sure of herself and her feminine appeal she would have crushed the thrill she got just looking at that man as it was she let herself go and her eyes went melting under his gaze he crossed the room to her on the in- stant pushing people out of his way as if he didnt know they were there monettas heart was thumping like mad by the time he reached her her cheeks were burning it was so long since shed blushed she felt horribly self-conscious he drew her into a quiet corner and his blue eyes searched hers deeply i knew id find you some day he said huskily and i knew when i did find you that there wouldnt be any fool preliminaries or sparring it would be just this way then he took her in his arms and kissed her long and passionately that kiss made her feel tinglingly alive and at the same time meltingly yielding as she clung to him she forgot she was in the middle of a chattering group of sophisticated people who laughed at love and scoffed at life and made fun of everything people used to call sacred what she felt was no fleet- ing thing-of-the-moment it was some- thing strong and deep yet tender some- thing meant to endure when he let her go he said this is real i dont know how it came about or why but its something that was meant to be you feel it that way too dont you you must monetta was silent too moved to speak she looked up at him disturbed wonder- ing suddenly he smiled and he said sim- ply lets get out of here away from the mob tte didnt wait for her to agree he - just took her by the arm and hurried her out of the cocktail party and into the gathering dusk of evening outside the air was fresh and marvelous after the stuffy atmosphere of the cocktail party the sky glimpsed between the tall arabian nights towers of the city was intensely blue the whole world was more exciting and thrilling than monetta had ever known it she felt more tinglingly alive too she was keyed to everything romantic the man got one of the horse-drawn hansoms that drowsily wait for lovers on the edge of central park he gave the old cabby a bill and said just drive around in the park and then he got in beside monetta sitting close to her she was so aware of the magnetism of this stranger that she trembled he took her into his arms again and held her close to his heart but he didnt kiss her again instead he talked softly persuasively im a queer sort of duck he told her incurably romantic underneath hard- boiled on the surface ive never let any- one know before how romantic  am but you see dear ive had this dream in the back of my mind all my life that somewhere somehow i was going to meet the one girl and when i did shed know just as i did he drew a quick sharp breath and i promised myself something else too that in the lirst five minutes of play i was going to ask her to marry me no courting no preliminaries just two people who were made for each other meeting and knowing right away-and get- ting married  marry in haste she sensed that he was rather embar- rassed now that the proposal had been made but she wasnt thinking about that she was finding out that shed heard his voice somewhere before shed been so swept off her feet before this that she hadnt placed it but now she was sure he was the furious voice threatening her on the telephone this afternoon she said weakly but-we dont know each others names nor anything about us that was sort of incoherent but she was beginning to feel an awful ache in her heart-a panicky sort of ache may- be we wouldnt approve of each other with our minds the way we click with our feel- ings he said thats the whole point of this darling we marry without knowing any- thing at all about each other take each other on faith are you game darling monetta remembered that this was the man who hated her strange- she said slowly are you sure you dont know anything about me he said look sweet i know all the important things youre beautiful and youre all woman all fire and light and for some obscure reason you like my kisses thats all i know thats enough jitonetta hugged those things close to her breast he thought she was beau- tiful he thought she wras feminine and al- luring he wanted her just as she was and without questions well why not get married like that she was pretty blase about marriage was miss monetta graeme of the gossip column her scouts brought in juicy items all the time to prove that love was a snare and delusion and that no one found mar- riage sacred but just a sort of football to kick around a lot of the people who had grown up together and been engaged for ages made the worst mess of marriage she had thought back in the far corners of her mind that some day she would get married but she had never fallen in love until now marriage had never seemed so awfully important to her until now then why not take a chance it was sudden- yes but thousands of romances came that way suddenly out of the blue and if two people felt that way- she drew a deep breath and said this is the craziest thing in the world and i hope youre sober and sane because im in a pixie mood myself im just bewitched enough to take a chance lets go he kissed her and she was floating along on a cloud after that dimly she was aware that they ex- changed the hansom for a taxi and drove out to the airport once there they chartered a plane it was heaven winging through the skies held close in this mans arms having him say wonderful magical things to her and then they were in virginia and they had to come down to earth monettas real name was karen kirkpatrick shed used the other two names for so many years that shed almost forgotten but she was glad she had them to fall back on now especially when she saw him put his name down on the license as shepard blanding mcclure iii that was paulettes bro- ther right enough her name had been mcclure before her marriage a couple of years ago her father was shepard bland- ing mcclure ii monetta felt cold all over look shep she said quietly i know quite a lot about you now youve been in the papers a lot i should have recognized you from your pictures i know that your fam- ily is rich and social register and that you broke away from them to take a com- mercial flying job i know that youve broken a lot of records and done a lot of important things for aviation and that you fly clippers and things across the at- lantic youve been trying hard to get into the marine flying corps lately but they wont let you because youre more important in a commercial flying job she took a deep breath so you see she went on since i know all these things it isnt playing the game quite square not to tell you who i am before we get mar- ried she stopped for a minute to gather courage she thought i didnt know a person sweetheart stories could fall in love this hard im burning up when i think of going through life without seeing shep mcclure again i havent known him two hours and hes more important to me than breathing shep smiled at her tenderly you can tell me afterwards whether youve had three husbands before this or do a spot of mur- der in your spare moments come on darling weve got a date with the justice of the peace monetta thought im getting married to a man who is going to hate me like poison when he finds out who i really am im letting myself in for a heartache im never going to get over but she married him just the same the ceremony was over in an incredibly short time shep kissed her tenderly my wife he said huskily and there was such deep happiness in his voice that monettas throat tightened with the ache of tears there followed a two-day honeymoon which was so perfect that monetta re- alized that all her life she had been wait- ing just for this this was what she had been born for to be with shep this was why she had found every other man so boring and uninteresting sheps mind matched her own in quick- ness they became happy congenial com- panions in no time as well as lovers shep brought her flowers every day and little gifts every time he went out once when she came back into the big charm- ing old-fashioned hotel room where they were staying he was gone such a sense of desolation swept over her that she felt faint and sick with the force of it and then she saw that written in the dust on the huge old-fashioned dresser were the words i love you and the words were repeated in powder on the mir- ror her heart sang again those two days together were heaven she thought we smart sophisticated round-the-towners were the dumb ones after all the little girls who believe blindly in love are right nothing is more wonder- ful than this nothing shep had to leave to take his plane to lisbon on the third morning he asked her a question about herself for the first time on that fateful morning i suppose you have an apartment in town he murmured his face against the soft clouds of her hair monetta drew a deep breath shed been trying to gather courage to tell him the truth but it got increasingly difficult be- cause shep opened up to monetta he told her all his likes and dislikes-and the thing he hated worst on earth was a career woman he hated women reporters and women announcers on the radio and most of all he despised women gossip columnists she could understand a little why that was now that she knew about that streak of sentiment which was so deeply ingrained in him it explained why he had taken up cudgels so valiantly for his sister paulette it was because of that very sentiment that monetta loved him he thought monetta graeme had ruined his sisters marriage and lost her chance of happiness he didnt realize that paulette was an irresponsible little thrill-chaser who would have come to grief sooner or later whether gossip columnists existed or not h repeated his question i want to send you a cable when i get to lisbon youd like to know wouldnt you oh yes she gasped yes the end of the world seemed to have come when she thought of anything hap- pening to shep she looked out at the grey of the day outside rain was beating slantwise against the window-pane and sliding down greasily in a monotonous way wind was bending the trees double she thought of a clipper up there in the sky scudding across the atlantic and the pit of her stomach hurt suddenly agoniz- ingly oh darling i do want to know she whispered clinging to him then she gave him her new york address he raised his eyebrows slightly swanky address darling he murmured as he wrote it down on a bit of paper i havent married an heiress by any chance have i  marry in haste ive found out that pride and anger are nothing to love shep told her she said too hastily  fraid not dear then she added i havent any parents or any relatives im alone in the world he kissed her lingeringly im your family darling monetta thought wildly as he held her in his arms in the thrilling half hour be- fore they left to fly back to new york ill give up my job and all my old life ill be just plain karen kirkpatrick the way i started out three years ago it was awful saying goodby to him he wouldnt let her go to the clipper she was glad of that because she knew all the political people and socialites who traveled the clipper and discovery would be in- evitable she was still afraid to let shep know who she was maybe some day he would be so much in love with her that shed dare tell him because the truth couldnt hurt him later hed understand hen shep had been gone an hour monetta realized that she couldnt walk out on her old life and her old job she had a contract she had a myriad contacts in this ex- istence of hers which she had built up so painstakingly and efficiently thinking it was exactly what she wanted for herself sweetheart stories she had phoned bill rand to take her place on saturday saying she had a bad cold and was going to stay in bed no- body knew she had been married she put her wedding ring away in her purse along with the wedding certificate and the gay- little silver ribbon that had gone around her orchid wedding corsage she wanted to put her wedding ring on a bit of ribbon and hang it inside her blouse where she could feel it comfortingly on her warm skin but didnt she put it in her smart handbag-and felt chilled with the bleak- ness of separation crushed with its heart- ache and lonely enough to die the rain kept thudding down a dismal accompaniment to her lonely thoughts the wind whirled around the tall newspaper building moaning like a homeless ghost but with all her aching loneliness it was nice to get back to the office that fact hit her like a blow in the face she hadnt expected it she didnt love shep the less but she knew now that she wanted both shep and her job which was just too bad bill rand eyed her speculatively you look like the well-known cat with the ca- nary feathers around the mouth he said frankly bill was married and had a couple of kids he adored he added you look less like any gal with a bad cold in the head than any ive ever seen if you werent the aloof monetta graeme who figures men are just to be kicked around id say youd gone overboard for some guy ah me monetta was furious at herself for blush- ing she said anything break on satur- day bill to change the subject bill nodded plenty are you sure of your facts about that paulette parker thing monetta youre getting sued again and this time theres plenty of dough be- hind the boys bringing the suit the shepard mcclures no less oh said monetta feeling faint bill rand said youll beat the rap as usual darling-dont look so sunk and went back to his own office monetta sat there feeling as if the bot- tom had dropped out of everything tevins called her and said worriedly - look monetta were behind you all the way on this paulette parker suit but the paper stands to lose half a million bucks and there isnt that much money in the world so far as were concerned were up against it the richer people are the better and more boldly they lie monetta said hesitatingly maybe theyll settle out of court maybe i could apologize publicly in the paper and say i made a mistake bevins bellowed so that her ear hurt apologize my eye whats come over you monetta were right on this thing and we fight to the death the call-clarion never backs down what are you thinking about besides were cooperating with the police on this thing they want to jail this bogus count for a nice long stretch monetta began to have a hunted look the rain kept thundering down she thought of shep flying through all that fury of elements she had to choke back a sob of fear sallie fletcher came racing in late as usual and full of excuses as to how it hap- pened she was burbling with happiness her sweetheart had brougnt her a gor- geous diamond engagement ring now she felt just ever so much more engaged if miss graeme knew what she meant mo- netta said she did sallies boy friend and she had talked and kissed a lot and had a wonderful time sallie had loved the ride in the ambulance out to the air field shed simply adore monetta as long as she lived and would monetta ever forgive her for the simply awjul things shed said that she hadnt meant at all monetta said think nothing of it and mused to herself that sallies impul- sive words had played a big part in landing monetta herself in the midst of love the san francisco correspondent rang up to give monetta a hot lead on a new triangle in s f society circles betty jane who covered manhattans stage cir- cles popped in to tell about a new engage- ment between a leading lady and her head chorus man les raymond from the marry in haste nightclub fraternity had an item about a hardboiled nightclub proprietor falling for his star headliner the telephone operator from downstairs called up to ask timidly if miss graeme would put her in the column shed just got engaged and her boy friend was simply crazy about seeing his name in the paper love love love everybody seemed bitten by it the wind kept whistling around the building in an eerie lonely way thunder rolled and lightning flashed and more flashes came in all over the country about people falling in love monetta listened with much more sympathy than would have been possible for her three days before the day kept on exactly like any other day the scouts from all over the coun- try telephoned in their tip-offs people asked monetta to dances and parties dinky rang to reproach her for walking out on the ccktail party everybodys talk- ing about the way you and shep mcclure went to town on that kiss he finished and there was more warmth in his voice than had ever been there before you never cooperated like that when i kissed you he grumbled how about stepping out with me to the conslemans brawl tonight sorry dinky booked to the teeth she told him blithely evidently sheps kiss had shown the rest of her world that she was a woman not a news-gathering machine the mail came in on the very top was a big envelope addressed in a masculine handwriting that made her heart turn somersaults sheps handwriting it had become so familiar in the last two days she couldnt miss it shep-shep mcclure writing to monetta graeme had he known who she was all the time she almost died her hands shook so that she could hardly get the letter open the letters written on the page danced and jittered before her eyes miss monetta graeme was the curt beginning of the letter circumstances made it impossible for me to come in and tell you personally to your face what i told you over the telephone but the next time i am in the vicinity i shall give myself that ex- treme pleasure in the meantime a suit has been entered against you for libel it is nothing new for you to be sued i know but this is one suit you will not win my sister has told me under oath that she was never in atlantic city with count rafelli you were woefully mis- informed and you have done my sister such harm that nothing you can do now can undo that harm i hope your sleep is haunted by the thought of the woman you have pilloried into losing reputation husband and home but a ruthless person like you has no conscience i had forgotten that fact shepard mcclure monetta kept on staring at the letter sallie looked at her curiously whats the matter bad news miss graeme monetta said not at all and folded the letter touching it as if it burned her fingers for three hours she kept her mind strictly on business it had become a mat- ter of pride with her to turn out the best column possible just to justify herself to herself while sallie was out to lunch she put in a call to carla lewis the scout who had telephoned in the tip about paulette parker when she got hold of carla she said was it paulette parker who was with count rafelli in atlantic city on the tenth she wasnt at all surprised to hear carla stammer and stutter and finally gasp out oh miss graeme i made such an awful mistake it was a girl who looked terrifi- cally like mrs parker but it wasnt they showed me a picture of this other girl and- who showed you a picture asked monetta crisply knowing perfectly well  sweetheart stories carla gasped oh im so sorry about this miss graeme but- count yourself off the call-clarion pay- roll as of now sighed monetta not that it matters to you for i suppose the mc- clures have paid plenty for you to rat on me she slammed down the phone on car- las rapid protestations lunch that day tasted like sawdust when she came back captain of detec- tives salback was waiting for her the mcclures have cooked up a story that it wasnt paulette parker with that phony count he snapped we know perfectly well it was but theyve got every loophole covered can you do anything about making her come through miss graeme it means a lot for us to lock up that phony count hes been preying on silly title-crazy women so long i thought this time we had a fool-proof case of course we should have made the mc- clure-parker woman sign an affidavit against him right then and there but she was having hysterics taking it so hard that we felt sorry for her we thought shed have to come forward when the trial began anyhow we didnt dream the mc- clures would pull anything like this he sighed monetta said quietly ill try to see mrs parker but i know it wont do any good theyre all vicious against me as a matter of fact i have a libel suit on my hands he got up well testify in your behalf miss graeme he said gruffly sorry about this he left monetta sat there feeling utterly sunk she read that letter over again there was an unforgiving stiff side to sheps nature when he found out she was mo- netta graeme it would be the end for monetta she was due for that heartache shed been fearing all along and it was going to be such a bitter heartache that she felt like dying at the very thought of it it only she hadnt let herself love shep so much but it was much too late now for regrets she thought somehow or other ive got to talk to paulette parker after all she is sheps sister there must be some good in her she telephoned the mcclure town apart- ment which was a twenty-room place in park avenue no dice she went there but she couldnt get past the uniformed doorman then she got her scouts to work she knew paulettes type she wasnt the sort to mope at home shed be stepping out somewhere to cry on everybodys shoul- der and gather sympathy and adulation on every hand late in the afternoon monetta got the dope paulette was going to the consle- mans party at the ritz that rang a bell in her memory dinky dinky had asked her to go to the party with him she called him at once he was more than delighted to take her he sounded awfully smug about the whole thing as if shed just been playing hard to get monetta didnt care about that she didnt care about any- thing if only she could get paulette to call off this suit lytonetta got filipe of the waldorf to stay at his swanky beauty salon for an extra hour for her he did it gladly eager for a mention in her column her hair-do was a masterpiece and he had his head operator give her a facial saying mademoiselle looks just the least bit tired monetta agreed with him she knew she looked as if she had been pulled through a wringer evidently a broken heart showed on your face her eyes looked enormous and violet shadows lay deep be- neath them the facial made her look young she dashed out and got a taxi in the pouring rain the taxi driver recognized her and asked her to put his name in her column she wore a sleek black-and-white number that was quite daring one half of the dress was white satin and the other half black velvet it swirled around her lovely figure whirling out fan-wise about her small black jet slippers marry in haste dinky tried to make love to her in the taxi and she had to laugh to cover how annoyed she was she was glad when they arrived at the conslemans party everyone in town who counted was there and the first person monetta saw was paulette paulette all in filmy white look- ing just too innocent for words she had a sort of filmy veil over her head east indian fashion and it was a most appeal- ing outfit monetta waited for her chance the moment paulette was alone for a minute monetta shook off the stag line and went over to her ive got to talk to you miss parker she said her voice shaking a little paulette turned around with surprising swiftness she said you and her pretty soft baby face went ugly on the moment then her hand shot out with plenty of force behind it monetta was so aston- ished she just stood there rooted to the spot but there was worse to come a man talking to a group of men and women nearby turned at the sound of that resounding slap he stared his eyes bleak and cold and hateful it was shep ton etta felt the floor billowing under her feet she wished she were the fainting sort but she wasnt she just stood there feeling chilled to the very heart he came over and took monettas arm but there was nothing tender in his grip just iron hate he said to paulette ill handle this he took monetta out of the ballroom in- to the lobby then he said you are lower than things that crawl monetta graeme and his look seared her with its anger and contempt monetta always so facile with words was struck dumb she gasped out the thing uppermost in her mind what hap- pened to the clipper why are you here shep said curtly bad weather ground- ed we hope to get off tomorrow he added after an icy pause i came dash- ing straight back to spend this extra day with my loving wife the way he said that stung it made her shiver i went to your apartment and your maid told me the true identity of the contemptible woman i had married monetta gasped it was your own idea shep getting married without knowing any- thin more about each other- shep snapped you could have told me you were the woman i hated when you found out i was shep mcclure monetta said weakly but id fallen in love with you by that time he didnt pay any attention to that it was plain that he didnt believe any- thing she said he went on in the same low furious tone so you stoop so low in your gar- bage-gathering business that you even marry to keep out of a lawsuit well miss breaker-of-homes this is one time you underestimated your opponents your being mrs shep mcclure isnt going to stop this suit its going to make things just that much worse for you because im going to get up there on the stand and tell how you tricked me into marry- ing you trying to spike this suit monetta got mad she said everything you think is right isnt it mcclure well let me tell you this your sister hasnt a loyal bone in her this isnt the first time shes cheated that nice husband of hers everybody knows shes a notorious thrill- chaser shes just no good if it hadnt been for the fact that the police wanted to nab the count i wouldnt have both- ered to chronicle what everybody from here to california already knows for a minute she thought he was going to strike her he said things low and indistinct coming from between clenched teeth bitter insulting things she thought frantically why do people who have loved each other hurt each other so hideously when theres a quar- rel all the passion seems to turn to venom i wish i were dead shep was talking more slowly now de- liberately he said i suppose youre going to put your own heart in your col- sweetheart stories umn for the world to pick at just as youve done with my poor sister like fun you are-not you when it comes to your own hurt youll crawl away by yourself and lick your wounds in a dark corner somewhere then he laughed cynically but im forgetting-you arent hurt you havent any heart to be hurt and pride is something you know nothing about so im wasting sympathy over you my dear mrs mcclure and if i ever see your lying face again i hope i choke a long time later monetta was back in her office she wasnt quite sure how she got there shed been riding around and around in the rain in a taxi for hours and now it was one in the morning and she was banging out copy in the stillness of the empty office nobody was around but the watchman and a couple of reporters who had to stay by the teletype to be sure nothing big broke without the paper knowing they were dozing in their chairs outside the presses began turning at nine in the morn- ing as the paper was an afternoon paper monetta said slowly he was right about one thing i must take it if i dish it out painstakingly she typed what well known gossip columnist with the initials m g got her face slapped by what young matron at the ritz last night  society is all agog over the fact that the gossip columnist married shep- ard clipper pilot mcclure at a veddy veddv quiet ceremony in virginia the other day but when the groom found out the brides identity he repudiated her before everyone at yesterdays swank consleman affair at the ritz ke gets a lisbon divorce when his clipper lands there next trip she hesitated a long moment and hen typed firmly it is rather a joke on the gossip col- umnist as she has been reported hard- to-get but it seems she is so-o broken- hearted that the torch is consuming her there mr shep mcclure she said through her teeth thatll show you i can take it all the rest of the night she worked getting her column ready for the next day sunrise was making the sky rosy by the time she finished she laid the column on the desk with a note for sallie to run it exactly as she had typed it out and then she slipped out of the building and wearily went home thhe town certainly buzzed the next day monetta went to the office with her head held high she turned out her column as usual answered telephone calls and did her work like an automaton it helped to work nothing could ease the awful pain in her heart but work did help a little it was like a sedative that dulled the tormenting thoughts bevins was awfully worried about the trial things werent going so well it looked as if the mcclures were sure to win the newspaper had been grand to mo- netta she felt she owed them a lot she tried to think what she could do to get the paper out of the jam finally she thought of ted parker out in reno es- tablishing residence for the divorce she put in a call to him he slammed the phone down on her the minute he knew who she was so the second time she called she said it was paulette parker and when he answered she started talking in a regular flood he listened monetta could be awfully per- suasive when she wanted it was funny- the only time her gift of words failed her was when she talked to shep she loved him so much that she couldnt tell him how things really had been she just choked up and went dumb she talked to ted parker for half an hour until he said finally i think youre a swell gal miss graeme ill go back to paulette on condition that she stops the suit i still love her i guess love is some- thing you cant turn on or off as you would a spigot knowing paulettes wacky hasnt stopped my loving her so ill go back  marry in haste you havent anything more to worry about it seemed he was right the next day there was a reconciliation between ted parker and paulette they left for cali- fornia on a second honeymoon the slan- der suit was withdrawn and everything was swell everything but monettas love and her future life she put the whole story of the reconcilia- tion in the column then she waited mark- ing time days slid by leadenly the clipper was home but shep made no move to get in touch with her worse than hat one day she got a folded paper that looked awfully legal it was all in portuguese but it didnt need an in- terpreter to tell her it was a divorce decree she put it away in a little box that con- tained a tarnished silver ribbon which had once been around a wedding corsage there was a silly little doll shep had won at the shooting gallery at that street fair theyd gone to that second night and the wed- ding ring and the marriage license-ghosts of her memories queer how such a tiny box could contain all there was of life    rpime dragged on monetta made every attempt to see shep she hung around the landing field when the clipper came in she dogged his apartment she rang up at all hours shep was too smart for her she never caught so much as a glimpse of him she put that all in her column baring her heart to the world laying aside her pride because shep had said she couldnt take it as well as dish it out one afternoon bevins called her to his office your column is losing ground he told her bluntly people dont like this personal soul-searching you put in as a lead item monetta felt tears sting her eyes tm sorry she said you can have my resig- nation any time you like dont be a dope said bevins sharply youre still the top attraction in the gos- sip world only do go slow on yourself wont you monetta said i dont suppose youd understand but-that was a sort of pen- ance there wont be anything more about me in my column i promise you that that was the night she saw shep for the first time in two heartbreakingly long months shed gone to the opening of the southy galleries with dinky everybody important was there monetta was thin and she looked as if shed been living on nerve alone but she was very smart in her hunters green suit with the gay little green hat set on one side of her dark head dinky was proud to be seen with her in fact he got so sentimental he proposed marriage in a half-hearted way monetta didnt even hear him shep was staring at her clear across the room just as he had done that first day when they had met at the cocktail party for just an instant they looked into each others eyes and realized the old attrac- tion was there stronger than ever then paulette came up and the thread between them snapped monetta knew that it hadnt worked out with paulette and ted paulette had found a man in san francisco she used to know a long time ago she had sneaked out to meet him ted had packed up and come back to san francisco without her the little tramp thought monetta re- sentfully hating her with all her heart and then abruptly the things began to happen a man came into the galleries who had no business to be there a down-on- his-luck tattered-looking man with a gaunt face and evil blazing eyes that didnt look quite sane with a queer prickling of her spine monetta recognized him count ra- felli they hadnt been able to convict him without paulettes testimony but the mcclure money and prestige had done their work the bogus count found him- self barred from all the old haunts where he had found gullible ladies with lovely jewels the mcclures had done what the police had been unable to accomplish the count was definitely out  sweetheart stories and now here he was nobody was paying any attention the artist who had the gold medal painting at the exhibition was entering the hall all eves were turned toward him all except count rafelli- his eyes were blazing with hate and they looked directly at paulette with a swift fateful movement he jerked a revolver out of his pocket he aimed straight at paulette and murder looked starkly out of his face shep was standing with his arm linked in his sisters arm if that bullet found its mark shep would be hurt too maybe killed without counting the cost monetta sprang forward screaming a warning she shrieked sheps name as the bullet intended for paulette found its mark in her own soft breast she pitched forward on her knees feeling queerlv dazed and not quite sure what had happened then tearing pain began to rip at her ferociously she hadnt known a bullet wound could hurt like this she clenched her teeth to keep from crying out in her pain dimly she was aware that people were crowding round her their faces wavered and spun about as if they were on a merry- go-round she tried to speak sheps name but her strength was gone with a little tired sigh she lay still her face as white as the crisp little pocket handkerchief in her top pocket had been before it became crimson    slowly reluctantly she came back to consciousness white walls white ceiling a smell of antiseptics in the air a hospital of course she turned a little on her pillow and felt a stabbing pain suddenly remembrance flooded back shep she whispered was shep all right her voice seemed to come from a long way off miraculously shep himself answered his face was against hers he was kissing her soft tremulous lips kissing them wild- ly passionately kissing back into monet- ta the will to live monetta dared not open her eyes she thought contentedly if this is death its fine and fumbled for sheps firm warm hand she curled her cold fingers trustfully around his palm and drifted off to sleep the next time she came back to con- sciousness she felt stronger she opened her eyes and saw that the room was filled with flowers she asked the nurse about them studiously keeping away from that beau- tiful delirium when she had dreamed that shep was kissing her the flowers were from people in all walks of life people she had helped peo- ple to whom the publicity of her column had meant the difference between starving to death and a good job the nurse bent over her and took her temperature youre a wonder mrs mcclure she said anybody else would have been dead after what youve been through the bullet came within that much- she held up her finger- of your heart it was a perfect miracle and now two days later you havent even a tem- perature its great well have you out of here in a couple of weeks monetta didnt hear anything but the fact that the nurse had called her mrs mcclure she said not quite daring to breathe shep- hes right outside mrs mcclure just where hes been all the time i never saw such devotion never the nurses eyes were misty she smoothed monettas pil- low then added self-consciously my boy-friend is crazy about publicity mrs mcclure if you could put me in your column he might- shep came in just in time to hear that he kissed monetta long and tenderly monetta clutched his hand tightly she gasped oh but im not going to have a column any longer nurse that was to tell shep she was hauling down her flag she meant to add something else but shep cut in dont you believe her nurse shes delirious ill see that you get in the col- umn all right you helped save my wifes life ill put you in the column myself if mrs mcclure doesnt  marry in haste the nurse gave them both a very bright- eyed look then she tiptoed out monetta gasped shep i- again he wouldnt let her talk when you get well you can kick me he said grimly ive found out a lot of things since that bullet went off the first and most important is that pride and anger are nothing compared to love monetta lay perfectly still and thought i want to keep this moment forever he went on next paulette got such a scare that she told the truth for a change shes awfully sorry about everything but -well- monetta shook her head a little she gasped out the thing uppermost in her mind you called me your wife the nurse called me mrs mcclure but that lisbon divorce- shep got red-faced all at once im a heel darling he said an awful heel i hate to have you find it out but i am that wasnt a divorce decree you cant get divorces in lisbon any easier than any other place i just counted on your not knowing portuguese and being too proud to get anybody to translate monettas heart was singing then what was it darling she asked him he grinned it said decree at the top very impressively and then it had both our names its a document that allows us to eat at any restaurant in town without a ration card he added even when i was so furious with you darling i was figuring on that document coming in handy one day when i could wangle a trip for us oh shep monetta whispered oh shep i love you so  shep said before i kiss you within an inch of your precious life mrs mcclure read this i went down and wrote it my- self to head your column monetta read what clipper pilot is feeling like the heel he is because his wife whom he treated abominably turned the tables by taking the bullet intended for him the answer is shep mc- clure who is writing this column to- day in his wifes absence monetta didnt read any more her eyes were too filled with happy tears oh shep darling she cried shep said complacently i can write a pretty nifty column myself it seems we got a lot of letters on this one and bevins says the papers circulation has gone up five thousand ill help you with the column between flights if you like monetta saw through all the self-as- surance and boasting now and she knew that shep was like a very small boy storm- ing and blustering because he was scared hed lost something terribly precious to him through his own stubborn fault well write a swell column together she told him holding out her arms in life and love as well as on the paper his kiss was passionate and tender and jubilantly happy be sure to send in the favorite story coupon favorite story coupon a

divorce she had an almost personal sense of loss as if her own mar- riage were cracking up before her very eyes that is if shed had one meg bellamy was her best friend she had introduced buster to meg she had been bridesmaid at their wedding and had seen a lot of them during the four stormy years of their marriage she sighed love just couldnt end like that suppose andy hadnt disappeared on that grey long-ago day suppose shed been married to andy these four years in- stead of counting off each solitary day on a rosary of loneliness and this was her marriage hers and andys that was break- ing up she shivered and pressed the bell again her marriage could never break up for the simple reason that shed never marry anyone but andy even though hed been gone four long years she loved him but then hadnt meg and buster been deeply in love too buster bellamy opened the door oh its you del come in he was in his shirt sleeves his dark hair was rumpled and she was shocked at the look of des- peration in his dark eyes i thought it might be meg he said raggedly she looked around the disordered living room meg hasnt come back then no his voice was bitter she left me i hoped shed changed her mind buster im so sorry del sank forlorn- ly into a chair ive tried so hard to con- vince her shes making a mistake she had been so sure that this marriage would last a marriage made in heaven she remembered thinking that standing there in the sunlit church in her shell-pink  dress and her bridesmaids hat she could still smell the lilies of the valley in her bouquet hear the muffled crying of megs mother feel the hushed solemnity of the moment when her two best friends had sworn lasting fidelity to each other she remembered too the white awed look on andys face during that ceremony he was only twenty but shed been in love with him even then busters tortured voice brought her back to the present shes divorcing me del cant you do something to stop her the doorbell rang and a look of eager- ness replaced his worried expression gee maybe shes changed her mind he ran to the door and flung it open why andy chilton where did you come from del heard him say but it was a moment before that name really- registered in her mind then she was out of her chair crying andy andy is it really you   hello del his voice was just as she remembered it and his hair the minute he removed his hat it fell forward the same as always in a curly yellow mass his face was still quite boyish but his blue eyes were different thought id come around and sit up at the wake he said wake buster repeated dully yes i was around when your wonder- ful romance was born now im here to help you bury it dels eyes still searched his face for signs of change his cynical words matched his eyes but were incongruous when you looked at his youthful face and long lanky figure something has changed him she thought but what is it dis- illusion over meg and buster cracking up or is there something else something deeper more personal when did you get back she asked are you staying andy sweetheart stories came yesterday ive got my old job back at the roxy well he dug his hands into his rockets and some coins jingled dont they generally serve drinks at a wake so he would be working as projectionist at the theater again just as if the past four years had never been the thought of andy living and working in the same town made her tingle with excitement she wanted to take that lovely feeling home with her to keep it new and shining so she picked up her bag and gloves you two stay and drink i have to get home to bed ill take you home andy said at once following her to the door my car is out- side they said goodnight to buster and del thrilled to the touch of andys hand on her arm as he helped her into the car live in the same old place he asked no i live with my aunt on beach street did you know that father died two years ago and that im a working girl now yes i knew where do you work at quantells from nine to five mend- ing silk hose for the stores customers what have you been doing andy trying to grow up mostly del felt a small shock at his words what did he mean she watched him driving easily apparently relaxed whats wrong andy i dont know but you seem strange the old andy would have kissed me hello she said thats easy he pulled over and stopped the car this andy would kiss you hello too his lips were firm and warm on hers and impetuously she put her arms around his neck but just as all the pent-up yearning of four years surged over her he released her hello he said and turned back to the wheel hello she whispered she thought achingly he didnt really want to kiss me it was if hed said you asked me to kiss you and i did-so what the car stopped in front of her apart- ment but he made no move to get out he was silent his fingers absently drum- ming on the wheel perhaps he was in love with someone else after all in four years-why he might even be married she moistened her lips and said i sup- pose youve been in love many times over in all this time no i havent another little silence del felt her nerves tighten so you forgot me just like that she said his elbow jabbed her arm as he dug his hands in his pockets how about you i hear all the news you know del one romance after another in and out of love a dozen times since i left and how about the chap named blakley the one you left standing at the church i wasnt in love with any of them she said hotly she couldnt tell him that she had gone from one romance to another trying feverishly to fill the void in her heart trying to smother her longing for him as for blake i-i thought i could marry him but i just couldnt go through with it i didnt love him enough love the scorn in his voice was like a slap what could have happened to make him so cynical she wasnt sure she liked this new andy she said sharply whats come over you youre not the same andy no thank heaven he replied fervent- ly- im sorry i asked you to kiss me dont be youre a darn kissable girl del i guess you know that but with you kisses and engagement rings are all mixed up with each other and whats wrong with that she flared and then could have bitten her tongue for having said such a thing engagements have a way of leading to marriage he pushed his lanky body out of the car and came around to open the door but you see del im not in the mood for matrimony ah i hate him she thought as she  love is for keeps tossed restlessly that night to have him back after four years only to have him say lies not in the mood for matrimony but why she longed to delve further into the fas- cinating mystery that was andy to know what made him so bitter yet she was afraid she sensed that knowing would mean heartbreak for her but heartbreak or no she vowed silently ive got to know tose chilton andys cousin gave a party for him the next night del danced with andy to the music of record- ings and wondered why shed been so up- set the evening before here she was in andys arms all their friends automatically paired them off together and the future held magical possibilities as her smoke- grey chiffon skirts billowed across his neatly creased blue trouser legs excitement glowed in her grey eyes and flamed in her cheeks andy she cried with a new reckless- ness tell me youre glad to be back glad to see me his arm tightened about her waist i am youre even prettier than i remem- bered you del i used to think there wasnt another girl like you in the world she tilted her head and as she spoke only a small edge of sharpness cut through the surface smoothness of her voice were you in the mood for matrimony then he looked down at her at the dark hair that grew in an intriguing point on her broad forehead the grey eyes shadowed by long black lashes at the sweetly curved mouth if any girl could change my mind he said low it would be you happiness flowed in on her like liquid gold and she caught her breath andy she whispered andy later although she had anticipated a long ride in the moonlight he took her directly home the moonlight he said plus that starry-eyed look youre wearing would be too much for me im afraid did you know im called gun-shy andy  as he lifted his hand to the door handle del taunted him saying youre afraid and i dont mean gun-shy youve been evading my questions ever since you got back he couldnt leave her as he had the evening before with her heart full of un- answered questions-questions that would torment her all through the sleepless night his hand fell away from the door handle but he did not look at her i am afraid he said very distinctly del turned toward him swiftly shocked at the bitter intensity of his voice a queer hot feeling almost of fright spread through her as she listened each word seemed to come from down deep as if it had been hurting him for a long time before she could speak andy went on his voice bitter i should have known how it would be i should have had sense enough to stay away i want to kiss you-more than ive wanted anything for a long time he pressed his hands against his head youve got me all mixed up again he wanted to kiss her  a wild ting- ling joy throbbed in her blood and she thought hes going to kiss me as if he read her thoughts he said brutally dont let it throw you he straightened and his voice was once again bright and casual and uncaring there are matrimonial strings tied to your kisses well not for me my pet she gripped his arm and shook him furiously youre the most exasperatingly stubborn man ive ever met youre con- ceited and hard and hateful i hate you do you hear thoroughly all right  he said harshly you asked for it you wanted explanations so ill give them to you now-once and for all  im listening andy tte pushed back his hat and that un- rully lock of yellow hair fell forward again i was best man at a wedding once the first wedding id ever seen i was only twenty he paused when he spoke again his voice had dropped to a low thrilling pitch sweetheart stories and del felt queerly breathless and hurt remember the sun on those stained glass windows and the flowers and the organ music that made you tremble and want to-want to darn near bawl yes she said huskily i remember her throat ached at that memory if only it could be recaptured if only another such moment could be hers this time with andy the groom and she the bride dear heaven was that so much to ask she leaned closer as he went on then the music stopped the minister asked the usual questions and they answered without hesitation then there was the ring re- member how hushed and solemn it all seemed yes she said softly he stirred sud- denly and sat up straight yeah all the props were there and when youre twenty they can seem mighty im- pressive but ive never forgotten how shocked i was at the idea of a man stand- ing up there and vowing to love one girl until death it struck me all of a heap thinking how wrong it was they stand there and swear in all sincerity and solemnity a vow they have no more idea of keeping than- oh andy of course married people keep their vows del protested youre just being cynical how about buster and meg theyre just one case you cant- how about my mother and father since they divorced each other theyve been married and divorced several times they get a divorce almost every other year as casually as theyd buy a coat she laid her hand on his arm im sorry about you parents andy but you mustnt let them make you bitter do you know what percentage of mar- riages end in divorce oh why get statistical dell was getting a little desperate if a girl really loves her man shell keep her vows-and so will he tte shifted about to face her you want me to believe that you would she could see his face in the half light coming from the corner street lamp she whispered yes i would he threw back his head and laughed the more you talk the more you prove my point for four years youve flitted from romance to romance -what on earth makes you think you wouldnt flit from divorce to di- vorce the air in the lit- tle car was charged with tension every bit of her being was alert to catch the feel of what lay be- hind his words did he mean that he loved her but didnt trust her you dont know what i would do- you cant speak for my behavior either present or future she told him defiantly no and neither can you well youll never catch andy chilton standing before an altar making vows when he doesnt have the least idea what hes doing but if you loved a girl- love has nothing to do with it he reached out and gathered her hard against him his mouth fastened on hers you see he thrust her back that could be love but the only thing a girl like you wants is marriage you want mar- riage first last and always love in a strait jacket he opened the door stepped out and held out his hand for hers you see were right back where we started del love is for keeps he was a brute she decided later as she tearfully prepared for bed no he was adorable and lost he was bitter and mistaken and stubborn but she loved him he came to the store the next morning and stopped at her counter del ive something to say to you ill be around about seven-thirty tonight right all right andy she watched him walk out of the place hes got the lanky look of a boy she thought and with that glowing pink-cheeked face and yellow hair he looks about seventeen until you look into his eyes she bent to the silk stocking she was mending i wonder-will he tell me hes changed his mind about marriage perhaps if she made herself indispens- able to him-if she could be so necessary to his happiness that hed want her to be near him always    they drove in silence the night was starry and still and the air was filled with the myriad elusive smells of awaken- ing earth in spring del sighed vibrantly aware of andy here with her in the dark intimacy of his little coupe the car stopped the motor coughed into silence she wondered if hed kiss her i thought id tell you he began not looking at her that im going away again a chill blacked out the warm anticipa- tion she had felt going away but youve just come youve got your old job back and you said- i said i was staying but now-well i cant stay i want you more than id ever dreamed i could want any girl but you want marriage and i dont and so i have no right to stay if i go youll find someone else someone wholl say all the right vows and make all the right mo- tions- dont be so cynical she cried her lips trembling it doesnt become you im sorry his voice sounded weary im only trying to tell you how i feel honestly i want you now id swear any- thing in order to win you but how do i know how ill feel ten years from now how do you know i suppose you think we could get married anyway and if we fell out of love-well theres always di- vorce but theres no such thing in my book once im married its for keeps thats why im scared i cant promise a thing for always and be sure i can keep such a promise dont you see no i dont see she faltered all i know is that i love you ive never loved anyone else and i never will oh del my sweet he murmured raggedly and took her in his arms there was desperation in the way she clung to him and sweet abandon in her response to his kiss he pressed her fiercely against him and she twined her arms tightly about his neck every nerve in her body throb- bed with the knowledge that he loved her his kisses grew less fiercely demanding became sweet and achingly tender sweetheart he breathed i cant leave you i cant her lips left his lingeringly then dont go darling she whispered but what will we do del still had her fingers twined in his hair she gave a little tug well work ii out somehow youll see but later as she tossed feverishly in her bed she could not see a way out andy- loved her but was afraid of marriage theres always love without marriage yes but do i want that theres some- thing so shining and beautiful about my love for him i want to keep it that way and i will but the next evening andy had made up his mind once and for all they sat before the fire in her apartment andy on the edge of his chair as if ready for instant flight and del on the sofa her puzzled eyes on his face what is it andy im enlisting in the army thats final so this is goodby oh no darling no del put out her hands like a hurt child but why dont touch me he said irritably i cant think straight his usually ruddy cheeks were pale and he sat worrying his sweetheart stories lower lip with his teeth ive been waiting for the draft board to get around to me but they havent so im going to hurry it up a little thats all hphats all but she knew it wasnt all re was running away from her from love from responsibility arent you afraid youll be asked to swear something she asked sarcastically youll have to swear to fight for your country when the time comes and- thats different thats got nothing to do with love oh yes it has you love your country so you swear to fight for her shut up will you he cried and got to his feet he ranged around the room his hands thrust deep in his pockets his head bent im leaving tuesday del we have till then del sat clasping and unclasping her cold fingers his voice came to her from an- other part of the room we have the weekend del why cant we go away somewhere have just a little while to- gether he came and threw himself at her knees will you del do you care enough she reached her hand to his hair ri- diculous how she loved to twine her fingers in that tumbling forelock of yellow curls no dont touch him just be very quiet she told herself im sorry dearest he murmured in a lost sort of voice i cant offer anything permanent a broken little laugh escaped her youre still not in the mood for matri- mony is that it dont he cried and caught her in his arms she turned her head from his searching lips and shrank away from him he didnt care-not enough not nearly enough i cant go she said very cool now her emotions under control it would cheapen the way i feel about you i love you not for just today but for all the days to come and the hours between if youre ill or maimed if you need me or not ill still love you i want to be by your side always ill love you till life is done and she ended huskily that can only mean marriage andy tte looked at her in silence for a long time then got slowly to his feet del watched him put on his hat one hand pushing back his hair the other adjusting the hat just so she caught him at the door andy she cried andy she threw her arms about his stubborn neck and laid her forehead with its dark widows peak against his mouth andy she faltered give me time to decide ill give you my answer tomorrow night he kissed her swiftly tomorrow night then he said gently and was gone the next day was friday del sat at her counter her head bent over endless stock- ing runs her needle flashed in and out it was go with andy or lose him forever she blinked her long lashes so hard to hold back the tears that they threatened to entangle themselves in the silken mesh of her work for she knew she would not be going with andy she told him so that night my answer is no andy his face blanched at her words but he didnt seem surprised i guess i always knew what your answer would be he said slowly well-goodby he turned away with dragging steps goodby del couldnt bear to watch him go she fled to her room and smothered her sobs against her pillow why was a beautiful dream given to a girl only to be snatched away her memory of andy would al- ways be an empty hollow thing for there would be no remembered happy fulfilment to their love gradually her sobs merged into the deep breathing of sleep del went through the usual routine on saturday morning a quick shower a plain black wool dress zipped up with one hand while she reached for clean hanky purse and gloves with the other all her motions were automatic from force of long habit for her mind was busy dragging her  love is for keeps thoughts back from dangerous ground this was saturday she and andy might have spent it together she walked past the hall telephone then she stopped and stared at it her eyes filled with longing she had only to lift the receiver- she had loved andy and longed for him so long- her heart began to race as she picked up the receiver and dialed the store no she wasnt coming to work for a few days that was that now for andys num- ber with a few snicks of her red-tipped finger she burned her bridges behind her she heard andys voice and she said un- evenly andy its del when do we start his whoop of joy made her smile dar- ling can you be ready at eleven im ready now swell ill be right there rpo del there never had been such a - gloriously golden spring day she lowered the car windows to sniff the frag- rant wind laden with the earthy smells of growing green things she sat close against the reassuring warmth of andys body and thought fierce- ly i am happy i am then suddenly the fierceness was gone there was only a bewildered emptiness in her heart andy enlisting next week andy going away this time for good he would forget her andy she faltered aloud if you really loved me youd know its for keeps you wouldnt be afraid to promise- he said not taking his eyes from the road we can turn back you know she lifted her chin and said im not afraid andy you know that yes he laughed suddenly you al- ways were a plucky little thing one of the things i admired about you in fact i wanted to marry you once when i was about seventeen her grey eyes wistful she whispered what happened to that andy oh he got lost in the shuffle of life by the time i was twenty and you and i stood up for buster and meg my father had divorced my mother remarried and divorced again his voice was bitter again and del wept inside for that young andys hurt and dis- illusion and for his loneliness she felt a deep anger at all the forces that had com- bined to change him into this remote cynical young-old man ttow does it happen so many couples celebrate their golden wedding she wondered do they live together that long -  sweetheart stories war opportunities in

kate might think i dont know but we visit there to- day we can leave tomorrow on some pre- text but we wont leave tomorrow del thought determinedly by that time my plan will be working and if we do go there will be a wedding they turned off on the gravel road to bayonville and del was silent busy with her thoughts her plan had to work twelve hours or more under the neat roof of uncle berts farm house and andy would be a convert once he saw how happy they were after years and years of marriage he would slough off his warped ideas and all would be well dear god she thought achingly make it so

left the room there comes a time kate continued as if no interruption had occurred when you know there never could have been any- one else then promises dont matter you dont fret at them any more

so now that andy had guessed what it was she sighed im sorry dear his hand was warm on her arm i wish i could be everything youd like me to be oh andy dearest she cried and slid her arms about his neck please marry me he pressed her close and laid his cheek against hers i want to he whispered huskily but- but why del as i see it love comes and goes without our volition these old folks are just lucky thats all they didnt know fifty years ago that it would last a man cant promise to love one woman the rest of his life he doesnt know that hell do any such thing then you dont love me it was a statement bitter and bleak he laid his lips hotly agajnst here oh darling i love you so enough to promise anything  no she disengaged herself and turned away i dont want your promises unless you mean them he made no move to stop her as she went listlessly into the house and up to the room that aunt kate had given her that was that then she looked somberly at the silver moon- light that sliced across the old-fashioned spread on the bed and then suddenly she was crumpled up on it crying it might have been so beautiful yvhen she came down next morning andy was at the breakfast table with kate
