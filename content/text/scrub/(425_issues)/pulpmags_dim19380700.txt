  what was that figure from a dim dread age which rode through
  town enshrouded in the black folds of each dust storm sometimes it
  left in its wake a beautiful girl ravaged insane    sometimes there

 remained only a piti-
 ful heap of fragile
 feminine garments-
 where a lovely maid
 had stood trembling
 only seconds before

 out of the void

the veering flow of wind
whipped the old mans scraggly
white beard stirred the halo of
silver that fringed his bare head he

 would have been impressive clothed in a
 prophets robe of long ago but here up-
 on his soap-box in front of haneys drug
 store he was an absurd anachronistic

 an audience that was willing neither to
 listen nor to believe

  still he babbled on   
by donald dale

a long novel of nameless doom and sinister diabolical intrigue

the ominous cloud of swirling black
dust had already gobblld up the west
edge of  gem city- it was swirling
around banker jomaris big house and
beginning to lick greedily toward the
center of town more fervently the old
mans- sonoroas voice arose meddle not
with gods plans he has delivered this
land to satan flee ye from the wrath

to come escape the dust devil that rides
the storm

the few who made up the early satur-
day afternoon crowd on main street
scurried by unheeding a year ago they
might have been swayed by the super-
stitious exhortation of the old man who
called himself john the hermit for then
everyone had been discouraged ready to

give up his home and join the other
tragic dust-bowl refugees but now hope
renewed by the new reclamation work
they merely ducked hastily into store-
doors to wait for another duststorm to
blow over

  i grabbed kays arm and we sprinted
for haneys as we flew past the old
street preacher the only person in gem
city who was not diving for shelter from
the unpleasant black shower i yelled at
him to come in but stubbornly he held
his lowly pulpit and as we made the
drug-store just in time he flung a last
prophetic warning after us his shrill wild
voice endowing the familiar scripture
with the urgency of a newly-discovered
personal threat dust thou art to dust
returneth

tnside a number of people stood be-

  hind the show window staring up the
street as we joined them doc wal-
ters the nervous little pharmacist and
the two soda-jerkers left their post to
come up front silently we gazed out all
held by that peculiar fascination of a dust
storm that never lessens with familiarity
fierce wind-driven sandstorms we had
always known and accepted but even
in this third year of that plague upon our
land there still seemed something un-
canny about a sky-high wall of dust that
advanced stealthily turned a few minutes
of day into thick black night and passed
with no wind no movement except the
curious whirling and boiling within itself
that seemed to endow it with sinister life

  the advancing black cloud was half
way down the block now obscuring the
red-brick front of the post-office across
the street now scudding past rankins
hardware now drawing a curtain across
the pies in the window of henrys cafe

  from his box at the edge of the side-
walk the old man continued to gesticulate
wildly but his words were indistinguish-
able

he was the only person on the street
and i was thinking that perhaps we
should force him to come in when sud-
denly just as the duststorm edged in on
the west side of the drug-store window a
girl-a stranger in town-ran into view
from the east her bare head crowned
with a duchess braid of luxuriant raven-
black hair was lowered as her tall well-
formed body bent into an eddying gust
the high-boned cheek was waxen pale
and the strong white hands clenched
tightly before her

then the first dusty fingers reached
out from the seething wall to mold the
silken blouse against her breasts and im-
pudently flip the hem of the graceful
skirt above her knees and when in the
last minute before the storm swallowed
her i saw her fling her head up and
flash a wild look into the boiling mass
bearing down upon her i had the fantas-
tic thought that the pained contortion of
her regal features was caused not by fear
of the storm itself but by terror of some-
thing she had seen in the writhing dust

then before she could pass in her de-
termined eflfort to press on westward the
thick black cloud moved across the win-
dow completely wiping out our view   

as swiftly as it came the storm moved
on for a few minutes the heavy after-
drizzle of dust- still obscured the vision
then as suddenly it too cleared we surged
as one man against the glass to stare un-
believingly at the figure outside on the
dust-sprinkled walk i hardly heard the
shrieks and whimpers of fright that rose
up from the group for paralyzing terror
held me

it was the girl the lovely stranger
who had come into view just before the
storm struck but god what the storm
had done to her

the tall well-formed body was nude
except for a few ragged wisps of some
sheer garment that as the retreating wind
maids for the dust-devils



snapped back at them whipped around
her waist the black hair loosened from
its braid was now tumbled into wanton
curls as if it had just been rumpled in the
play of love the red mouth morst and
half-open seemed to bear the burning
print of fierce kisses all the strong grace
of her hinted shockingly of a delilahs
cruel ecstasies-just consummated

but in the split-second of my paralysis
i stared at the great ragged abrasions--
flecked with queer gelatinous globules-
that scraped her white shoulder diag-
onaled her arrogant breasts and dug
deeper across the undulating line of stom-
ach and thigh as if made by some mon-
ster from whose huge destructive hand
she had just escaped

she turned and her long-lashed eyes
seemed to stare straight into mine with
a flash of dazed triumph then she flung
her hand high-her right hand-grasping
a strange-looking grey thing and as
her long-drawn ululant cry split the air
she pitched face down on the dusty side-
walk

tnstantly i was in the street with
 the villagers and saturday-idle farm-
ers who surged out from the stores where
they had been watching the storm and
i began to realize a dreadful seriousness
in the situation

for three years the simple people of
this little farming community had seen
their labor bear nothing but sterility had
watched their homes slipping away their
families reduced to want the losing
struggle against unremitting deluges of
dust had left minds agonized nerves taut
to the breaking point and imagination
wild and morbid and now even though
the last few months had brought new
hope they were ready to stampede at the
first appearance of anything they did not
understand

immediately their oft-flayed minds re-
verted to the superstitious rantings of

john the hermit to supply a supernatural
explanation of this strange occurrence in
their midst there is little wind in a dust-
storm and so they whispered to each
other the girls attacker-her lover-must
have-been the dust devil

i had no time to think of explanations
for somehow though i had accepted the
assistant directorship of reclamation here
because kay frazer my fiancee was
teaching their small school my work had
come to mean more than a job and i felt
responsible now so sending kay inside
i mustered all possible firmness to deal
with the terrified mob crowding around
the nude unconscious girl

i urged them to stand back with mu-
tinous mutterings they slowly gave a few
feet but i saw nerves quivering in toil-
worn faces and superstition slinking into
dust-reddened eyes as dr larmer the
village practitioner crowded through and
knelt with me over the inert body of the
girl

she lay prone right arm doubled be-
neath her the left arm was outflung and
the left knee bent as if bracing against un-
utterable agony dr larmer did not look
at the girls pale patrician face half-cov-
ered with the loose ebony curls but hav-
ing fumbled his scarred stethoscope from
the battered case he placed it against the
blue-veined whiteness of her superb back
just under the left shoulder blade the
crowd held its breath while he squatted
there listening for her heart-beat and
stirred uneasily when a moment later he
turned to growl testily well shes all
right but somebodys got to take care of
her who is she

the question was flung all around but
in this village where each least detail of
everyones life is common knowledge no-
body claimed to know her who she was
where she had come from or why she
had entered the little isolated town was
a complete mystery

but dr larmer was impatiently insist-
dime mystery magazine

ing that someone take her for a few days
care knowing the town had no hospital
and no hotel i looked around the ring
of staring faces expecting many offers
from these usually hospitable westerners
grim silence met my unspoken appeal

mrs bailey i finally began wont
you-

but mrs bailey recoiled with shudder-
ing protest and her husband crowded for-
ward toward me belligerently i began
the same appeal to two or three others
whom i had in the past months been able
to befriend but all the crowd was back-
ing nervously away and no eyes would
meet mine

it was then as i was silently cursing
their stupid superstitiousness that kay
stepped through the nervous circle dan
she said to me why not let me take the
poor girl up to my cottage

involuntarily i recoiled a protest
springing to my lips while for an instant
i was flicked by the same illogical un-
easiness that had touched the supersti-
tious mob

but dr larmer was enthusiastically
accepting kays offer and ashamed of my
strange momentary lapse i had to agree
that the little cottage where kay and
her bronze-haired assistant anna falk
lived was the best place for the lovely
stranger the staring circle had closed in
again but someone pushed through to
spread a blanket beside the still white girl
i helped the doctor turn her over and
started to wrap the blanket around her

then i saw-the thing she clutched in
her hand

a wave of fantastic thoughts washed
over my mind and i was hardly aware of
the recoiling circle as terrified they
stepped on each other in their haste to
back away but my own wild thoughts
were prodded by their choking staccato
fear the dust devil  i told you
   hell git us all    god-a-mighty
lets git outa here  dust to dust i

as if under compulsion i forced loose
the girls convulsive grip but my fingers
refused to receive the thing and it
thumped to the walk soddenly tingling
with a queer creeping fear i stared-
tried to force myself to characterize the
thing

grey malformed elongated ragged at
one end it was like life as it had first
manifested itself in the beginning of time
-a repulsive shapeless blob-enlarged
to monstrous size a tentacle from the
body of a huge rhizopodic monster to en-
gulf and consume an enticing victim

then my eyes jerked to the girls hand
to one white finger clung a shred of
green-like algal slime and across the
upturned palm was a deep furrow almost
to the bone filled with a clear gelatinous
substance it was as if the touch of the
gruesome thing had caused devolution-
reduced the girls flesh to protoplasm-to
its own protozoan state

      chapter two
      mates for the dust-devil

coon after kay and dr larmer had
taken the unconscious girl away i
stood in the prescription room of the drug-
store with several others staring at that
queer mass of matter walters the phar-
macist had carefrilly scooped it onto a
rubber pad and carried it in there and
while he examined it i began to get con-
trol of my thoughts i realized that the
unknown girls clothes could have been
torn from her by some freakish whirlpool
in the dust and the grey object must be
something floating in the storm which she
had convulsively grabbed it wasnt-it
couldnt be-life

   but the four or five men who had fol-
lowed us inside were strained and silent
as walters got tongs and probe from a
drawer and fearfully poked at the gelati-
nous mass on the pharmaceutical mixing
slab the reverend clark wilson ad-
maids for the dust-devils



justed his tie cleared his throat and said
huskily perhaps dr larmer had best
be present at the analysis

jan christman the towns huge blond
plumber shot a quick glance at the stern
aristocratic face of banker jordan and
said nervously maybe some of you think
i got a nerve crowdin in here but im
here and i got my opinions lets dont
stall about this thing lets look at it
right now

with only one purpose i spoke our
people are in the grip of a grave menace-
the menace of fear unless we can find
a solution to this mystery that will satisfy
them we can not save them from them-
selves they will desert this place as
they so long have been on the verge of
doing and here on the very eve of re-
covery all our reclamation work will go
for nought im sorry to have spoken so
long but-

you are exactly right my boy bank-
er jordan said between thin lips if the
people desert now they cannot pay off
their mortgages and ill be ruined-left
with countless acres of barren worthless
land on my hands

it was like him to be thinking only of
himself even at a time like this a hot
retort sprang to my lips but at that mo-
ment monroe shelton director of recla-
mation and dynamite tate his right-
hand man pushed into the little room
shelton with his usual over-politeness
shook hands all around and his long bony
hand in mine was like ice

immediately walters began to poke at
the ugly grey mass and all heads stooped
low above it as a cleft was forced in
the dark gelatinous substance i forgot
my glib rationalization and once more a
deep instinctive fear began to stir in me
the thing was boneless and without def-
inite form all the way through it was
like gelatine impregnated with dust or-
i could not keep the thought back-like
dust-engendered protoplasm congealed

because cut off from the source of life

   walters pale eyes behind the huge
shell-rimmed glasses were wild and ex-
cited he was muttering under his breath
god why not     protozoa were en-
gendered from primordial ooze and this
-the monster rhizopod from which this
tentacle came-could be bred of the dust
the friction    the static electricity
of the dust storm   his voice rose
hysterically-why not why not
god in heaven jordan licked his
thin lips its even easier to believe than
the other every one accepts the first
theory of the spontaneous generation of
life then why not this god it is as
true as life itself-your life miner

tvtothing but harm had come of our
awkward attempt to examine the thing
that looked like the tentacle of some amor-
phous monster and when dr larmer
joined us later his nervous examination
of it and his few pretentious remarks
added nothing so we wrapped the thing
carefully planning to send it for analysis
the next day to the science department of
midwest college

   i lingered a moment at the drug-store
to inquire again if anyone had seen the
hermit since the storm and to question
dr larmer about the lovely stranger who
had suffered such peculiar disaster from
the duster

   his usual garrulity seemed to have de-
serted him coma my boy coma he
said brushing past me

   but i stepped outside after him and
went with him to his office door i had
to ask one more question and the queer
glutinous wounds-what caused them 
seem to be from some acid capable
of producing glutinosity he mumbled
hastily and bolted into the door leaving
me standing in the street   

   a feeling of sadness and a premonition
of disaster swept over me it was satur-
day afternoon and yet there were no
dime mystery magazine

children racing gayly in and out with
candy and ice-cream cones no romances
budding on street-corners and at soda
fountains no chattering women peering
through windows at gay prints no men
swapping yarns at the curb

instead families were huddled together
in old fords and ramshackle wagons in
the care of the strangely-silent women-
folk while nearby knots of men talked
together in urgent tones one throng
caught sight of me the group pressed
together and lowered their voices to a
whisper

in front of the barber shop a cluster
of my men-laborers on the reclamation
project-suddenly stopped their talking
and looked toward me as if hoping for
some reassurance but i only waved and
passed on for what did i have to say

so with a queer intangible dread tag-
ging at my heels i walked the few blocks
to kays house i wanted to see if i could
get some clue from the girl she had taken
into her home

but kay would not let me arouse the
girl who lay on her bed waxen eyelids
closed black eyelashes making a fringed
shadow on the ivory cheek nor would
she let me draw her wounded hand from
under the cover to examine it so leaving
anna kays assistant with the sick girl
i drew kay into the living-room and
pressed her dear warm body close to me
trying desperately to regain a feeling of
normality

but she herself was strangely nervous
and distraught it was almost as if she
a woman knew something i could not
know

for long minutes she clung to me si-
lently then fearfully she asked me the
one question i hoped she would not think
of dan    darling    did- what
about the thing the girl held in her hand 

well dearest i tried to answer cas-
ually naturally theres no one here who
is capable of-

but what she insisted in a frightened
whisper does it look like  what do you
believe 

dont bother your head about it dar-
ling for tomorrow it goes to midwest
college for analysis and the strain of
uncertainty will be-

the telephone bell shrilled into the
room nervously kay jumped to answer
for you then she said

it was walters voice excited hysteri-
cal dan its gone

but who-where- i began not
needing to ask what he was talking about

i dont know i locked it in the poison-
cabinet-the thing the tentacle and now
its gone or-dissolved

a few minutes later i was with wal-
ters in his little cubby-hole his
excitement had been all out of propor-
tion to what had happened it was very
simple a bottle of add had overturned
and broken the thing down into a harm-
less pool of dust and almost-clear fluid
and somehow i felt relieved i was just
going to phone kay to reassure her when
from out somewhere in the street a cry
of terror rose up it spread grew surged
until it overflowed the street and filled
the stores around

with insane visions of some indescrib-
able monster crawling over mangled
corpses toward new victims i dashed to
the front part of the drug-store the door
was open and screaming fctnldren gibber-
ing women white-faced men were piling
in through the narrow entrance

what is it i cried out atnrst no
one answered

at last clem jones whose farm i had
terraced for him only the day before
croaked in terror a dust-storm two
in one day taint natural another dust-
storm 

another dust-storm  two in one
day i had never heard of dust-storms
coming so close together for a moment
maids for the dust-devils



i myself felt that our world was besieged
by some sinister inhuman force but of
course that was silly this thing could
not be supernatural it was only unusual
nonsense clem its only-

but this morning- he whispered
the thing that-

as if the mention of the thing were
a signal sharp cries rang out from those
up in front who stood gazing out the
window i pushed my way in among
them stood behind the plate glass where
kay and i that very morning had watched
the first dust storm and a cold fatalistic
premonition swept over me i felt that the
gears of time had slipped backward-that
i had lived this exact moment before
knew what had happened and must there-
fore happen now predestined from the
beginning

as before the street was deserted only
this time not even john the hermit was
there to cry out his frantic warnings the
dust-cliff was slipping down the street
now it was scudding past rankins hard-
ware across the street now beginning to
draw a curtain across the show-window
of henrys cafe

it was like a movie film i had seen be-
fore i knew its inevitable sequence so
in a queer daze i stared into the street
waiting for what must come waited until
at the moment the storm was almost upon
us there appeared as was fated to appear
-a girl one lone girl

but this time it was not a regal
stranger it was gertie glass the pretty
little blonde waitress coming out of the
rosebud beauty shop across the street a
newspaper held over her fresh finger-
wave she was dashing for henrys cafe
just two doors west of the beauty shop
hurrying to her five-oclock shift

blind unreasonable fear clutched at
me-fear for the girl-fear that i was
on the verge of some cataclysmic soul-
shattering discovery something my mind
could not support

she was in sight only a split second but
i saw a teasing finger of wind reach out
and press the flimsy green uniform-blouse
against her breasts another eddy whipped
the green skirt close about her firm young
hips then in the boiling palisade of dust
that was almost upon her i seemed to see
a denser more definite blob with long
hideous feelers pushing out from its huge
amorphous body-like some rhizopodic
monster bred from the dust eagerly seek-
ing a victim my wild imagination saw a
long grey tentacle reach out slap the
newspaper from the girls hair clutch the
still-wet yellow ringlets and-

somehow i broke my paralysis and
sprang to the door but by the time i was
outside i saw her hand reach out toward
the latch

the door opened and then the storm
hit blotting out everything   

the illusion of a monster in the swirl-
ing dust had lasted no longer than the
flicker of an eyelash yet as i jumped
back inside and stared into the dust-
darkened street i could not keep from
picturing an insatiable inhuman menace
stalking our town i tried to recall my
glib explanations of what had happened
to the strange girl whom kay was now
giving shelter but all i could think of
was the queer gelatinous disintegration
of her flesh and the grisly tentacle torn
from her attacker

i was completely oblivious to the nerv-
ous crowd around me held by a queer
illogical excitement i waited for the storm
to blow over never taking my eyes from
the spot just outside the cafe door where
i had last seen gertie it was as if i
knew that when the storm rolled over
another nude girl would stand in the
streets of gem city-a victim of the dust
devil

the thought was absurd i knew be-
sides i had seen the girls hand on the
door and knew she must now be safely
inside serving the refugees that crowded

the cafe yet i watched    when the
storm passed on and i could see through
the fine drizzle of dust it had left behind
the street was completely deserted i was
turning away feeling relief as illogical as
my fears had been when something on the
sidewalk just outside the cafe door caught
my eye something green lying on the
walk

  gertie glasss uniform but what had
happened to her

tn a second i was across the street the

  clothes were not thrown about the
walk nor yet lying in a heap as if some-
one had undressed her but together in
proper order still holding limply the shape
of her body the orange-cuffed sleeves
wildly outflung extending from beneath
the flimsy green skirt the cheap silk hose
reaching out limply into the high-heeled
pumps the weekly clarion the news-
paper that had covered her fresh finger-
wave scudded toward the gutter

  i knelt above that strange arrangement
of garments and peered at the row of
buttons beginning at the close-fitting or-
ange collar and running down the front
of the blouse-still buttoned and the
skirt-belt that had fitted so snugly around
the girls small waist-still hooked

  dully i ran my eyes from the neck of
the dress down the limp bodice skirt and
hose to the tips of the patent leather
pumps but how- before i could force
my mind to admit the answer that seemed
to be pounding at me an excited crowd
had gathered and constable john sears
blundered through exclaiming testily
whats this whats this

  he snatched at the green dress and
from within it slid to the walk two small
bits of cheap silk underwear

  then the wild thought i had been re-
sisting crashed through to my conscious-
ness side by side in my mind was an
amoebas shifting fluid form and the huge
grey tentacle of some gelatinous substance

like congealed dust-infused protoplasm
one is as easy to believe as the other
jordans trembling voice had said

  i remembered the hand of the unknown
girl and the path across her breasts and
hips-glutinous like the primal stuff of
life

  and now this i could not escape the
admission of what these clothes suggested
-a body converted to protoplasmic fluid-
ity flowing out of civilizations garb to
become-a mate for the dust monster i

  while my thoughts dragged back
through time to the primordial ooze i
was one with the wild-eyed superstitious
crowd that stared with me at the limp
garments we seemed all bound together
in an eternity of terrified silence the
world would go on like this forever with-
out movement or sound then suddenly
from far up the street a wild shrill scream
of agonized terror rose keened its way
into our raw minds

  god can the mind of man endure
more  i cried to myself as i plunged up
the street toward the cry the others stum-
bling after me crashing into each other
in their panic two blocks up we came
to the creature who had uttered that
scream of agony-a mother standing in
her front yard staring with glazed eyes
at a strange arrangement of dainty gar-
ments-like a limp paper-doll cut-out
another girl gone

  then before the full horror of that
scene could sink into our minds from
farther on in the deepening twilight an-
other scream hoarse agonized torn from
a strong mans throat and others to the
north to the south rising up from every
direction

  like leaves driven by a gust of wind
the terror-maddened crowd swept through
the streets of that little town tracking
down tragedy but i did not follow
heart cold with fear i ran into a corner
grocery and called kays number

  at the blessed relief of hearing her
maids for the dust-devils



voice i clung to the phone-box weakly
darling darling are you all right
i shouted wildly

   yes of course dear but i seem to
hear shouting down the street what is
it

   thanking god that the little school
house and cottage was at the edge of
town and she could not know the horror
sweeping around her i calmed myself
to say im coming right up promise me
you will not go outside until i get there

   as i turned from the phone to start
to kay shelton came in the door of the
grocery pale and tense he forgot his
usual annoying over-politeness and spoke
to me without greeting dan ive got to
get mrs shelton and our daughter out
of here dynamite will drive us into ok-
lahoma city youll have to hold the
works until i get back the men have
their orders for tonight so therell be just
the sunday shifts well be back by mon-
day morning

   then the full weight of my responsibil-
ity settling upon me i stepped into the
dusk of the street and saw doc walters
stumbling down the walk back toward
town

   catching sight of me he stopped to try
to tell me of the swath of horror cut
through the little town with terror-
drunk tongue he enumerated the names
of the victims described the nuclei of
grief and madness scattered among the
people-two four five seven seven
feminine costumes lying limply in the
street seven lovely bodies by some hell-
ish metamorphosis delivered into the
power of an incredible monster

   seven mates for the dust devil   

       chapter three
       into the darkness

t had found kay at the point of col-
lapse for she had learned after my
telephone call of the disappearance of the

girls and anna falk her assistant was
among them but now a dull incredulity
had settled upon her there on the table
was annas volume of swinburne marked
with her favorite book-mark over a
chair-back was flung her blue scarf in
her desk letters from her mother and her
sweetheart waited to be answered

but she was gone and there was
nothing we could do no coffin to buy
no body for the undertaker how
where in what hideous state did her
body exist impatiently i jerked my mind
back for i must not let it slide off again
into the wild thoughts i had had when
i looked at those empty clothes on the
side-walk

it cant be kay kept saying things
like this dont happen

yet they had happened gertie glass
the pretty waitress clear-eyed jane
thomas on her way to a violin lesson
the lovely black-haired bride of lloyd
jones  the vivacious red-headed kelsy
twins in town from the farm the taffy-
haired blue-eyed slow-speaking bertha
christman and anna-here at the edge
of kays lawn

it was madness to enumerate them try-
ing to force some pattern from those awe-
some tragedies the only certainty was
that these girls were gone-gone most
horribly   

suddenly a thought burst in my brain
the victims had not been chosen indis-
criminately 

there was a pattern a frighteningly
obvious one all victims were girls beau-
tiful girls

again the wild thought flashed through
my mind that these girls had been taken
to become mates for the dust monster the
lovely unknown in the adjoining room
had won the struggle-at the cost of only
a bit of flesh the others had lost and
their bodies had at the vile touch flowed
out to-god knew what

disgustedly i checked my thoughts

for i knew i must get rid of these wild
intangible ideas now was the time for
common-sense there was danger here
no use to deny that menace was lying
in wait for every lovely woman in our
town and kay-kay was the loveliest
of them all

and it seemed to me now that i had
forced myself to think straight that there
was only one answer some degenerate
monster was loose in our land some sex
criminal under the cover of the dusters
had invaded our town stolen the flower
of our womanhood thank god kay had
been inside attending the sick girl

i had come here to make sure of kays
safety and await the telephone call to
announce that the posse which was being
organized was ready to start i was more
eager than ever to start now-to track
down the fiend who stalked our girls and
i began charting a route of search in my
notebook

kay excused herself saying i must
prepare my sick guest something to eat
i succeeded in getting her to take some
soup at lunch

while kay was making the soup i
went into the bedroom and looked in
pity at the lovely ghost-pale face framed
in heavy black waves of hair the cover
rose and fell with her quiet even breath-
ing but her waxen face was like an
exquisite death mask when kay came
in to feed her i went back through the
living-room to the kitchen and stood look-
ing at the stubbornly silent telephone
suddenly i heard a crash-a tray of
dishes clattering to the floor and kay was
calling dan dan

i hurried back through kitchen dinette
and living-room to help kay with her
patient and pulled up sharp staring in
dismay at-emptiness

dishes lay in a shattered heap beside
an overturned chair the covers of the
bed were in wild disarray the bed-
rooms outside door swung ajar against

the darkness outside both girls were
gone

t dont know all the things i did dur-
ing those next few hours i plunged in
all directions down dark streets even be-
yond into the country road i flooded
the little two-roomed schoolhouse with
a flashlight and searched in every closet
and corner i called i wept i cried-out
kays name i went down town and
begged constable sears for help he said
that the posse had been difficult to or-
ganize but that it would be ready to start
before long to him kay was just an-
other girl-not the only girl in the world

   completely exhausted and defeated i
went back to the little cottage for then
i seemed closer to kay i threw myself
on the bed buried my face in her pillow
and tried desperately to make sense of
the last ten hours

   god only ten hours for it was not
yet midnight and it had been almost two
when i had stood over the nude body of
the beautiful stranger who had been the
first to be attacked by the foul fiend

   and as my thoughts came around to
her i realized how selfish i had been in
my grief for kay not one thought had
i given the girl whose scarred body had
been snatched from the sick-bed in what
cabin could she and kay be were they
at this minute in the arms of a sex-crazed
fiend how could he have stolen them
with so little noise    

   suddenly i heard the door-lock click
softly i raised my head stared as slowly
the knob turned i never moved gaze
riveted to that little brass ball moving
almost imperceptibly at last the door
fell back and framed in the doorway
against the black background of night was
-the lovely stranger

   her beautiful perfectly-molded body
was covered only by the sheer flowing
folds of a chiffon night-gown the clas-
sic strength of her-the long firm thighs
maids for the dust-devils



the plastic curving waist the proud lift-
ing breasts the straight smooth throat-
was like the perfection of a beautiful
grecian statue

i sprang to her gripped her fine white
shoulders kay i cried out where
is kay

her dark violet eyes looked deep into
mine her arms encircled my neck her tall
body swayed against me wilted in my
arms

hastily i guided her to the bed tried
to stretch her out upon its tumbled sheets
make her comfortable but she pulled
me down to the edge of the bed and
curved herself close against me her
strong young arms fast around my waist
her hair a black pool against the grey
lapel of my coat her eyes closed as if
in deep contentment her full scarlet lips
smiling provocatively

impatiently i shook her i shouted at
her where is kay

her beautiful mouth curved as if for
speech my heart stood still as i waited
for her words but suddenly her lips
closed tightly and terror seemed to flick
over her features then all the tense-
ness was gone out of her and with a
long sigh she fell back in my arms un-
conscious 

when the call finally came and i rode
through the dark village to join the posse
at the court-house square i could see here
and there lighted windows where i knew

bereaved families were keeping the death-
watch without even the comfort of the
cold peaceful body of the loved one

we searched every possible hiding-place
in the whole barren countryside including
the shacks at the reclamation camp and
when we returned in the chill prairie dawn
with no word for the bereaved i won-
dered if it were possible that their grief
could match the aching despair in my own
heart

now as i had never ceased to do
through the long futile night of search-
ing i kept thinking of the stranger who
lay in kays bed and it seemed to me
that the clue we needed must rest with
her by what strange coincidence had she
escaped-twice-when the others had
been swallowed up so completely was
she a hellish decoy an accomplice in the
diabolic plot that had carried away our
girls it is true she couldnt have car-
ried kay away with so little struggle but
she could have signalled to someone out-
side how else could anyone have known
that for that brief instant kay was out
of my sight

yet if she were a fake if she were
not a girl in a hypnotic trance induced by
fright then she was the cleverest de-
ceiver i had ever seen at the edge of
town i left the posse and went by the
cottage where i had left her with dr
larmer the only person i had been able
to persuade to stay with her but he said

that there had been no change except
perhaps a deepening of the coma

   so i left for the mass-meeting that was
to gather about sun-up my feeling of
futility deepened as i had to pull aside
to let pass an old wagon loaded with
shabby household goods upon which rode
man wife and five children with grey
hopeless faces and fearful eyes and a
little further on was a ramshackle ford
its trailer filled with pitiful remnants of
a home

nhhey were on their way out i knews

   these were the people kay and i had
tried so hard to help this is what had
become of our dream of enriching our
love by service my grief became identified
with this tragedy of the people and settled
more inexorably upon me

   but the deserters were few and when
the mass-meeting was over i had a new
appreciation of the courage and common-
sense of these level-headed laconic men
for even though an ungodly supersti-
tious fear gleamed in the eyes of many
they had with a few brusque words
bound themselves together in a pact to
stick with their homes and their land
rather than drag their families out to
join the thousands of hopeless unwanted
wanderers driven from town to town they
were going to stay pinning their last
hopes on the work of reclamation-our
work-today my work for the first time
since i had lost kay i remembered that
the whole project was in my hands for
the day

   at the thought courage rose in me to
match the hope and determination of these
people i got my car and drove the five
miles to the center of operations-the al-
most-finished irrigation well and its sys-
tem of canals-to supervise the day shift
though i was late and the night-workers
were already off duty the day men had
not yet gone to work they were all
huddled in nervous groups around the

long pine breakfast tables talking fur-
tively it was the first time work had
ever stopped since we had begun opera-
tion six weeks before as soon as they
saw me the night men scattered and the
others went to work

the day was a tortured blur i was
torn between duty and love yet i know
i would have deserted the work had there
been anything to be done for kay but
during the night our posse had covered
everything soon the state police would
be out now there was nothing i could
do

but i wore myself out dashing into
town to inquire for news and back to
camp to try to keep the nervous restive
men on the job as the day wore on my
activities no longer seemed separate
events but were all jumbled together into
one blur of restless unhappiness i kept
wishing there were forests or hills or
some place in this barren country where
i could spend my energy in search and
it must have been a need for a change that
took me late in the afternoon over to the
dry coulee which i had always felt in spite
of sheltons arguments should be made
a useful part of our work and when i
stood on the steep cliff at the top of the
arroyo i wondered crazily if i found good
use for this sun-baked dust-blighted hol-
low the almighty might accept it as a
sort of bribe to help me find kay safe
and untouched by horror

suddenly far down at the other end of
the dry coulee i saw a little cloud of mist
hovering close to the ground strangely
like the mists that hovered over the new
earth when first life began to stir then
the mist curled thinned and i could see
what it veiled

all sense of reality left me it was as
if my wild thought had transported me a
million years back in time-a man forced
to look upon his own meaningless pro-
tozoic origin for through the thinning
cloud of mist i could see tiny creatures
maids for the dust-devils



moving about designlessly in what seemed
a pool of black slime

like a visitor upon a backward planet
i stood in the huge lonely prairie and
looked upon this spot squirming with
senseless primal life-crowded and slug-
gish like that in a drop of stagnant water
under a powerful microscope

a big grey shape with long waving
feelers dominated that little drop of life
the smaller white blobs around it seemed
to be alternately attracted and repelled
to the monstrous thing by some strange
sub-normal force

a big grey shape    and smaller white
ones

suddenly my mind broke through the
fetters of unreality i snatched my field
glasses from my belt trained them upon
the far-off cluster of squirming life and
then-sanity left me

the grey shape became a monster
huge hideous-with one of his slimy ten-
tacles shortened ragged as if a piece had
been torn from it the smaller white
figures were nude girls drifting about in
the crowded pit with a queer uncertain
aimlessness it was i thought with hor-
ror as if they had lost all sense of pur-
poseful locomotion-had reverted to pri-
mordial vagueness

with shaking fingers i sharpened the
focus of my glasses the white creatures
skins had a pearly translucence and be-
neath j seemed barely to see blood cours-
ing sluggishly through the flesh that must
have turned to protoplasm

i thought of the gelatinous deterioration
of the unknown girls hand where the
thing had touched her i thought of gertie
glasss empty green uniform i stared at
the creatures below and i had to accept
the crazy idea that since the first disaster
had terrorized the minds of the people

these girls had reverted to a lower
stage of life they had become mates of
the dust devil i could no longer deny it

i had seen it with my own eyes

chapter four

satan rides the storm

rphe big grey thing reached out one
long tentacle and drew a white figure
to him letting the formless tip wander
down the firm hollow of her back and then
slip lower and cling close against the
filthy chest glowed the blond curls-
gertie glass no- it was what had been
gertie glass

  then the thing shoved the girl from
him and insinuated a feeler among the
surging feminine bodies and drew an-
other forward he turned the beautiful
body around and pulled the snowy white
back close to him the obscene tentacle
curled around her graceful body moved
with slow undulations around the slender
waist desecrating that loveliness with its
unholy caress

and the hapless creature was kay

  over and over i said those words
that is kay but for seconds the fact
did not explode in my mind it thumped
dully like a dud bomb and lay sizzling
uncertainly then it burst crazily slitting
my mind with red streaks of insanity

  that hideously lovely creature whose
movements were vague and aimless whose
skin had taken on a sort of ectoplasmic
translucence whose body was in the em-
brace of a grey rhizopodic monster-that
was kay

  with agonized eyes i measured the
distance then jumped into my car and
raced around the dangerous rocky edge
of the coulee losing sight at times of the
awful group below and then regaining
it only to lose it again i had no plan
no definite thought i only knew that now
i had something tangible to fight and my
body was powerful with fury

  at last i skidded my car to a stop
above the point i thought must be the
pit where the monster was toying with
the girls he had made his creatures i

flung myself to the ground and started
to plunge down the steep rock-strewn
slope despair stopped me in mid-stride

balanced grotesquely on the edge i
stared unbelieving into the coulee below
yes the pit was there-a black slimy
spot in that stretch of sere brown but
it was empty deserted there was no
monster no creatures who had once been
girls no kay

stumbling crazily i plunged down the
slope my existence became a kaleido-
scope of futile action i examined every
crack and corner of that shallow black
hole there was no way for anyone to
disappear beneath it i raced back and
forth across that small narrow coulee
tearing at the cliff walls with bare bleed-
ing hands examining every stone every
dry shrub and though i knew they could
not have got out on top without my see-
ing them i found in the gulch no hiding
place   

it must have been a long time before
i tore myself away from my futile search
for the prairie night was falling swiftly
before i climbed out and crawled dazedly
into my car and it must have been habit
or a subconscious sense of responsibility
that directed me back toward project head-
quarters

the first thing i knew i had parked
my car down behind the bunkshacks all
were dark except one where bill sharp
the old timekeeper for the day sat in the
door whittling as usual the day-men
had all gone into town as i started
up the little slope that carried me over
to the almost-finished canal on the other
side where the night shift must now be
working i remembered uneasily the
powerful undercurrent of restlessness and
queer excitement that had hung over the
camp all day i recalled with new emotion
-new understanding-the snatches of
wild conversation i had overheard at the
table at noon the laborers had dwelled
too much on the disappearance of the

girls and their unlettered minds had
seized upon parts of the attempted scien-
tific explanations mingling them with the
worst of the superstitions and in half-
fearful obscenity they had been speculat-
ing upon the terrifying pleasure of con-
sorting with a dust-monsters mate

at that time i had felt only deep
disgust that the kidnaping of seven
of the towns loveliest girls could breed
such vile and insane thoughts and i
knew with fierce anger that some of them
must be thinking of kay in particular
for i had often brought her to the project
and seen these men who had been too
long in a mens camp separated from
wives and sweethearts look covetously
upon her feminine loveliness

the flood-lights that lit the night work
were out of sight behind the hill and
the weird ruddiness that hung in the air
just above was like the sullen glow from
the forges of hell the huge pistons of
the well-drill thumped into the great
empty night like a giant heart and the
earth shook under my feet with every
impulse of the snarling drill as it bit its
way into the earth seeking ruthlessly the
water that the creator had seen fit to hide
from man all the conventional world
of cities night-clubs factories homes
seemed to break off and drift away leav-
ing this bit of dry dusty prairie an island
to float helplessly in infinite space it was
as if-

suddenly i was yanked back into real-
ity my cold leaden heart leaped to my
throat and then i was running running
madly to the crest of the slope for as if
set into motion by a hot vicious puff of
a monsters breath on the other side
toward the ruddy aura of light swept a
small cloud of dust

it was moving fast and in a second it
hovered over the little hollow where i
knew the men would be working faster
and faster my feet pounded up the slope i
maids for the dust-devils



dont know what i expected to find but
my tortured unreasoning mind told me
one thing disaster and destruction ride
the dust

god could i get there in time and
time time for what my whirling
brain echoed still i ran one flying foot
caught on a mesquite root i stumbled
recovered and at last leaped to the crest
of the slope

the dust-cloud had just swept past and
the little hollow halved by the canal with
its high ridge of loose dirt alongside was
clearly revealed i dont know what i ex-
pected to find but the thing i saw was
inconceivable i think i cried out i know
my legs stiffened became cold dead props
beneath me as i stared at the panorama
of horror below

the girls all of them as i had seen
them in the coulee the protoplasmic
translucence of their white skin here and
there smooth shoulder rose-tipped breast
or full curving thigh accented by a wisp of
greenish slimy algal deposit white soft
arms curving and waving aimlessly like
-boneless tentacles hideously beauti-
ful revoltingly alluring they huddled to-
gether in an uncertain blob like a clus-
ter of microscopic life in a drop of water
and around their feet spread a thin wet
plash as if they had just been lifted from
some alluvial pool

and the men dirty-faced horny-
handed clad in their greasy overalls they
stood opposite in a tense ragged semi-
circle staring wildly at those white nude
bodies astonishment    fear    and
then-a beginning of something else it
flamed in their hungry red-rimmed eyes
showed in convulsive hands and the nerv-
ous jerking of strong muscular limbs

suddenly butch blunt broke the semi-
circle with a lumbering step forward head
lowered like an advancing bull and one
of the nude creatures with that queer
floating motion moved from the little
white cluster toward the man with her

movement a wisp of slimy green loosened
from a translucent shoulder and slithered
over the mound of breast and floated to
the ground with a deep hungry bellow
blunt leaped forward and snatched the
girls slender body to him

and the sharpness of the horror broke
through into my consciousness for that
girl-that creature who had surrendered
-was kay

tugging at my gun i plunged down
the slope and scrambled upon the high
loose dirt that flanked the narrow canal

as if blunts advance had been a signal
the other men had plunged forward the
white creatures had broken from their
group and now all was one mad milling
jumble only one thought drove me-to
put an end to the thing kay had become
at the dust devils disintegrating touch

my eyes searched the mad melee
caught sight of her i raised my gun fin-
ger to trigger then somewhere from be-
hind me a heavy crushing blow thudded
upon my head and the hideous scene
the white nude figures the tense ad-
vancing men-everything-was wiped
from my consciousness

yty body had no existence except as
an anguishing heaviness without mo-
bility or form i could not move i could
not open my eyes i knew only unutter-
able agony

i felt a trickle of blood oozing from a
red-hot streak across my head slipping
down upon my leaden eyelid i tried to
raise my hand to brush it away but i had
no hands no legs no feet my body was
a solid imponderable fusion of pain and
pressure-pain as huge and heavy as the
universe

thin and far away in the cosmic void
i could hear the murmur of amorous
voices mens fast excited breathing and
teasing lascivious laughter of things that
were once girls-the tantalizing pretenses
that precede surrender but it had no im-
dime mystery magazine

port to me it was only a part of this
meaningless world in which i existed only
as a titanic block of solid pain

then one voice separated itself from the
others became individualized the trav-
esty of a voice i had once known in a
deep ecstatic ripple of wordless passion-
rose and then was smothered as if by the
pressure of eager lips a feminine voice
-kays

kay i knew then i must open my eyes
with an agony of effort i forced up my
burning lids but the red pain obscured
my vision and the scene somewhere in
front of me was a meaningless blur of
moving forms

yet terror such as i had never known
rose up in me as i became aware of a
strangeness about myself my eyes were
almost on a level with the ground my
chin touched the earth and i had no
body

again i could hear that voice-the
voice of the thing that had once been kay
-raising in amorous excitement with al-
most superhuman effort i slowed the mad
whirling in my head squeezed my eyes
tight together stretched them open and
for the first time since i had been struck
i returned to full consciousness

i realized where i was and madness
seized me as i surveyed the horrible situa-
tion i could not understand why but i
knew it was a shrewd human hand that
had struck me down and imprisoned me
in such horrible way and the girls-it
was no weird and unnatural change that
had come over them but in some queer
crazed state they the loveliest girls of our
community-kay among them-were giv-
ing themselves to this orgy

it was some fiendish human plot

only a cruel mind could have conceived
such incarceration-such entombment-
as mine my body had been placed up-
right in a hole up to the neck and dirt
had been shoveled in and packed tightly
the fiend had planned my torture shrewd-

ly for i was on a slight elevation forced
to face a sight to drive any man to mad-
ness

   the little basin that had been the scene
of our sane scientific reclamation efforts
was now a hellish pit of lewd bacchanalian
revelry god i had never realized how
action even impotent or futile threshing
around can relieve strain if only i could
have clenched my fists lunged against
rasping bonds thrown my shoulders
against restraining bars but all i could
do was look let my eyes communicate
to my aching brain horrors too ghastly for
comprehension

   the revelers had built a bonfire and
like savages were flinging themselves
wildly around it the girls translucent
bodies floating as if with primitive in-
stinct through an unspeakable dance with
tantalizing prolongation of each shame-
less gesture like a picture in slow motion
the mens clothes were partly torn off
and their strong muscular bodies jerked
to some fierce inaudible rhythm

hphey made one twisting writhing
mass of violence and lust-these crea-
tures who seemed mates of the dust mon-
ster and these men who had dreamed of
their unholy love but for my eyes there
was only one-kay the girl i loved and
in its cruel grave my body could find no
expression of the revulsion it felt except
the tearing pain deep down in my vitals

   her white body threaded its way in
and out of the moving figures every
floating movement began slowly lan-
guorously with the smooth legs ran up
the round white columns of the quivering
thighs flowed over the soft swell of stom-
ach and slowly pushed up to the quiver-
ing breasts

   i felt i had suffered every weird dam-
nable thought of which man is capable
when suddenly the tempo of the bacchana-
lia changed the group began to shift
as with a purpose
maids for the dust-devils



the kelsy twins glided over and fast-
ened themselves around the big hulk of

them she went to him red lips uplifted
and entwined her lax body around his
then the four withdrew from the flicker-
ing fire and sank down upon a bed of
upturned earth

that acted like a signal upon the others
and in a moment the wild dance had
turned into something unutterably worse
sixteen-year-old jane thomas stirred
amorously in the arms of old pete barto
and let his toothless drooling mouth close
on her fresh red lips and his dirty gnarled
hands caress her young body the taffy-
haired naive bertha christman and little
peewee turner gertie glass and   

god it was too much anna falk
and the lovely black-haired bride of
lloyd jones-all withdrawing in languor-
ous embrace

until only kay was left kay-and
butch blunt standing aside his red snaky
eyes upon her with that aimless floating
motion she continued to drift alone
around the heathen fire her body slowly
turning as if spun by a whorl of languid
air the red glow painting one after the
other every lovely curve

she moved around until she was close
to where he was standing he never
moved she drifted closer her soft trans-
lucent hips arching provocatively toward
him still he never moved

she drifted over to him and twined her
white arms around his big bull neck he
stood still unbending his arrogant eyes
holding hers then she lifted his big
beefy hand and placed it around her
waist fierce fire leaped into his eyes a
bestial triumph gurgled in his throat as
his huge hairy arm snatched her to him
and he started for the shadows

a bellow of rage and unendurable hor-
ror split my throat then i saw the
amorous couples in the shadows stir and
butch blunt stop throw his head up as
if startled but still holding kay close
and it took me a second to realize that
it had not been my voice that had broken
in upon their lewd love

not my voice for i saw their eyes lift
far above and behind me to the crest of
the hill above and behind me a wild
frantic voice had risen to drown out my
own and was whipping over my head to
hold the frenzied couples below

a frenzied voice and mad mad words
god is not mocked this country be-
longs to the dust demon reclamation is
sin you must destroy this unholy plan

       death by wholesale

t could not turn my head but i did
a not need sight to tell me that the voice
belonged to john the hermit at that
realization chaotic thoughts arose in my
mind and tried to combine into a new in-
terpretation of the terror that had des-
troyed us all but they made no pattern

the voice rose higher and wilder and
that strange motley of ragged rude men
and lovely nude girls rose up and listened
with gleaming fanatic eyes the pleas
of the hermit grew more definite took
on the fervency of an inviolable edict

it must all be destroyed

and with his mad words some of the
fantastic pieces of the puzzle seemed to
fall into place this old street preacher
whom we had considered harmless had
somehow with his fanatic fervor thrown
these men and girls into a horrible hyp-
notic state and was driving them to des-
troy the project they were under the
spell of a lunatic

yelling in unholy glee the men and
girls broke for the unfinished canal and
with their hands and with shovels began

death-sticks are in the store-room

it took a moment for the thought to
drive home then like fiends out of hell
they raced up and over the hill and i
knew where they were going death-
sticks as everyone in the midwest knows
-mean dynamite handfuls of violence
and death

i could hear picks hacking at the door
of the powder house god when would
the day-men return  and where was bill

ment shrieking and laughing the pack
were running back down the hill carry-
ing sticks of dynamite and all hell broke
loose

agonized i searched the mob for kay
and there she was-waving a stick of
dynamite in her flaccid hand as if it were
a childs fire-cracker i cried out her
name again and again but my voice
seemed to mean nothing to her or else
she could not hear it through the noise
of high obscene laughter that rose from
the crowd and the hermits continuous
fervid exhortations i cried out the names
of these men who had worked so faith-
fully and intelligently on this job but
they paid me no heed

stuck into the flames of the dying bonfire
the fuse of a death-stick-stuck it in and
held it there until it was well lighted and
then threw it down the vale to the far-
thest end of the canal it hit exploded
with a shower of dirt and the neat canal
end was a ragged yawning hole

everyone was thrown to the earth with
the shock screaming in idiotic delight
gertie glass and bunk hawk scrambled
up ran hand in hand toward the scene
of destruction then i saw butch blunt
scratch a match hold it to a deadly fuse
and then fling the stick high swift and
true after the speeding couple i watched

through a century-long instant as it sailed
through the air over their heads-to burst
in their faces

    the earth spouted two bodies sprawled
grotesquely into the air and exploded
into bleeding fragments

    the crazed revelers paid no heed to
their dead comrades but began to light
their death-sticks and throw them wildly
in all directions and above all the voice
of the crazed priest of destruction shrilled
driving them on

teath was bursting all around god
only knew why it did not strike
again the concussions of air almost split
my ear-drums the earth shook huge
rocks showered around me and the bac-
chanal of destruction became more
frenzied

the hermits voice grew more exigent
louder he shouted until a lull came and
he could make his voice heard the well
the demon-well must be destroyed go
to the well

but during the last few minutes some-
thing strange had begun to happen to the
mad mob for a moment they turned their
eyes to where the well-drill chugged away
in the darkness but on their faces was no
understanding and no unholy zest they
looked back at the chaos around them and
one or two men lighted matches but like
bewildered children let them go out again
their movements were slow and drag-
ging like a phonograph record run down
as if some excitant with which they had
been drugged was wearing off

hope rose in me perhaps i could get
free before the victims did any more dam-
age to themselves i knew i could handle
the poor old crazed preacher wildly i
struggled in my imprisoning grave and
made a dizzying discovery the dirt
around me was loosened the explosions
of dynamite had rent the earth i jerked
one hand free i knew that my tight-
packed body was a long way from free-
dom but my elation mounted
maids for the du st-d evils

then suddenly on the far side of the
basin in the shadow of a clunip of mes-
quite i saw a figure stir grey dim
vague i strained my eyes into the dis-
tant shadows but i could not see with any
distinctness beyond the circle of the flood-
lights

for a moment the frightful thought
came that this was the revolting shape-
less creature i had seen with the girls in
the coulee

then the figure moved forward and
i saw it was a man-a masked man

c ven as i struggled to free myself
i wondered what this man had to
do with the scene of destruction before
us but the question was driven from my
mind as i saw a restless stirring begin-
ning again in the huddle of the lethargic
men and girls god what now

a single figure-a girl-detached her-
self from the group falteringly but with
seeming purpose she began to drift away
from the others gazing like a bewildered
child out upon the ravaged basin then
as her face turned toward me i saw it
was kay

with hope that she might be recover-
ing from whatever drug had enslaved her
i called out her name for a moment she
hesitated then she went on more
loudly i called she turned her head and
looked in my direction again i called
her name she turned around took one
faltering step in my direction hope rose
higher surely somehow

suddenly the shadows at the edge of
the basin stirred and a figure stepped out
of the dimness and seized her the masked
man

more violently i jerked my racked body
against the tight imprisoning dirt what
was he going to do with kay  how much
time did i have

harder i twisted and wrenched my
eyes on the two he snatched his tie off
knotted it around kays slender waist his

long skinny hands lingering in vile car-
esses god what could be the meaning 

too soon i knew the horrible answer
for he picked from the ground a long-
fused load of dynamite-so huge that it
made the small shots the others had used
seem like toys-and stuck it into her im-
provised belt then directing her toward
the group of men and girls so strangely
and quietly huddled in the basin between
us he-struck a match i knew that
when the fuse was lit she would in her
strange trance do his bidding-go down
to them carrying this messenger of death
-their death and hers

directed by the will of this fiend in-
carnate she would become a living bomb

but there are things more bitter than
death even violent death and it was the
masked fiend who forced me to drink to
the dregs

with a sudden motion he flipped his
match out without touching it to the
fuse he whipped out its flame and his
long thin arms drew kay to him

with surprising strength he lifted her
until her tiny feet no longer touched the
ground and his thick slavering lips
roamed over her lovely white face closed
over her red mouth

frantically i dug with my one free
hand then i had a shoulder uncovered

for the first time the man seemed
aware of my desperate struggles against
my entombment for he looked sharply in
my direction then regretfully he re-
laxed his grip on the girl he shot another
look at me as i was gradually pulling one
numbed leg from the soil that imprisoned
me and then striking a match and light-
ing the fuse of the bomb which was still
held by the narrow strip of blue silk that
engirdled her he raced down into the
basin dragging her with him

trailing the spark that slowly climbed
toward that tube of death he ran directly
toward the pitiful huddle of humanity
and pushed her into the midst of it

death by wholesale death for my
loved one

my eyes upon my beloved as she stood
dazedly watching the death spark eat
closer i scraped and twisted and pulled
with my tortured body and then god-
the god who i thought had turned his
back-was good i felt my legs pulling
free in a moment i would   

i tore my eyes away from kay as i
realized the masked man had run up the
little slope and was almost upon me he
catapulted his body across the ditch and
lunged straight at me we went down
together in a shower of flying dirt

he would be an easy adversary i
couw feel that but he was on top my
feet were sunk again in the loose soil my
muscles had already been wrenched al-
most beyond enduring and my legs were
numb

and the deadly spark was crawling
nearer to kay a seconds delay and she
would be   

god i forgot all the rules of civilized
combat and kicked punched butted the
masked fiend we turned twisted and
locked in a murderous embrace rolled
over and my feet were free of the bog
of loose earth

but kay

i tore myself free from the creatures
desperate clutches lunged past him
knocking him sprawling into the drainage
canal and then with a prayer on my
lips i threw myself toward that helpless
huddle of men and women toward that
tube of death that lay against kays white
body-toward that flying spark

how many thoughts can shoot through
a mans mind in a split second of stress
the men the girls kay the primi-
tive pleas for self-preservation what if
i should get there in time-but just in
time

i made the last wild leap and then the
dynamite was in my tight-clenched fist
my eyes held by the spark nibbling at the

nub of the stick my fingers tightened by
a paralysis of fear clung to it for an eter-
nity god could i never turn it loose

then i whirled drew back my arm for
the throw knowing that i must hurl it
far but even then i think i knew i was
too late

the stick left my hand-and then it ex-
ploded the world split into a million
pieces and i was blasted backward into
a sea of nauseous blackness 

dynamite if it is not handled by an
expert is as unpredictable as it is dan-
gerous and thank god the shot which
in my desperation i hurled so tardily did
not explode in all directions as was to
have been expected but shot most of its
force forward blasting the hill where i
had a few minutes before been trapped

of course we all suffered from shock
and from flying rock-kay the other piti-
ful victims of mad greed and i but we
are all well on the way to recovery now
and theres not even a scar left to mar
my fiancees perfect beauty

but the explosion was fatal to the
masked man the masked man  monroe
shelton forced by banker jordan into a
fiendish plot that he could not reject be-
cause the banker knew that the reclama-
tion director had embezzled project funds
and on the promise that jordan would
replace the funds and make no report of
the theft shelton had promised to frighten
the people from their land and let it fall
back to jordan the mortagee-because the
banker had recently discovered oil under
those dusty wastes

as he lay dying shelton told us that
much but he cried out hysterically
he promised me there would be no
violence he promised me he said the
people would be easily frightened away
that all id have to do was to kidnapi the
girls in some way that would arouse super-
stitious fear and the people would leave
we got the idea from the hermits rant-
ings and then i saw by my special
maids for the dust-devils



weather reports that there was to be a
siege of dusters i thought everything
would be easy but   

but the plotters had underestimated the
courage of the westerners and shelton
had been driven deeper and deeper into
crime while hysteria and sadistic im-
pulses rose crazily as he went on

that is the heart of the tragic story
but it took many weeks to unearth ex-
planations for all the details interesting
but tedious necessary to the ever-grow-
ing plot and there are some things that
have still to depend on inference

destruction of the project had not been
a part of the original plan but when shel-
ton found out it would be necessary he
knew he would have to scheme carefully
for the project was never alone for a
minute so he put a drug-excitant and
aphrodisiac-into the mens supper and
under cover of the small dust-storm
brought the drugged girls and the fanatic
hermit also drugged to the reclamation
center

the drugs wore off sooner than he had
planned and shelton saw he was going
to have to kill his dupes and finish the
work himself in order to create a con-
fusion that no routine investigation could
unravel

the unknown girl who lay in a trance
was the famous woman-photographer
marie gil-martin come to take pictures
of the dust-bowl

the

 out of the horrible maelstrom only one
 disturbing puzzle remains-the monster
 i saw in the coulee shelton admitted that
 he had kept the girls in a cave in the coulee
 wall and that he had used the pit to pre-
 pare them with their coats of glutinous
 pomade but he swore with his dying
 breath that he never had used a hideous
 grey monster disguise

 because the cavern had been caved in
 we have not yet been able to follow it to
 its end it seems to lead onward and
 downward into the bowels of the earth
 and we never did find the grey disguise

 yet i saw sheltons lasciviousness ex-
 press itself that horrible night at the proj-
 ect when he held kay in his arms and
 of course i believe he was lying-that he
 did use a disguise for some sadistic reason
 or else how can i explain the great grey
 shape i saw with the girls

 yet when i look down into that black
 bottomless pit behind the caved-in hiding-
 place strange thoughts crowd into my
 mind mans knowledge of the stuff of life
 is so puny that he must not be too quick
 to reject new ideas and today when i
 think of walters theory-that the crea-
 tion of a monster rhizopod by the friction
 and static electricity of the dust storms is
 as plausible as the universally-accepted
 theory of spontaneous generation of the
 lower forms of first life in the primordial
 ooze-i can ask with the studious little
 pharmacist why not

help me to diei

by leon byrne

that was my dead body they carried from this room last week-my
body yes but i am not dead listen but a moment to my story and
then if you can deny me still   

in the name of god in the name of
all you hold dear i beg of you i
beseech you as no man has ever be-
sought another-help me to die

that was my body they nailed in the

coffin and carried out of here last week-
my body yes but i am not dead listen
but a moment and let me tell you and
then if you can deny me   

there never was a woman more beauti-



dime mystery magazine

ful more tender and fragile than the girl
who had just become my bride golden-
haired blue-eyed stefanie and because
the love we shared was so great and so
precious i had brought her to this little
village where we could be alone to savor
to its fullest the blossoming of the tie
between us

  that was why when we first encoun-
tered the ancient my impulse was to turn
back and avoid him we were walking
in the fields by the river-you can see the
place from the window here he was
standing in the center of the path staring
down at the ground there was nothing
evil or alarming about his appearance you
understand-just the contrary he re-
minded me of a venerable and kindly old
patriarch with his white beard and deep-
set pensive eyes-eyes that seemed to
have been gazing at and appraising hu-
manity with pity and tolerance for genera-
tion upon generation

  but while stefanie and i were still some
distance away he suddenly lifted his arms
as a man will do in a gesture of hopeless-
ness of resignation call me mad if you
wish yet i swear that for an instant i did
not see a man standing there with out-
stretched arms-i saw a cross a cross
such as you will find in many a burial
ground standing as sentinel over a lonely
grave a cross that is a tombstone

  one moment i saw the cross there
limned in the glaring sunlight a symbol
of pain and death then as i brushed my
hand across my eyes it was gone the
tall somber figure of the man had dropped
his arms lifted his eyes from the ground
to gaze moodily at stefanie and myself
as we came up

  there was death there at his feet tiny
and immaterial death-but symbolic it
was a thrush lying stricken on the grass
and when stefanie saw it she ran forward
with a little cry picked it up tenderly in
her small white hands

  oh she said impulsively the poor

little creature what happened to it
the old man looked down at her mus-
ingly said a snake caught it it was
dead before i could rescue it

stefanie stroked the feathery little body
still warm such a pretty thing to have
to die she murmured

ah yes the old man sighed the
mortal clay it not so appealing to the eye
once the spirit has fled

i had said nothing all this while and
now with a polite inclination of his head
to stefanie and me the oldster turned and
started away but stefanie who is always-
loath to allow anyone to depart said
quickly are you a stranger here in
brentwood i dont remember having
seen you-

he turned appreciation of her friendli-
ness lighting his somber eyes hardly a
stranger he said a newcomer you
might call me i have taken the farns-
worth cottage for the summer and he
nodded toward this house where we are
now i find this peaceful countryside
ideal for my work and my studies

the old man was so courteous so ob-
viously lonely that much as i wanted to
be alone with stefanie i could not be rude
to him and i said what do you study if
i may ask

death he said quietly then when
he saw the startled questioning look in
stefanies face he quickly added death
and its conqueror-life i study the soul
of man i would be honored to receive
you some afternoon when you have a few
minutes to while away-you and the young
lady both then he turned and was gone
down the path with long impatient
strides

that was our introduction to dr
nathaniel creighton and if i thought at
the time that it was a crack-brained ec-
centric we had encountered i quickly
changed my opinion when stefanie and i
called on him-for we did accept his in-
vitation diversions were few in the little
help me to die



village of brentwood where stefanie and
i had come to spend our honeymoon and
though we wanted nothing more than
each others company there was some-
thing about the old man-an elusive sense
of hidden and strange powers perhaps-
that we could not seem to forget and that
drew us to him

   we visited the old man two days later
spent a pleasant afternoon-and the next
day at his request i returned alone to
his cottage

jtvespite his countless years nathan-
id creightons mind was brilliant
razor-keen and he possessed a store of
knowledge as vast and illimitable as the
many-starred heavens

   life he said that afternoon and
death are two things that ho one can
avoid we see them but do we know
what they are we can say when an
organism begins to function it is what we
call life when it apparently ceases to
function it is death but in man there
is something beyond this mere bodily
functioning something beyond the mind
even we choose to call it the soul where
does this soul come from before we are
born where does it go when we die 

i am a scientist mind you and scien-
tists can explain life and death in terms
of physics and chemistry the soul they
cannot explain that is why all true scien-
tists are religious men cold reason tells
them there is a supreme being a guard-
ian of the souls a god because there must
be a god

yet there is still much about life and
death-and the soul-that man has not
fathomed when life ends the soul re-
turns whence it came but what happens
when life is suspended 

we see a girl swimmer suddenly seized
with a cramp see her go under half an
hour later her body is dragged up from the
bottom of the lake stretched out on the
shore

her body is cold she has stopped
breathing no heart-beat is registered we
say that she is dead then what do we
see an hour of furious resuscitation of
massage of heat and oxygen applied and
the corpse stirs moans begins to gain
color as lungs and heart start functioning
again she was dead and now she is alive
and where when-she was dead was her
soul  it had not gone back irretrievably
to her maker for it has again entered into
her body was it not hovering near pre-
scient hopeful watchful

he stared at me long and penetratingly
i have worked for years he went on
slowly many years to perfect an elixir
-an elixir that will liberate the spirit the
consciousness the soul from its earthly
shell the body yesterday i believe i suc-
ceeded i do not know for sure but i
think so only one thing remains-proof
by experimentation he looked at me
eagerly will you help me with the ex-
periment

my sudden apprehension must have
shown in my face for he went on hurried-
ly no no do not misunderstand me
i do not wish to try the experiment on
you i will be the subject but i must
have your help after i have injected the
elixir into my veins after its powerful
chemical action has reduced my body to
apparent death-and liberated my spirit-
after this has continued for a period of
minutes a second hypodermic contain-
ing the counter-agent must be adminis-
tered if the elixir is perfect my body will
resume its functioning again become
alive

i protested vigorously at first that there
were certain things which belonged to
god with which man should not tamper-
but even as i argued with him i was men-
tally scoffing at his theories and his claims
nathaniel creightons mind was brilliant
yes-but it had cracked and he was talk-
ing of something that was impossible pre-
posterous


dime mystery magazine

  but he was not talking now he was act-
ing with the swift determination of a
zealot

  you have no choice in the matter
he said fiercely as he thrust a hypodermic
into my hands if you fail me i am dead
-forever in tea minutes inject this into
a vein now-

  he strode to a couch-that cot beside
which you are standing now-stretched
himself out on it and pulled up his sleeve
then he plunged a second hypodermic into
his arm slowly but firmly pushed the
plunger until it was empty the needle
dropped from his hand and almost im-
mediately he seemed to fall into a deep
slumber

  then as i watched intently his breath-
ing slowly diminished and stopped i felt
his pulse it was faint barely perceptible
in a moment it too had ceased his sight-
less eyes rolled back his entire body
seemed to collapse-in death

tt was a torturing seemingly endless
ten minutes i spent here with that body
so recently pulsating with life now an im-
mobile piece of senseless clay more than
once i was tempted to plunge the life-
giving fluid into his arm to end the ter-
rible suspense-but i waited then when
i did use the hypodermic i was so clumsy
and nervous i feared at first that i had
made a terrible mistake missed the vein
with the precious antidote

  but it worked-it worked as though
it were a necromancers magic potion-
and as nathaniel creighton had died he
came back to life-he returned to full con-
sciousness a trembling eager wildly ex-
cited man who leaped from the couch
seized me by the arms his eyes burning
with a mystic fervor he shouted at me

  i have done it i have done it i have
severed the cord binding consciousness and
flesh i have torn the spirit free from its
earthly bondage i tell you i have loosed
the soul from the body

he stopped almost overcome with the
frenzy of his exultation and i helped him
to a chair he sat there a moment and
after he had become more calm he went
on in low and vibrant tones

it was a-a tremendous experience al-
most incredible i felt consciousness leav-
ing my mind i felt a terrific physical and
mental dizziness then just as i was
about to slip down into a black void it
seemed the walls of darkness parted and
i was hurled like a straw blasted from the
mouth of a volcano up into a dazzling
blue firmament

my mind my consciousness were out-
side my body i was here still here in this
room and i had complete awareness of the
room and everything that went on in it
-yet i was free

reason told me that what he was saying
was preposterous-that he was either
playing some fantastic joke at my ex-
pense or that he was suffering drug-
induced delusions but no the man was
not jesting-if ever a man was in deadly
earnest it was nathaniel creighton

you will wonder if i was so skeptical
why it was that i permitted him to pour
that same powerful virus into my veins
my only explanation can be that the old
scientists enthusiasm was so contagious
his description of the disembodied state
so rapturous that my curiosity was
whetted to a white heat

the experiment had taken but ten
minutes it had not harmed him in any
manner-and if he was telling me the
truth then i would share with him the
honor of discovering of exploring huge
new vistas on the horizon of the human
mind and consciousness

and as i asked him then begged him
to let me share his secret a voice within
me whispered some things are mans-
some things belong to god but the voice
was a tiny one quickly silenced and the
old man was as eager for me to test and
prove his alchemy as i was to try it
help me to die



   soon i was stretched out on the couch
felt the prick of the needle in my arm felt
an overwhelming rush of bewildering
dizzying exhilaration grip me then-it is
impossible to describe to you the amazing
the incredible feeling i experienced in the
next few minutes

   you have watched a tiny chick emerge
from a shell seem suddenly to leap out
into life full born from nothingness i
too seemed to leap out into a new life
i awoke from my daze an omniscient
being i could see i could hear i could
sense things as never before yet i was
not a slave to eyes or ears of that fum-
bling mass of grey tissue we call the brain
i had the all-seeing eyes the all-knowing
wisdom of a god of the god

t could see the pale still piece of flesh
lying there on the couch-the body of
robert gregory i could see the tall tense
figure of the metaphysician nathaniel
creighton bent over it studying it watch-
ing with eager hawklike impatience for
any visible symptoms of his experiments
success or failure

   i could hear him muttering over and
over immortality-immortality is within
our reach the mystery of death and of
life-the secrets of the creator-

   i could see from above from below
from all sides-i could see with a thou-
sand eyes and hear with a million ears for
i was not seeing and hearing through
crude sensory organs-i was feeling and
knowing as a god would know and my
consciousness my spirit was all-pervad-
ing

   i saw dr creighton cast a nervous
speculative glance around the room as if
he were seeking the location of my pres-
ence and i laughed-my spirit laughed-
at his confusion

   i saw him take a pin and thrust it into
the flesh of my body there on the cot to
see if there was any reflex action-and i
laughed again at myself for having felt

a momentary pang of alarm that i was
about to be hurt for the body did not
quiver and i-naturally i felt nothing

i saw him fingering the hypodermic in
his hand nervously looking at his watch
from time to time i wanted to shout to
him to stay the injection to permit me
further moments of this glorious freedom
of release-but i had no voice and the lax
grey lips of the body there on the couch
had no volition of their own-they were
as uselessly immobile as the rest of the
fleshly abode from which the spirit had
risen

no i could not stop him the hands of
his watch swung around to eight and to
nine and on toward ten minutes and he
put the watch down on the table-that
table there behind you-and stepped
quickly back to the couch started to bend
down over my body with the hypodermic
needle poised in his hand

then the laughter the impatience the
exhilaration suddenly went out of me
for dr nathaniel creighton faltered
shook convulsively an instant and sank
to the floor with a moan

the hypodermic thudded to the carpet
bounced under the couch and the old
mans eyes dilated wildly as he made a
feeble despairing effort to reach it to
jab it into my body even if it was his last
mortal act for dr ceighton knew as i
knew that he was dying-that the tumul-
tuous happenings of the last half-hour had
been too much for his feeble old heart

he died quickly while i watched and
as he died he cast his eyes dazedly upward
into space as if seeking my spirit and he
muttered with bitter anguish my god
what have i done forgive me-forgive-
me-

you can understand-i do not need to
tell you-the flood of despair that swept
over me as i watched his gaunt frame
stiffen and grow cold lying there on the
floor beside that other body-my body
i do not need to tell you how the ticking
dime mystery magazine

of his watch there on the table tolling off
the seconds sounded as a funeral knell to
me as the minutes and the hours rolled by
into eternity

it had been just after noon when i
came to the cottage to visit him-it seemed
endless centuries later although the watch
showed that only six hours had passed-
when i heard a footstep on the porch
recognized with a glad surge of thank-
fulness the voice of stefanie calling my
name

i remembered suddenly that i had told
her i was coming here to visit the doctor
but for an hour or so i realized that she
had become anxious and alarmed because
i had not returned and had come to find
me

grateful joy welled up within me at
sound of her voice and i started to rush
out to meet her started yes my spirit
rushed out toward her but my body lay
immobile my spirit called out to her but
my throat paralyzed in seeming death
would not move

i waited and my spirit became ever
more frantic as it echoed the growing fear
in her tones while she sped from room to
room calling for me seeking me

rphen she came running into this room
- this room where we are now and i
cried out to her stefanie darling i
am here-i am her waiting for you there
is but a moments task for you-seize
the hypodermic and push its needle into
my body    there it is there under
the couch take it darling quickly-
quickly-

i cried out-but she did not hear me
she heard nothing-but she saw those
violet eyes swept over to the couch on
which lay a body-the body of robert
gregory-my body

with a wild sobbing cry she ran to the
couch flung herself down on me she ran
delicate quivering fingers over my face
felt the cold immobility of my features

stared with growing terror at my staring
sightless eyes

hes dead she whispered dead
-and she drew back as though she had
been struck cruelly in the face her eyes
wandered down to the ghastly grey fea-
tures of nathaniel creighton lying there
on the floor then back up to mine some-
thing seemed to snap in her mind and she
hid her face in her hands sobbed uncon-
trollably

no-no- she whispered-i cant
live without you robert-i cant-

then while i screamed a voiceless
scream and my spirit writhed in impotent
fury at my helplessness i saw her spring
up stare wildly about her for an instant
then run quickly to the doctors desk seize
a steel-pointed letter-opener from its sur-
face

i reached frantic fingers to grasp it from
her-and my fingers were wisps of air
i shouted with all the might of my lungs
stefanie-dont but my voice stirred
not the slightest echo for it was a voice
from beyond which she could not hear

as i watched and my spirit sickened
and died with her she plunged the blade
into her breast deep into her heart she
staggered tripped over the body of

-upon the fleshly shroud of me there on
the couch  

that was a week ago what has hap-
pened since is only a wild and jumbled
pattern in my tortured consciousness i
know they found us found our bodies a
day two days later i know that my shat-
tered spirit was dimly aware of the ex-
cited outcry that arose in the village the
press of curious horrified throngs surging
in to stare and wonder and speculate in
hushed whispers

wound for stefanie gregory death from
causes unknown for robert gregory

i remember vividly the brief and furi-
ous but futile struggle i made to prevent
them from placing my body in a casket
as they had done with the others much
else i do not remember for grief can
strangle memory as well as voice but i
remember calling out to them wait
that is not a corpse you are carrying off
to bury in cold earth it is the body the
undead body of robert gregory-my body
-and i am not dead for me there can
never be peace never be reunion with my
beloved in his realm until you have freed
me from this bondage-

they did not hear me

but you can hear me-i can tell by
your expression that you hear me that
you understand my plea

there there it is-that thing you
have in your hand-that hypodermic you
know where they buried the body of
robert gregory-my body get there
quickly-use that injection as i have told
you it should be used let my body be-
come alive again-if just for a moment
so that i can die decently as other men
die as god intended them to die

no dont tamper with it like that you
may ruin it look at me-i am talking to
you dont you hear me i am calling
you in the name of god listen to me

itphe real estate agent opened the front
i gate of his yard slouched wearily up
the path to the door of his home just as
dusk was falling he went in walked
through the house to the kitchen where
his wife hannah was preparing supper

well he said with a tired sigh i
cleaned up the farnsworth cottage not
very pleasant work messing around
where three people have just died

it may sound crazy to you but all
the time i was there i felt as though
i wasnt alone there wasnt anybody
there of course but well-it seemed as
though i could almost feel somebody or
something he went to the window
stared vaguely out into the twilight it
seemed that someone was trying to talk to
me begging me to help him-

now now hannah dickinson re-
proved him dont you go letting your
imagination run away with you you fin-
ished cleaning up the place did you

yes its spick and span i boxed up
all of the old mans things and put them
away for the public administrator to dis-
pose of-all except one thing a hypo-
dermic i found behind the couch it was
full of some funny-looking kind of stuff
thought it might be poison so i threw it
in the river yes i finished up every-
thing and yet somehow i dont know
why it seems to me theres something
unfinished-something left undone

chapter one

deaths white wings

the rain lashed down seeming to
claw at me as i stood under the
dripping station eaves lightning
split the midnight blackness but i paid
little attention to either i stared at the

two things the flash revealed-the station
sign that said boganville and the black
bulk of the big house far up on the cliff
overlooking the village-and i cursed
through set teeth

i looked around for somebody to take
me to the damnable place but saw no one
naturally i had come unannounced so
that no one could have been sent for me

they dont roam after dark in
ville   but young john crayton heeded
not that grim warning for the girl he loved
had inexplicably married a man who rev-
elled in unholy communion with the dead

-and john had seen the figment of her spirit go forth to join the
 white things that cast a plague of grisly death in boganville
things claimed k-

and the residents of boganville accord-
ing to the train conductor were hiding be-
hind locked doors these nights

a funny sort of guy that conductor his
eyes had seemed to avoid mine as he
talked to me

youre stopping at boganville oh
sure we stop here on signal not very
often no freight or passengers usually
yesterday a girl came here from high-
town forty miles over the hills first stop
weve made at boganville for months

he hadnt noticed the way my face tight-
ened at the mention of the girl he had

gone on talking the queer look growing
in his eyes

the people of boganville are queer-
unfriendly i think maybe theyre afraid

of something all of em i dont know
what but they dont roam around in that
town much after dark maybe youd bet-
ter not roam either

the look of my surroundings bore out
the conductors vague warning

the station itself was dilapidated and
dark across the single railroad track
from it was the little village not one light
showed in any house it looked like a ghost
city in the lightning flashes far beyond
perched on the cliff edge like a buzzard
about to strike was the big corse home
which dominated the village at its feet as
for generations the corse family had dom-
inated the lives of the villagers

the corse home stella was in there
now unaware of my arrival 

i could feel her telegram in my pocket
like a stabbing blade id gotten it in the
city that noon

married fred corse this morning for-
give me stella

married to fred corse but stella and
i had lived for each other for over a year
we were to have been married in less
than a month she could not have done
this thing to me of her own free will
something must be wrong terribly
wrong

corse had been the one who introduced
me to stella her family had once lived
near here in the kentucky hills but there
had seemed to be nothing but friendship
between them now a week ago she had
come down to visit her aunt in hightown
and next thing i heard from her was the
shattering telegram

married fred corse this morning 

now i had come to this flag-stop at mid-
night to go to the corse home and demand
to hear from stellas own lips why she had
done this thing to me

i pulled my coat collar up around my
throat and stepped off the station platform
into the mud it was spring and the rain
was warm besides the turmoil in my
heart would have kept me from paying

much attention to even a worse night than
this black stormy one

i started down the villages one street
past house after house-and not one light
showed and that was odd even in a
small town there are usually a few people
who are up at midnight

i think the people in boganville are
afraid of something the conductors
words came back to me they dont roam
around in that town after dark

afraid of the name of corse perhaps
i thought bleakly

tpred last of the corses was an aris
 tocratic looking young man probably
generations of almost feudal power over
the ignorant backward residents of bog-
anville had given the family that aspect
but there was something subtly disturb-
ing about his slender elegance that had
finally stopped my acquaintanceship with
him though i had let it drop with no open
break

there was a sort of serpentine grace
about his body a kind of veiled deadliness
about his dark eyes and triangular face
added to that in college had been the
queerness of his library one of the most
extensive collections of books on after-life
spirit-visitations and ghost-lore that i
had ever seen

a curious person was fred corse full
of contradictions a dark mystic when
id come to know stella better i had asked
her what she really thought of him and
she had confessed to a suppressed fear and
dislike of him

and now-she was married to him

he forced her some way i swore
as i slogged through the rain and mud
toward the cliff he must have drugged
her-hurt her ill break his neck ill-

i stopped if stella were indeed married
to him there was nothing i could do i was
all washed up

if she were married to him in that
small word lay slight hope anybody can
the town the dead things claimed



send a telegram could corse have sent
that signing stellas name to it for some
crazy reason  he was arrogant enough to
do it

oh yes fred was arrogant enough to
dare anything the corse family owned
most of the land surrounding boganville
the inbred moronic villagers all worked
for fred that feudal arrangement had
made him insufferably arrogant

but would he have dared to hurt stella
or to send off that telegram if it were a
fake

suddenly my thoughts were cut off as
though by a knife and the knife that cut
them was a scream a girls scream once
twice it split the eerie darkness making
the hair on my scalp prickle with the terror
it contained then it stopped-and i was
running toward the source of it

the scream had come from the muddy
road beyond me i couldnt see any one
there but obviously a woman ahead of
me somewhere was in danger of some
kind and urgently needed help

they dont roam around in that town
much after dark

the lightning ripped a jagged splash in
the black veil of the night and i saw the
person who had screamed directly ahead
of me in the road i got to her quickly

a girl of nineteen or so she stood in the
middle of the mud with the rain plastering
her brown hair to her cheeks and dripping
unheeded from long lashes over wide
haunted eyes she had on a white dress-
but the garment was in rags over her
shapely body exposing her soft breast and
graceful shoulders her eyes beautiful
eyes glared at me with a haunted stunned
look in them

she was staring straight at me as i
grasped her bare wet shoulder but she
didnt seem to see me it was very queer
i felt a cold sensation touch my spine she
was like a person in a hypnotic trance no
more sound came from her lips

whats the matter  i said are you

hurt you called for help didnt you

she said nothing not one thing she
just kept on looking at me-or rather
through me-as if i didnt exist

it was then that i felt moisture on the
fingers that clasped the silky skin of her
shoulder which was not the cold moisture
of the rain it was warm sticky

after me    she mumbled wildly
the dead ones  theyre after me 

ouddenly she was running crazily
 from me in the rain with her body
looking like that of a naked woman be-
cause of the way the rain plastered her
white dress to her it was then when the
lightning flared that i saw the thing on
her back a long thin stripe of ragged
red where blood had come from a kind of
gash or cut

she didnt run far at the end of the
street was an old church it was a hulking
ruin with half its roof long gone and with
its steeple long since caved in the girl
ran toward that and the lightning flared
just in time for me to see her white nude-
looking figure dart within the sagging
doors

i followed her the urgency of my own
business was shelved for a moment in re-
membrance of the horror i had seen in
the girls streaming face i heard her voice
sounding ever more loudly as i neared the
ruined church

save me save me from the dead
ones merciless spirits  i have done
no wrong    

the words broke once more into that
keening terrible scream that i had heard
before it stopped just before i got to the
door and hurried inside

it was as dark as the grave in the ruined
church-till the brittle lightning streamed
down from a drenched heaven

i saw the girl then she lay down at
the end of the aisle that led between brok-
en long unused pews she lay before the
overturned thing that had been a pulpit all
white and streaming like a naked woman
dime mystery magazine

but the lightning revealed other red
stripes on her white back now besides
the one i had seen as she ran from me out-
side other gashes down her snowy flesh
and it revealed for one brief instant some-
thing else which left me utterly bewildered
as i ran down the aisle toward her

three vague white forms seemed to
hover in mid-air near the body at least i
thought they were hovering there like
patches of mist in the blackness i couldnt
be sure that they werent simply hanging
strips of paper or white blotches of plaster
on the wall behind the upset pulpit

theyre after me    the dead
ones  the girl was babbling souls
of the dead 

i bent over her started to gather her up
in my arms to take her away from there
then in the lightnings incessant flaring
i saw a figure at the door it was the figure
of an elderly man straight spare with
lank grey hair and a fanatics blazing eyes
he strode toward me and i straightened
up from the girl

he too seemed to stare straight at me
without seeing me at all it was as if i
were a ghost on that black night he came
to the girl and dropped on his knees beside
her i saw a resemblance of feature be-
tween them he must be her father

the souls he whispered-not to me
he was still paying no attention to me
the souls of the dead scourging those
who sin  

he whirled toward me with a strange
madness shining in his eyes he crooked
his fingers toward me like horns

go get back to where you came from
and take your hells scourge with you

i stood in hesitation as he glared at me
then the fire died from his eyes and he
bent to pick up the body of the girl he
strode toward the door with her and i
slowly followed i made no move to help
he was easily able to carry her i simply
left the ruin of the church going into the
lashing rain again

what lunatic talk was this of dead
ones of scourging souls what had
made those lone gashes on the girls white
back i couldnt answer something pro-
saic and ordinary was at the bottom of
course some natural thing distorted by the
ignorant villagers into talk of the souls
of the dead

i shrugged it aside telling myself that
probably the girl was subject to seizures
of some kind and that in one of them she
had inflicted those wounds herself by con-
vulsive clawing of her own nails i started
on toward the house atop the cliff-then
stopped in my tracks the lightnings
flash was silvering the world again and
in it far ahead i thought i saw three
floating wraithlike shapes like patches
of mist drifting up the cliff path ahead of
me

three things like great slow birds yet
unlike any birds ever seen before three
things floating in an unhurried and sound-
less way toward the great house of corse
on the edge of the high cliff

      chapter two
      can the dead scream

t felt stark evil pressing down on this
- black hill section in the black night
storm my fingers were trembling a little
as i pressed corses bell

i heard the peal clang hollowly inside
and started a bit as the door was opened
sooner than i expected i shrank back
with a vision of the girls streaming
wounds before me but there was nothing
fearful or fantastic at the door

a woman had opened it she was about
thirty dark of hair and eyes very attrac-
tive in a mature voluptuous way she
stepped aside with her dark eyes running
questioningly over me

i want to see fred corse i said blunt-
ly with anger winning again over the sense
of nameless dread that had dogged me to
the house all that counted now was that i
the town the dead things claimed



was in the home of the man who had some-
how taken away from me the girl i loved

 the woman shut the door after me shut-
 ting out at tire same time most of the
 uproar of the storm i looked more closely
 at her face was that pallor natural to her
 brunette complexion were her eye-
 pupils dilated because the light in this big
 front room was dim-or because of fear 

 mr corse cant possibly see anybody
 she said

 hes got to see me where is he

 she repeated firmly  he cant see
 any one tonight he wants to be alone in
 his grief

 tm going to see him before i leave this
 house i declared also im going to
 see mrs corse

 it hurt to say those words mrs corse
 the womans eyes widened and her face
 grew paler

 but that is the reason you cant see
 him mrs corse i mean she is dead it
 happened just a few hours ago mr corse
 has shut himself up since then and refuses
 to talk to any one

 she shrank back startled as i grasped
 her arm i guess i must have looked fright-
 ening i dont know i only know that my
 mind was reeling at the shock of those
 words

 mrs corse   stella  i mouthed
 sure that i had heard wrong-praying that
 i had heard wrong

 she died a few hours ago just as
 the storm was beginning she fell over a
 low part of the cliff it was not a long
 fall but she  her neck was broken
 there was a big stiff-looking chair in
 the hall i got to it and sat down the
 woman started toward me hesitated plain-
 ly didnt know what to do or say next

 i heard a man call mary who is out
 there

 the voice was followed before the
 woman could reply by the speaker i
 looked up dazedly to see a big man of about
 forty with tanned face and strong jaw

 walking questioningly toward my chair

this is doctor jeanne the woman
said to me you-

my name is crayton i said vacantly
john crayton

the man nodded of course i should
have guessed you came because of that
telegram nasty shock i wanted mrs
corse to break the news a little more gent-
ly but she seemed to think a clean cut was
best

this woman says she is dead i said
i started to struggle to my feet

easy now easy the doctor said with
a hand on my shoulder yes she is dead
he turned to the woman fred will see
this man i think well find out anyway
tell him that mr crayton is here

the woman nodded and started down
the hall toward a wide door at its rear
she must be a superior servant house-
keeper perhaps a very good looking one
ordinarily id have smiled at the thought
of such a housekeeper in a bachelors lone-
ly home but not now i was still numb
from the shock of the news stella dead
i couldnt take it in 

   the housekeeper came back mr corse
will see you she said there was sym-
pathy in her dark eyes

   i started down the hall doctor jeanne
caught my arm for a moment

   im here he said as physician to
fred corse as well as friend he hasnt
been well lately and this thing has hit
him pretty hard please be careful what
you say to him dont upset him

i wrenched loose to hell with corse and
his tender feelings how did jeanne think
the news hit met
i opened the wide door id seen the
housekeeper enter and stepped into the
library of the house i saw a mans bowed
figure in a big chair next to a dark fire-
place

   the man lifted his head and i saw with
a little shock the change in it it was fred


dime mystery magazine

corse unmistakably yet the man was a
stranger to me

it is hard to say what that change was
he seemed an exaggeration a refinement
of his former self that was all his dark
eyes had always been intense now they
were glittering like the eyes of a man who
is very ill his face had always been thin
now it was emaciated he had always been
nervous now he quivered all over like an
old old man in spite of my grievance
against him i felt a momentary pity

john he said i didnt expect to see
you after the telegram stella sent but i
suppose you got the second one announc-
ing her death    no you couldnt have
you must have left the city before it could
be delivered

i got only one telegram i said un-
steadily i didnt hear of the other till
a minute ago its    true  it isnt a hor-
rible joke

its true at half-past seven this eve-
ning scarcely ten hours after the marriage
ceremony stella slipped and fell over the
edge of the cliff outside his hands
clenched and he paused till he could con-
trol his voice then with his eyes glit-
tering more wildly he almost smiled she
wont be gone from me though he
crooned her spirit will be with me her
soul robed in white staying with me al-
ways 

i could only stand there speechless be-
fore the man who looked ill almost unto
death and he stared up at me suddenly
with the shrewd gleam in his eyes that
comes to the eyes of one whose mind is on
the thin borderline of sanity

youre surprised to hear me say that
souls spirits you used to sneer at my
preoccupation with such things at college
i knew and i knew that the reason you
dropped our friendship was because you
thought i wasnt quite sane well you may
get a chance to discover for yourself to-
night though i am not sure they will
show themselves to you

 tte looked into the fireplace eyes
 glowing like dark sinister jewels
 for a long time ive been convinced
 that the souls of the dead-their spirits
 -can take a strange material envelope be-
 yond the grave and return to us they
 can protect us if we deserve it-and
  scourge us if we sin    oh yes you
 stand there staring at me as if i were a
 madman but i tell you such a thing is
 possible i know

 i brushed aside his crazy fantasies

 all right i said harshly there are
 materialized spirits im not interested in
 such things now what i want to know is
 how you induced stella to marry you we
 were to have been married why did she
 suddenly choose you

 does it matter shes dead now-
 it matters to me i rasped i want
 to know how you tricked her into marrying
 you or did you  was that first telegram
 a lie sent by you

 fred looked at me for a full minute
 then he reached into his coat pocket and
 drew out a crackling paper which he
 handed to me i read it it was a marriage
 certificate announcing the union of fred
 corse and stella leigh in this the hill
 county of crile it was dated this very
 day and signed and sealed

 somehow the hope that the marriage
 story was a lie had helped me bear up
 under the shock of stellas death i was
 left without that prop now the double
 pronouncement smashed me

 fred was staring at me with something
 like contempt in his eyes

 now for once he said you can envy
 me instead of sneering at me ill have
 comfort and you wont shell appear to
 me but not to you yes appear to me
 at last in recent months i have seen them
 -the white souls of the dead in this
 house

 i retreated a step his voice had risen
 he was getting to his feet waveringly as
 an old man moves and his eyes were
the town the dead things claimed

 hideous glittering eyes of a madman 

   in this very house-

   as i staggered back from him with
horror and sickness eating at my heart
there was a high scream of terror from
somewhere below us the scream of a
woman in deadly terror

   i stared at corse his shaking hand had
gone to his trembling lips he started for
the door but i beat him to it i leaped
into the dimly lit hall steps pounded on
stairs at the back of the house the steps
of a man doctor jeanne probably i ran
toward them and saw a rear stairway lead-
ing down i started down them then
stopped a sound at the back door had
caught my straining ears

   the upper half of the rear door of the
house had a glass pane in it framed there
i saw a face that i can still see in night-
mares 

   it was the face of an old man maddened
by ragethe lips were twisting under a
long curving nose heavy grizzled eye-
brows formed ragged lines over gleaming
eyes eyes which glared balefully at me

   then the face was gone

   i started toward the door saw a wil-
derness of trees and shrubbery in a flash of
the lightning and turned back toward the
stairs the scream from the basement
seemed more important than the face

a womans scream the shriek of a
human being in horror stellas wild cry
but stella was dead dead

i raced downstairs into the cavern of the
basement

chapter three

the locked room

rphe corse home was very large i came
into a basement room that was at least
thirty by forty with doors at the end
telling of still more basement space but
i didnt pay much attention to the door-
then my gaze was riveted to a sight in
the center of the big room

a woman lay there freds housekeeper
the doctor was bending over her holding
a spoonful of some sort of dark liquid to
her lips her face was as white as a sheet
her breasts stirred with her gasping for
breath beautiful breasts completely ex-
posed for her dark dress had been ripped
down the front almost to her waist

there was a long gash between the
white mounds

one of them i heard her pant to the
doctor one of the dead ones i have
sinned the scourge-

drink this the doctor was saying
quietly it will help

she forced the liquid down i saw her
throat move with the effort then she
stared at doctor jeanne vacantly started
to say something and relaxed in a dead
faint in his arms

corse had come down the stairs and
passed me jeanne looked at him for a mo-
ment i thought i saw something like grim
accusation in the doctors level eyes then
he nodded toward the unconscious woman

help me carry her upstairs fred

fred lips ashen with something that
seemed to be more than fear bent down
together the two men carried the lovely
body to the stairs

i came after apparently unnoticed by
both men in that crowded moment but in
the first floor hall while they carried the
housekeeper to the library i lagged behind
in a portion of the wall beyond the library
door i saw a curtain hanging as though it
covered a niche

i went to the curtain glanced around i
was alone in the hall i drew the shroud
back   

a gasp came to my lips there was a
little statuette on a pedestal in the niche
behind the curtain it was a bizarre and
lovely thing of a woman all swathed in
tenuous misty drapes with hands held
forward as though in kindly benefaction

then i saw two things that sent a cold
wave up my back


dime mystery magazine

tipping those beautiful outstretched
hands were long curved nails like the
talons of a bird of prey

the face of the misty apparition so cun-
ningly chiselled in stone was the face of a
beautiful demon-and was the face of
stella leigh

t heard my own rasping breathing as
- i stared at that thing of subtle horror
a statuette of stella with a she-devils face
and with curving clawing talons out-
stretched  the fact that at first glance the
little statuette seemed to depict a kindly
benign being-and only at second glance
was revealed as a thing of pure frightful-
ness-emphasized the shock its appearance
gave

so this was the kind of spirit of
white soul fred corse saw in his sickly
dreams this was the way he had pictured
stella as she would look beyond the grave
must have pictured her indeed before
she died-for he could not have molded
this thing or had it done in the short
space of time after her actual death

i heard steps then and started rapidly
toward the library door letting the curtain
fall into place again over the niche and its
hellish contents

jeanne came from the library he
glanced absently at me

is she all right i asked nodding
toward the library

he nodded yes the wound was not
bad there must have been only one of
them- he stopped abruptly

only one of what i demanded sharp-
ly whats the mystery in this damned
place  what happened to her down there 

he looked at me strangely then
shrugged

there are    rats  in the cellar
one must have bitten her

he left and fred came from the library
his eyes rested on me with a little start as
though he had forgotten my presence here
till the sight of me recalled it

john i-let me show you to a room
youd better get some rest you probably
need it i know i do

he started toward the front stairs i
thought of protesting of refusing his hos-
pitality but closed my lips before words
came for into my mind had come a plan
born of the shock of seeing that little
statuette with stellas face so subtly and
horribly altered and which had somehow
caught in hard stone the feel of an almost-
disembodied wraith or spirit

   all right i said following him docile-
ly-

   we got to the stairs and started up

   what jerked my gaze in that direction
i do not know but suddenly i found my-
self looking over the bannister toward the
back door of the house and there once
again i saw the thing i had seen before

   the face of an old man icily enraged
peering in at the streaming window then
it was gone but this time a lightning flash
showed me a bent and gnomelike body
running crabwise over the lawn outside
for the shelter of a clump of trees

   alf-past two in the morning

       i sat on the edge of the bed in the
old-fashioned but comfortable bedroom to
which fred had shown me and listened in-
tently there were still storm-noises to be
heard in the night though wind and rain
were dying down but it was not for those
noises that i was listening

   i was straining to hear if any one was
still up in the big house particularly any
one in the hall outside my door for it
was time now to go through with the plan
that had determined my staying in the
house that night

   it wasnt much of a plan it was simply
a resolve to search methodically through
this whole house room by room and see
if i could find out the secret of the nameless
horror that spread its wings over it

   strangely materialized spirits  white
souls of the dead comforting those who de
the town the dead things claimed



served it-scourging those who did not
what was the real answer to those im-
possible things

also i wanted to discover anything i
could about stella theyd said she was
dead but no one had offered to show me
her body what was the reason for that 

i tiptoed to the door out into the hall
and to -the stairs cursing the ancient floor-
boards that creaked under my weight i
went up to the third floor first

what insanity had fred corse been
babbling of what had attacked the girl
in the ruined church-and the housekeeper
in the basement  what were the three mis-
ty wraithlike things i had seen floating
ahead of me up the path-to this house 

spirits of the dead-white souls from
beyond the tomb 

nonsense utter idiocy i told myself
and as i was saying it i felt sweat start
out on the palms of my hands

there was nothing on the third floor i
went into room after room and all were
empty save one where i heard the steady
breathing of some one asleep

back on the second floor i repeated the
performance save for three of the six
rooms there two were the rooms in which
i cautiously discovered jeanne and fred
slept the third was my own which of
course i didnt bother to search

the first floor   

there were kitchen dining room li-
brary and two big living rooms with a
double door between all empty but there
was one more room off the main hall and
that i found with a quick intake of breath
was locked

i took out a knife to see if i could force
the lock then plunged it back into my
pocket and turned

coming down the stairs was the house-
keeper

for a moment i was rigid with alarm i
had no right to search the house this
way i felt that there were dark secrets
here for which some one might murder to

keep hidden if the woman screamed   

but she didnt she gasped with relief
and said oh its you i heard a sound
and was afraid 

she didnt finish the sentence she had a
thin robe over her comely shoulders as
far as i could see there was nothing under
it she was too agitated to realize that it
hung open loosely in front

whats the matter  why are you down
here 

i shrugged no important reason i
cant get to sleep i wanted a cigarette and
found i was out of them i came down to
look for some

there are cigarettes in the library
she turned and went toward the library
door i saw a gauze strip a thin bandage
between her breasts where id seen the
thin gash as she lay in the basement she
snapped on a dim light and wordlessly
pointed to a silver cigarette casket

che took one too i lit it for her and
 sat down beside her on a broad divan
here perhaps was a chance to get some
information

youre pretty brave i said to come
downstairs alone to investigate a noise
after what-happened to you

her hand went to the bandage and her
face whitened she shivered in the thin
robe

fl thought the noise was made by a
human being and it is not human beings
that i fear in this house

i watched her sharply and said you
thought the noise was made perhaps by-
stella corse 

she only looked surprised made by a
dead person oh no

it was hard to get out any words about
it but i forced myself to say its odd
that stella died so soon after marrying mr
corse tell me-why do you think she
married him  he isnt a well man

i think maybe thats the reason she
may have pitied him many marriages are

made for that reason you must know
that

did she seem contented here

oh yes

that hurt i said brusquely she wasnt
bothered by the-whatever it was-that
attacked you in the basement

her fingers touched the bandage again
her dark eyes peered fearfully into mine

i  i cant answer that she gasped
oh you must leave here get out the
first thing in the morning there is nothing
for you here-with her gone nothing but
death death on silent white wings

whats all this talk of the dead scourg-
ing the living who have sinned i per-
sisted

in answer she got up and put out her
cigarette

i cant say any more you had better
go to your room at once and lock the
door-tight

she stepped into the dark hall i heard
her soft footsteps as she went up the stairs
i stayed in the library for five minutes
and then went into the hall myself but
not to the stairs i went back to that locked
door

i managed to shoot the simple catch
with the blade of my knife and stepped
into blackness i stood inside the doorway
a few minutes and then began to see a
little

i saw dimly many glistening cases
standing around the walls a table in the
center the vague oblongs of two shaded
windows then i tensed suddenly as i saw
a shadowy white shape standing between
the windows

i stood there with perspiration standing
in clammy drops on my forehead for the
misty wraithlike patch against the dark
wall was all too much like the three shapes
i had seen slowly drifting up the cliff path
ahead of me but it didnt move and sum-
moning all my courage i stepped slowly
toward it to investigate

i stopped from behind me had sounded

a small noise i stood with beating heart
the noise sounded a little like the faint
swish of flowing draperies at the same
time i seemed to feel a slight coldness
behind me

for a long moment i stood there then
i turned-and a hoarse yell came from my
lips behind me was another tall dim
white shape but this one was not still it
was moving it was coming floating
toward me with misty things like arms
outstretched

i tried to move and couldnt i got my
head around enough to see a white shape
looming slowly behind me from the di-
rection of the windows i heard my breath
rasp from terror-tortured lungs then the
thing i had first heard was near enough for
me to feel a sort of clammy cold mist touch-
ing my flesh

i tried to crouch tried to leap but some-
thing crashed down on my skull and i
sank into blackness

chapter four

the cleansing flame

t came back to consciousness knowing
- somehow that i was in the basement
of the house perhaps it was the feel of
dampness the sensation of the cold con-
crete on which i lay it was very dark

i could barely see my hand as a dim
blotch when i held it before my face i
touched my head which was throbbing
unendurably what had struck me in the
upstairs room where i had seen the ghastly
white shapes 

now sound began to penetrate my con-
sciousness it was a soft murmuring un-
like anything i had ever heard before it
kept on varying now in one note now in
two or three for all the world like an eerie
conversation heard from afar

the noise stopped i got unsteadily to
my feet at first i could see nothing but
the blackness around me then i saw one
relieving spot of light and started for it
the light came from a keyhole i sank to
the town the dead things claimed



my knees and looked through the tiny
space

 i was looking into another basement
 room i saw bare stone wall illuminated
 faintly by a bluish light i saw the end of
 a table or slab of some kind i saw two
 dainty bare feet at the end of the slab like
 things carved in snowy marble i gasped
 at that and the last shreds of fog fled from
 my dazed brain

 the shock of what i saw on the slab
 when my vision had cleared is with me yet

 on the black-draped slab as on a funeral
 bier was a lovely white body it was the
 form of a nude woman with hands crossed
 on the breasts so beautiful she seemed
 and so peaceful that you would think she
 was only sleeping there but then i saw
 the throat and face and knew differently

 the face was that of stella leigh and
 the throat was almost covered over by one
 great bruise it had been heavily pow-
 dered but the bruise showed through it
 the bruise of a broken neck i closed my
 eyes for one shattered moment then
 opened them again as i heard movement in
 the room

 two figures came into my range of
 vision one was fred corse with his
 feverish eyes glittering like black dia-
 monds the other figure was robed all in
 black  veiled by a garment like a priests
 cape over the face was a black hood like
 that of an executioner

 watching impotently through the key-
 hole i saw fred kneel beside the nude
 alabaster body his attitude was worship-
 ful but there was avid hell in his dark
 eyes

 words came from under the black hood
 of the figure robed like a priest of satan

 death beautiful death death is not
 ugly it is lovely as this corpse is lovely
 and it is not the end from it springs life
 -the life of the soul

 i saw freds pallid lips move in answer

 prove to me just once more i must
 be sure

 it shall be proved once more with this
 girl the black-robed figure replied the
 words musical liquid were almost in a
 whisper but they carried plainly to me

the soul is ever-living freed of its
flesh it becomes immortal taking on pure
substance and going where it pleases it
becomes heavens scourge for wrong-doers
each becomes a winged thing as you have
seen before as you shall see again   
stroke the dead flesh that it may release
its spirit

corse rose from his knees i could bare-
ly see him in the ghastly blue light but i
could see his eyes plainly enough glitter-
ing hard his hands went out

slowly lmgeringly they passed over the
white white body of the girl i had loved
halting on the graceful fulnesses dipping
to the soft hollows

it was more than i could stand i jumped
to my feet raving at corse i shook the
door bruising and gashing my knuckles
as i pounded against the massive panels

t heard all words cease abruptly in
 the next room then i heard some-
thing that even in that moment could stop
my wild raving

a renewal of the eerie soft murmuring
like the talk of strange beings far away
with this was a sound as of many soft
forms moving with gently swishing drap-
eries in the blackness around me and in
that blackness i barely saw looming white
shapes slowly appearing and nearing me

i screamed and tried to run blindly
anywhere as if it had been a signal they
were on me the air was filled with the
wraithlike whiteness like mist patches
floating around me i felt as if a hundred
whiplashes tore at me in the darkness and
the soft hideous pressure of the white
shapes crowding in almost suffocated me

god the feel of those things cold dank
with floating garments that were like the
touch of hideous membranes

again and again i screamed as i lashed
out at the floating shapes and sometimes
dime mystery magazine

my screams were muffled as one of the
things smothered my face and sometimes
they ripped clear like the screams of a
damned soul as i clawed the wraithlike
shapes off of me

i was on my knees now fainting gashed
in a hundred places as if by talonlike claws
i wavered onthe threshold of death in the
subterranean room i knew that with a ter-
rible certainty i could feel the hot blood
dripping from my face as it had dripped
from the rain-soaked body of the girl in
the ruined church

the dead ones returning    spirits
of the dead scourging those who sinned

reason returned to me for one brief in-
stant there was only one way out of this
pit of white death that was through the
bolted door into the next room where
corse and the black-robed figure were just
that one way out

i was still near the door i lay on my
side with my arms over my face to shield
it from the horrible softly murmuring
white shades that pressed upon me

theyve got me i yelled toward the
door theyve-got-me-

i scratched at the door with bleeding
fingernails then was utterly still

over me the white wraiths floated and
the agonizing torture of razorlike gashes
continued every nerve in my body was
writhing in pain and revulsion but i man-
aged to lie as motionless as a dead man

and the ruse worked

i heard bolts shoot back heard the door
open under my right arm i could see the
doorway corse stood there dimly to be
seen in the weird light that trickled in
from the other room his eyes were stark
mad his body rigid with weird ecstacy

the scourging spirits have him-sinner
that he is the white souls are flaying
him i shall watch him die

the black-clad figure appeared behind
him and tugged at his arm

no no come out of there it said
and the voice was not quite so musical

now it was harsh and filled with fear

   the spirits will not harm me corse
said see how they rend him-

   i sprang then i saw the unholy lust
in his eyes turn to amazement and then
to fear i saw the black-robed figure try
to shut the door in my face then i was
on the threshold with corses throat be-
tween my slashed hands

horror and loss of blood had weakened
me but the weakness for the moment
was more than compensated for by an in-
sane rage the figure in black clawed at
me corse battered my face but i held on

rphen i saw something over corses
shoulder something that slowly weak-
ened my grip as nothing else had done

   i was staring unseeingly at the bier on
which was the milk-white body of stella
it just happened that my gaze rested
there unwittingly as i tilted my head to
escape corses desperate blows and i saw
something white stir  

   stellas body for one crazy instant i
thought that but it was not the thing
that stirred was something else something
that turned my fingers into nerveless sticks
from whose clutch corse was tearing him-
self free unheeded

   it was one of the dreadful wraithlike
shapes and it was rising slowly from the
body of the girl itself

   death is lovely as this corpse is love-
ly and it is not the end from it springs
life-the life of the soul

   the blaek-robed figure had said that
my god had the spirit of stella leigh
materialized before my eyes coming from
the white dead body as a butterfly comes
from a cocoon i was blind to the other
white wraiths looming around me again
and was numbed to their slashing attacks
i could see only the one white thing which
had come from the body of a dead woman
i heard a roaring in my ears felt my knees
give under me

   the white shape floated toward me with
the town the dead things claimed



misty arms outstretched and the face was
that of stella with a demons smile on the
full lips and the outstretched hands were
tipped with cruel avid talons

i went mad

i know now what is meant by insanity
i have been insane myself it is a state
where you laugh when normally youd
scream with horror it is a state in which
you have a strength beyond bone and
muscle and a quickness that makes light-
ning seem sluggish

corse was staggering toward me with a
club in his hands the black-robed figure
had a knife that was rising to sink into my
flesh

laughing i hit corse before the club
could descend in his unsteady hand laugh-
ing i got the club and struck down with
it on his head as hard as i could

i felt the sting of a knife-graze on my
side and then turned to grab at the black-
robed figure

even in the midst of my lunacy and in
spite of the odd shock of feeling a womans
voluptuous breasts under the black priests
robe i heard the roaring from above grow
louder and knew that it was actual and
not just within my own skull

and then a man screamed above the
people from the village every mothers
son of them axes    guns    corse

mary get away through the tun-
the voice was stilled with terrible sud-
denness i whirled the black-robed body
from me it fell to the floor and the hood
came off the face of the housekeeper
glared at me it was the face of a she-devil
with murder in her black eyes

   i could hear the smashing of glass up-
stairs and something else far more fright-
ening  a roaring crackle that i knew was
fire well advanced

t ran through the basement and up the
stairs in the hall was doctor jeanne
and another man on the floor jeanne was
dead with glazing eyes open the handle of
a knife protruded from his chest the
other man elderly was writhing in blood
on the floor

   i recognized the bushy eyebrows and
down-curving nose it was the man i had
twice seen peering into the glass of the
back door furthermore-it was the father
of the girl who had been attacked in the
old church

   he glared at me with a hatred that faded
when he saw the streaming wounds on my
face and throat

   so    he gasped you are not one
of them i thought  

   he coughed blood and lay back i bent
over him

tunnel from basement he panted
go out that    safe   

red was glaring through the dawn-
blackness of the hall i heard the flames
roar more loudly from a dozen spots in
which the old house had been set afire at
the smashed windows and the open doors
i saw the faces of men whose eyes were
wide with idiot hatred the faces of the
villagers scourged beyond endurance by
some inexplicable thing emanating from
this house and now rebelling by burning
the house and all in it impossible to escape
through door or window the men would
not permit that

tunnelthe old man gasped again
in the coal bin    take the girl that
way   

but the girl is dead i cried wildly

no    take her   he choked and
was still

there was a crash as the back door
burst down and men ran in i got to the
basement stairs ahead of them and raced
down they didnt follow they must have
been satisfied that i was running down only
to death in the flames when the building
collapsed over me

i got to the room where the white
wraiths wheeled and where corse lay with
his head battered in i got there just in
time the woman in black was on her feet
she was bending over stellas body with
her knife in her hand

i caught her white wrist on the up
stroke as the blade was poised to plunge
down into stellas white breast then i
hit her-hard she wasnt a woman-she
was simply an incarnation of evil

i gathered stellas body in my arms and
raced for the coal bin

so cleverly was it concealed that id
never have found it if i hadnt been told
where to look but in a moment i did
find it-a black hole in the floor uncovered
by pushing aside a mound of coal and rais-
ing a trapdoor

there was a staggering trip down a dark

passage with a white body in my arms
that somehow incredibly seemed warm
then i was out in the rain with the blaz-
ing house a hundred yards behind me
dancing maniac figures showed black
against the red glare but none of them
looked our way probably could not have
seen us in the night if they had

   on legs that felt dead under me i
tottered to the road a car seemed to ap-
pear out of nowhere it was filled with
men one of them with a sheriffs badge
on his coat got out

   that was all i knew

tt was the old man who had told me of
the tunnel who rounded out the dread-
ful story he didnt die tiy hours later in
the operating room of the boganville hos-
pital after being dragged by friends from
the burning house

   he knew of the tunnel built in civil
war days that led into the corse base-
ment not as ignorant as the rest of the
villagers he pretended to be as frightened
of the scourging spirits of the dead ones
as the others but all the while he was
entering that house secretly and piecing to-
gether the chronicle of crime and horror
it contained

   doctor jeanne was behind it a biologist
as well as a physician he had developed c
by selective breeding albino vampire bats
of the gigantic south american species
things that had better than a five foot
wing-spread and seen in darkness ap-
peared to tower like white-draped wraiths
as they floated near the ceiling of an un-
lit room

   jeanne heard about corse and his un-
balanced belief in the occult and in em-
bodied spirits of the dead returning he got
his great white bats into the house secretly
and showed them to corse in a dim room
with suitable mumbo-jumbo corse saw
materialized spirits and was almost in a
state of mind to do anything jeanne
wanted almost-but not quite
the town the dead things claimed



jeanne wanted corse to make a will
leaving everything to him and corse
demurred

stella leigh dropped by to make a duty
call jeanne recognized in her the inspira-
tion for the little wraith in stone in the hall
niche it looked like jeannes chance if
he could show corse the materialized spir-
it of this girl after death the will was as
good as drawn up then corse could die
and the family fortune would go to the
doctor

jeanne drugged stella while she went
through a wedding ceremony with fred
then he doped her into unconsciousness
painted a deep bruise over her throat and
told corse shed died of a fall over the
cliff from the draped bier on which
stella lay one of the great bats was to
flutter up convincing corse that he had
seen her soul take wing

then i got there corses telegram had
drawn me instead of keeping me away
jeanne and the housekeeper-who was his
sister-had tried to scare me off by fak-
ing an attack on her of the scourging
souls instead of leaving i tried to in-
vestigate jeanne it was who knocked me
on the head and left me in the room of the
bats to die there

white souls-great white bats looming
high in darkness with their tremendous
wing-spread their ghostlike fluttering 

 but sometimes the bats got loose un-
 afraid of men because reared by one they
 attacked the villagers-who saw in the
 wraithlike shapes whatever they wished to
 see as i had thought to see talons and the
 face of stella in the white form that had
 fluttered from under her bier at last the
 people had risen and destroyed the place
 from which they knew terror came even
 though they did not know the nature of
 that terror 

 there isnt much left for you to take
 over except fire-charred ruins darling i
 told stella when she had recovered from
 her fantastic experience

 much for me to take over she re-
 peated bewildered what do you mean 
 you were married to corse for a few
 hours youre his widow-you get his
 estate

 she shuddered i never want to touch
 anything associated with that name
 there are other properties beside the
 house i said not looking at her a
 quarry farms some timber lands a fair
 coal mine

 she put her slim finger on my lips
 well sell it all and give it to charity
 she said id choke on a crust of bread
 from that place and you know it

 i kissed her with my heart in my eyes
 yes i said i do know it and-
 thank god for it

      chapter one
      the man without a face

dave wendell was within a
block of his destination when a
sixth sense warned him he was
being followed without checking his
stride he glanced swiftly back over his
shoulder the street was dark gloomy
imperfectly lit by the rays of a sputter-
ing arc lamp shining through amorphous
coiling tendrils of fog in this dim half-
world of light and shadow the detective
caught sight of a figure behind him a
figure that stole furtively along the pave-
ment dogging his footsteps

through the grey veil of the fog and
night the form of his pursuer was in-
distinct shapeless strangely terrifying
there was something about it that seemed
abnormal and grotesque-something not
quite human

there was only one way to find out
who it was that stalked him he quick-
ened his pace reached the benton resi-
dence where he had been called by tele-


dime mystery magazine

phone that evening the house was set
far back from the street surrounded by
a tall hedge silently wendell darted
through the gateway crouched behind the
hedge he fumbled in the pocket of his
topcoat drew out a small flashlight his
other hand closed around the butt of a
revolver with muscles tensed every
sense alert he waited for what was to
come

footsteps shuffled eerily over the pave-
ment drew nearer out of the gloom
swam the figure it hesitated stopped di-
rectly in front of him he jerked erect
suddenly thumbed the button of his
flash a strangled cry broke from his lips
as light sprayed over the nightmare crea-
ture before him

it was tall thin to the point of emacia-
tion its skeleton body outlined beneath the
long black cloak it wore bony fingers
were lifted malevolently shaping into tal-
ons underneath a felt hat pulled low
over the forehead sunken eyes burned in
a skull without a face

that was the quintessence of the hor-
ror gibbering in dave wendells brain
where the features should have been there
was nothing but scar tissue with bits of
dark skin still clinging to it the nose
was white cartilage the cheeks eaten away
teeth gleamed in the lipless mouth fixed
in a perpetual frozen grin

even as wendell stared petrified the
hideous creaturesnarled and struck at him
viciously the odor of kerosene smote
his nostrils as he ducked the blow he
slipped on the dew-soaked grass and went
sprawling he was on his feet again almost
immediately but that split second of time
was long enough to give the thing a chance
to escape the sound of its footsteps thud-
ded on merged with the stillness when
wendell reached the pavement the mon-
ster had disappeared

the detective cursed softly the hair on
his scalp still crawling at the memory of
the horror he had seen who or what was

the faceless thing  why had it been trail-
ing him  why had it smelled so strongly
of kerosene  unanswerable questions that
must tie up in some way with george ben-
tons frantic telephone message benton
should be able to clear things up for him

pocketing his revolver and flashlight
wendell turned and followed the concrete
walk to the house he crossed the porch
and rang the bell the door swung open
just inside stood a slight middle-aged
man with thin tanned features in the
semi-darkness of the hall those features
mirrored suspicion and a certain desperate
fear

you are detective wendell the man
asked tersely

wendell nodded keen eyes studying the
face before him

and you are not connected with the
police department

wendell gestured impatiently im a
private operative if thats what you mean
he said curtly

the man sighed with relief i thought
you were he muttered but i had to
make sure a private detective can help
me more than the police can i-im
george benton come into the library
and ill explain why i called you here
tonight

the room they entered was wide and
spacious dimly lit by scattered lamps
three walls were lined with books the
fourth was filled with glass cases in which
were mounted specimens of animal life
mainly native to tropical america there
were vampire bats tiny monkeys an
armadillo several kinds of insects in-
cluding the deadly tarantula in the cen-
ter of the room was a huge desk and be-
side it stood a tall young man whose
sun-blackened skin contrasted oddly with
his blond hair

my secretary paul lambert ben-
ton said paul is as much concerned
with what i have to tell you as i am
myself wendell he continued hastily
terror has no face

both our lives as well as the lives of two
others are in terrible danger

danger the detectives eyebrows
lifted from what may i ask

p eorge benton didnt speak for a
 long time when he did his voice
had sunk to a whisper we are being
threatened-by a dead man he said
hoarsely

wendell had schooled himself not to be
surprised or startled by anything but
this was a little too much for an instant
he gazed angrily into bentons haggard
countenance then he turned and started
for the door

sorry but i cant appreciate a prac-
tical joke he said coldly

im not joking benton panted
clutching at his arm im telling you the
truth wendell the man who is going to
kill us died six months ago were posi-
tive of that and yet-we heard from him
today we got letters from him threaten-
ing our lives youve got tobelieve that
youve got to

the detective swung around his fore-
head wrinkled in a puzzled frown ben-
ton sounded sincere and certainly both
he and his secretary were badly fright-
ened there might be something to the
mans crazy talk after all

suppose you start at the beginning and
tell me all about your trouble wendell
suggested

benton swallowed convulsively as i
said before it began six months ago
he faltered we were in brazil at the
time collecting specimens for the museum
of natural history in washington

besides lambert and myself there
were three others in the expedition pro-
fessor john brant well known zoologist
was our leader then there were dr
melvin shaw on leave of absence from
columbia university and philip dray-
ton a brilliant young pupil of shaws
we-we all liked young drayton thought

hed be a great help to us on the trip
how could we guess that the time would
come when wed curse the day we took
him along

then drayton is the person youre so
much afraid of wendell put in

benton nodded philip drayton died
while we were in the matto grosso the
wildest and most dangerous region in
south america he said huskily theres
no question about it and still hes found
a way to return from the dead and mur-
der the rest of us

it was his own fault that he lost his
life benton continued hysterically if
he had turned back when we wanted him
to everything would have been all right
we had spent weeks along the amazon
were well satisfied with the specimens we
had secured it was the beginning of the
rainy season and the very breath of the
jungle was laden with fever our quinine
and other supplies were running low un-
der the circumstances it was sheer insan-
ity to keep on

but drayton insisted he had learned
there was a rare species of butterfly the
cyrestis thyodamas to be found in the
interior of brazil near the rio madera he
was determined to add the insect to our
collection and so he persuaded us much
against our will to accompany him

i dont know how long it took us to
reach the madera i-i cant remember
but it seemed ages the river a tributary
of the amazon is navigable for only a
short distance because of its many falls and
cataracts we left our boat at a small
village along the stream and struck into
the heart of the matto grosso on foot
we didnt find the butterfly we sought
we found only trouble-with the catu-
quinas a tribe of indians native to that
region

apparently they had little use for
white men for they were unfriendly and
suspicious of us from the start they did
not openly attack us it would have been


dime mystery magazine

a relief if they had they kept out of
sight after the first glimpse we caught of
them but as we went through the jun-
gle their arrows began to fall around us
flickering through the trees getting closer
and closer driving us to the point of mad-
ness

a hundred times we tried desperately
to catch sight of our invisible enemies and
fight back but we never succeeded they
were too clever for us and then one day
an arrow struck drayton in the hip crip-
pling him it was too much for the rest
of us we broke and fled-

and left him to the mercy of the sav-
ages  wendell said slowly the scorn in
his voice cut like a whip

benton flushed it was the only thing
we could do he whined if we had
stayed behind and tried to save him we
would all have been killed what was the
use of sacrificing our lives for his

as we ran drayton shouted curses
after us swore hed pay us back for desert-
ing him we heard his shouts turn to
screams of agony-and we knew the in-
dians had him   bentons voice wav-
ered into silence

and then wendell prompted

there-there isnt much more to tell
the catuquinas didnt try to follow us i
suppose they were satisfied with just kill-
ing drayton at any rate we reached the
madera and our boat without being furth-
er molested but we didnt feel safe until
we left the jungle behind us and got back
to civilization once-more and now   
we are in danger again six months after
his death philip drayton is trying to make
good his threats and revenge himself on
us

george benton stopped talking abruptly
and fumbled in the pocket of his coat
he drew out a folded sheet of paper
creased and frayed at the edges through
much handling without a word he un-
folded it and gave it to the detective on
k was written in huge and sprawling let-

ters the following mysterious sentence
you shall die as i died-
without a face

chapter two

death is kind to cowards

tor a full minute wendell studied the
message then he glanced again at
bentons pale frightened face

   when did you get this he asked
tersely

   it came in the regular letter delivery
about two oclock this afternoon the
envelope was postmarked new york
drayton must have mailed it from a let-
ter box or a local postoffice some time
during the morning-

   a dead man mails you a letter threat-
ening your life wendell exclaimed be
reasonable benton why are you so cer-
tain drayton sent it

   the note is in his handwriting ben-
ton insisted stubbornly id recognize it
anywhere

   it might be a forgery the detective
interrupted again someone else could
have sent that note who knew draytons
handwriting well enough to imitate it
someonewho might have been with you
on that expedition and is using the dead
mans threat against you now for some
reason of his own   

   but thats impossible benton pro-
tested rthe three men who were with me
when drayton was killed-professor
brant doctor shaw and paul lambert
here are entirely above suspicion none
of them would do a thing like that even
as-as a practical joke besides they all
received letters just like this one he
turned to his secretary show him the
one you got paul he gasped

   lamberts note was identical in every
respect with that of his employers it
contained the same single sentence the
same sinister warning that benton insist-
terror has no face

ed had been written by a dead man

 you shall died as i died--without a
face wendell read once more this
time aloud what does it mean

george benton shuddered i dont
know he whispered possibly the catu-
quinas did something horrible to philip
draytons face before they killed him
they must have tortured him in some
fiendish way-before he died and now
bentons fingers were digging into the
detectives arm drayton has come back
from the grave to do the same thing to
us youve got to stop him wendell
youve got to save us

his voice faded away he was trem-
bling all over his blood-shot eyes were
piteous and paul lambert seemed
equally affected by the intangible aura
of menace that hung in the room sweat
beaded his tanned forehead and he clung
to the desk as if for support

wendells eyes raked their features his
thoughts going back to the ghastly shape
that had followed him through the night
to this very house it had been inhuman
awful what was even more significant
it was without a face could that strange
shape be the very thing these two men
were so afraid of-the corpse of philip
drayton animated by some unholy power
stronger than death creeping through the
darkness to fulfill its vow of revenge
a corpse trying to commit murder it
was fantastic a dead man seeking ven-
geance on the living reason and logic
rebelled against such an impossibility
and yet   

with an effort wendell shook off the
eerie mood that gripped him handed back
the notes what about the two other
men who received these threatening let-
ters-brant and shaw he asked abrupt-
ly where are they now

i-i invited them to come here to-
night benton faltered i thought it
would be a good idea to have all of us
together for mutual protection when

drayton struck they should be along
any minute now  

    did you tell them you called me in
on this case the detective wanted to
know

   no but-

    bentons words choked off in a stran-
gled gasp suddenly a voice was scream-
ing-the voice of a man driven insane
with horror and fear muffled terrible
it sounded inside the room seemed to
come from the wall itself

    mercy it shrieked dear god have
mercy i dont have it i dont have it
i tell you brants the one who does
hes the man you want kill me if you
will but not like this mercy-

the voice rose to a frenzied screech
stopped abruptly benton was staggering
across the floor face chalk-white point-
ing a shaking forefinger at an almost in-
visible door beside a bookcase

its doctor shaw he babbled hes
in that closet something horrible is hap-
pening to him

    ith an oath wendell darted past
the terror-crazed man yanked the
door open suddenly a form bobbed
there in the dimness swaying a little with
a ghastly simulation of life it was the
body of a dead man dangling from a
hook in the wall like the carcass of a
sheep hanging in a butcher shop and
dave wendell felt black sickness churn-
ing and twisting in his stomach as he saw
the hideous way death had struck

the head and face of the man who hung
there before him was entirely bare of
flesh as though picked clean by vultures
only the skull remained naked white
bone with not even a vestige of skin or
hair clinging to it black holes leered at
him from empty sockets where the eyes
had been

for one man at least the grim prophecy
in those terrible letters had come true
melvin shaw guilty with three others of


dime mystery magazine

abandoning philip drayton to a horrible
fate had died zvithout a face

fighting his nausea wendell drew
nearer the gruesome corpse forced him-
self to touch it he turned away with a
shudder to explore every square inch of
the closet space he rapped on floor and
walls with his knuckles pressed onto
panelling but his search was fruitless
aside from the dangling body the closet
was absolutely empty its walls solid
there was no sign of the murderer
no evidence of any secret passageway
through which he might have escaped
there wasnt even a clue to the grisly
weapon he had used to mutilate his vic-
tims face so horribly whoever-what-
ever-had killed melvin shaw had van-
ished utterly without a trace

wendell spun around unsteadily to
glare at the pallid stricken men behind
him well he grated what do you
two know about this

paul lambert moistened his dry lips
drayton did it he choked he killed
shaw just as he threatened he would
he murdered him while we were standing
here talking-

but if drayton did it how did he get
away afterward wendell interrupted
harshly theres only one exit from that
closet-through the door leading into
this room drayton couldnt have made
his escape that way he couldnt have
been in the closet at all-

but he was in there benton panted
we heard shaw talking to him didnt
we we heard the poor fellow begging
for his life and then drayton-or the
thing that was drayton-murdered him
and disappeared before we could open the
closet door i tell you wendell were up
against something inhuman-something
with unearthly powers something that
can vanish through solid walls as though
they didnt exist

nuts the detective muttered ghost
or no ghost the killers going to have a

hard time pulling a vanishing act when
we get him behind iron bars

but his words lacked conviction once
more he felt superstitious terror plucking
at his nerves threatening his self-control
once more he was battling fighting the
worst of all fears-fear of the unknown
he had heard a man screaming behind a
closed door barely five seconds later he
had jerked open that door to find the same
man a hideously mutilated corpse five
seconds for some fiendish killer to strip
the flesh from that mans face and dis-
appear as if into thin air it was all so
utterly fantastic and impossible it could
not have happened

no it couldnt have happened wen-
dell mumbled to himself it must have
been done in some other way he wiped
at the sweat forming on his forehead
turned to benton again

were you and lambert at home all
day he asked

benton looked puzzled then shook his
head we spent most of the afternoon
in a museum he said we were exam-
ining a collection of insects in the natural
history department-

and i dont suppose you opened this
closet after you came back 

no we had no occasion to we sel-
dom use it- benton broke off suddenly
his face going livid what are you driv-
ing at wendell he-gasped do you
mean that the murderer-that drayton-
brought shaw to this house while paul
and i were away forced him to go into
that closet do you mean that both of
them might have been in there since this
afternoon 

its quite possible that shaw might
have been at least   

but even so that doesnt explain why
the murderer delayed killing shaw until
just now or how he managed to escape
from the closet afterward without being
seen-

it doesnt explain another thing id
terror has no face



like to find out wendell snapped what
did shaw mean by screaming  dont
have it brants the one who does just
before he died what was that thing he
didnt have and the killer wanted have
you any idea benton

   i dont know benton said hastily i
-i couldnt even guess but his voice
didnt ring true and he refused to meet
the detectives eyes could the man be
lying keeping something back youll
have to ask professor brant he added
lamely

   im going to wendell said grimly
and right away whats brants ad-
dress he scribbled it down turned to
the trembling secretary call the police
lambert he ordered ill be back as
soon as i can

   but you cant leave us alone benton
whimpered youve got to stay here and
protect us brant will be along in a few
minutes anyway he said he would-
brant will never keep that engage-
ment with you wendell interrupted
harshly if he isnt dead now he might
be soon the police will take care of
you and lambert benton ive got to
warn john brant before the killer gets
him even now i may be too late

   he heard bentons despairing cry be-
hind him lambert frenziedly telephon-
ing police headquarters then he was out-
side the house racing down the street to
the corner he hailed a cruising taxi
climbed in

   professor brants residence  olive
street he panted and step on it

chapter three

the crawling death

flthe driver made good time scarcely
ten minutes later they stopped with a
squeal of brakes in front of a brownstone
house wendell tossed the hackman a five-
dollar bill raced up the walk without wait-

ing for his change the front door was
slightly ajar he pushed it open entered
a dark shadowy hall light sifted out to
him through drawn curtains hanging be-
fore a room to his left cautiously dave
wendell crept toward the source of that
light he yanked the curtains apart re-
coiled with a sick gasp of horror at what
he saw

near the doorway lay the body of a
man legs bent hands clenched even in
death in a spasm of agony the face was
gone-obliterated as in the case of mel-
vin shaw the flesh had been stripped
away leaving only a bone-white skull
whose jaws yawned open as if in silent
hellish laughter and bending over the
hideous corpse frantically searching its
pockets was the slim figure of a girl

wendell must have made some sound
for suddenly she jerked erect and whirled
on him for a moment she stood perfectly
motionless and rigid then a strangled
cry broke from her lips and she cowered
back eyes dilated with terror

the detective reached for his revolver
leveled it at her menacingly sorry to
interrupt your little murder party he
said grimly but i think the police would
like to have a talk with you that he
gestured toward the thing on the floor
was professor john brant i take it 
the girl nodded her face a white frozen
mask but i didnt do it she whispered
i didnt kill him i-i dont even know
who did i just got here a short time
ago-

and proceeded to go through his
pockets wendells lip curled just a
common little thief robbing a dead man 
angry color flamed in her cheeks for
the first time he noticed how pretty she
was im not a thief she cried furi-
ously i was only after something that
didnt belong to him-something he took
from my husband something that means
everything in the world to phil

phil
dime mystery magazine

philip drayton i mean im mary
drayton his wife

dave wendell gaped at her foolishly
his mouth hanging open philip drayton
according to george bentons story had
died six months ago in south america
philip drayton or so benton said had
come back from the grave to exact a ter-
rible vengeance on four men who had left
him to a horrible fate two of those men
had already been murdered dying as
drayton was supposed to have died with-
out a face and now here was this lovely
girl who said she was draytons wife
searching the pockets of one of draytons
victims looking for something she claimed
meant everything in the world to her for-
mer husband what in this world could
be important to a dead man anymore  it
didnt make sense

lets get this straight wendell said
feebly first of all what is this some-
thing you want so badly

the girls lips set in a thin line its
none of your business she said defiantly
but if it isnt on brants body her voice
hardened one of the others must have
it ill get it if its the last thing i ever
do

so youre planning another murder or
two wendell rasped i dont think so
not if i can help it at any rate
murder she gasped but i didnt
murder anyone i just told you i-
her voice broke off suddenly and re-
lief flooded over her face as she caught
sight of someone over the detectives
shoulder philip she cried joyfully
thank god youre here

the rank odor of kerosene more than
what she said warned dave wendell of
the horror that lurked behind him he
whirled around his blood turning to ice
in his veins one split-second glimpse he
caught of the inhuman shape that had
trailed him to george bentons house ear-
lier that evening-the ghastly faceless
creature that must be the corpse of philip

drayton then a club in the things hand
swept up and descended with crushing
force on his head crimson lights whirled
and danced in front of his eyes pain ex-
ploded inside his skull snuffing out con-
sciousness as a strong wind snuffs out a
candle 

tt seemed hours later when dave

  wendell opened dull suffering eyes
once more he was sprawled on the floor
his revolver lying a few inches away from
his outstretched fingers with the excep-
tion of the mutilated body of john brant
he was alone in the room both the girl
and the faceless thing had vanished

  wendell staggered to his feet picked up
his revolver drums of agony boomed in-
side his head he rubbed a shaking hand
across his aching forehead tried to think
straight the thing without a face was
behind these murders he was positive
of that now whether it was human or in-
human a living creature or a corpse
didnt matter it was killing destroying
life

  the girl must be its accomplice she
had declared that she knew nothing about
the murders but she must have been lying
she and the thing had already killed two
men-melvin shaw and john brant
they would kill two more-george ben-
ton and paul lambert-unless they were
stopped

  hed stop them hed save benton and
lambert with that determination seeth-
ing in his brain wendell stumbled from
the room and out into the night air he
could never recall afterward how or when
he reached bentons home the next thing
he remembered was running up the path
to the house dark and silent as a tomb
even before he burst through the front
door he knew death had preceded him
even before he rushed into the library he
knew he would be too late

  the body of a man lay there in front of
the desk like the bodies of the others
terror has no face

who had died that night it was hideously
mutilated the face and head stripped clean
of flesh but by the clothing it wore
wendell identified it as the corpse of
paul lambert lambert who had died
too without a face lambert who was the
third to be hunted down and murdered to
satisfy a dead mans lust for vengeance

but where was benton the fourth vic-
tim marked for slaughter there was no
sign of him in the room had he escaped 
and why werent the police there lam-
bert had telephoned them to come he
had been calling them when wendell
rushed away  that wild goose chase to
brants home

or had lambert called the police  with
an inarticulate cry wendell leaped for the
telephone snatched it up dangling wires
trailed across the desk as he lifted the in-
strument  the killer had made the phone
useless so that lambert couldnt get help
that might have saved his life

wendell returned to the corpse knelt
beside it lambert had been dead only
a few minutes his flesh was still warm to
the touch the detective got to his feet
brow furrowed in thought significant
happenings of that night of horror whirled
in a stream of lurid pictures through his
mind he recalled the two ominous notes
he had read that evening he thought of
another corpse he had seen he remem-
bered a man screaming in terrible fear-
a man who was found dead and hideously
mutilated seconds afterward these frag-
ments of a jigsaw of mystery should form
a completed pattern of crime if only he
could put them together

again wendell was at the desk run-
ning his fingers underneath its edge he
straightened up finally waited suddenly
a voice was shrieking in the room once
more-a voice so muffled and terrible that
it froze the blood with horror mercy
it shrieked dear god have mercy i
dont have it i dont have it i tell you
brants the one who does hes the man

you want kill me if you want but not
like this mercy-

it was melvin shaws voice shaw had
screamed those same words once before
but shaw was dead-his corpse dangled
from a hook in the closet dave wendell
was pale and shaking as he listened but
a moment later he smiled grimly as the
hideous voice rose to a nerve-tearing
screech and rasped away into silence

as simple as all that he muttered
aloud just a recording of shaws voice
-what a fool i was not to spot it what
a fool to let the real murderer escape
when i had my hands on him but he
must be still in the house and this time
his tricks wont help him

whirling the detective went plunging
out into the hall the other rooms in the
house were dark they were vacant too
wendell switched on lights as he ran he
reached the kitchen stopped in front of a
door leading into the cellar dim light
filtered up to him as he opened the door
down below the killer must be lurking
preparing his next move in this desperate
game of life and death

cautiously wendell descended the stair-
case his hand was thrust deep in his
pocket gripping the butt on his revolver
he reached the concrete floor of the cellar
and moved across it on tiptoe there was
no trace of the killer

but on a table in the center of the floor
was a transparent circular object that re-
flected the light-a huge glass jar and
inside that jar was a dark ball that moved
and swayed with hideous life

wtendells breath was frozen vapor
  in his lungs as he drew nearer and
saw what that living ball was it was
made up of dark moving bodies millions
of tiny insects they were vicious south
american ants the vilest scourge of the
tropics they devoured everything that
was unfortunate enough to be in their way
-leaves plants other insects and living
dime mystery magazine

creatures many times their size all ani-
mals even man fled in terror at their ap-
proach they were more to be dreaded
than the most savage beast that roamed
the jungle

this then was the hideous murder
weapon the killer had devised there was
a wooden bottom to the jar and in it a
hole large enough to admit a mans head
once fastened in there the victims face
would be exposed to the ants they would
devour skin flesh-everything leaving
nothing but grinning bone behind this
was why three men had died-without a
face no wonder melvin shaw had
screame in horror when he saw what was
to be his fate

sick nauseated dave wendell stared
at the swarming insect horrors so fasci-
nated was he that he failed to notice that a
door was opening inch by inch at the other
end of the cellar he didnt hear a black
furtive shape creep from its hiding place
and start silently toward him he was
aware of no danger until a vicious blow
struck the side of his head with terrific
force arrows of anguish shot through his
brain he felt hideous darkness envelop
him he felt his limbs turn to rubber and
the floor rushed up to meet him as he
fell

consciousness returned to dave wen-
dell slowly consciousness filled with agon-
izing pain his head throbbed excruciat-
ingly and there was the flat taste of blood
in his mouth he groaned opened his
eyes he was lying on the floor bound
hand and foot near him stood the shad-
owy figure watching him through the
slitted eye-holes in its masked face

you should be punished for interfer-
ing with my plans david wendell the
figure droned but i am inclined to be
merciful i am succeeding in what i set
out to do in spite of you i have already
revenged myself on melvin shaw john
brant and paul lambert for the wrong
they did me there remains only-

stop it wendell cried hoarsely
youre just wasting your breath by try-
ing to feed me that nonsense i know the
whole cursed scheme i know who you
are and the reason for your hellish
crimes

really a snarling note crept into
the gloating voice in that case it may be
necessary to include you in my list of
victims after all but go on wendell
you interest me

an icy wind seemed to blow through
dave wendell as he caught the menace
underlying the masked fiends words he
knew too much he was in the way un-
less a miracle happened he would meet
the same hideous end as the others al-
ready the insect horrors were scurrying
around more rapidly in their glass cage as
if scenting the flesh of another victim

yes i understand the whole devilish
plot now wendell continued sparring
desperately for time i know what really
happened to philip drayton on that expe-
dition to south america you wanted me
to believe you had been forced to leave him
behind when you fled from an indian
attack didnt you but that was a lie
to cover up your own guilt you and the
others did leave drayton behind-but to a
fate infinitely more horrible than anything
a tribe of savages might have done to him
you tied him up in the path of an army
of ants knowing what would happen when
the insects reached him planning to mur-
der him by the same means you used to
murder your three accomplices tonight
i have no proof of that of course but i
am just as positive you did it as if i had
been there to watch you

but why did you and the others wish
to murder drayton there could be only
one motive-greed for wealth drayton
had something the rest of you wanted-
something so valuable you were deter-
mined to kill him to get it something i
found out a short time ago that was small
enough to be concealed in a mans pocket
terror has no face



what could be so tiny and still be of
such value that you would commit mur-
der to possess it only one thing-a
jewel of some sort a precious stone 

chapter four

the mask of horror

voure much too clever wendell
the masked figure snarled too
clever for your own good youre right
drayton was left in the jungle for the
ants to devour him he did have a pre-
cious stone-a diamond known as the eye
of light and worth a small fortune it
was given to the poor fool by a rich
brazilian whose life he happened to save
while we were in rio de janeiro from the
moment i saw that diamond i knew i had
to have it for my own the money i could
get from selling it would leave me in com-
fortable circumstances for the rest of my
days and i did get it at last i have
it now-

i thought so wendell interrupted
harshly but it didnt really come into
your possession until tonight did it  for
after you and the others robbed drayton
of the diamond and disposed of him the
jewel disappeared you found out then
that there was no honor among thieves
let alone murderers you knew one of
your three accomplices had stolen it but
you werent sure just which one and so
you thought of a scheme that would not
only frighten the thief into giving up the
diamond but would also eliminate him
and your two other confederates so that
the proceeds from the sale of the jewel
would be yours alone

ironically enough you decided to use
philip drayton in that scheme when
you and your three partners in crime left
drayton to die in the jungle he had
screamed threats after you vowed he
would find a way to get even you knew
your accomplices remembered those

threats if you could convince them that
drayton actually had come back from the
dead for his revenge you could break
down the nerve of whichever one had
stolen the diamond to such an extent that
he would be only too glad to give it up
once the diamond was in your possession
you could murder all three of your con-
federates and pin the blame on a dead
man

and you did it well you started your
terror build-up by imitating draytons
handwriting in the notes you sent to your
victims warning them they were going to
die as he had died-without a face you
also mailed one to yourself of course to
keep them from suspecting you and since
you lived in the same house with one of
your intended victims you got your note
the same time he got his and could study
his reaction you pretended to be just
as panic-stricken as he was even agreed
with him that i a detective should be
called in as a protective measure you
knew the police were bound to find out
what was going on anyhow and hoped to
convince them through me that a super-
natural influence was actually at work

you did go to a museum this after-
noon but you didnt stay there long as
you wanted me to believe you slipped
away after a short time and went to find
shaw your first victim you brought
him here compelled him to enter this cel-
lar with you then-wendell shuddered
as he glanced again at the hideous swarm-
ing death in the glass jar-you showed
the poor wretch the murder weapon you
had devised to carry out the threat in
those letters you had brought the colony
of ants in that jar from south america
for just such a purpose

shaw went crazy with terror when he
found out what was going to happen to
him he vowed he hadnt stolen the dia-
mond accused brant of taking it instead
you let him rave on for a little while
before you killed him you had rigged up


dime mystery magazine

a dictaphone outfit in the cellar which
was making a record of what he said
you figured even then that you might
need such a device to pull the wool over
my eyes a little later on

when the ants were finished with
shaw you went after brant next wrap-
ping up the glass jar so that no one could
tell what it contained you drove with it
to brants house but before you mur-
dered him you found out he didnt have
the diamond either only one person
could have it-the third man who had
helped you take it from the original owner
in the jungle

you had gone with that man to the
museum earlier in the afternoon he was
still there not knowing that death had
already struck down his two companions
you rushed back here then to set the
stage for the performance tonight you
dragged shaws corpse up from the cellar
and put it in the closet concealing the
dictaphone record of the dead mans voice
behind a bookcase near the closet you
connected it with an electric switch under-
neath the edge of the desk you could
stand beside the desk and start the record
without anyone noticing what you were
doing you were all ready now for the
little drama of horror you played this
evening

and i swallowed the bait you had set
for me hook line and sinker wendell
went on bitterly when you clicked on
the switch and i heard shaws voice ap-
parently coming from the closet i reacted
just as you hoped i would i thought
of course that someone was in the closet
with shaw murdering him and when i
yanked open the door and found the poor
devils body hanging in there that belief
was intensified your little trick helped
you in two ways in the first place it
gave you an ironclad alibi since obviously
you couldnt have just killed shaw when
you werent even close to him second-
ly it sent me racing out of the house in a

foolish attempt to save brant who was
already dead leaving the third victim of
your hellish scheme completely at your
mercy

i didnt get wise to you until i came
back here again from my wild-goose chase
to brants house wendell continued
harshly then when i found the body
of your last victim lying in front of the
desk and the telephone wires cut i be-
gan to smell a rat why should a super-
natural killer need to take the precaution
of cutting telephone wires so that its vic-
tim couldnt call for help  i remembered
too that shaws body had felt cold when
i touched it instead of being warm as it
should have been if he had just been mur-
dered i knew then that both he and
brant had been killed hours before and
your alibi wasnt worth a nickle i pried
around a little bit more and discovered
how you had apparently made shaw talk
long after his death those murders
hadnt been committed by an inhuman
thing the corpse of a dead man avenging
an old wrong no a human agency was
at work you a fiendishly clever murderer
who would stop at nothing to accomplish
your purpose but i had found that out
too late to do much good-

 a nd you came back here too soon

for your own good wendell the
black shape interrupted viciously after
you left for brants home my last victim
went to pieces completely and confessed
he had stolen the diamond he surren-
dered it to me and began to plead for his
life but my little pets soon stopped his
yammering the damned sniveling thief
i was getting ready to destroy the in-
criminating evidence-the murder weapon
i had used and the dictaphone record of
shaws voice-when you interrupted me
you just gave me time to hide in the back
part of the cellar when you came rushing
down here but though youve discovered
who i am ill still get out of this mess
terror has no face



with a whole skin wendell ill still save
my hide-by killing you and i might
as well use the same weapon on you i used
on the others-

you cant get away with it wen-
dell cried hoarsely you needed me to
prove your alibi the police are sure to
find you out now

dont be stupid wendell the robed
figure chuckled i dont need an alibi
the police will never dream i committed
the murders and you know it

how true that was wendell realized
bitterly the fiend would escape and never
be punished if only he could stall the
killer off a little while longer the masked
shape had lifted the terrible glass jar was
coming toward him with it inside it the
dark ball burst into a thousand scurrying
horrors ready to devour his lips his
tongue his eyelids strip the raw red flesh
from his skull sweating panting wen-
dell struggled with his bonds they were
giving slightly but not enough for him
to reach the revolver in his pocket he
needed just a little more time something
must happen to stop the murderer for a
few more seconds

and something did suddenly the stairs
leading down the cellar creaked ominous-
ly a thing was descending those stairs
-a thing of horror it was gaunt hideous
faceless-the corpse of a dead man the
corpse of philip drayton returning at
last for its revenge slowly remorselessly
it drew nearer the fiend who had murdered
it

the masked man must have heard that
slow approach for he whirled around to
confront the horror stealing upon him a
jangling scream rasped from his lips and
the glass jar with its awful contents
dropped from his fingers and splintered
into fragments on the floor whimper-
ing crazed with fear he cowered back
shaking from head to foot his red-rimmed
eyes rolling wildly in their sockets

you have come back he bleated

you have made good your vow no it
cant be it cant be stay away from me
for the love of god stay away from me
the thing that had been philip drayton
didnt answer it was as though death
had robbed it of speech in ghastly silence
it continued on fleshless jaws open in a
snarl of hate skeleton fingers shaping into
claws to bury themselves in the masked
figures throat

no the fiend screamed again i
killed you once ill try again make sure
this time if the ants didnt finish you in
the jungle a bullet will now

the murderer was pawing wildly in-
side his coat striving to jerk out a gun
but wendells hands were free at last
his own revolver in his fingers orange
flame stabbed suddenly through the gloom
of the cellar the masked figure shrieked
weaved back and forth uncertainly crum-
pled in a grotesque heap to the floor

swiftly wendell untied the thongs
around his ankles bent for a moment over
the form of the murderer too bad my
bullet only stunned him he muttered
but perhaps its just as well the electric
chair will be a better punishment

the detective straightened up turned
to the hideous creature behind him he
saw now that the things features werent
so badly mutilated as he had supposed
enough of the face was left to indicate
that its owner had once been handsome
and manly and young a girl had entered
the cellar and was standing beside it now
-the same girl wendell had seen at john
brants home a short time before

the detective went toward them gripped
the things hand thank god you came
when you did drayton he said fervent-
ly you saved me from a horrible death
you-he hesitated as he forced himself
to look again at that ghastly remnant of
a face-you werent killed in the jungle
after all

it was the girl who answered philip
cant talk very well yet she explained


dime mystery magazine

huskily no he wasnt killed as his en-
emies thought he had been he was res-
cued by a tribe of friendly indians be-
fore the ants finished him but even now
he hasnt fully recovered from his terrible
experience even now-her voice broke
-he imagines the awful insects are still
crawling on him and insists on dousing
himself with kerosene 

i understand wendell said gently
ive heard that people in tropical coun-
tries use kerosene to keep the horrible
little beasts away i-he tried to grin-i
was wishing for some kerosene myself
tonight

mary drayton shuddered and drew
closer to her husband as she glanced at the
unconscious form of the murderer on
the floor and to think george benton
planned all this she whispered to
think any man could be so cruel and
fiendish-

benton wendell interrupted that
isnt benton he stooped once more over
the black-clad figure ripped off the mask
the thin tanned features beneath were
distorted with fear and rage

wpaul lambert the girl
panted i-i cant believe it i
saw his body-

that was george bentons body you
saw upstairs in the library dave wen-
dell said grimly planting bentons corpse
there to be mistaken for his own was an-
other of lamberts tricks to keep every-
one from finding out he was the murder-
er he killed benton destroyed his face
to prevent recognition he then changed
clothes with the dead man knowing that
bentons body would pass for his since
they were both approximately the same
height and weight lambert you see
wasnt sure he could convince the police
that a supernatural killer had committed
the murders but he figured he could still
make a clean getaway by having it appear
that he himself was a victim of the killer

with paul lambert apparently dead he
could take the diamond he had schemed
so hard to get adopt an assumed name
and go to another country where he would
never be suspected

i fell for his gag myself at first
wendell continued harshly then i re-
membered the two threatening letters ben-
ton had showed me earlier in the evening
the one benton had received was worn
and frayed indicating it had worked on
his nerves so much that he had looked
at it countless times during the day the
other note-lamberts-had hardly been
handled at all in other words lambert
hadnt been terrified by the ominous warn-
ing in those letters because he was the
author of them himself i recalled too
how lambert had hung around the desk
all the time waiting to turn on the record
he had made of shaws voice i knew then
that lambert was the killer saw through
the devices he had used to shift suspi-
cion away from himself  

letters  mary drayton gasped de-
vices i-i dont understand

briefly wendell explained to her and
her husband the part of lamberts scheme
they hadnt heard the whole thing origi-
nated in the brain of a madman driven
insane with greed he added thank god
he didnt succeed

he bent again over the killer as he
talked found a hidden pocket inside of the
coat he drew out a small square box
flipped open the lid inside on a mound
of cotton rested a magnificent gem glit-
tering sparkling with dazzling radiance
it was the diamond the eye of light
but there was something sinister about
its loveliness something evil in its cold
scintillating beauty because of it three
men had died because of it still another
man-paul lambert-must go to his
death in the electric chair

yes it is evil dave wendell mur-
mured and yet good sometimes comes
out of evil he turned to mary drayton
terror has no face



saw her slim fingers tremble as he put the
great jewel in her hand i think i know
now why you wanted it so badly he said
softly i think i know why you told
me it meant everything in the world to
your husband 

we need it to make philip look like a
human being again she whispered
weve consulted a plastic surgeon who
is sure he can restore philips face through
a long series of treatment but those
treatments will cost a fortune we need
the diamond so that we can sell it and
pay for them   

tonight philip followed you to ben-
tons home because he suspected that
some scheme was afoot he ran away
after you saw him and came to find me
we decided we had to act quickly or we
might not get another chance to recover
the diamond those devils had stolen from
him you caught me going through

brants pockets and philip had to knock
you out so that we could continue our
search we went next to melvin shaws
house but we didnt find him at home-
for a very good reason as a last resort
we came here-and thank god philip
got down into the cellar just in time be-
fore that damnable fiend   

lets not talkabout it anymore wen-
dell interrupted kindly theres still a
little job for me to do its time lambert
was brought to justice-

he turned recoiled with a sick gasp
of horror as he stared at the unconscious
form of the killer grim poetic justice
was already being meted out to paul
lambert the ants they had crept out
of their shattered glass prison were
swarming over the fiends body lam-
berts own murder weapon had turned
against him he was dying as his vic-
tims had died-without a face

love me - and perish

by lyle d gunn

 little thought as i watched the
famous star commence her erotic
dance of doom that all too soon
my sweetheart would be in her place
-a willing partner to an invisible
monster come out from hell to
choose a victim for the devils tor-
ture mart

claire ladds dressing gown
fluttered to the studio floor and
the glare of the arc lights picked
out and accentuatedthe ravishing body
that had made her the idol of a million
men and long kept eldorado pictures out
of bankruptcy under the maze of girders
cables and overhead lighting equipment
the stage was set to represent an oriental
seraglio but no fabled caliph ever pos-
sessed so alluring a slave as the smoulder-
ing redhead who graced this jumbled
movie version of the arabian nights in
the glaring illumination even the sheen


love me--and perish

of her famous milk-white skin was height-
ened by her filmy costume the hollywood
version of a harem girls attire-an open-
fronted blouse that but partially hid the
swell of her firm breasts and failed by eight
inches of softly molded flesh of meeting
the silken pantaloons that hung low on
her voluptuous hips her full thighs
rounded and perfect seemed a natural
continuation of the alabaster amphora a
tall um-like vessel of peculiarly suggestive
shape before which she halted

again i had the feeling of imminent dis-
aster that had been growing steadily sharp-
er as we approached the last days shoot-
ing of this picture i could not even char-
acterize the danger i sensed all i knew
was that strange menace hovered over this
set and as my eyes sought out mary
boyne for once i wished that the girl
i loved were somewhere else

mary was claire ladds stand-in and
therefore wore the same revealing costume
but her refreshing sweetness and the clean
grace of her figure made it appear charm-
ing rather than suggestive i might have
been prejudiced for we were engaged to
be married whenever i rose from the
nonentity of an assistant director but i
found her far more attractive than claire
ladd

at last bogolowski the director tore
his pig-like eyes from the alluring body of
the nearly-nude star and signaled he was
ready for the take castelon rapped his
music rack to bring the studio orchestra
to attention and claire ladd dropped to
her knees before the alabaster amphora
ready to begin the dance that was the
climax of the picture and was supposed to
invoke the jinni in the bottle then it
was that abou malik the wealthy im-
porter who had consented to act as techni-
cal adviser on this production slowly
shook his head and as the black silk tassel
on his red tarboosh cast a flitting shadow
over his swarthy face he softly said it is
dangerous to trifle with these things  

   his eyes were on the alabaster amphora
and suddenly all my vague dread was crys-
talized it was the amphora from which
seemed to flow the aura of malignant
power i remembered the peculiar alive-
ness i had felt in its smooth stone when i
had helped quigley our ancient prop man
fill it with the chemical that was to simu-
late the materialization of the jinni and
suddenly the fantastic thought came to
me that perhaps it was in rapport with
some unearthly power malik who had
lent it to the studio from his private col-
lection had claimed it was actually a relic
of the second caliphate the fabulous age
of scheherazade and the caliph haroun
el raschid who could say where in
legend was the borderline between pure
myth and time-garbled truth  

   i attributed the vagaries of my mind to
the strain under which we had been work-
ing to finish the last two scenes today on
schedule then the cameras began to grind
and as the orchestra went into her number
and claire ladd started the exotic dance
my only thought was that i was glad it
was not mary who was kneeling and
gesturing before that alabaster symbol of
evil

   i did not know that all too soon my
sweetheart would be in claires place do-
ing that same dance before all these eyes
-and one more pair come out of hell to
choose a victim for a strange desire

jphe kneeling girls dance began with
a slow undulation of her torso that
rippled the soft conformation of her bare
waist and stirred even her firm breasts
into a subtly sensuous quivering she
added a snake-like writhing of her supple
arms then her contortions became still
more abandoned as her stomach muscles
shuddered and she slowly rose to her feet
swaying and undulating to the sensuous
rhythm of the music

   then each part of her body continuing
its unique provocative motion she slowly


dime mystery magazine

began to bend over the amphora through
the sheer pantaloons could be seen the
bunching of her thighs from the pull of her
lowering torso then her hand snaked
down to unstopper the amphora-and
abruptly stopped

her eyes widened with fear a sudden
dread seemed to grip her yet it was so
swiftly overcome by her troupers instinct
to go on that the pause was nearly im-
perceptible quickly she composed her
face reached down unstoppered the am-
phora and then i felt it-something evil
something malign something that came
out of hell through the narrow neck of
that sinister bottle

the very air seemed to throb with a
terrible destructive force but when i
flashed my gaze over those near me i saw
no surprise or fear on bogolowskis face
was an expression that might have been
satisfaction at the scene he was getting
for the rest-except abou malik who
was not to be seen-there was only desire
inflamed by the provocative spectacle
even old quigley showed it as he licked
his thin lips hungrily

yet it was with a sense of horror that i
watched the smoke billow from the bottles
neck rise sluggishly flatten and drop
into a spreading grey cloud on the floor
as the smoke continued to pour out the
cloud mounted higher seemed to grasp
claires legs venomously to claw at her
thighs in rage but any emotion she might
have felt was now well under control and
she continued to dance smoothly as the
curtain of smoke steadily rose before her
then as it suddenly thickened she was
completely hidden from view

i breathed a sigh of relief the scene was
over and nothing had happened

but why didnt bogolowski yell cut
the cameras still ground at that opaque
greyness and my forebodings returned
swiftly as it seemed suddenly to stir with
life to gather into a myriad of ectoplasmic
globules that shifted and writhed and

formed fantastic shapes and swiftly chang-
ing patterns for a second it seemed the
illusion persisted and then there was only
smoke again settling and thinning re-
vealing   

  god i can still hear the screams that
arose the hoarse cries the horrified
shouts for this shapeless flesh weltering
in blood this twisted figure with torn
breasts and ripped throat was all that re-
mained of claire ladd

cam gold eldorados president
climbed to the stage from which claire
ladds mutilated body had been removed
an hour before his manner was harried
his heavy-jowled face grey as he faced the
assembled cast and staff

  we must be practical he said tersely
even at the risk of being considered cal-
lous the continued existence of my com-
pany is at stake so are your jobs de-
spite this-accident the picture must be
finished today

  marys slender body trembled inside
the curve of my arm and from the others
except bogolowski rose a shocked mur-
mur but it soon changed to a chorus of
grudging agreement marred only by the
directors sharp how

  only the sequence in the cave is left
gold answered referring to a shooting
script that scene can be taken as a
medium long shot and if we keep the face
of the girl taking miss ladds place away
from the camera there need be only a
superficial resemblance he hesitated
we have such a person in miss boyne
a faint gasp came from mary and i
was already half out of my chair to pro-
test when gold swept on

  you may be sure i would not suggest
this he urged if i felt i were placing
anyone in danger granting that a murder
had been committed and that we do not
know by whom there is no reason to be-
lieve anyone else in danger from that per-
son  
love me--and perish



but was it a person that was my chill-
ing thought as abou maliks warning ran
through my brain again in an insidious
whisper it is dangerous to trifle with
these things i wished he had returned so
that i could ask what he thought of this
a girl killed without a sound heard or
anything but a patch of smoke seen by the
score of people within a dozen feet of
her

as for any other idea gold continued
as though he read my thoughts a woman
is not torn-is not killed without human
hands touching her in a few minutes the
film of that scene will be developed and
we can look at the rushes the inexpli-
cable will be explained i am sure by the
cameras less emotional eye   

he was right i supposed and i had
no right to deny mary this chance she
was eager for it now that she had gotten
over her reluctance to double for a dead
girl yet i could not shake off my dread
could not keep from feeling that there
was some connection between claire
ladds death and the sinister amphora
but at least that scene was done the
amphora was not used in the one in which
mary would play a little ashamed at
thus admitting to myself that i did fear
the thing i was still glad that mary
would not have to perform the ritualistic
dance of invoking the jinni

then it was that one of the men from
the developing room rushed through the
crowd caught gold as he was walking off
the set his agitated whisper cut through
the sudden silence the film must have
been exposed there was nothing on it
gold swore groans rose bogolowski
exclaimed then were licked

im damned if we are shouted gold
well still finish this picture today a
roar of approval went up as he issued his
order if it takes all night shoot both
scenes

only then did the full significance of
this accident strike me mary must re-

peat the dance that had brought claire
ladd a strange and brutal death i

tpor three hours bogolowski rehearsed
mary in the dance and for three hours
i struggled with a dilemma that kept
growing more frightening but never be-
came clearer unquestionably gold was
right and any other attitude was insane
but there was still this horrible thought
to torture me if the other the incredible
were true-mary was doomed i couldnt
risk it r

   in the end my change of feeling came
about paradoxically abou malik sudden-
ly was walking beside me as i paced the
floor nervously into my hand he thrust a
smooth dark object-like an amulet with-
out any inscription a charm against cer-
tain evils he said and quickly left my
side an instant later his tall figure passed
from the building out onto the lot and
suddenly i felt very foolish his melo-
dramatic manner and his charm had
cured me of my ridiculous fears

   but when they were ready for the take
i went to the stand at the side of the set
near mary but out of range of the cameras
that was just a precautionary measure
i had satisfied myself that there were no
trap doors in the stage floor but i was
going to stand where i could see behind
the screen of smoke

   then the take began and i was quickly
lost in admiration at marys performance
it did not have the heavy sensuality of
claire ladds but it seemed to strike
closer to the meaning of the dance she
actually seemed a devotee of some ancient
cult sincerely supplicating the jinni to
manifest himself that ring of authenticity
robbed the dance of all obscenity and as
she rose from the first kneeling position
before the amphora and her whole undu-
lating body was revealed i felt that this
was more than wanton exhibitionism
there seemed a real ritualistic significance
in the devotional entreating gesture with


dime mystery magazine

which she unstoppered the evil amphora

then i felt it again-some emanation
that spread from the amphora in great
powerful surges yet it was different
this time different in a way i could not
characterize until suddenly as if in re-
sponse to it a wave of sheer wantonness
seemed to sweep over mary

in a second she seemed to have a more
lavishly endowed more provocatively
shaped body than claire ladds and the
movements of that body changed at the
same time became slower but stronger
and more stirring seeming to pick up the
fierce deliberate rhythm of passions own
surge

one part of my brain said that she had
only been caught up by the spirit of the
dance the other shrieked that a demonia-
cal spirit had found her pleasing that she
was responding to his demand giving her-
self to a fate worse than claire ladds
god why didnt i listen to it and stop
her before it was too late but i poor fool
knew my thoughts were mad i could not
spoil the take which would be over in
another minute now that the smoke was
rising before mary and from where i
stood at the side i could see that no one
else nothing else stood behind the thick-
ening curtain a foot in front of her

she was safe i told myself the only
difficulty was with my imagination the
smoke once more seemed to be gathering
into misty shapes that swirled in exotic
patterns and strove avidly to press against
her body and she seemed to shudder with
ecstasy her thighs trembled her soft
waist swelled and flattened with her heavy
breathing her whole body began to
tremble-as if in the amorous embrace of a
lover god i was able to endure it only
because i knew it was smoke i was seeing
and there was a definite space between it
and mary as two separated things i
could see her pulsing white body and the
curtain of smoke two separate things
i could see them both

and then i could see only one the
madly gyrating smoke before my very
eyes mary had disappeared-as though
she had been erased   

rthe huge giddy clouds of multi-colored
a light that filled the sky slowly receded
back into my own brain and then i saw
that i was walking along upper holly-
wood boulevard it was nearly midnight
but the five hours since i had left the
studio were a blank to me i remembered
the first consternation when the lowering
smoke had shown the others what i knew
already the panic that had ensued as the
fruitless search went on the police their
questions the discovery that again the
films were mysteriously spoiled bogolow-
ski arguing with gold who had been called
back and at last convincing him that noth-
ing could now be done to finish the picture
on schedule everyone being kind to me
as together we left the lot for what i knew
was to be the last time

then i was alone thinking of it for the
first time and i remembered no more

and now my thoughts began to spin in-
sanely again as i faced the incredible
truth-mary was gone gone to the em-
brace of a creature of hell-born desires
and deathly corruption

i fought for a saner view but it was
difficult claire ladd was one matter
there were ways even if i could not say
how that she could have been killed but
mary had vanished into thin air and be-
fore she had disappeared with my eyes
upon her i had felt the perverting power
from the amphora seen marys passionate
response to the embrace of an invisible
lover

perhaps my subconscious mind was
directing my stumbling feet for i was
nearly to the eldorado lot when the wild
thought came to me where would mary
be but in the grotto where the jinni was
supposed to have transported her

it was insane but as i broke into a
love me-and perish

run i was cackling gleefully to my shaken
mind the thought seemed perfectly logical
and evident even after i had let myself
through the gates and was flying past the
false-fronted buildings of a frontier town
followed by an english village down a
street in montmartre at whose end stood
a plaster taj mahal and round a corner
through a section of the u s navy yard
it did not seem incongruous that on a
hollywood movie lot i should be seeking
the lair of a demon out of the legendary
arabian nights i slowed up as i passed
the studio building where the weird affair
had had its beginning quietly i opened
the door of the adjoining studio crept
toward the end where the artificial grotto
had been built

it was only partly roofed and as i en-
tered its narrow mouth far ahead i could
see the pale moonlight that pierced the
skylight of the building i went toward
it over a thick carpet of moss and gradu-
ally i made out the monstrous figures in-
cised on the wall the huge rocks at the
grottos end then standing beside them
i saw mary exactly as i had seen her
last with one sweep i took in everything
from her half-closed eyes to the unmarred
beauty of her profiled figure in the flimsy
costume that was not even rumpled she
was unharmed had not been touched

an exultant cry rose to my lips-but
was never uttered mary had tilted back
her head lifted her lips extended her arms
-as if in invitation but no one else was
there

incredulously i watched her torso arch
provocatively her body sway forward i
could not understand against this screen
of light there was nothing visible except
her body standing out in fine detail yet
she was seeking an embrace begging ca-
resses

suddenly the silk taut over the curve of
her breast was indented-by the print of
a mans hand the print but not the
hand 

derhaps i hadnt really been con-
vinced until that second all i know
is that with that physical evidence of a
hell-born being who was material yet in-
visible fear closed over my heart and
chilled its beating my breath oozed out
my strength trickled away the jinni
actually stood before mary the jinni
invisible yet capable of dimpling marys
breast with the touch of his hand capable
of fondling her of-god it was the hor-
ror of that thought which rooted me to
the ground made me look upon the weird
wooing as though in a trance

   the separate indentations made by the
monsters fingers slid together and i could
see her soft flesh firming at the touch-
flattening suddenly under a pressure that
could not be seen an ecstatic shudder
rippled marys body and she inched for-
ward her arms curving about empty space
as if enfolding a material lover

   my own hoarse shout snapped me out
of my trance and i lurched forward awk-
wardly what happened in the next split-
second seemed composed of many separate
events mary stiffened started to turn
a form shot past me marys turn was
arrested and the cloth across her waist
tautened as if a restraining arm had en-
circled her the figure ahead of me
stopped whirled faced me i saw sam
gold

   the first thought that flashed through
my mind was that gold though he had
no conceivable motive had staged this
whole weird affair that i had been mis-
taken in what i believed i had just seen
then i looked at mary again and her
provocative expression and sensuous ges-
tures could allow only one meaning the
jinni did exist and mary was mad with
desire for his unholy love   

   i sprang forward-but gold stepped in
front of me blocked my way i didnt
understand not until i really looked at
him for the first time in the dim light
i could see his eyes were black with hate


dime mystery magazine

and in his hand-he held a revolver

my god i cried you dont think
i-

he did think so his lips curved into
a sneer he believed me what i had for
a second thought him-a fiend who had
engineered these crimes and he was
raising the revolver to point at my heart

wait i shrieked look behind you
you dont understand-look behind you

mirthlessly he laughed for the jinni
-while you jump me his finger tight-
ened on the trigger  

god it was coming coming quickly
even as my eyes darted to mary for one
last look she was turned toward us and
no longer could i see the imprints of in-
visible hands on her but her eyes were
shifting as if watching something stalk
toward us   

i heard a click the revolver was
cocked i braced myself for the shot 

gold fired

but as he did his arm jerked down spas-
modically and the bullet hammered into
the grotto floor he had gone stiff all over
-as if in the bone-crushing grip of an in-
visible giant and without a hand that
could be seen touching his throat he began
to gag and his eyes bulged monstrously in
a face that quickly turned livid then black

something that had been pushed far
back in my mind made me plunge my hand
into my pocket for a small object there
but it was forgotten again in the horror
of what i next saw suddenly as if re-
leased from support golds body crashed
to the floor jerked convulsively once and
was still while from his mouth and nostrils
gushed rich claret blood then i felt the
first crushing agony of the death hold   

cubconsciouslyi must have been
 prepared for it for even as sharp
twinges of pain shot through my arms and
legs i was able to fall back a few steps
but the invisible force followed me pinned
me against the grotto wall and i felt as if

my entrails were being pulped as if my
arteries were swollen to the point of burst-
ing iron bands bound my chest and each
breath of air i sucked into my lungs was
a searing flame my head pounded and
from the excruciating pain deep inside of
me waves of blackness rolled up over my
brain this i thought is the end   

but i was to live for a far greater
agony

the pressure subsided and though i
retched violently i did not lose conscious-
ness but i could not move completely
paralyzed my body stood against the wall
while my dulled mind struggled to under-
stand why i had not been killed then i
understood when suddenly i saw mary
raise her arms once more saw her blouse
buffeted under an invisible touch the
monster had been too eager to return to
her

her thighs were bunching her torso
was inclining backwards bending her
waist into a voluptuous curve i could al-
most see the missing parts of the picture
the monsters hand in the hollow of her
back supporting her his vile body leaning
over her white form-causing that sud-
den flattening of her waist her hands
swept to her blouse tore it from her
gleaming flesh then she rose to her toes
and as her bare bosom was lifted and
arched provocatively--her meaning could
not be mistaken

god i even stopped struggling then fo
move my paralyzed limbs mary was lost
beyond recall the monster had complete
possession of her soul-as it would soon
her body then it was that mary straight-
ened for the first time stepped backward

wild hope fluttered in my breast-and
died as slowly languorously mary sank
down upon a bed of moss a sound that
was half sick horror and half impotent
rage filled my throat but i could not give
utterance to it

time lost all meaning and it might have
been one minute later or ten that again
love me--and perish



i became conscious of the amulet in my
knotted fist bitterly i thought that if it
were a potent charm if i did know how to
use it it was probably too late now-

   it was too late god i wished her
dead i thought i did-until suddenly she
moaned in pain and then i shrieked as
i saw her body stiffen her eyes begin to
bulge the monster had tired of her and
now was going to kill her-crush her to a
pulp like gold

   like a maniac i struggled to move and
when i had failed and marys face was
turning livid i actually became a maniac
for a moment blaspheming shouting in-
sanely screaming but i fell abruptly si-
lent when the blood began to trickle from
the comer of her mouth she was dying
fiercely i clenched my hands as if i
could hold her back i barely realized the
amulet had broken in my crushing grip
her color changed again her face became
black it was the end

   suddenly an acrid odor was all around
me i was breathing sharp fumes-the
paralysis was leaving me and as my
brain swiftly cleared i realized that the
broken amulet must have been a glass
capsule containing something to counter-
act a poisonous gas that had caused my
paralysis and killed gold and-mary

   on legs that were stiff from inaction i
stumbled across the grotto and the acrid
fumes seemed to have spread ahead of me
then i had mary in my arms and tears
filled my eyes-tears of joy as color slow-
ly crept back into her cheeks   

fpo me the most amazing thing is that
we knew how it was done before we
knew who did it when the amphora was

unstoppered a noxious gas was released
which was capable of causing unconscious-
ness and total loss of memory for a few
minutes during that time the fiend did
his work unseen it was one of his chemi-
cals poisonous in the free gaseous form in
which it was escaping from a broken con-
tainer stored in the grotto that had en-
dangered mary and me and killed gold
whose exertion as he ran past me had
caused him to breath deeper

it was not until the motive had been
discovered that we knew the villain had
been gold certain that the picture would
lose money and plunge him into bank-
ruptcy he had killed claire ladd for the
heavy insurance his company carried on
her mary he had intended to kill later in
the grotto to further the idea of a weird
inexplicable crime and to thoroughly com-
plicate the case

the invisible monster so far as i
will ever know was conjured by my wild
imagination solely from the stirring of
marys costume by currents of air and
her own amorous movements themselves
caused by drugs gold had given her
-but i wonder sometimes abou malik
remains an enigmatic figure he has never
been seen since he gave me the means of
saving us both even his priceless am-
phora he left behind why has he some
knowledge he is protecting us from   

often too often his words come back
to me it is dangerous to trifle with these
things

what really happened in the grotto
mary has never spoken of it and though
she is now my wife something-delicacy
and perhaps fear of the answer-makes
me hesitate to question her

horrors broken body

i still dont know how we made it
to the beach there was a devilish
undertow backing up against the coral
reef and we were swept back time after

time before we suddenly found ourselves
in the clear and riding a foam-edged
comber into the shore

i dragged marion up on the sands and
for awhile we stood there while she clung
to me sobbing with exhaustion then we
slowly started walking up the narrow


dime mystery magazine

strip of beach my arm around her waist

i kept glancing back over my shoulder
at the somber wall of vegetation which
loomed about us in the darkness like a
huge cupped hand flashes of lightning
split the sky at about two-second intervals
and the ghastly white light made the toss-
ing palm trees the huge-leaved bananas
and hibiscus plants with their pallid bell-
like flowers seem like the hysterical in-
habitants of a strange planet

but it was the intervals between flashes
which sent icy tremors vibrating up my
spine for as the blackness closed down i
could see bright pinpoints of light down
near the ground where the shadows were
thickest-fiery sparks which occurred al-
ways in pairs and seemed to my over-
wrought imagination to be pregnant with
infernal deadly significance

the eyes of beasts made phosphorescent
by the inky darkness undoubtedly they
would promptly retreat as we approached
them i knew that-but for some reason
they aroused something like an instinctive
terror in my heart

i looked out to sea and as the heavens
cracked open with a tremendous sheet of
vivid white fire i saw the last of the
gallant little yawl which had carried us
almost half-way around the world a giant
comber lifted it free from the coral reef
tossed it high on its crest-and then
brought it shatteringly down on its for-
ward strakes crushing it like an empty
pecan shell to be gulped into oblivion by
the succeeding roller

that was the last of the marion t

the hurricane had shipwrecked us on
an island which the compilers of my ad-
miralty charts had apparently never heard
of wed sighted it just before the storm
struck us and after figuring my bearings
i discovered the chart indicated a sounding
of  fathoms in the precise spot occupied
by this speck of land in the south pacific

the lightning showed a splintered sec-
tion of the forward hatch tossing about

in the surf i waded out and secured it
broke off half of one of the split boards
it made a fairly serviceable weapon-in
case those beasts in the bush were not
quite as harmless as i hoped they were
then with an arm about marions slen-
der drenched shoulders i started slowly
toward the tropical jungle which hemmed
us in

j battered a path for our stumbling
feet through dripping leaves bushes
and vines fortunately the undergrowth
was not as dense as it had seemed from
the beach and soon we emerged into a
practically open area which i was sur-
prised to see as the lightning flamed again
resembled a carefully cultivated park we
paused in the middle of it our shoulders
hunched against the driving rain clutching
each other like lost children-and again i
felt a tremor of weird foreboding race up
my spine

  we were completely encircled now by
those eerily luminous eyes as we stood
there i counted twelve pairs of them
ranged almost symmetrically about us
marion squeezed against me

  dont be afraid of them i howled
above the clamor of the tempest theyre
harmless wild dogs maybe-

  but i knew that was ridiculous these
oceanic islands are almost completely
without animals having been so long sep-
arated from the continents that all fauna
except birds bats and sometimes reptiles
have long since become extinct the an-
imals that are found are descendenis of
imported beasts it was unlikely that any-
one had imported dogs to an uncharted isle
in mid-pacific

  still-something was there and my
nerves got a shock as i suddenly realized
that the only reason i had mentioned the
possibility of their being dogs was because
the eyes seemed to be about dog-distance
above the ground actually they looked
much more like human than canine eyes
goddess of the half-world brood



my imagination was beginning to take
a dangerous turn i cursed myself and
holding marion closer forged straight
ahead across the clearing toward the pair
of eyes opposite they disappeared before
we had come within ten feet of them-and
the lightning showed a well-made gravel
path where they had been

oh look jim-a path marion ex-
claimed the islands inhabited

but i couldnt share her joy for some
reason i felt mysteriously reluctant to
meet the tenants of this lost unknown
islet  but i followed her as she slipped
from under my arm grasped my hand
and began running ahead

a minute or so later we saw the yellow
gleam of a lamp through the foliage and
shortly after that we came to the end of
the path and found a rambling but well-
made two-story cottage of bamboo stand-
ing in a large clearing

in what appeared to be the livingroom
of the place a single lamp glowed the
rest of the house was in stygian darkness
we stumbled up the steps onto the veran-
dah and i pounded resoundingly on the
door of solid oak panelling

there was no response i tried again
and still the silence of the place held save
for the steady drumming of rain on the
roof i glanced back into the darkness from
which we had emerged the twelve things
which had stalked us through the forest
were there in a semicircle thirty feet
from the porch steps their human-appear-
ing luminous eyes glaring at us steadily
as though in cold emotionless curiosity
and now as the lightning hissed again i
got a flashing impression of the bodies
behind those eyes-humped hairy masses
without recognizable contour but with the
same sort of indefinable humanness as their
eyes possessed

i hurled my club at them and turned
back to the door i tried the latch and the
door swung open

come on i said and pulled her in

jim do you think we ought to do
this- she began and then she
screamed horribly

she clutched my arm in a frenzy of ter-
ror and i saw it too

it was in the center of the floor-a thing
which a short time ago had been a human
body now it was an all but unrecognizable
mass of bloody tom flesh exposed man-
gled viscera and gleaming bones

quickly i turned marion about
guiding her around two sides of the
room i forced her into a chair on the far
side where a table blocked her view of the
thing then i yanked a batik covering
from the table and threw it over the mess

i saw the body was that of a native
probably a negrito from what remained
of the face the covering immediately be-
came blotched with the blood which seeped
through it

i looked around weighing in my brain
the advisability of searching the house in
the hope of finding a key to this grisly
mystery-and decided against it marion
would be in danger of hysterics if i left
her alone with that gruesome corpse i
went over and put an arm around her
shaking shoulders

brace up sweetheart i murmured
and she made an effort to control her sob-
bing poor girl plucky as the devil most of
the time her nerves had given way under
the tragedy of losing our gallant little boat
and now-this   

i heard the door open softly behind me
and whirled i found myself staring into
the barrel of a iarge-calibre pistol held un-
waveringly on my midriff by a deeply
tanned young man of about my own age

put up your hands he said

i did so promptly and then he saw
marion his gun half-lowered and hi
eyes came back to me what are you doing
in my house-and how did you get here 
he asked

we got here by being shipwrecked on


dime mystery magazine

the coral reef at the north end of the
island i said we found a path which
led to your house we were unable to
rouse anyone so i tried the door found it
unlocked and came in there is a dead man
lying there on the floor-

he said quite and thrust his pistol
back into its holster he came toward us
skirting the corpse without giving it a
glance and stopped in front of us

forgive my inhospitable gesture he
went on since no one has landed here
during the past ten years i was naturally
startled he held out a tanned hand my
name is richard wanderleigh

i took his hand mine is james towne
this is my wife

wanderleigh stared at marion an un-
necessarily long time it seemed to me
before he bowed and murmured some
banal acknowledgement of the intro-
duction only then did i realize that the
girl might as well have been naked for all
the protection her gown afforded her a
sheer silk one-piece dress it was all
she could stand aboard ship in those lati-
tudes and she wore nothing at all beneath
it the sandals on her feet being her only
other articles of clothing now drenched
by the seas we had fought through it clung
to her deliciously rounded slender body
like a coat of paint

if you have any dry clothing for my
wife- i suggested-a pair of ducks
and a shirt perhaps-

wanderleigh smiled i can do better
than that my sister would be delighted
to loan mrs towne a frock come with
me please

he picked up a lamp from the table lit
it and led the way into a corridor that
opened off the living room wanderleigh
himself was dressed in white shorts and
shirt and carried a pith helmet all of
which were dripping wet what had he
been doing out in this storm-while a
mangled body to which as yet he had
made no reference lay in his living room 

apparently his sister was not at home
he entered her room without knocking
opened a closet door revealing a number
of dresses

you are welcome to any of these
frocks mrs towne he said and again
his brilliant black eyes clung to the con-
tours of her figure in a manner that began
to make me see red we will await you
in the living room

we went back to the front of the house
and wanderleigh for the first time looked
down at the corpse on the floor

poor nara he murmured they got
him at last-just like the rest

a native of the island i asked i
was wondering what frightful thing had
happened to him

wanderleigh looked at me with a
strangely calculating expression in his
eyes this island has no natives he
said after a moment its been ift ex-
istence only about fifteen years volcanic
you know we too were shipwrecked
with a bakers dozen of a crew i had
chartered a junk to take us from rapa
island to the marquesas where we hoped
to catch a liner for england judging
from the size of the largest trees the
island had been in existence about five
years at that time the south end is
riddled with lava pits boiling soda pools
and is covered with pumice and volcanic
ash how there happened to be fertile soil
on this end god only knows probably
the island has emerged above the surface
of the ocean intermittently for millions
of years

i nodded it certainly didnt appear
on my charts i said that seems
strange too since they are supposed to
be revised every year

wanderleigh shrugged theyre re-
vised with respect to the main maritime
routes it would take the entire british
fleet five years to make a complete geodetic
survey of the two million square miles
occupied by the south pacific archipelagos
goddess of the half-world brood

 but here-lend me a hand with this
fellow will you  too bad your wife had
to see the mess  

      chapter two
      beasts of frightfulness

nphe body was in a condition which
made it difficult to pick up in one
piece in the end we gathered the grisly
cadaver in the covering i had thrown
over it and carried it outside

   it had stopped raining and with that
characteristic abruptness of tropical
storms the clouds were clearing away
and the moon was beginning to edge out
of the hurricane wrack at wander-
leighs direction we carried the body
about half a mile below the house and left
it on a small grass-tufted hummock

   burials are impossible here he ex-
plained the earth is only eighteen inch-
es deep below that there is soft rock
which the tree roots grow into and some-
how find nourishment anyway the jack-
als would dig up anything you buried-
and they dispose of it all the more quickly
if you leave it top-side where they can
get at it without any trouble

   i shuddered in spite of myself as we
left our gruesome burden on the mound
i turned and looked back before we had
gone more than a dozen yards-and al-
ready those twin glowing beacons were
beginning to appear in the undergrowth
near the cadaver

   but how did the jackals get here
if-

   wanderleigh cleared his throat as
a matter of fact he said with queer hesi-
tancy i dont know what they are they
look something like jackals-and also
like something else i have a theory that
some zoological expedition was wrecked
on this island before we were and that
these beasts picked up god knows where
are the only survivors   

it was obvious to me that wander-

leigh had no faith whatever in his alleged
theory-but somehow i didnt feel like
pressing the matter instead i changed
the subject

i hope im notbeing unduly inquisi-
tive i said but i was wondering where
your sister is isnt it dangerous for her
to be out-with these beasts on the
prowl 

oh they never attack you-unless
youre asleep or dead wanderleigh ex-
plained carelessly apparently they
caught nara snoozing on the verandah
i dragged him inside and went gunning
for the beggars i still have a few bullets
left but ordinarily i hate to use them
on the beasts theyre extraordinarily
hard to hit and as they become more
numerous-

he stopped suddenly biting off the last
of his sentence as if he had said too much
i looked at him and noticed how white
and drawn his face looked but perhaps
that was only the effect of the moonlight

 more numerous  i echoed then
they have been multiplying since they
landed here 

wanderleigh laughed shortly yes
he muttered i guess you would call it
that    but you were asking about my
sister she went out too-east while i
went west she should be back soon 
he hesitated a minute and then went
on and while we are on the subject i
may as well prepare you for sicily-my
sister she is-well rather a strange
girl dont put too much faith in the
things she may tell you im afraid that
our enforced isolation has had an unfor-
tunate effect on her mind and she is be-
ginning to have strange fancies   
what a pity i murmured but prob-
ably when you get her back to civiliza-
tion again-

i left the sentence unfinished as we had
reached the front door-and at my words
wanderleigh turned suddenly and looked
at me for a moment in silence while a


dime mystery magazine

faint smile curved the thin lips beneath
his short black mustache

   oh-quite he said at last with un-
mistakable sarcasm in his tone then he
opened the door and ushered me into the
living room with a slight bow

titarion had put on a plain blue
 dress and looked fresh and relaxed
the recuperative powers of women are
marvelous-especially when they are giv-
en the chance to don fresh clothing

   hello she greeted us im-im
glad youre back i felt that she carefully
avoided looking at the bloodstains on the
carpet

   wanderleigh smiled at her you look
charming mrs towne

   i hope your sister doesnt mind she
said

   wanderleighs smile became a bit twist-
ed rfas a matter of fact she has peculiar
ideas regarding her costumes nowadays
he murmured i have just been warning
your husband mrs towne that my sis-
ter has developed a few odd idiosyncra-
sies during the past few years this utter
isolation you know-

   oh murmured marion im so
sorry-

   she was interrupted by an infernal
clamor which suddenly arose apparently
just outside the cottage the next instant
the front door burst open to admit the
slender sun-browned figure of a girl
clad solely in a sort of brassiere and girdle
of what i took at first to be white fur-
but which i subsequently learned was
made of the breasts of small white birds
cured and cleverly stitched together the
girl carried a long leather whip in one
hand she whirled about and slammed
the door shut falling back against it as
though to brace it against the attack of
some pursuer-and an unearthly howl
arose outside

   damn you dick she began you
fed them that- and then she noticed

marion and me for the first time and fell
suddenly silent

we have visitors my deaf purred
wanderleigh mr and mrs towne
they have been making a world cruise on
their yawl which unfortunately came to
grief on the coral this evening

the girl had a wild indescribable beau-
ty taller than marion she was as ex-
quisitely if more voluptuously formed
the outside comers of her dark eyes had
an upward tilt which gave her a slightly
oriental appearance the tips of her
small ears exposed by her tossed-back
raven hair came almost to a point-like
a fauns her full breasts only half-cov-
ered by the downy bandeau rose and fell
with the violence of her breathing

the girls eyes widened as she stared
at us for several moments in silence then
oh my god she murmured in a low
husky voice two more  

my dear put in wanderleigh quickly
calm yourself theyre quite safe as
you see

but somehow his remark seemed hardly
appropriate to her exclamation she turned
on him suddenly

theyre not safe she cried none
of us is safe-not after the shrouds have
eaten human flesh i cant handle them
any more god only knows if i ever will
be able to now why did you do it you
knew i pulled naras body inside the
house so they wouldnt scent him and come
-you knew that but the minute my
back was turned you took him out where
they could get at him youve ruined them
oh damn you

the girls voice broke on a sob then
suddenly she wheeled jerked the door
open again she sprang outside and
slammed the door shut behind her

involuntarily i started forward and
marion jumped from her chair with a
startled cry

wanderleigh calmly stepped in front of
me with his hand uplifted see here i
goddess of the half-world brood

protested we cant jlet her go out there
with those beasts-

heavens no exclaimed marion do
go out and get her-please-

its quite all right said wanderleigh
in a soothing voice please dont worry
about her for a moment she always acts
like this when one of the men has been
attacked-or died and been eaten by the
things the poor child has formed a
strange affection for the beasts and re-
fuses to believe that they have ever at-
tacked a human being she would much
prefer to believe that i had killed them
all and strangely enough the things
seem to reciprocate her feeling for them
ordinarily they fawn upon her like big
dogs and obey her with an intelligence
that is weirdly human-although they al-
ways become a bit intractable after they
have-dined-as they have tonight
good heavens breathed marion and
sank back in her chair

something in wanderleighs atti-
k- tude told me that he would resist
with physical force any persistence in
my attempt to get out to the girl not
wanting to precipitate a crisis unless it
were really necessary i went to a window
and looked out

in the moonlight in front of the house
a strange scene was being enacted the
girl stood in the center of a ring of cring-
ing beasts-the animals she had called
shrouds they had stopped their in-
fernal howling but now and then one of
them would turn toward the house as
though about to slink off toward it at
that her whip would flick out and the
animal would jump back toward her
whining with its tail between its legs
she seemed to be talking to them and
gradually they quieted down entirely
squatting or lying in a ring around her
as if listening intently to her words

for the first time i had a good view
of the beasts and i could understand

both wanderleighs reference to them as
jackals and his reluctance to insist on
such a designation for them actually they
were much larger than any jackal and
their bodies were thicker in proportion to
their length especially across the shoul-
ders their heads although terminat-
ing in a typically pointed jackal snout
were wider across the cheek bones and
deeper from cranium to jaw on the
whole they resembled what might result if
an ape were successfully crossed with a
wolf

  as i watched the weird tableau the
term the girl had applied to them again
crossed my mind shrouds shrouds are
the clothing of dead men why did she
call them that  i have often wished i had
never learned   

  the next morning marion was too list-
less and drowsy to get up but the heat
drove me from bed early as no oneelse
seemed to be about i made myself a cup
of tea-which wanderleigh i learned had
succeeded in cultivating on the island
-and went for a stroll heading for the
south where my host had said the volcanic
formations were

  naturally the island looked entirely
different than it had during the night and
the storm it was a riot of color and light
-but somehow its air of other-worldliness
its mysterious faculty of seeming a bit
of land from some strange planet re-
mained this island harbored some dark
secret of which i had no hint as yet i
knew that and itched to get at the root
of the puzzle as soon as possible i swore
to myself that i would

  it was one of those resolutions cheer-
fully and easily made with which we
bolster our egos when confronted with
an enigma but a wiser more intuitive
part of my brain was whispering that i
would be happier if i curbed my curiosity
naturally i disregarded that   

  my mind was full of the weird spec-
tacle i had witnessed last night in the


dime mystery magazine

moonlit dooryard of the house-sicily
wanderleigh taming her fearsome shrouds
-when suddenly i rounded a huge volcan-
ic boulder and came upon the actors in
that strange drama

   the same actors-but an entirely dif-
ferent scene this time sicily lay
stretched in the sun lying on a little green
hummock while one of her ugly pets
dozed with its shaggy head resting on her
bronzed right thigh the rest cavorted
about like ungainly puppies at play wres-
tling rolling on the ground and chasing
each other about sicilys dark head rest-
ed on her clasped hands and she would
have appeared asleep except that she was
humming a strange wild tune which rose
and fell on the still morning air like the
sound of a distant brook murmuring over
pebbles and treet roots

chapter three

the fire-god speaks

tt was only a moment before the near-
est shroud saw me he leaped to his
feet and came stalking stiffly toward me
while a savage growl rose from deep in
his throat i thought of the condition in
which we had found naras body and
tensed my muscles but at the sound
of the animals growl sicily looked up
then got to her feet she called out sharp-
ly to the beast which was making for me
and the thing slowed to a halt then with
seeming reluctance turned about and went
back toward her

   come on she said to me they wont
bother you

   but i kept a vigilant eye on the beasts
as i advanced they had closed in around
her in an attitude of protection and there
was a gleam of unmistakable venomousness
in their eyes which did nothing to strength-
en my faith in their harmlessness i real-
ized that just one of them could if he
wished make mince-meat of an unarmed
man in considerably less than a minute

their paws were armed with claws as big
as a grizzlys and the huge canine fangs
which showed beneath their lower jaws
looked as though they could have ripped
my throat with a single slash 

apparently sensing my distrust of her
pets sicily turned and spoke a few words
to them in an authoritative tone and as
i drew nearer they slowly slunk off into
the jungle of greenery at the foot of the
hummock casting baleful glances back at
me over their shoulders

sicily resumed her former position on
the ground and motioned for me to sit
down beside her

do you like our island she asked
carelessly

its very attractive i said without a
great deal of enthusiasm

i hope you will learn to like it very
much-because you will probably be here
for a long time unless of course the
sea suddenly decides to swallow it up
again

i suppose there is always a chance of
that

 sicilys slender all but naked body rip-
pled into action as she restlessly rose to a
sitting posture and clasped her arms
about her knees she was silent for sev-
eral moments gazing abstractedly off into
the bush where the shrouds had disap-
peared

theres a much worse danger than
that she said finally my brother you
must watch him

i looked at her quickly would you
mind explaining

she turned the perfect oval of her face
toward me and i saw that her strange
tilted eyes held plumbless depths of
tragedy

he has already killed thirteen men
she said in a low voice and for years has
been trying to drive me insane some-
times i think he has succeeded

good god are you sure he murdered
all those men
goddess of the half-world brood



she nodded and her eyes again sought
the jungle we left england in dicks
schooner twelve years ago when i was
sixteen we shipped with a crew of
twelve men you will be safer if i dont
tell you the purpose of our voyage final-
ly we got to tuamotu and picked up
nara the negrito boy as a general rousta-
bout dick didnt kill him until yesterday
because he has been useful about the place
we got caught in a hurricane and a
water-spout flung our ship on the reef
we all landed safely and managed to sal-
vage practically all the ships gear and
stores as well as the-the thing we had
come down here for then it began-the
killings i mean

first chips the carpenter died that
is he disappeared the next day two
of the seamen were missing then the
cabinboy the cook and the quartermaster
all but nara were gone inside of two
months and there was never a sign of
what happened to them but as they disap-
peared the shrouds began to be noticed
it seemed that as the number of men
decreased the shrouds became more nu-
merous a terrible superstition grew out
of that-arid the last men to disappear
were sure that some weird magic of the
island was turning them into beasts then
anderson the mate died in horrible agony
he was poisoned i think the rest were
probably thrown into the lava pits he
was the only one i saw actually die-
and he was the last of the white men  

she paused a long time and when she
spoke again her voice was so low as to
be almost inaudible he said that all
the men had been secretly in love with me
and that i had known it he accused me
of being a witch-of turning them into
beasts he cursed me and called me-
circe 

irce-the siren of ancient greek
 mythology who changed her lovers
into wolves and lions who transformed

the followers of odysseus into swine  
i wanted to smile at this idea of a modem
reincarnation of the ancient fraud-but
somehow i couldnt

actually you think it was your brother
who killed these men but what reason
could he have had

one of the best reasons in the world
she said getting lithely to her feet but
i dont intend to tell you what it was not
yet at any rate

she started to walk off in the direction
the shrouds had taken then she suddenly
stopped and turned around

was there anything salvaged from
your ship she asked

i shook my head not a thing but our-
selves

you had a sextant aboard of course it
might have been washed over the reef and
come ashore

its possible naturally i havent been
down to the beach yet

dick has she said i saw him wade
out and get a box about a foot square and
eight inches deep could that have been
the sextant 

its quite possible i kept it in a wal-
nut box about that size

sicily bit her lip and seemed on the
point of saying something else then ap-
parently she changed her mind turned
back toward the jungle and walked into it
swiftly disappearing without a backward
glance i heard a few muted animal yelps
and the sound of several bodies moving
about in the undergrowth then the slight
rustlings died away in the distance and i
was left alone in the silence of the tropical
morning   

the first tremors began as i was walk-
ing back to the house after my strange talk
with sicily they brought me to a stand-
still with my heart in my mouth it
wouldnt take much of an earthquake to
wipe an island of this size out of existence
-and we were helplessly marooned on it
hundreds of miles from the next island


dime mystery magazine

and thousands of miles from civilization

a muffled boom sounded faintly behind
me and i whirled about in time to see a
solumn of black smoke ascend rapidly into
file sky and then mushroom out into a
gigantic black flower over the southern
end of the island

i started for the house at a dead run-
and hadnt taken a dozen strides when the
world seemed to move sideways under my
feet and i was thrown to the ground with
stunning force as i got to my feet the
sound of low rumblings came apparently
from deep in the earth and another ex-
plosion boomed out behind me

i knew from past experience with vol-
canic earthquakes that this was going
to be a serious one the shocks were com-
ing at two- or three-second intervals and
rapidly increasing in force i fell a half-
dozen times before i finally reached the
house which was still intact and burst
in at the front door i shouted marions
name at the top of my voice-and received
no answer i dashed upstairs to the bed-
room we had occupied-and found it
empty i was about to leave when i no-
ticed a thing which brought me to a
breathless halt on the doorsill

marions clothes were still neatly piled
on the back of a chair as she had left
them the night before the bed was a
riot of disordered blankets and sheets-
and beside it on the floor lay the night-
gown which she had borrowed from sici-
lys supply it was ripped from neck
to hem

the severest shock of all came then
and i had to hold onto the jamb to keep
from being thrown to the floor the house
swayed as though in a high wind and
joists cracked like fireworks i staggered
down the stairs and suddenly the beams
supporting the ceiling gave way the walls
swayed inward the staircase behind me
collapsed and i had just time to get out
of the door when the house folded up like
a paper bag and crashed to the ground

it had not been more than five minutes
since the first quake but already the skies
were becoming overcast a wind was com-
ing up bending the palm trees and scat-
tering a shower of ashes and pumice from
the exploding volcano all over the island
i stood looking at the ruins of the house
for a few stupefied moments trying to
decide what direction to take in my search
for marion but i had not the faintest
clue to work on i shouted her name re-
peatedly but the noise of the wind and
the approaching cataclysm made my yells
all but inaudible even to my own ringing
ears

i was frantic with indecision but at last
i decided on a plan having no idea of
where to look for marion the best thing
i could do would be to start a systematic
search of the entire island god only
knew if it would remain above the surface
of the ocean long enough for me to cover
half of the territory which would have to
be explored but it was the only course of
action that seemed to have the slightest
chance of bringing success

i plunged directly into the jungle head-
ing east from the house intending to keep
on until i reached the beach on that side
of the island then make a circuit of the
north end and work back  south criss-
crossing through the brush it was clear
enough that wanderleigh had kidnaped
marion and i cursed my negligence in
leaving her unguarded in the house of a
homicidal maniac-but of course i hadnt
any idea of what he really was when i left
the place that morning

as i fought my way through the jungle
the shocks continued with gradually
increasing force and the wind rose stead-
ily the thicket was in an uproar with
bats stirred from their daylight slumbers
fluttering about blindly in the tree-tops
time and again i was thrown to the
ground or forced to cling to a swaying
tree trunk as terrific shocks shook the
goddess of the half-world brood

island already i could hear the acceler-
ating beat of the surf licking ferociously
at the shoreline as if in eagerness to beat
it into oblivion

then simultaneously i emerged into a
small clearing and the shocks subsided
this i knew would probably be no more
than a brief intermission and i could ex-
pect even more violent tremors to follow
it but it gave me a chance to get my
bearings

i was about to strike off through the
other side of the clearing when suddenly
one of the shrouds appeared directly in
my path the beast came to a halt and sat
back on its haunches regarding me grave-
ly for a moment then it turned to the
right and began to walk off i started on
in my original direction-and instantly the
shroud turned about and came running
after me i whirled to protect myself
expecting an attack but the beast merely
turned again and started off in the direc-
tion it had first taken halting after a
few steps to look back at me

as plainly as though it had spoken i
saw that it wanted me to follow it i played
a hunch then and walked over to it the
animal immediately sprang into the bush
with me close behind it

straight to the south the shroud led
me through jungle across occasional open
spaces and over rocky black outcroppings
we skirted a small lake which had been
formed within the past few minutes when
a landslide had dammed off a creek and
presently reached the foot of a rugged
black escarpment at the foot of which
stood sicily and the rest of her ferocious
looking pets

hello she greeted me calmly do you
think this is the end

im not sure i said but fm afraid
it is well know-if were still alive-
within a half-hour or so have you seen
marion-my wife

she looked at me for a long time with-
out speaking then at last you love

her very much dont you she asked
quietly

yes of course

you would like to return with her to
-the outside

i laughed shortly theres a fine
chance of that but naturally i would
like to be near her when this speck of
land begins to slide into the sea

 she fell silent again gazing at me with
her weirdly beautiful eyes-and there was
something in her expression which began
to make me feel vaguely uneasy then
suddenly she came up to me and slipped
her brown rounded arms about my neck

listen she said i have never known
what love is i have always been afraid
of it my brother-and the men who died
-they have made it seem a horrible night-
marish thing my brother knew what
those men thought-he knew of their
belief that i was a witch a circe who
changed men into beasts he has pretended
to believe that himself all these years he
wanted to convince me that it was true-
to drive me mad he doesnt dare kill me
as he killed those men for he knows that
the shrouds would tear him to pieces
he found a treasure before we were ship-
wrecked and he wants it all to himself
he has built a boat-he thought secretly
but i came upon him many times unsus-
pected and saw him at work on it he
needed only a sextant to guide him over
the ocean-and now he has that the one
that was on your ship he is ready to sail
-and he is taking your wife with him-

i cursed aloud and grasped the girls
wrists damn his soul where are they
tell me i

i took her by her slender shoulders
and shook her violently she looked up at
me with a sad slow smile then she gently
freed herself from my grip the shrouds
had growled menacingly as i shook her
and now they closed in about us looking
up at me with baleful lights in their eyes
and showing their fangs in savage snarls

       chapter four
       the pit of doom

tut she didnt for a moment she
stood before me with her eyes upon
the ground at her feet her young breast
rising and falling swiftly then suddenly
she turned around so that her smooth
back was toward me and said in a barely
audible voice come

the pack of shrouds sprang ahead of
her leading the way up a narrow trail
which ran along the escarpment and i fol-
lowed silently raging at the slowness of
the pace would we get to this boat of
wanderleighs before he had time to
weigh anchor

the path ascended steeply for awhile
then suddenly broadened out into a wide
ledge in the side of the cliff a narrow
cleft showed a faint yellow light our
weird cavalcade came to a stop and sicily
pointed into the cleft

in there she said

i brushed past her abrupt in my eager-
ness and entered the crevice-only to
come to a startled halt as an eerily beauti-
ful sight met my eyes beneath my feet
a narrow path fell steeply away to a little
lagoon enclosed in a vaulted cavern at the
far end of which daylight showed faintly
tossing on the agitated surface of the
lagoon was a tiny queerly shaped boat
bearing a single mast rigged with a small
gaff-mainsail and jig both of which had
been sheeted home and hung flapping list-
lessly two lanterns stood on boulders
near the water illuminating the scene-
and now from behind the rock which sup-
ported them came a man his arms loaded
with objects which i could not distinguish
clearly from that distance i started to
descend cautiously

    wanderleigh deposited his burden on
the cambered deck of his curiously con-

structed boat and again disappeared be-
hind the boulder by the time he reap-
peared i had reached the bottom of the
path and was waiting for him his arms
supported a large crate which he imme-
diately dropped as he saw me

wheres my wife damn you i said

instead of answering he snatched the
pistol which hung at his right side
snapped it up and fired the bullet struck
me in the right shoulder and flung me
back against the boulder he fired again
but missed near as he was to me he had
time to pull the trigger once more before
i was on him but the hammer clicked
harmlessly on an empty chamber

he slashed at me with the revolver butt
as i closed with him laying open the
scalp over my right eye for several inches
we crashed to earth with me on top i
had only my weight to hold him as my
right arm was useless i swung at his jaw
with my left but missed as he dodged and
caught him in the right temple instead

wanderleigh screamed like a woman
he tried to fling himself sideways and
struck at me again with the butt of his pis-
tol hitting me in my wounded shoulder
the pain made lights dance crazily in
front of my eyes and i knew that if i
didnt get him within the next few seconds
he would have me licked

with an effort which nearly cost me
consciousness i managed to force my right
arm into a position where i could clutch
his hair with my hand then once more
i swung my left fist this time i connect-
ed squarely with his jaw and felt his
body go limp beneath me

i sprang up and staggered to the boat
which floated flush against the rocky ledge
of the shore in deep water i pulled
myself aboard and descended a compan-
ionway leading down into the cabin there
bound hand and foot lay marion on a
bunk she cried out joyfully as she rec-
ognized me and i began fumbling with
the ropes about her ankles
goddess of the half-world brood



   darling-are you hurt badly let
me-

   no he got me in the shoulder-
missed the bones i think cut my scalp a
little

t had her free in a couple of minutes
and she insisted on bandaging me up
with some gauze we found in a foot-
locker

   you stay here i said when she had
finished ive got to go back and get that
girl and wanderleigh well keep him tied
up until we make a port-then im going
to bring murder charges against him tell
you about it later i ran up the companion
-and came to a shocked halt as i hit the
deck

   instead of the unconscious man i had
left on the shore there was now a grue-
some bloody corpse-such a corpse as
marion and i had found the night before
lying in the middle of the wanderleighs
living room while i was below the
shrouds had come down here and   

   there was no sign of the beasts now
they had done their bloody work and dis-
appeared i seized the cadaver by one
ankle and hauled it behind the boulder
where it would be out of sight when i
brought sicily down then i started back
up the trail

   as i reached the opening to the grotto
the second series of tremors began i hesi-
tated for a moment was i justified in
risking marions safety by not putting
to sea immediately then i caught sight
of sicily down below in the ravine i
shouted to her and began running down
the path

   she stood in the midst of her beasts
waiting for me the animals milling rest-
lessly about her

   come on sicily i said were real-
ly in for it this time this island may
blow itself apart any minute-

   she shook her head and put her hands
behind her back as i reached for a wrist
no she said im going to stay here

damn it you cant stay here i tell
you the islands going under youll be
blown up or drowned-

she shook her head again the tremors
began to come more rapidly and increase
in strength i decided there was no more
time to waste on words i grabbed her
and swung her up in my arms turned to
start back up the trail

instantly the shrouds leaped for me
one grabbed the heel of my boot and near-
ly threw me the rest blocked my path
growling savagely

sicily call off those brutes i de-
manded weve got to get out of here

she smiled up at me faintly and shook
her head again they wont let me go
she said you might as well put me
down

another shock hit the island and i
fell to my knees still holding sicily but
she immediately struggled out of my grasp
i got to my feet and lifted her up

good-bye she murmured and slipped
her arms about my neck her lips met
mine and clung i held her smooth slen-
der body close for a long moment then
she broke away from me and fled down
the ravine followed by her beast pack
she stopped for a moment as she reached
the entrance she turned and waved brief-
ly then quickly disappeared around the
wall of the escarpment with a wild bitter
emotion i dared not name raging in my
heart i turned and made my way labori-
ously back up the path

the little boat stood out to sea in a
quartering puffy wind the waves were
high and broken as in a circling storm
and giant peaks of water would suddenly
pile up without warning and threaten to
swamp us i pulled in as close to the wind
as i dared striving to pull directly away
from the land-which was of course the
chief source of danger

within the past five minutes a great cone
had arisen at the extreme southern tip of
the island and from its mouth there


dime mystery magazine

belched a solid column of fire which lit
the sea for miles with a weird infernal
glow it was necessary to skirt that end
on the first tack and it brought us closer
than was comfortable to the flaming cone
i kept a narrow watch on it-and that
was how i happened to witness the ghastly
drama which took place on the blackened
hillock to the right of it

tctrom the glimpse i had caught of it
while on the path leading up the
face of the escarpment i knew that it was
no true hillock but the side of a small
crater in the center of which raged and
tossed a lake of boiling lava the molten
rock cast an eerie green and yellow light
upwards which illuminated several fig-
ures standing along its western rim i
called marion to take the wheel and turned
my whole attention to that group on the
lip of the crater

    the distance was great but i knew
that it was sicily-and twelve other be-
ings-who stood there etched by the weird
light into high relief against the smoke-
curtained sky but a curious change had
taken place-so that i could not be sure
that my eyes were not playing tricks

as i watched i felt an icy hand closing
about my heart and unconsciously my
arm rose in a gesture of protest against
what i sensed was about to happen-what
i sensed was inevitable

the girls arms raised slowly above
her head and she stood poised there for
a minute her nude slender form painted
in shimmering greens and yellows by
the sulphurous flames below her then
suddenly her body arced forward-and
launched into space

a small geyser of flaming lava sprang
into view-and subsided i covered my
eyes with my hand for a moment and when
i looked again i saw sicilys twelve weird
companions plunge downward and in
that next instant twelve small geysers
leaped up   

it was many moments before i had the
strength to go back to the wheel and when
i did marion whose intense preoccupa-
tion with the handling of the ship had mer-
cifully saved her from witnessing what i
had just seen looked at me with anxiety
written on her face

what is it jim she said dont
you think we have a chance 

go below marion i muttered make
everything fast weve got a chance-but
things are going to happen and damned
soon too

as if to verify that a terrific rumbling
arose seemingly from the very bottom
of the sea and a huge wall of water rose
off our port bow quickly i lashed the
wheel and lowered the mainsail furling
it on the boom then i went forward and
took in the jib next i freed all the stays
and sheets unstepped the small mast
wanderleigh had built a couple of sup-
ports fitted with straps and i hoisted the
mast onto these so that it lay along the
deck on the port side i buckled the heavy
straps over the mast and went back to
the wheel

wanderleigh had built his little boat
well-for the purpose he had had in
mind it was completely turtle-decked
and with the hatch battened down would
be as streamlined as a submarine about to
submerge and that as he had foreseen
was precisely what it was going to do if
the island sank

the wind now appeared to be coming
from every direction at once and i
couldnt tell whether we were bearing
down on the island or going away from
it but enough was occurring on the
island itself to drive consideration of
everything else out of my mind for a
moment i forgot about the boat

suddenly the crater-iake into which
sicily and her followers had disappeared
boiled over at the same moment the
new cone next to it emitted a blast of fire
steam and smoke which seemed to cover
goddess of the half-world brood



the whole sky-and a tremendous livid
crack appeared in its side out of which
poured a torrent of flaming lava

   the air quivered with terrific detona-
 tions-and abruptly a portion of the
 islands surface at least five acres in ex-
 tent leaped into the air propelled by a
 torrential column of billowing steam and
 lava

 the end was approaching i went be-
 low and battened down the hatfch i lay
 down on the bunk beside marion and used
 the leather thongs attached to it to strap
 us in if we were still living at the end
 of the next few minutes we would be
 safe 

  

 but it was nearly an hour before i dared
 venture above-decks in that time the ship
 had tossed madly gone on her beams ends
 and turned completely over more than
 once but she had lived never breaching
 a seam or shipping a pint of water and
 the mast was still in its brackets when i
 came on deck in fact i could find no
 part of the little craft that had not

withstood the fury of the tormented sea

all signs of the island had disappeared
except in the distance some floating
wreckage-perhaps up-rooted trees or oth-
er refuse of the cataclysm the seas were
still high and faint rumblings came from
deep beneath the boat at wide-spaced in-
tervals i stepped in the mast and sheeted
home the jib the wind had steadied but
it was still too strong to risk hoisting the
mainsail i sat at the wheel and looked
back over my shoulder at that floating stuff
far astern

i cannot tell you all the thoughts that
came to me then-but this i will tell you
and you may believe or not just as you
wish

i said before that after sicily had
leaped to oblivion in that lake of boiling
lava her companions had cast themselves
into it after her there were twelve of
them as i have said and they were there
with her-but they were not shrouds if
some strange fantasy of my brain did not
distort my vision it was not a dozen
beasts who leaped to death after their
mistress   

it was twelve men

it was a hot august and i was driv-
ing a bakery truck i got the job in
june when i was graduated from
college on the hottest afternoon of them
all i parked the doughnut truck on wall
street and went up to the air-cooled of-
fices of wallace brown and gaines to


dime mystery magazine

pire state sat behind the big mahogany
idesk with a white handkerchief carefully
tucked into his breast-pocket

you look like a bruiser dad said
appreciatively if i didnt know better
id say your family had been driving
trucks since the civil war

i stretched my bare arms that air-
conditioning felt good driving trucks
doesnt support a wife i told him and
its a wife im after terry ramsay to be
exact so i came to ask you about that
hundred shares of standard cereal i
bought last year

a startling change came over dads
face that doesnt happen often and when
it does it means somethings up your
stocks have gone crazy he said tersely
along with everybody elses stocks he
was silent for a minute looking at me as
though i were a business proposition
which surprised me id never been that
to dad even after i got out of school
with his millions behind and ahead of me
hed refused to give me a job in the firm
chet wallace just wasnt the kind whod
have even his own son grubbing on him

ronnie he said as last in a flat
heavy voice im thinking youre just
what i need around here you look like
a man which is more than i can say about
anyone ive had business with for a long
time for your information the market
is practically on the verge of collapse and
theres no reason for it except that people
have gone wild wild and panicky and i
cant tell you why take that ass harry
gaines for instance-my own partner-
bought two hundred shares of atlantic
copper three days after the newspapers
announced that atlantic was going into
bankruptcy hes crazy-dangerously
crazy all over the country these fools
are playing hopscotch with the nations
finances and i cant handle em ronnie
maybe-if i took you into the firm-you
could check up on whats going on

for a minute i thought one or the

other of us had gone queer with the heat
understand for twenty-two years id
been brought up to think that my fathers
position was none of my business that id
have to make my own way up i felt the
way any kid truck-driver would have felt
if a big-time financier had offered him a
big-time job just-floored by the luck
of it

i guess i enthused pretty incoherently
because dads heavy lips went grim and
he said its not going to be fun thats
not why i want you theres something
damned wrong around here and nobody
in the street can find out what it is may-
be an outsider a hard-handed day laborer
like yourself can get to the bottom of it
i cant exhibit a will be harry gaines
hes what youre supposed to bring
around do it and ill buy you a seat on
the stock exchange for a wedding pres-
ent

bringing harry gaines around didnt
sound like a tough assignment id known
him since i was a frosh at college a thin
likeable high-strung cuss whod kidded
me unmercifully about my attachment for
his wifes sister-and then slipped me a
twenty to take her out when my allow-
ance ran short

and then-harry gaines came into the
office i stopped feeling enthusiastic and
there was nothing in me but a queer spon-
taneous sickness not unlike the queazi-
ness id had a year before when i stepped
onto the mat for the intercollegiate wrestl-
ing finals

because harry looked like the ungod-
liest job id ever tackled

tm taking young ronnie into the
firm my dad said in a tight voice
hell have the other desk in your office
we need new blood in this outfit

gaines was considerably leaner than i
remembered him shoulders sagging with
sheer emaciation his narrow face white
and taut as though hed been digging
the werewolf of wall street

ditches all day in the august heat instead
of sitting in an air-cooled office he an-
swered in a weary monotone new blood
chet yes we need-new blood

he barely looked at me but there was
something just not right about the way
he said it new blood he thinks im
a kid i told myself angrily chet wal-
laces kid and nothing more ill show

him yetbut what i really felt

was-half-sick

mind-if i take some water chet
the lean man continued parched-in
this heat

i stared at him as he drank cupful after
cupful from the water-cooler till i
thought hed burst dad started saying
something about atlantic copper and
harry went on drinking as though he
didnt understand at last he finished
with a gurgle and shambled toward me
extending a bony hand

i shook it-and dropped it hurriedly
the white hand was like ice actually
cold and dry as that not like any other
human hand youd touch in a new york
august unless-you happened to be in
the city morgue

i turned to dad when harry left and
said hes sick dad hes the sickest
guy i ever saw standing on two feet
sick or crazy dad dismissed it sim-
ply or both

but it didnt seem as simple as that to
me id been hired to get a more compre-
hensive answer suddenly i remembered
all the ti red-looking people in the outer
office and i thought they looked that way
because theyve been trying to find out
the scientifically air-cooled offices of
wallace brown and gaines was thick
with an intangible hopelessness i got
out in a hurry into the comparative nor-
mality of ninety degrees in the cab of my
doughnut truck

i knew dad was having company for
dinner that evening very private com-
pany-sandra howard in fact so i

picked up dinner somewhere in the vil-
lage and then continued uptown to terry
ramsays place i had a lot to tell terry
that night

if i put her onto it would she coax
her sister marcia to take harry away for
a few weeks vacation if she didnt i
had the darndest feeling that the ramsay
pere and mere would be burying a son-in-
law before they acquired a new one god
how i wished harry would leave town
for his own sake-and for ours even
then with nothing to go by but that per-
sistent queaziness at the pit of my stom-
ach i felt more than a little uncomfortable
at the thought of harry it wasnt some-
thing ordinary hed picked up i thought
like a cold or the mumps-it was a disease
without a name

and terry-she was fair as an angel
and just as good but the remote trou-
bled look in her grey eyes when she met
me at the door-that was something new

ronnie she told me her warm voice
just a little strained a little harsh im
standing you up tonight youll have to
excuse it

terry whats the matter i asked
sharply i felt a momentary pang of jeal-
ousy-and then i realized from the ex-
pression on her face that she wasnt
breaking this date because she wanted to
it wasnt anything as simple as another
man in her life she seemed worried
frightened and as alone as ive ever seen
a girl look

well she hadnt any right to look so
alone i was there wasnt i  i guess she
saw the way i felt because her lower lip
trembled and she slipped into my arms
clinging to me as though i were her sal-
vation that didnt make me feel much
better because i still didnt know what
the matter was

oonnie darling have you-have
you seen harry she whispered
i-dont know what it is but marcia-


dime mystery magazine

i promised to go to marcias tonight i
must go she needs me

marcia needs me still only a partial
explanation later i was going to curse
myself for an inhuman beast remembering
how i thought then that even future in-
laws were a bother

yes ive seen harry i told her
coldly

then she whispered you know al-
most as much as i do

the look on her face would have melted
a rock and i wasnt a rock i didnt even
mind that almost you cant go there
alone i told her if youre in trouble
im in trouble too thats how we are
terry

i felt like a dog seeing that gratitude
and love in terrys eyes and knowing i
didnt deserve it the least little bit as
though it werent my primary business to
be beside her when she needed me 

we were sitting in the roadster id been
given for graduation with my arm around
her it was much cooler driving than a
-bakery truck that angd-fair face was
warm against my cheek as i told her
cheerfully that my truck-driving days were
over and here id just march in tonight
and give harry a good lecture bring him
to his senses and thus earn my seat on
the exchange

   and well all be happy ever after
i concluded though that queaziness in my
stomach was acting up again if you just
trust ronnie the giant-killer that made
her smile

she smiled and i smiled back and all
the time i half-sensed the nightmare that
was to come    

there was no answer to our ring at
marcias apartment terry looked at me
anxiously and pulled a latchkey from her
purse i dont like breaking in on people
even your future sisters-in-law so i rang
again this time there was an answer

aa-ouw the scream rose icily
clearly broke on a note that i heard with

my spine rather than my ears i shouted
my god and pushed terry away as i
took the key from her she wasnt going
in there not while i could help it

no lights i stumbled through the liv-
ing-room to a lamp the room was emp-
ty and undisturbed i shouted marcia
marica are you hurt

a thud sounded beyond the bedroom
door i burst in snapping on the wall
switch as i went the first thing i saw
was-a white rag of a face snarling at
me from outside the bedroom window
words shrieked through my brain skin
doesnt look like that human beings dont
have twitching purplish eyes and thin
liver-colored lips curled back on-red
teeth

i stepped toward it-and stumbled over
something softly solid on the floor when
i looked again the face was gone and
when i looked at the thing that had
tripped me i guess my own face stopped
being a thing not good to see

my hands were wet and cold with a
sweat that had nothing to do with sum-
mer heat and my mouth was dry and
soundless as a desert

that face through the window-i could
have sworn it though i couldnt have
sworn to my own sanity-had belonged
to harry gaines

and inert-a twisted thing on the floor
-lay the body of his wife marcia

her thin nightdress lay in shreds over
her body under the tatters pulsing in
tempo with the aorta blood oozed down
her white side forming a widening dark
stain on the carpet i picked the girl up
and blood smeared my linen suit covered
my hands

i soaked every towel in the bathroom
and tried to wipe the blood away it was
after the towels had been changed three
times after id called a doctor that my
stomach began to churn in revolt

as soon as i relaxed for a moment all
the werewolf of wall street



the horribleness of it crashed home to me

 marcias right cheek was gone it had
 been gnawed away as though by rats
 long strips had been torn from her
 throat and there was no tip on her right
 breast here some ma-d shylock had
 claimed his pound of flesh then blood
 had filled the wounds again

 the woman on the bed stirred she
 was staring at me now eyes wide lips
 parted in an unvoiced wail of intolerable
 pain that was turned into a gurgle by the
 rush of blood

 take my hand i told her in an
 agony of helplessness squeeze it hard
 -that helps sometimes

 her finger-nails dug into my wet palms
 her eyelids dropped and a scream started
 through her tattered throat there were
 words scattered through the piteous
 sounds    harry no    my god
 it cant    be    harry    har-
 ry her husband the lean likeable fellow
 who had become a devil-a monster he
 had done this to her

 id seen his face at the window and
 then it was gone there was a fire escape
 and harry gaines was free terry terry
 was outside alone i threw a sheet over
 marcias poor white body and stumbled
 out

 there was a doctor in the corridor
 walking toward the apartment with an
 elevator man but of a girl with grey
 eyes fair as a botticelli angel there was
 no sign anywhere

      chapter two
      another tryst with death

 t shouted at the doctor to go inside
 and collared the elevator man no he
 hadnt seen terry go out    but then
 hed just come on duty

no terry no terry anywhere i
called at her home asked futilely for her
and shouted at her mother and father

 with unconscious cruelty that theyd better
 get over to marcias i went back to
 marcias myself pounding up and down
 the staircase of the apartment house i
 shouted terrys name till a cop came out
 of marcias door and told me to shut up

    the cops-god how i needed them
 now but even in the crazy panic that
 rode me that night i realized that it was
  whod been seen coming out of the but-
 chered womans apartment-i who was
 covered now with her blood-i whose
 finger-prints were all over her place i
 hadnt time to explain to the law it
 was more important to find terry i beat
 it down the staircase and got to a corner
 drug-store in a matter of seconds

    dad i called into a pay-phone i
 dont care what youre doing but stop
 doing it terrys gone and i think har-
 rys got her i gave him a brief outline
 of what id seen in marcias apartment
 dad i cant report her missing when
 shes only been out of my sight for an
 hour in fact i dont dare go near a cop
 but youve got drag you can make em
 look for her right now if you want to

    steady son he cautioned me sure
 ill get them after her and you come
 home youll be better off here

    i wasnt going to be better off any-
 where but where terry was but there
 wasnt much sense in saying so if i
 didnt get away soon the law would see
 to it that i wasnt even free ta look for
 her so i went home 

candra howard looking like a
sophisticated schoolgirl in spite of
her two marriages and her grown-up
daughter was perched there on the sun-
parlor settee she screamed when she
saw the blood which covered me dad
patted her shoulder with the half-conde-
scending affection hed shown her always
and said to me youd better change
your suit ronnie and take a shower
too you look like a butcher
dime mystery magazine

 terry i pleaded with him you
 called the cops about terry

dad nodded slowly sandra started to
weep softly and dad talked to her the
way youd talk to a child he had the
fondness for her that big men always have
for people theyve been kind to since
sandra had cracked up in that motor ac-
cident a year ago and dad had come for-
ward as a blood donor to save her life
shed been a pretty constant visitor at our
quarters

he snapped her out of it quickly
enough and she grew tearfully maternal
toward me its-just so terrible to hear
all this ronnie and to see you-looking
that way there was something brave
about her as though she sensed an im-
minent peril that would warp all our
lives im getting you a drink she told
me firmly 

it was the most sensible thing anyone
could have done for me at that point i
gulped it down with a gasp

a respectful face full as the moon
showed itself at the door

mr brown your partner to see you
sir announced jason our butler and
then dad shooed me into my own room to
clean up

i did as good a job as i could but my
finger-nails were still dark with clots of
marcias life-blood maybe sandra knew
a way to clean them-women often did--

i paused in the doorway because it was
useless to ask sandra anything any more
she looked-panic-stricken half-mad with
fear and bob brown standing between
her and my father wasnt at all the full-
bodied man id met six months earlier
he was a ghost of a man an emaciated
wreck with a white face and feverish
twitching eyelids he was sick- in the
same ungodly way harry gaines had been
sick

get the hell out bob dads voice
rumbled i said get the hell out

sandras small nervous hands caught

dads wrist stopping a sure blow at the
sick man ill go with him she whis-
pered ive got to go chet-maybe
theres a reason   

and then she reached for her purse
even as dad cried after her she was
gone out into the night    holding to
the reedy arm of a man who was evilly
sick

dad stood there tense and white he
was impotent with rage dad im fol-
lowing them i shouted

im coming with you he said my
god she didnt want to go  

i was out the front door as i shouted
back to him you stay where you are
they may phone you back-about terry

t thought i saw sandras silver-
blonde head through the rear window
of a cab that was waiting for a red light
to change and that was good enough lead
to follow i raced my car down park
avenue after the cab lost it in traffic and
found it again at union square i was
following the wildest of hunches but then
everything that happened was wild and
unbelievably horrible

first terry had been frightened and
she had gone someplace she didnt want
to go-because of a sick man harry
gaines now another sick man had
turned up and summoned another woman
who was obviously panic-stricken at the
thought of accompanying him somehow
i felt bob brown and sandra might lead
me to terry bob was stricken by the
same disease that cursed harry gaines
i had to stick to him-he was my only
clue

if thered only been time-if id only
had a breathing spell in which to con-
vince the cops about seeing harrys wild
face at the window-i might have had
allies in my search now there wasnt

time and i had to handle it alone

terry god i prayed dont let me lose
track of that cab againdown-
the werewolf of wall street



town why were we going downtown
brown didnt live downtown i knew and
neither did sandra nor was it likely that
either of them knew a soul south of four-
teenth street they werent that kind of
people that cabbie was some driver-
he shot through a light at astor place
and i was stopped for trying the same
thing

i dont think i heard a word the traffic
cop bawled at me i was in a fever of
impatience to get going    and when i
realized that the bawling-out was likely to
take some time i stepped on the gas and
while a whistle shrilled imperatively be-
hind me i did some fancy stretching with
the new york city speed limit

it was gone it might take me all night
or all year to locate that cab again in the
maze of little alleys that make up old
manhattan

but-this was familiar territory id
covered it the day before in my bakery
truck    and then i knew where brown
was going with sandra the one possible
place they could go in that part of town
it was insane at this hour for anything
to be going on there but something was
going on-in the street in wall street
after hours

terry terry with her grey eyes and
angels face  no there wasnt a sign
of an angels face on the deserted alley
that by day was the richest little lane in
the world for at night the skyscrapers
are dark their doors locked and from the
areaways come the drunks the derelicts
and all the spawn of the waterfront near-
by

no window of all those thousands was
lit brown-sandra-terry-where in
gods name were they  or was this dark-
ness hiding them

i saw a girl walking slowly ahead of
me a girl i hadnt noticed before there
was something oddly familiar about her
gait  i ran to her and she turned

the dark face garish with cheap cos-

metic assumed a tired smile she said
hello mister and stood still so did i
damn you i told myself this is one case
where you dont say havent i seen you
before but it was exactly what i wanted
to say even while i knew that i couldnt
possibly have known a woman like that at
any point of my life

   the girl shifted to her right hip
well she said there was an odor of
perfume coming from her and it wasnt
five-and-dime stuff either i stepped back
involuntarily she shrugged her shoul-
ders and walked on

   maybe it was because she was the only
living thing that i could see i was up
against a stone wall anyway i followed
her i had to do something

   i pussy-footed close behind her keep-
ing as much in the shadows as she did
once i had to step aside into the gutter
because the pavement was too narrow for
me to side-step a swaying drunken sailor
who barred my path

   she was going toward the building-
our building the entrance was barred
and padlocked but she had a key to the
gate i ran now not caring how noisily
my heels thudded

tt missed me by inches breezing
against my face with a harsh whoosh
and then it hit the pavement with a dull
crack i looked at the thing that had come
from the window and important small
matters like nerves and blood-vessels
stopped working inside me

   in a smear of broken flesh and trickling
blood it lay on the pavement face up
that face might have been lovely once-
i didnt know it was a young girl and
she was stark naked i didnt know
whether she had jumped fallen or been
pushed to her death i didnt know who
she was or why she should have been in
that darkened building

   the barred gate opened again and
shadowy images emerged with a far from
dime mystery magazine

shadowy speed i recognized the girl who
had accosted me earlier saw two others
stoop to the thing on the sidewalk

whatever whoever they were they
hadnt any business there i sailed into
them tooth and nail only to be repulsed
by what i touched i tell you it wasnt
human flesh that my fists pounded-too
cold for that it was the icy cold of death
these creatures werent alive they
faded away like mist before me and i
was alone in the deserted street the
body of the girl was gore i heard the
click of the closing gate

i rattled at the padlock shouting
hoarse vain threats a dim procession
was vanishing down the corridor toward
the elevators but there was steel between
us

out of the echoes of my own cries and
of those ghostly footsteps thudding on
bare stone came a dim call my own
name ronn- it was cut off muffled
in mid-air but i knew it knew that
voice as i knew that i was alive

it had been terry ramsay calling to
me from the shadows out of unspeak-
able and unknown hell with cold relent-
less steel between us

i was clinging to that gate shouting at
the things within when something hard
struck me between the shoulder-blades
there was a cop behind me the third to
take a dislike to me that night and this
one seemed ready to do something about
it

some remnant of reason warned me
that he was the wrong person on whom
to resume wrestling practice much as i
felt like it what you think youre
doin he asked collaring me intolerant-
ly better make it good brother   

i tried to shake him off but i couldnt
this time i had to explain a girl i
told him she jumped out of the win-
dow and they took her inside  get me
in there officer for gods sake it was
all i dared say if id told him that i was

trailing the second woman to disappear
that night in the vicinity of a man name-
lessly sick id have had to identify my-
self as the man who found marcias
butchered body that might mean months
of proving to a jury that i wasnt a mur-
derer

and i didnt have months i didnt
have-minutes to spare ive got to go
inside i shouted at the officer again

he gave me an odd look wavering be-
tween credence and disbelief but with
the balance all on the side of disbelief
god if he were going to do something
why couldnt he do it in a hurry he
sniffed at my breath while i cursed si-
lently and then rapped his nightstick
against the gate a sleepy-eyed watchman
shambled up to us from the shadows and
inquired whas going on

this guy says he saw a girl jump out
of a window in this building said the
officer he says somebody came and
picked up the body and took it back in-
side seen anything like that pop 
the watchman sniggered a senile stu-
pid snigger that made me want to kill him
he sounded so sleepy i was sure hed
been doped hes dreamin orfisser i
oughta know what goes on here been
here every night for twelve years and
aint seen a girl yet wouldnt be so bad
at that

thanks pop said the officer to me
he added youve had a snifter havent
you say do you think i ought to take
you to the precinct or the nut-house 
make it the nut-house haw-hawed
the watchman

i saw red dammit a girl had died
here five minutes earlier and they were
laughing  a girl had died and another
girl might die if i didnt find a way of
getting to her i slipped out of my jacket
let the copper have one on the chin as he
came after me and tried to take myself
elsewhere instantly the street was loud
with whistles alive with blue-coats and i
the werewolf of wall street



knew in a kind of hopeless agony that i
wasnt going farther without police escort

dad came down to the police station
as soon as i called him but by the time
he got me and my roadster out of hock
having convinced the department that id
been a good son and a good citizen all
my life it was almost dawn

dawn-for everyone else in the world
for me it might mean only the day of
judgment because i had been too late the
night before  

chapter three

they have no blood

 on forgive me that was all my
 father said sitting heavily beside
me in the roadster he looked old some-
how and the white breast-pocket hand-
kerchief was crushed and crumpled
over the darkness grey visibility crept
from the east there was a hot wind blow-
ing from the sea

why dad i asked

ive gotten you into a hell of a mess
wishing that job on you-maybe a mur-
der rap but ill stand behind you  

that wasnt what bothered me dully
like a clock tolling in purgatory terrys
name went through my head dad j
said got a key to your own office ive
got to get in there-got to find her
you mean terry he asked terrys
all right-thank god at least i can give
you that much good news sandra called
me a little after one last night and said
she was home brown had taken her-
down to the aquarium said he was go-
ing to introduce her to the fishes crazy
like all the rest she gave him the slip

she found terry at her own place
when she got home her own daughter
maxie met terry in a bad nervous state
outside marcias corridor they live quite
near each other you know maxie made
terry come home with her

i yelled im going to her right now

dad said i wouldnt do that son
sandra said terry doesnt want to see
you-just yet shes under some kind of
misapprehension-thinks it was you who
butchered marcia sandra used to be
some kind of nurse-shes keeping terry
quiet for the time being says the childs
not in a state where she ought to see any-
one says the only reason terry hasnt
informed on you is that shes prostrated
with the shock of it

but dad- no i couldnt believe
that terry to think me a butcher how
had she found out between the time id
gone into marcias apartment and the
time i found her gone no shed been
out there till she left where she could see
nothing    but what if she had seen had
slipped in past me somehow wasnt
that evil suspicion exactly what id
feared would come into every mind

sandra believes in you ronnie dad
went on she wont let terry talk till
the girls calmer    and the whole ram-
say familys too upset about marcia to
mind leaving terry in capable hands if
youll just sit tight son  

sit tight after the previous nights
horror a kind of numbness had come
over my brain everything had been too
incredible too beyond belief-was it my
senses that had gone mad and not the
outside world i half-believed that i
tried to tell dad

it doesnt make sense he sighed
harry gaines mutilating his own wife
-im taking your word for that ronnie
-girls plopping out my office window at
midnight maybe the watchman was right
maybe you dreamt it ronnie

maybe i did i echoed if terry
hated me-didnt want to see me-any-
thing was possible

the healthiest thing for you to do
dad advised is to go back to the office
and wait well keep our mouths shut
about this-till something breaks im
going to see harriet brown bobs wife


dime mystery magazine

poor woman-she was sweet to me when
your mother died ronnie im thinking
she might need a man around the house
if anything happens get in touch with
sandra she can be trusted

sandra could be trusted i supposed
so i began to feel that i couldnt be
trusted it was pretty brave of her to go
out with brown dad said brave-
and damned foolish she thought she
might find something-for your sake
ronnie

suddenly i felt that the thing wasnt
over one girl had died and a woman
was probably dying rigth now and the
sick men were still at large dad i said
youd better go to sandras im-scared
for her scared for every female in this
town

dad shook his head we had come
back to the street and the sun was a big
orange ball over the east river im
leaving you here he said ive got to
get to harriet browns

he borrowed the roadster and went
off there was a faint dark stain in front
of our building a stain that had evidently
been rubbed almost out today hundreds
of unconscious passers-by would tread
that stain thinking of it if they thought
of it at all as part and parcel of the
citys untraceable muck

but to me it was unholy proof that i
hadnt been dreaming the night before-
that stain was a young girls life-blood

tvto one had arrived at the office
when i came in dad had given me
the keys to every office and room and i
investigated each one even the womans
wash-room where i had no business at
all and it was there unmistakable faint
and lingering that i caught the scent of
perfume that perfume which had come
from the girl who accosted me the night
before and whom i felt i should have
known but didnt

    shed been here all right but she

wasnt here now-she was in the limbo
where devils dwell in the daytime i ran
back to my phone and dialed sandras
number i listened to the buzzing signal
for what seemed a lifetime sorry they
do not answer said the operator

and then i was sure that they were
trapped when i saw them again they
might be broken corpses    but god
what could i do

the memory of dads heavy voice
came to me sit tight and i sat tight
had to the phone was ringing and after
i answered it it kept ringing with scarce-
ly a pause i had come to work early on
the day of the biggest crash since 

it was a hot job to handle alone that
august day when the bottom dropped out
of the market i sat at my phone collar
open shirt soaked jacket draped over a
hat-tree and i sold god how i sold-
when i could find a buyer which wasnt
often

there was the slimmest of reasons for
it it was pandemonium dropped without
warning oh thered been war scare and
drought in the west-but it hadnt been
enough to make the market insane not
in this way

somewhere in the back of my brain a
thought persisted and if id only had time
to examine it it might have clicked first
there had been the panics shadow-dad
shouting that the brokers had gone crazy
then the panic within-with men like
gaines and brown going horribly sick
with revolting death gripping the street
and those connected with the street and
now--the panic in full force it was as
though that hidden underworld which
skulked through the street by night had
come into the sun blasting our lives by
day   

ronnie need help- ill-dive right

i turned to see who had spoken and a
mad rush of anger made me tremble
standing there pale and sick but with a
the werewolf of wall street



good shave and a shine on his shoes was
harry gaines

i dropped the phone id been holding
and screamed youve got terry you
dirty murderer you cant do to her what
you did to marcia ill kill you for it
the eyelids jerked into a mild sur-
prised marcia-poor marcia someone
-hurt her last night

hurt her ill say someone hurt her
and i saw you outside her window
the leer didnt go from that white
face but harry retreated as though he
were afraid of me and i saw you he
murmured it-wouldnt be funny-to
tell police i was in my own apartment
they-expect that i live there but you
-have fingerprints all over-that dont
belong all over marcias body  i
could tell them something too

my arm dropped to my side i knew
as i had known all morning how the
damnably guilty feel i mumbled but
terry   

i dont know said the trembling
husk of a man his eyes avoided mine
and he slunk to his desk the phone was
ringing again

it was later and hotter and financially
bleaker before i had time to notice what
harry gaines had been doing with the
phone on his own desk and when i did
notice i went rabid he was-buying
as fast as i sold harry was buying up
again it wasnt gambling either it was
suicide i opened my mouth to call him
an unprintable name-and my jaw just
wabbled there in mid-air

decause while hed been sitting
there while the morning had waned
to afternoon harrys face had turned
white as chalk    and his eyes were pur-
plish and his liver-colored lips were a
thin gash in a rag face it was the face i
had seen snarling from marcias window

youve-cancelled my orders all-
day ronnie came from the unspeakably

vile visage words croaked as the unrest-
ing dead might croak them maybe-ill
die for it

youre damned right youll die i
howled at him youre half-dead al-
ready 

ill die of thirst he croaked on
thirst that water cant slake nor wine
-unless you save me ronnie his thin
lips barely breathed forth the words
youll want to save me-because if i
die terry is going to die with me

his words trickled down my spine like
separate drops of frozen air i wanted to
kill him    and i tried to i tore into
that icy thin body and when id stopped
shaking him he could hardly stand

his lip was split and something trick-
led over his chin from the gash it was as
weak and thin as water and that was
what harry had in his veins

blood thats what had been the matter
with them with harry and bob and
god knows how many others they had
no blood

youd better not hurt me he whim-
pered from a corner youd better come
with me tonight theyll kill terry if you
dont come with me

i clutched at the skinny throat dont
make a sound i warned him trying not
to go berserk if you tell me where ter-
ry is ill go there with you-today

his eyes popped and he shook his
throat for air there isnt any place to
go by day well have to wait-for to-
night

where is she now i asked

i dont know he answered

there was something else he had to
tell me something that had been both-
ering me for hours terry said if id
seen you i knew almost as much as she
did i told him what did she mean by
almost

his lips were drawn back and he
grinned like a corpse maybe-marcia
told her-that i hadnt been home at


dime mystery magazine

night-for weeks marcia tried to stop
me-tried to keep me from getting to the
fresh blood so i tore at her with my
hands  i had to make her leave me
alone

i shuddered at that hideous confes-
sion for there had been a time when
harry loved marcia i relaxed my hold
on his wrinkled throat

i believed that something would hap-
pen to terry if i didnt go with harry
tonight id seen what had happened to
the others and i knew that only the most
deadly compulsion could have driven
harry to buy stocks on a day like this

he was too weak to talk any more
though he tried i brought glass after
glass of water to him kept everyone else
out of the office my hot hands froze
every time they grazed his face he grew
paler and his tongue began to hang out
his skin turned gray    youve got to
last till tonight i pleaded with him and
he took the water and let it trickle over
his gaping mouth and swollen tongue
and there was agony in his eyes his
mouth was too swollen even for a
whisper

it got to be six and then six-thirty i
brought harry five cupfuls in three min-
utes id forgotten what i was supposed
to be in the office for   

harrys purplish eyes stared up at me
when i poured the water over him he
didnt even try to swallow it

harry was dead

and his death might mean-terrys
death i had to get to that place which
didnt exist by day and which harry had
been too far gone to name i phoned dad
told him id be working late

somewhere during the night that had
passed it seemed to me that sheer out-
raged instinct had caused me to draw
back when the gates to hell were open
at one point i had done the thing which
dropped that steel gate between terrys
hiding place and me

the girl with the faint perfume she
had asked me to accompany her and i
had not gone well i thought frantically
tonight she may walk again and if she
does-ill walk with her

chapter four
the feast of bloodless men

dark came and the myriad workers
were gone from the end of manhattan
island gone uptown gone to harlem
to brooklyn gone to hot dinners and
comfortable chairs and laughing children
nothing that was alive lingered on the
deserted street my footsteps echoed hol-
lowly through the black chasm of
stone   

and then there were more footsteps
from behind me came the girl with the
painted face she paused raised her eye-
brows at me back again mister

evil she was evil as the first sin in
eden and i wanted to run from her with
every instinct of my body but the odor
of her perfume persisted faint and lin-
gering as it had been in the washroom
that morning and certainties in the back
of my head grew stronger

i said what id half-meant to say the
night before havent we met before
somewhere 

she shrugged perhaps i meet so
many people    walk she cocked her
arm and i realized that i was supposed
to take it   

we passed the building where i
worked the building shed disappeared
into the night before that wasnt odd
but i didnt dare call attention to the
fact perhaps they changed the scene of
their operations for safetys sake

in front of the hines building with
the offices of hines and carter occupy-
ing the first three floors my guide
stopped like to drop in a while she
asked we could have-fun
the werewolf of wall street



   yes i answered doubling my hands
into fists to keep from gripping her
throat lots of fun

   she smiled and from her handbag she
drew a key-chain and opened the iron
gates this time i was going in thank
god

   nobody uses these buildings at night
she explained in the dim elevator she
operated herself pity to let all this nice
space go to waste isnt it when you
and i could be so happy-well it makes
a good spot to entertain my men
friends

   very clever i admitted dammit i
had seen her before but where i didnt
know

   at the third floor she led me into the
customers room of hines and carter
there were bottles and a bowl of ice and
glasses on one of the tables drink
she asked stroking my arm in a caress
that made me go hot and cold with
revulsion

   i had to humor her i drank    and
then suddenly the girl seemed to be danc-
ing a crazy jig her head floating off
somewhere yards away from her body
the room was coming apart too   

   thoughts circled upward out of my
head in a kind of humming jargon im
doped the words sang in my ears and
then everything was black

t couldnt move my hands it was
bothering me i could feel them but
i couldnt move them i said so aloud
and someone laughed

   i opened my eyes to find myself sag-
ging in a swivel chair in a private office
i sat quite still for the good reason that
i was tied hand and foot a door was
open ahead of me and in the dim light-
ing of that customers room beyond gro-
tesque shapes swirled and danced

   how do you like it ronnie asked
a clear feminine voice i turned my head
standing beside me her lovely little-girl

face twisted into amusement was sandra
howard

i tried to cry out and words came in a
whisper sandra youre-

at the bottom of all this she fin-
ished for me why of course didnt
you suspect ronnie

no i admitted hopelessly to myself i
hadnt suspected and i should have
god i should have that phony-sound-
ing story about brown taking her to the
aquarium about terry being at her place
god what had she done with terry i
tried to shout that name at her but it
came from my lips in a whisper thats
funny i thought i was a good shouter
in my truck-driving days

there she is sandra pointed my
eyes were growing used to the dim light
in the room beyond there were faces
and bodies where only shadows had been
before there was young carter who
was boss in this office by day his face
pasty and thin and hideous in the dim-
ness and there was a girl with him   
twisting her limbs about him her hands
caressing him all over his naked body

and there were at least a dozen others
bloodless and perverted a saturnalia
among corpses    then a scream drooled
from my lips

nude and unconscious and defenceless
stretched on a table in the midst of that
ungodly reveling was terry they
werent touching her now-but had they 
or would they

i called sandra the vilest name a man
can call a woman and she patted my
cheek with mock-matemalism youre
weak ronnie she said i had to take
so much blood from you-to keep my
men in there alive odd how much they
trust me theyre all doomed-doomed
to die of leukemia there isnt a doctor
in the world who knows a cure for it
they arent capable of manufacturing
blood in their bodies any more so they
come to me-for transfusions from


dime mystery magazine

healthy bodies like yours poor fools they
think im keeping them alive i hope their
delusions make them happy

 i whispered through teeth that
 clicked together strangely you gave it
 to them you took their blood    and
 theyre dying

 sandra nodded as though pleased with
 my perspicacity a girl walked toward
 her a girl who had not joined the incredi-
 ble revels it was my guide with the gar-
 ish make-up and the fine perfume then
 i knew her-and cursed myself impotent-
 ly for not having known her before she
 was maxine howard sandras daugh-
 ter nice work sandra said to her
 this ones the one ive been after right
 along

 my hips said the girl maxine are
 irresistible she giggled and then
 sighed suddenly tears started to flow
 down sandras cheeks her face worked
 oddly

 please- sandra gasped leave us
 maxie my poor dearest maxie  

 maxine turned and with a sensuous
 swaying of her hips vanished among the
 shadows sandra looked at me again
 composure putting her features back into
 the little-girl mask

 maxie is-dying she said to me tak-
 ing a deep breath i-killed her ron-
 nie it was selfish but i was desperate
 when your father offered me that blood
 transfusion last year after the motor acci-
 dent i took it but i was still weak
 needed more transfusions your father
 was still willing to be generous but doc-
 tors warned him that hed get leukemia
 from too much blood-letting so i took
 blood from maxine

 no doctor in the world would have
 let her give me as much as she did-we
 had to do it at home privately you know

 i was a nurse once oh i was nearly
 crazy with fear ronnie-fear for myself

 i got over it all right but-maxie was
 doomed

that made me desperate too i
lured men to our place night after
night gave them drugged drinks if they
had the wrong type of blood they woke
up and went their ways thinking merely
that theyd been drunk if they had the
right type the type we needed for maxie
they woke up sick they went to doctors
who told them they had leukemia that
they were dying then i stepped in of-
fered to keep them alive if they induced
others to come to me others who would
yield their blood   

it was a desperate game but it
worked the dying bring me their healthy
victims and soon the victims are dying
too  if they have the right type of
blood which you have youre your fath-
ers son ronnie i havent taken that
much from you yet youll pull through
but i may 

i struggled against my bonds and fell
back i felt dizzy and sick weak as water
an infernal bell was tolling in my brain

i-had to give them morphine with
the blood ronnie she went on so
theyd believe what i told them that id
discovered a chemical which would check
leukemia when it was added to a blood
transfusion they have to believe me if
they informed the police theyd go to jail
too and die there-because now theyre
as guilty as i am

but it gave me an idea a valuable
idea id taken my own daughters life-
like a werewolf i could become a were-
wolf-on wall street you know your-
self what i made these victims of mine
do on the market-and i can be rich now
ronnie rich as an empress

i tried to tell her to go to hell-but
then she was there already and so was
i youre not going to-kill terry are
you  i whispered

six years ago we awoke to the sudden realization that there was a definite
place for a new type of fiction so we brought out dime mystery
magazine and though we are frank to admit that it was at first an experi-
ment we have since proven that we made no mistake as a matter of fact most
publishing ventures are risky at best but we felt the two principal factors that
inspired us were basically sound and both were founded on human nature

has your mind ever flashed back to
hair-raising moments of your youth when
you were reading forbidden literature
up in your room with your lamp shaded
so that pop and mom would think you
were fast asleep  perhaps you were read-
ing bram stokers immortal dracula or
a blood-chilling tale by ambrose bierce
poe or wilkie collins whatever it was
the chances are that your pulse was
pounding like mad and every little creak-
ing sound-which might have been
caused only by the wind in the shutters-
made your heart leap up into your throat
to choke you well do we remember
nights like that and every one we know
can hark back to a similar era-its human
nature perhaps too you remember that
you couldnt find enough of that vivid
spine-tingling fare we never could and
thats one reason we thought there was a
definite place for a new magazine

later on we spent a few months travel-
ing abroad and once again we ran across
evidence of mans desire to be stimulated
by the bizarre the macabre the eerie in
paris there is a theater known as le

grand guignol and each week a new play
is presented in itself there isnt any-
thing unusual about that-but these plays
are like none offered anywhere in the
world they are designed especially for
the benefit of those who seek an emotional
outlet in pulse-tingling drama dramas of
the walking dead vampires and suc-
cubuses-creatures who prey upon the
innocent in the dark of night and we
noted each night we attended-every seat
in the house was filled  in london
we found a form of entertainment equally
popular though running along slightly
different lines madame tussauds wax
works this attraction once a part of
one of the empire exhibitions became so
celebrated that its owners set it up as a
separate museum the attraction is com-
prised of all the most terrifying blood-
curdling murders of history enacted by
figures of wax which are perfect images of
the originals madame tussauds wax
works was not designed for those with
low blood pressure and weak hearts yet
it has a definite place in the annals of en-
tertainment and the fact that there is a



dime mystery magazine

place for it as well as le grand guignol
added to our conviction that we should
publish a magazine devoted to the cream
of mystery-terror ideas

dont get the impression that we were
planning a magazine to be gruesome-
shockingly stark our plan was to con-
sider the audience reaction we noted
abroad and combine it with the thrills
we remembered as stolen reading in our
youth if we and all our friends were
exhilarated by poe and bram stoker and
if thousands of europeans can be enter-
tained yearly by the institutions named
above then there must be a market for
the type of fiction we planned to offer
we would be catering to a human need
as much in demand in certain fields as
western stories or detective yarns are
in other fields we felt certain of that

however-that was only the beginning
when we set about buying manuscripts
we found that there was a marked short-
age of authors who could supply what
we wanted for we sought certain com-
binations of eeriness terror and scalp-
raising material that actually were not be-
ing written we received any number of
gory yarns that offered nothing but gore
we received stories of the supernatural
that were too far-fetched to be convincing
we received plenty of the general run of
ghost story the haunted house variety
without any punch or plot there was
nothing to do but hash over every idea
submitted by our best-known writers and
request them to deliver the goods liter-
ally on order this does not mean we
dont welcome material from new-
comers 

here are a few of the rules we laid
down to authors the stories must be
modern and american that is to say the
characters must be everyday people who
might be you your neighbors    your
associates-not people on foreign soil in
ages long gone by there must be a
quality of genuine mystery there must

be a menace almost unbearable threaten-
ing the people in the story in such a way
that the reader really feels the fear that
they feel and this menace must be logic-
ally motivated by some character who has
a reason for it and in such a way that
it could happen-without too great a
stretch of the imagination-in your own
home town 

man will never cease speculating upon the
hereafter so we find our readers request a cer-
tain number of stories dealing with creatures
that are-or seem to be-from the mysterious
limbo beyond the grave    there are other
types of mystery-terror yarns too tales of hu-
man vampires sirens and modern witch-doctors
stories of the weird influence one persons mind
may exert on anothers oh there is ample
room for variety in this field-and now there
is always a constant supply good mystery-
terror yarns are not as scarce as they were when
we were young

glance back through this issue with us and
note the various styles of mystery fiction you
have just read donald dales lead novel maids
for the dust-devils is the story of a nameless
menace that rides under cover of a natural phe-
nomena striking swiftly and surely the fear
is caused by a combination of natures wrath-
and some evil influence enhanced perhaps by
the fact that the characters in this novel know
in their hearts that the crimes are actually being
committed by some horrible human agency   
in help me to die by leon byrne there is
no explanation attempted rarely do we find
a story like this  in the town the dead
things claimed paul ernsts novelette young
john crayton all unknowing comes close to
mingling with creatures from beyond the grave
-and his sweetheart apparently dead leads him
there terror has no face is raymond whet-
stones contribution to those readers who can
take their terror neat-and still go to sleep with-
out a bright light burning    henry treat
sperry gives you a novelette of a modern circe-
like woman who wields a weird compelling in-
fluence over strong men and at whose beck and
call snarls a pack of-well what were those
creatures in goddess of the half-world brood

   you tell us

and tell us what you like in mystery-terror
fiction dont hesitate to write us your ideas on
how we can offer you the pulse-speeding spine-
tingling type of story that packs the wallop you
want criticisms are welcome too

choice a man ever had to make dad
ruined mouth sealed by an alternative no
ordinary blackmailer could have con-
ceived and tied legally to a woman who
called herself with all justification a
werewolf-or terry thrown to those
hounds of sandras for blood-letting or
worse  it didnt much matter any
more what happened to me

terry or dad terry    or    dad
well sandra said impatiently
look theyre closing in on terry-if i
the werewolf of wall street

dont stop them   

i looked ill do it i gasped ill do
anything

they unbound me and left me alone
in the office to telephone dad still i
could barely move and i knew sandra
was listening when he arrived he was in
a towering rage

what the hells the idea of your being
here at midnight he blazed and tell-
ing me to come alone  

dad i began and then his face went
gray

ronnie youre dying he exclaimed

i will be i whispered to him unless
you- god how could i go on terry
or dad i didnt know

and then a shot pierced the silence
and dad leapt into the inner office where
sandra was listening i tried to shout
after him theyll kill you too   but
he went anyway theyve killed her i
thought in a mad panic theyve killed
my terry   

there was another shot and another
and another then through a haze i saw
dad reappear with terry in his arms
and maxine was walking beside him
there wasnt a blemish on terrys body
you take the girl i heard dad say to
maxie ronnies pretty heavy and hes
too weak to walk

tears were streaking down maxies
painted face sorry ronnie she said
to me i couldnt stand it-any more-
she was too evil to live i thought i
loved her enough to help her do anything
she wanted but when she tried to ruin
your life that was too much you see
ronnie your happiness is really all that
matters to me ive loved you from the
day i first saw you after mothers ac-
cident this is the only reparation i can
make she raised the pistol in her hand
before anyone could move she pulled
the trigger her young form drooped
slowly until she lay at my feet a long
quiver shook her-and then she was still

i tried to say something but a wave
of dizzy ness came over me and every-
thing went black   

a pair of grey eyes were looking into
mine and i was lying in my own bed
sunlight blessed simple sunlight poured
into the room

ive been with you all day terry
said youve been saying the queerest
things  

i tried to lift my arms to her but i
guess i just wasnt strong enough how
are you i managed to murmur

well look at me she answered rue-
fully i looked she was adorably smoth-
ered in my size a pyjamas your fath-
ers had me doctored on the premises
im just about getting over the stomach
pump there was a dreadful amount of
dope in me i guess

fear shot through me shaky fear that
made me want to weep terry-do you
remember-can you tell me what hap-
pened after-

the grey eyes veiled themselves i
dont know she said i was standing
in the corridor waiting for you when a
man with a white face came up to me it
might have been harry i felt something
prick me   everything was like a dream
after that a dream i cant remember till
i woke up here

a dream she couldnt remember just
how far had those blood purveyors used
her drugged body to further their plans
i didnt know and she didnt know and
there was no way of finding out   

maxie i murmured it was maxie
and sandra 

terry began to weep very softly i
used to be so fond of maxie she said
and-im sorry your father told me-
maxie shot sandra through the heart
you see without warning the others
thought shed killed the only person who
could save their lives and she stood
the werewolf of wall street

there and told them it was a hoax they
were ready to kill her-and she started
shooting them one by one but i guess
theyd have killed her anyway if your
father hadnt rushed them it is maxie
and your father we owe our lives to
poor maxie-she tried to make it up to
you in the only way she knew

that was two days ago two of the
others escaped maxies bullets but
theyre dead now anyway she wiped
her tears away they called us this
morning from the hospital marcias a lit-
tle better shell live

marcia would live why i didnt
know there couldnt be much joy left
in her living    but was there in ours
because they had taken blood from me
huge quantities of blood they had taken
it from harry too what if-r blinked
at the sunshine trying to get the courage
somehow even to think the thing what
if i were to turn into a feverish pale
ghost like harry and the others what if
i too went mad tore at the girl i loved
as harry had torn at her sister

i cant marry you terry i whis-
pered not till i know   

about me  she asked in a small
voice about what happened-while i
was asleep

no i answered not you youll
always be the purest thing in the world
to me till i know-about myself
terry was still there two days later
when a famous doctor came to test me
for anemia i felt calmer more at ease
but there was a sadness in me that had
aged me ill never be young again and i
havent passed the quarter-century mark

doctor jholmes took a blood specimen
from my finger and snorted youre
healthy as a truck-horse he said what
makes you think youre anaemic

i didnt tell him the whole story be-
cause i couldnt talk about it

well he said thoughtfully you

athletes foot

send coupon
dont pay until relieved

   according to the government health
bulletin no e- at least  of the
adult population of the united states
are being attacked by the disease known
as athletes foot

   usually the disease starts between the
toes little watery blisters form and
the skin cracks and peels after a while
the itching becomes intense and you
feel as though you would like to scratch
off all the skin

beware of its spreading

   often the disease travels all over the
bottom of the feet the soles of your
feet become red and swollen the skin
also cracks and peels and the itching
becomes worse and worse

   get rid of this disease as quickly as
possible because it is very contagious
and it may go to your hands or even to
the under arm or crotch of the legs

   most people who have athletes foot
have tried all kinds of remedies to cure
it without success ordinary germicides
antiseptics salve or ointments seldom
do any good	 

   heres how to treat it

    the germ that causes the disease is
  known as tinea trichophyton it
  buries itself deep in the tissues of the
  skin and is very hard to kill a test
  made shows it takes  minutes of
  boiling to kill the germ so you can
  see why the ordinary remedies are
  unsuccessful

    h f was developed solely for the
  purpose of treating athletes foot it
  is a liquid that penetrates and dries
  quickly you just paint the affected
  parts it peels off the tissue of the
  skin where the germ breeds

  that the itching is immediately relieved
  you should paint the infected parts with
  h f night and morning until your feet are
  well usually this takes from three to ten
  days although in severe cases it may take
  longer or in mild cases less time
