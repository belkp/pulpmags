telepathy

              by hugo gernsback

ne of the problems that has
kept popping up continuous-
ly from time immemorial
is the intensely interesting
one of telepathy telepathy
in short is a silent trans-
ference of human thought to a distance
there is nothing new at all about this
idea for it was discussed by the ancients
thousands of years ago and it is sure to
recur at an increasing rate in the years
to come

  not so many years ago the present
writer through one of his former sci-
ence magazines offered cash prizes
totaling some six thousand dollars for
scientific proofs of telepathy as well as
other so-called occult phenomena the
prizes were never claimed yet the be-
lief that there is such a thing as tele-
pathy seems to be pretty well established
in many minds although from a scientific
viewpoint no real evidence has ever been
produced the test for telepathy is ex-
ceedingly simple since no apparatus of
any kind is required any body of sci-
entists or investigators would believe in
telepathy if the following tests were met
to their satisfaction

  take two people who claim to have the
power of telepathy or thought transfer-
ence and place them in two adjoining
rooms let subject a read from a- pre-
viously unknown book a sentence and
let him transfer the sentence by telepathy
to subject b if subject b is then able
to give this sentence either in whole or
in part the test would seem to show
conclusively the transference -of thought
yet absurdly simple though this proce-
dure is no subjects ever tested have been
able to come through the usual ex-
cuse is that the conditions must be
right because otherwise no thought trans-
ference can take place inasmuch as the
subjects usually claim psychic power
they will tell you that such tests can
never bring about results and that tele-

pathic messages are not obtained at will
but often come in a sleep-like state un-
der emotional stress or otherwise un-
expectedly

  yet no less a scientific authority than
the late luther burbank claimed that he
had been able to converse freely by
mental telepathy with his sister thou-
sands of miles away and that he had
proved to his own satisfaction that there
actually is such a thing as telepathy

  with such a statement from so great
an authority and so universally respected
a man as burbank even the hard-boiled
scientific investigator is forced to take
some notice of a so-called nourtienon if
such there be very frequently tele-
pathic claims have been made by a pair
of subjects closely related -such as
mother and daughter or more particu-
larly twins yet when it comes to
simple tests they have produced no re-
sults and the whole subject of telepathy
immediately becomes very vague and in-
conclusive

  we do not take the standpoint that
telepathy as a whole is impossible or
even improbable and perhaps 
years from now when the humb race
has advanced further than it has now
conditions may be different

  scientific investigations have actually
shown that any concentration of thought
produces certain physiological effects
which can be measured by sensitive elec-
trical instruments but so far no in-
vestigator has been able to detect the
so-called thought waves by means of any
instruments not connected directly to the
human body if the human brain is
capable of producing electrical waves of
an extremely short wavelength as yet
unrecognized it is possible that later int
vestigators may be able to detect such
waves by means of electrical apparatus
at a distance just as we are receiving
radio impulses from a distance today
but so far the experiments have given
no positive results of any kind

of

 wet

r r century

 about five years ago some extremely
 strange events occurred which had
 filled all the newspapers in the space of a
 short lime there had vanished without a
 trace from various cities of germany as
 well as other countries a number of men
 who not long previous-
 ly had distinguished
 themselves in science

  in each case the
 man in question was a
 bachelor almost all
 were less than thirty
 years old being schol-
 ars who had made
 new discoveries and
 whose daring plans
 were at the moment
 meeting opposition

   the mining engineer
 eberhard romer had
 lectured on the possi-
 bility of using the
 metals on the moon

 he wanted to get there
 by means of space
 ships on the moon
 which offers no possi-
 bility of life to earth
 dwellers because of
 its lack of an atmos-
 phere he planned to
 erect air-tight houses
 filled with oxygen
 from which mining
 operations were to be
 begun he had been
 laughed at in bitter-
 ness he had left mun-
 ich by plane for leip-
 zig and had disap-
 peared without leaving
 a trace

   at the medical con-
 gress in vienna the in-
 structor dr weigand had presented some
 revolutionary theories regarding the com-
 batting of cancer his proposals had been
 rejected he had left trieste on a mediter-
 ranean trip and on the day after the de-
 parture his cabin was found empty his
 was thought a case of suicide due to a sud-

 den nervous breakdown

   ottomar golduer the swiss engineer had
 requested financial support from his gov-
 ernment so that he might set to work large-
 scale experiments on the st gotthard snow
 fields to secure quantities of heat from the
 solar rays and to store
 it up when his re-
 quest was laughed at
 he took the train for
 germany and disap-
 peared from his berth

                          otto schultz the in-
                       genious berlin plan-
                       ner viktor grote-
                       fendt who had devised
                       a plan for a most re-
                       markable express route
                       through the middle of
                       the ocean and who
                       was regarded as a can-
                       didate for a sanitar-
                       ium for an observa-
                       tion of his mental
                       state and gerhard
                       vetter one of the most
                       gifted men at the sie-
                       mens plant disap-
                       peared in the same
                       way all this oc-
                       curred within a week

                    while people a t
 large considered each
 individual case an ac-
 cident in berlin the
 aged retired crimino-
 logist dr schliiter
 was of the opinion
 that there must be some
 connection between
 them and investiga-
 tion s were made
 through the police
 police activity was
 doubled when about
 six months later ten more young men van-
 ished this time indeed they were young
 workers likewise unmarried mechanics
 high grade technical men foremen in this
 case also they came from different cities

 finally the matter was forgotten for as
 time went on nothing more had occurred to

               the twentieths
 pride our-
 selves on our wonderful
 civilization yet we have
 only to stand off and sur-
 vey the senseless traffic
 jams in our cities our
 slums our business depres-
 sions our hospitals filled
 with people afflicted with
 diseases and accidents that
 could have been averted
 and our brutal wars to
 realize that our civilization
 is indeed in a crude and
 unformed state

   what we have has been
 given us by science and
 science can be the means
 to make our world really
 wonderful but for that
 gigantic task science must
 be freed from the grasping
 hands of the profiteer and
 the stupid blunderings of
 the politician what could
 science do if it had a free
 hand the answer should
 be fascinating to every per-
 son with imagination es-
 pecially when it is given by
 the masterful mind of ot-
 frid von hanstein author
 of electropolls

  we proudly offer now
the latest of von hansteins
masterpieces which ice have
imported from germany
and had translated for our


wonder stories

keep the public interest alive only schlu-
tei pursued his secret investigations

   finally oneday there appeared a strange
advertisement in the hamburger fremden-
blatl

  do not worry about us we are well
and full of hope we shall be heard from
in exactly five years

   certainly it was held that this advertise-
ment which was signed by the vanished
scientists as well as by the workmen was
nothing hut a poor attempt at a joke es-
 pecially tince it appeared on april first
and so the world ignored it and gradually
returned lo its normal affairs forgetting this
mysterious business altogether

   all this as i have said
had happened some four
or five years ago

   now lately a scientific
expedition had been fitted
out at berlin the inter-
esting reports of the am-
erican explorer beebe
about rare forms of ani-
mal life and other inex-
plicable natural pheno-
mena on solitary islands
of the pacific had fur-
nished the impulse for it

   the thorough investiga-
tion of the iguana is-
lands the riddle of the
old civilization on easter
island and still other
goals were also in the
minds of the participants in this expedition
the members included the botanist prof
ortler of gottingen the mining expert vik-
tor zolling the meteorologist gumppendorf
prof gert van rhyn who was chief en-
gineer of the schuckert works and the sur-
g in geheimrat frank in addition there
were a few younger scientists and at the
last moment they were joined by dr ernst
schliiter the son of the criminologist
they went first to new york crossed the
american continent and finally sailed from
san francisco in the yacht nightingale
which had been placed at their disposal by
mr hastings a chilean planter

   almost at the start of the journey a great

storm came up which on the fifth day be-
came a regular hurricane sulphur-color-
ed clouds sped before banks of deep black
the waves foamed up high their crests
white and phosphorescent lightning
flashed while the roar of the sea drowned
out the thunder aided by the howling of the
wind uncanny st elmos fire danced al-
most incessantly on the two slim antenna
masts

the nightingale bobbed up and down
on the waves it was a stately private
yacht which its rich owner had equipped
with all modern accessories the effect of
the rolling of the ship was lessened by a
shock-absorbing system
ihe propellers weer driven
by electric motors and
the steersman was re-
placed by a robot steer-
ing device dr frank
the well-known surgeon
who was accompanying
ihe expedition as its phy-
sician had at his dispos-
al a sick-bay equipped
with every convenience

  to be sure before the
might of this tornado the
proud yacht was like a
nutshell it danced on
the crests of the giant
waves pitched from port
to starboard dipped its
prow deep into the val-
leys between the wavesand id the next mo-
ment was flooded by the speeding moun-
tains of water for three days the storm
had been raging with its utmost strength
creating a cyclone rare in these parts of the
ocean

   finally the nucleus of the cyclone lay be-
hind the ship for some moments the ex-
hausted travelers were granted repose but
tilings had gone ill with the white yacht
bad gaps yawned in the rail parts of the
bridge had been demolished in the storm
incessantly the crew worked at the pumps
and though all hatches and bulkheads were
shut water kept forcing its way inside
whatever was not actually fastened down

lay broken on the cabin floors

  until the few short moments during the
slackening in the gale no one had been able
to eat and even in this interlude of relaxa-
tion there had been no eating except some
bad coffee with sea water mixed in and some
cold meat nevertheless the brave men en-
joyed a splendid spectacle in uncanny
splendor the st elmos fire and the bright
flashes of lightning came from the black
sky while the sea opened up beneath them
shimmering in every color like a yawning
abyss of hell the men stood close to-
gether with serious pale faces at every
new giant wave which rushed against them
they heard the groaning of the ships plank-
ing and on their lips was an anxious ques-
tion each time a new mountainous wave
made it roll how long would the yacht hold
out

  gert van rhyn made use of a momentary
improvement in conditions to unfasten the
rope with which he had tied himself to the
rail clinging with his fingers he made
his way to the captain

  look out a new wave would have
swept the impetuous man overboard if paul
gesche the first officer who was now tend-
ing the wheel ordinarily operated automa-
tically had not sprung to his aid

  van rhyn turned to the captain what
is going to happen

  that depends on whether the ship can
survive the next six or nine hours

  where are we

  to tell you the truth i dont know we
have been driven far out of our course
stellar observations have been impossible
for days in this storm there was no way
of taking bearings that you could depend
on

  are there reefs here

  probably more than we want we can-
not be far from the iguana islands and
everywhere there are little uninhabited is-
lets and extinct volcanoes which rise steep-
ly out of the ocean perhaps we shall suc-
ceed in getting into some bay half an hour
ago i sighted reefs in the northeast if i
am not mistaken that may have been pinta
then a large island should appear to the
southwest

 is there a harbor there

 an ancient refuge for pirates other-
 wise generally speaking no ship ever pass-
 es these desolate islands

 the conversation was carried on in
 screams because of the storm then the
 gale lessened for a few minutes the other
 gentlemen likewise utilized the pause to
 climb up to the bridge it is getting some-
 what calmer was the general affirmation

a mysterious force

 anew and frightful flash of lightning
 blazed forth and showed white foam
 ahead of the ship they were still some
 two miles away from it but that meant little
 in view of their mad course in the storm

 there is a reef starboard gesche
 hard a-starboard

 what can that be

 i dont know exactly perhaps it is
 one of the little reefs of the iguana islands
 starboard gesche

 it is full starboard

 thunderation the ship doesnt obey the
 rudder

 the rudder works all right

 but the ship doesnt good heavens
 we are driving straight toward the reef
 signals were given for using the emer-
 gency rudder control

 everything works but the ship doesnt
 obey

 if the old legend of the magnetic moun-
 tain were not madness i should think the
 rock there was pulling us straight on in
 half an hour we shall be wrecked port
 gesche hard a-port perhaps that will
 work

 the rudder swung round but it had no
 effect the ship raced toward the rock

 around those rocks there must be coral
 reefs quite unknown to me i don l under-
 stand the waves are not foaming around
 the rocks they shoot up right in the open
 sea

 how they phosphoresce

 it almost looks as though the water at
 the crests of the waves were changing into
 boiling steam

 it is steam


wonder stories

  nonsense

  there came a new frightful burst of wind
the mainmast snapped with a short sharp
report flew overboard whizzed out in the
air and was carried off like a feather in
spite of its weight

  what is that

  suddenly the entire mast flamed up and
burned up in an instant high in the air
with a brilliant flame 

  what fearful lightning

  that wasnt lightning

  what was it

  lightning cant actually fuse a mast in
the air in a minute

  gentlemen we are lost

  get the lifeboats ready

  that is nonsense how could a boat
live a second in this hellish sea

  the men stood close together in their oil-
skins and- souwesters wearing lifebelts and
supporting vests each one convinced how-
ever that the equipment was useless des-
truction seemed certain and yet they could
not recognize what force it was that worked
so balefully so that the rudder failed com-
pletely though the chains were undamaged
and the motors were working with full pow-
er

  then with equal suddenness all became
perfectly calm the storm was still blow-
ing but the sea was perfectly smooth this
too seemed a miracle the waves changed
from the greatest roughness to complete
smoothness a few times more the ship
rolled from one side to the other as though
drunk and then it righted it rode abso-
lutely smoothly but even now it did not
obey the rudder no matter what exertions
were made the ship rode straight toward
the rock which now rose quite sharply from
the placid water

 a miracle an absolute miracle
  xtl the magnetic mountain

  the scientists and the captain had no ex-
planation for this they looked aft be-
hind them now already miles behind wild
foam rose up the same foam which they
had seen in front of them fifteen minutes
earlier

   that is quite impossible

  we are enchanted

 it is mockery of all the laws of nature
to have perfectly calm water here

  it appeared absolutely certain that the
yacht would crash on the cliffs in a few mo-
ments even if a miracle had brought it over
the girdle of reefs the reefs almost com-
pletely encircled this place which due to
some inexplicable circumstance was wind-
less

  again minutes passed which seemed an
eternity the strange power which their
ship obeyed and which was stronger than
motors and rudder was drawing them ir-
resistibly toward the cliffs their speed now
decidedly slow and then-the ship made
a turn avoided the coast was directed by an
invisible and mysterious power and slipped
along the shore the ship executed one
more turn as though it were in the hands
of a skillful pilot the officer in despera-
tion had long since abandoned the wheel

  in many turns the yacht passed by grim
cliffs which all presented a desolate unin-
habited face a little harbor opened up a
regular little harbor to be sure with a des-
ert shore on which there was not even a
trace of vegetation then the ship stopped
abruptly about a mile from the shore
drop that anchor

  the windlass did not obey the cable
simply could not be released it formed
a single solid mass yet the ship stood
quite still although there was certainly
a slight swell here the yacht remained ab-
solutely motionless

  all this is incredible

  hello there is some one standing on the
shore captain van breeken was holding
the telescope to his eye

  a savage

  no a european

  things are getting still crazier

  we must go ashore

  we will try to lower a boat

  the boat readily glided down at the dav-
its

  i dont feel like leaving the ship

  you dont need to captain

  the physician was the first one at the
ladder the other scientists all full of in-
tellectual curiosity all happy to have ei

caped the momentary danger got into the
boat the captain was just ordering some
of the crew to climb down to join them-
he and the other officers were to remain on
board-when another incredible thing hap-
pened the rope which held the boat to
the ship flamed up as though kindled by
an invisible flame it burned through and
at the same time again driven by an inex-
plicable power the motor boat began to
move gliding toward the coast while the
crew remained behind

  the scientists looked about them i he
yacht was turning around pointing its bow
toward the open sea while the captain
shouted loudly and waved his arms while
wild excitement reigned on board the yacht
it was going full speed to the open sea
again the gentlemen in the boat were
struck dumb they did not understand all
this then a slight grating could be heard
under the keel of the little motor boat and
it glided over the sand and was aground

  the men sprang out at least they felt
firm ground under foot again yet they
saw clearly the desperate situation in which
they were they were on land but a steep
rough rocky coast with only a narrow strip
of beach before it there was  house here
or any vegetation nor could anything be
seen of the european whom the captain
claimed to have observed the scientists
had in loto nothing but their oilskins they
were still in their lifebelts and swimming
vests and had with them not a bit of food
they could see the yacht far out on the
ocean becoming smaller and smaller in the
distance

         chapter ii
         more magic

the men climbed the steep wall here
human hands had evidently made a
convenient stairway and even provided a
rail

  now they were at the top looking around

it was plainly a small uninhabited island
upon which some miracle had brought them
round about them stretched the open sea
the weather had become fair the hurricane y

had blown itself out and only great black
clouds still sped across the sky the yacht
was no longer to be seen

  the island is uninhabited they agreed

  prof van rhyn raised his hand gen-
tlemen have you an explanation for all
this

  unfortunately no

  do you believe in the lodestone moun-
tain

  we are dreaming or we have lost our
reason

  now dr schluter who had thus far kept
quite apart from the others cried out gen-
tlemen the magic is continuing

  they looked around and what now ap-
peared to them was again mad enough
up at the top of the stairway at the point
where they stood on the bare rock a few
minutes earlier there was now a tent a
pretty gaily colored tent brightly lit up
by the now brilliant sun it stood open
and in it stood a table with six comfortable
chairs around it and on this table was
a refrigerating compartment with all sorts
of good things caviar oysters lobsters
cold roasts salads beautiful ctystal glass-
es stood there and in the ice section lay
several bottles of rhine wine

  dr frank laughed contentedly if we
really are here in the realm of a magician
i is at any rate a charming magician who
knows that we are hungry

  dr ortler shook his head in vexation
if it is human work it is certainly a most
incredible violation of our freedom
j frank laughed quick gentlemen
one must take feasts as they come who
knows when this wishing table will vanish
again

  prof zolling remained somewhat hesi-
tant shall we really  

  frank had already filled a glass and was
reaching into a dish the oysters are ex-
cellent

  now they all felt a terrible hunger for
they had hardly eaten for three days

  frank raised his glass to the health
of the magician
i supposing it is all poisoned

  it is all the same to me said prof

gumppendorf struggling with an immense
spoonful of caviar

  ortler still hesitated i cannot bear
tilings which i cannot understand

  then go hungry friend the lobster
is magnificent

  there sat these six men who hardly knew
what was happening to them who had just
escaped certain death in the hurricane and
were now on a wild inhospitable coast sit-
ting in comfortable chairs eating the finest
delicaciflfe and drinking splendid rhine
wine

  frank wiped his mouth but now   
he could not continue for just as unexpect-
edly as the table had been conjured up out
of nothing there now suddenly stood before
them a young man evidently a european
wearing a becoming sport suit he had his
hat in his hand gentlemen i have the
honor to welcome you

  the six men stared at the stranger who
spoke with the intonation of a german-am-
erican he was tall thin weatherbeaten
and stern of face and somewhat wild in
appearance but he wore a faultless sport
suit and had the manners of a man of the
world

  prof ortler addressed him what is
really the matter here

  the stranger smiled permit me to in-
troduce myself white bob white-dr
frank professor ortler and the other gen-
tlemen  have the honor as representative
of the settlement of santa scientia to bid
you welcome

  santa scientia doesnt that mean sac-
red science

  just about

  ortler shook his head i do not under-
stand 

white smiled i must beg your par-
don for the somewhat violent manner
in which we obtained the pleasure of your
presence  hope that you will understand
everything after you have been our guests
in the capital isabella

  i he devil take-

  please leave that unpleasant gentleman
out most honored gentlemen everything
whirh now perhaps appears to you somewhat

strange can be explained in natural ways
in a few hours you will perceive that we
acted in your interests when we freed you
from the annoyances of the hurricane
ortler turned to his colleagues the
man is evidently insane

  bob white acted as though he had not
heard the remark i must put before you
after being our guests our proposal that you
enter the service of our great cause for five
years 

  the devil we will accept

  again the stranger passed over the re-
mark in case then you decline our pro-
posal and wish to return ijome-we shall of
course accede to this wish-well in this
case i must ask you to give your word of
honor your word of honor as scientists to
say nothing on your return of what you have
seen and experienced here

  and if we do not give our word
then in a few hours your yacht which
is still held fast within our power will re-
turn you will go on board again and you
as well as we will have lost something that
we might have gained

  frank who up to this moment had con-
tinued eating looked up  want to know
what is actually going on here

  you give your word of honor

  here is my hand

  zolling had been reflecting if you
think so frank 

  van rhyn nodded vigorously

  do you in return promise to explain
everything to us

  of course you will see everything
then you have my word cried zolling
also

  gumppendorf likewise nodded i
agree

  dr schliiter extended his hand i too
ortler gave a sigh of vexation then 
am outnumbered here my hand

  i expected nothing else let me explain
briefly what has happened thus far it all
appears to you as a miracle but in reality
there is nothing at all strange about it
excuse me	j

  of course it was not hard for us in san-
tc scientia to learn that you were on that
yacht
utopia island



  but actually what is this sacred

       ton

science 

  you will learn that later today i
should just like to indicate that santa scien-
l  is destined to become the heart and brain
of the entire world

  at any rate that is not quite modest
you will judge otherwise after you
know everything it is simple for us lo be
informed about everything going on in the
world thus we knew of your expedition
knew that you planned to go to the islands
of the pacific and also that you dr sclilii-
ter came on a sort of police business i
may say that in a short time you will meet
in person the germans who vanished about
five years ago-not against their wills but
with their complete agreement

  while schlliter was listening oilier ask-
ed what gentlemen

  our fellow-workers the engineer rom-
er prof weigand and 

  ortler nodded now i begin to under-
stand these gentlemen are 

  quite right the founders of santa scien-
tia therefore during the hurricane which
was very handy for us   

  very kind of you

  we could always follow the position of
your ship and once you came within the
sphere of our electrical long distance con-
trol we simply removed your independent
power of motion and attracted you to our
coast you know that is an old invention
indicating nothing extraordinary

  well well

some explanations

tte furthermore have the power-to
yv explain which would consume too
much time at present-of quieting the sea in
our harbor you must have noticed that in
spite of the blowing of the storm here tile
waves were perfectly smooth this is an
invention of our friend vetter it depends
on the theory of atomic disintegration and
involves a system of submarine pipes
strong and specially adapted electric cur-
rents are continuously that i during
storms operated in a circuit of about two
kilometers outside the island great quan-

tities of hydrogen atoms are sent up from
below these produce the light foam which
you -saw covering our harbor and which
seemed to you outside as breakers

  the wall of hydrogen atoms rising there
causes the on-rushing waves to calm down so
that there is a quiet sea in the harbor it
is the same effect that is produced with oil
only ours is much stronger once you had
come within our sphere of long distance
control and had- crossed the wall of foam
you were in safety it is too bad that
through a slight error the artificial light-
ning which was really only to burn through
the rope fastening your boat to the yacht
was sent- too soon and burned up one of
the masts of your ship we shall be glad
to make good the damage

  incredible

  the scientists looked at the man who
spoke of such seemingly impossible things
with perfect naturalness their eyes becom-
ing larger and larger van rhyn said i
think we are dreaming no i am dream-
ing everything-about you also

  white smiled you will soon under-
stand everything i am just giving you brief
explanations so that you may see that the
unusual and rather violent form of our in-
vitation was unfortunately inevitable and
just for your own good

  but 

  no no there is nothing wonderful about
it if one rightly knows how to use the
forces of nature

  it is unbelievable

  white smiled slightly nothing that
happens is unbelievable it was neither a
mountain of lodestone which attracted you
nor are you in the realm of a magician
you are simply in a land which is a few
centuries ahead of the rest of the world
and where is this puzzling santa scien-
tia

  in a very pleasant and fertile region
which is still indicated on the maps as the
completely uninhabited main island of the
iguana archipelago

  but here we are on a reef and not on an
island on which there can be a city to say
nothing of a whole realm

  quite right we are on a reef lying out-


wonder stories

side the main island it is several hundred
kilometers from here at present we have
reasons for not having open harbors though
there could be no objections on the part of
the state of puitu from which the islaqd was
bought by our chief mr benjamin cook
or if you prefer king benjamin the first
of santa scientia

  zolling was getting nervous if i may
ask how do we get over to the island
by the electric railway explained
white calmly

  by 

  dr schluter interrupted where is the
tent

  oh yes  thought you had finished
eating see here is a concealed stone block
set in the rock purposely made irregular in
form this block can be raised and lower-
ed it simply stands on a pillar and
brought up the tent with the little break-
fast while you were looking at the island
because i hoped that you had eaten enough
and would now do me the honor to come
to pur capital isabella my people caused
the tent to disappear again

  it is a very useful device it occasion-
ally happens that we have to do with per-
sons whom we do not wish to take behind
the scenes we can entertain them here
but we are cautious and only invite really
eminent persons

  a soft whistle sounded

  are the gentlemen ready the chief is
already asking where we are

  king benjamin the first

  say simply the chief here we do not
know ourselves whether we are a kingdom
a republic or a joint stock company ac-
tually the only thing we do not have is poli-
tics

  the men looked at one another if the
good food had not given them a pleasant
sense of comfortable repletion if such ex-
cellent delicacies had not just passed their
teeth they would still have been inclined to
think it a dream hesitatingly they follow-
ed mr white

  again a part of the rock had opened
stops led into a room brightly lighted by
invisible lamps at the side of which there
stood open the door of a vehicle partly re-

sembling an elevator and partly an electric

street car

  we could have taken you directly to
isabella but first we had to have your word
of honor to maintain our national secret
the men nodded in understanding

chapter iii
in santa scientia

the men entered the car even now
they saw no living being except their
guide as he shut the door

  look out we go down now rather fast
you must remember that the sea and these
cliffs are everywhere very deep and that we
must go down more than a hundred meters
dr zolling think of the shaft of a mine
the car slipped downward very fast in-
deed but quite noiselessly and then it gave
a little jerk

  now we are going on an inclined plane
into the real tunnel it would be useless
loss of time to change cars

  soon after that the car entered upon a
level quite at a much greater speed

  we shall soon be at our destination
here we go about five hundred kilometers
an hour  told you already that there is
just a single tube in which our car is pro-
pelled floating freely this is the only
possible submarine railway of the future
it is incomprehensible that it has not yet
been used in the rest of the world for it is
not costly to build we made this line in
a few months

  chief engineer van rhyn looked ques-
tioningly at him excuse me but are we
then in a tunnel under the sea

  absolutely not tunnelling is useless-
ly expensive and also exposed to a thousand
dangers especially in a zone where earth-
quakes are not infrequent we regret that
we had to have the last part which passes
under the land in the form of a tunnel
then what sort of a road is this

  a tube road nothing is used but a
single tube lying about  meters below
sea level it is made of a certain alloy
which is not attacked by sea water and it
utopia

island



floats freely in the sea at a depth making
it independent of the motion of the sea

  the tube filled with air mostly with
strongly compressed air of course has a
strong buoyancy now it is anchored to
the bottom of the sea every five hundred
meters by two hawsers also made of this
alloy so that it cannot rise higher but on
the other hand cannot sink any lower such
slight oscillations as may perhaps occur do
not matter

  and how did you put together this tube
which is at least five hundred kilometers
jong

   we didnt it is all in one piece
i i beg your pardon

  that is a process worked out by our
engineer you will see it yourself a
great compression machine is set up where
the tube comes out into the sea white hot
metal is continuously supplied from above
while a piston in the inside presses this
metal into the tube form as the tube is
of course temporarily closed in front it is
forced out of the mould into the sea be-
cause this tube by no means has to be thick-
walled and therefore is not heavy it is
now dragged by ships on cables at about the
desired height until the next station is
reached and the anchoring can be begun
thus we have a completely closed tube

  and do the cars move in it by com-
pressed air

  yes and more the tube is lined close-
ly with copper wire bedded in iron at
definite -intervals high tension cables bring
current to sunken transformers therefore
there results a continually progressing
electric field which pulls the car forward
and lightens the work of the compressed
air now because the car itself is some-
what smaller than the diameter of the tube
and thus leaves a slight open space about
it it is raised during the trip into a floating
position a system of running wheels
serves only for the car to run on at the
start of the trip and to keep it from touch-
ing the walls in this way there is no fric-
tion and there is very little strain on the
tube

  you saw that at first we glided down
like an elevator we sank into an auto-

matically closing compressed air chamber
and then we shot forward into the per-
fectly horizontal tube the hard glass win-
dows-made by schotts process being
jena glass-are so fitted to the outer walls
that there is a perfectly smooth surface and
these little apparatus on the ceiling allow
sufficient access of oxygen gentlemen we
have nearly finished our trip you already
see that we are gliding more slowly i have
the honor to welcome you to the soil of
santa scientia in the city isabella

the travelers had the sensation of float-
ing upward then the car stopped
when the door now opened they found
themselves a bit dazed by the quick jour-
ney in a circular arched hall its walls uni-
formly covered with a marble-like mass
bluish in shade decorated with gold orna-
ments there were no windows but the
room was as bright as day despite the fact
that no mode of illumination was visible
the indirect light seemed to come from the
walls themselves the room in no way sug-
gested the lobby of a hotel in a circle in
the center arranged in pairs stood a num-
ber of comfortable armchairs

  you will certainly want to wash and
change your clothes i therefore request
you to go on to your rooms we have taken
the liberty to provide you with everything
necessary would you like to lodge-in
pairs good you shall find everything
to your convenience may i ask how you
wish to be paired

  dr frank nodded to the mining engin-
eer zolling does it suit you

  ortler stepped over to the meteorologist
perhaps we two

  van rhyn nodded to schliiter then
we will lodge together

  may i ask you to sit down a minute in
these armchairs

  they complied noting that the chairs
were numbered

  we are wet and dirty

that does not matter please
somewhat hesitatingly they sat down
bob white pressed a button three hith-
erto perfectly invisible doors opened in the
smooth walls the chairs began to move


wonder stories

glided with their occupants through the
domed room and reached an obliquely as-
cending passage again three doors open-
ed and a few seconds later each couple
was in a cheerful room although they
were provided with little furniture they were
still pleasant a soft carpet covered the
floor the walls to be sure had no pictures
but they had a warm agreeable tint in
the center stood a low table with a com-
fortable leather sofa before it arid there was
likewise a desk and chair yet there was
no sign of a door in the walls and there
was neither a wardrobe nor a bed nor a
washstand

  a most remarkable roqm zolling

  it almost seems as though we had got
into a trap and were locked in

  and where is there any way of washing
or even a bell

  look ovet there

  in the center of the wall a light could
now be seen not an electric light but a cir-
cular luminous spot frank stepped over
to it and when he was still a few paces
from it a piece of the wall moved aside
before them lay a very neat bathroom like-
wise finished in bluish marble with two
compartments having tubs in them in
front of them on a bench lay clothing shirts
sox underclothes complete business suits
shoes and everything else necessary from
two faucets warm and cold water was run-
ning into the tubs

  that looks fine

  but are we really to take those suits

  i dont know what else we could do

  the men bathed left behind their clothes
damaged by three days of storm dressed
themselves in the obviously brand new lin-
ens and the suits and then returned to the
main room at once the door closed be-
hind them the luminous circle now moved
over from its place to a new spot above the
desk

  look zolling said frank to his room-
mate

  on the top of the desk was now visible
a glass plate illuminated from below
lnder it appeared words in roman letters
marked telephone kitchen chief service
mail airplane electric railway doctor toi-

let beside each word was a little red but-
ton there likewise stood on the list the
names of the meji and after each pair the
number of a room

  look there

  above the desk there was likewise in-
serted a glass plate which they had not
hitherto noticed because it had not been
illuminated until now on this plate ap-
peared writing do the men wish to eat
together do the men wish to eat in their
room after each of these questions was
again a red button

  a very pleasant kind of service i think
we will eat with the others frank press-
ed the button and the writing changed

  in ten minutes please

  oh id like to shave first i look like
a savage but i have no razor

  try your luck with the service button

a perfect hotel

zolling pressed the button a small
cupboard in the wall opened and out
came a mahogany shelf with a telephone
i should like to shave but i havent any
equipment

  there was no reply but almost at once
another cupboard opened another shelf
came out and on it stood a complete razor
kit with all other necessaries

  indeed very pleasant

  in ten minutes there again appeared on
one surface of the wall the luminous circle
at the same time there was a soft buzzing
the two men moved toward it and again a
door opened the same one through which
they had entered before the door stood a
small padded open vehicle

  the elevator

  they seated themselves and at once the
car glided with them along the rails which
were set into the floor glided on to a turn-
table and entered another passage and a
likewise round room in which a table was
set for six persons at the same time there
came from two other sides the other four
of their friends

  they all reported the same experiences
  in truth a perfect hotel

  they stepped to the dining table be-
utopia

island



fore each seat lay a very extensive menu
and wine card after each food offered
there was again a button

  shall we have soup

  they pressed the buttons after a short
time a circular place opened in the middle
of the table and a dumb-waiter came up
the section of the table now stood on three
decorative pillars above the dumb-waiter
and on this were six plates of soup

  ortier the ever nervous one grinned con-
tentedly

  excellent we dont have to have a
waiter who puts his thumb in the plate
frank surveyed the wine card come
one lets drink

  the wine also appeared with equal swift-
ness then the dumb-waiter remained vis-
ible until they had placed on it the empty
plates and the next course ordered by the
buttons appeared in the same manner

  frank was decidedly enthusiastic this
is what i call truly an ingenious solution
of the hotel question he cried

  van rhyn nodded at the same time
probably simple and practical somewhere
near the kitchens sits a man who takes the
orders if a house is built thus right from
the start     

  finally they had eaten enough auto-
matically there appealed cigars cigarettes
and pipes and tobacco besides lighters and
ash trays

  excellent

  again there was a buzzing and then the
table which stood on a circular slab sank
the opening closed and there were now
six chairs there please this word ap-
peared in the middle of the platform

  the men who were becoming more and
more enthusiastic about these startling
things seated themselves again there was
a buzzing and the platform rose and dis-
appeared with them through a circular
spacewhich opened in the ceiling they
were now in a vaulted room made entirely
of glass a sort of conservatory in which
stood palms and blooming plants and which
offered a view in all directions on a
table at the side stood a pot of steaming
coffee some little cakes and six cups

  the gentlemen stood together and looked
out so this is the iguana islands

  i still feel that i am dreaming

  where the devil is the city

  it was a single great garden upon which
they were looking the glass pavilion
seemed to lie on a low hill in the midst of
a great park which was interrupted every-
where by such hills and was divided by
decorative fences into separate sections
everything breathed fertility little springs
spread a pleasant freshness parrots swung
in rings and great cages contained gay-
feathered songbirds the sun shone but
if was covered by a light veil of mist

   do not understand all this where
the devil is the city

ccaou are in the middle of it gentle-
x men i hope that you are content
for the present mr white again stood
before them

  you do not actually have to believe in
a fairy tale here you simply see a city
which is intentionally built practically at
the moment we are in the eleventh story of
the houses what you see before you are
simply roof gardens i certainly admit
that many things were favorable that the
entire city of isabella which is erected for
ten thousand persons is now inhabited by
barely one thousand that it was built all
on one plan by mr cook and that there
was no need to be sparing of expenses
but whence comes this vast wealth
from pure chance some years ago a
german scientist prof alesius who was
cast on this island by the wreck of the air-
ship in which he was going from san fran-
cisco to yokohama discovered the old caves
in which ruminjahui the faithful general
of the last inca emperor concealed his
rulers body and also his entire stores of
gold and jewels mr cook became ac-
quainted with prof alesius in san fran-
cisco the scientist joyfully agreed to the
use that the chief wished to make of this
wealth then mr cook simply bought the
island of isabella and the neighboring reefs
from the government of puita i think he
will speak of all this with you himself
may i now take you to him


wonder stories

  we are indeed eager to meet this magi-
cian

  again they seated themselves in the
chairs and zolling remarked shaking ilia
head it is incredible how quickly one gets
used to these things

  they went through a whole system of
passages then doors opened and they were
in a great rectangular room in die center
of which stood a large desk befoore it
sat in a chair-mr cook

  the chief was a tall man with clear cat
truly american face promising great clever-
ness and determination

  he now arose and addressed his visitors
in fluent german gentlemen i must ask
your pardon for the strange way in which
you were received and as it were conducted
here against your will yo yourselves will
perceive the reasons it is a perfectly
unique realm into which you are entering
you are practically making a leap into the
future when chance brought to light a
great treasure i had a long consultation
with my friend the german scientist ale-
sius

  this treasure which foresight had pre-
served for centuries was not to be squan-
dered for mundane purposes but i was of
the opinion that it also need not remain un-
used then came to me the idea of founding
a sort of island of the future tremendous
things all being done for the betterment of
human life here clever city planners have
worked out new ideas they find a field
here to work out their ideas uninfluenced by
prej udices

  it is not a question of changing the old
but of creating the new great inventors
have devised tremendous things-here they
are realized great physicians and scien-
tists are here to find peace and everything
that they can use to make their researches
live

  the experiment shall be made of found-
ing a state of enlightened persons of work-
ers of the mind completely free from politi-
cal entanglements we want to strive to
remove from man all mechanical drudgery
and to substitute automatic machines
among many other things we wantio lead
sport into altogether new paths we shall

try to show the world that the man of ihe
future will be a cheerful happy healthy
long-lived person for this it was neces-
sary to steal from the world so to speak
the best brains a sort of intellectual flower-
hood and then as we hope to win them to
our program it will be a pleasure for me
to conduct you about and to let you see
everything for yourselves

  this speech had produced a remarkably
strange impression from this man who
decidedly gave the impression of youthful
creative joy and was by no means self con-
scious or overstrained there was transmitted
a strikingly calming influence since no one
replied mr cook arose with a smile

  f thank you for the confidence which i
read in your eyes and for your inner agree-
ment which i feel i certainly hope that
in the future you will not lose this con-
fidence and i beg you to excuse me if i
now leave you alone for a short time in
these booklets i can offer you a guide which
will give you an explanation about the ori-
gin of santa scientia before i leave you
to your reading i should like to acquaint
you with some more of my fellow workers
who are probably waiting near at hand so
please be patient a moment

chapter iv
a spy

cook went out with a friendly bow and
frank cried out involuntarily a
strange man

  he is certainly not an every-day speci-
men

  and still less a deceiver

  this last was said by dr schliiter and
now van rhyn stepped over to him par-
don ine doctor if i use this moment of
our being alone to ask a question which
i should like to do in the presence of my
colleagues on shipboard in view of the
storm we had no chance to become closely
acquainted but now we shall probably have
to live together for a considerable period
may  ask whether we may welcome in you
a colleague a scientist

  i am a criminologist
utopia island



  a criminologist

  i owe you a more detailed explanation
in the last few months certain events had
occurred repeating some of five years ago
you know that then a number of particu-
larly outstanding scientists vanished from
germany without leaving a trace i do not
know whether you have followed the re-
ports

  yes occasionally

  well then exactly three months ago
there disappeared from berlin in a single
day a great number of persons who had
already made a name for themselves among
them the engineers bollman and muller
this time they were chiefly mechanics and
chemists and even some whole families with
wives and children after some time there
arrived in almost every case a postcard
from san francisco to the relatives of the
missing man saying that all was well with
him it is obvious that the police began
to wonder about this continued removal of
german citizens and so i was given the
duty of going myself to san francisco and
to try from there to learn something but
in frisco no one knew anything only i
happened to hear obscure rumors that puz-
zling things were happening on the iguana
islands in the pacific islands hitherto un-
known to me

  at that time i made- the acquaintance of
the owner of the yacht nightingale since
i also learned of your expedition gentle-
men i gratefully accepted the proposal of
the chilean planter that i come along on
the boat i had a definite feeling that i
should accomplish something in your com-
pany but i did not at once venture to ac-
quaint you with my plans and hopes be-
cause i was afraid you would object to
my travelling with you

  van rhyn extended him his hand what
you say is very interesting  think  ex-
press the opinion of my friends when i
assure you that you are welcome to us it
is just in our position that it might be very
useful for us to have along a man with
the trained knowledge of humanity pos-
sessed by a criminologist

  schl liter bowed and thanked him and
then they sat down again they addressed

themselves to the cigarettes which stood be-
fore them and awaited with the tension of
people about to solve an interesting prob-
lem the return of mr cook and the prom-
ised arrival of his fellow workers

  while the members of the expedition were
talking with mr cook and waiting for him
to bring them the gentlemen who were to
explain to them the mysteries and marvels
of santa scientia and its capital isabella
bob white the secretary of the american
had another and equally remarkable exper-
ience white actually of german descent
and named at birth robert weiss had be-
come externally an american he com-
bined the americans iron power for work
with the germans capability for enthusi-
asm and had hardly found time in the
last few years to think of the land of his
birth he was now sitting at a hurried
piece of work which had been interrupted
by the reception of the germans when he
was most unexpectedly reminded of his
earliest youth by a strange occurrence

  he was startled by a ringing of a bell
a ground glass pane was in the wall and
on this now appeared writing zeppelin
 safely back from frisco please use
the telephone

  he grasped the receiver

  a young man has come from frisco on
the zeppelin

  how can that be

  i do not know the airship has dis-
tant control and carries only cargo no
mechanic went along when we were un-
loading the young man jumped out and
asked for mr cook he refuses any in-
formation that he will give any only to his
majesty king benjamin or to his excel-
lency the royal chancellor

  a ridiculous fellow

ut te doesnt please us either he is ap-
x j- parently very young and always has
a mocking smile he appears to me a spy
who has been sent by some government to
investigate us again and maybe he bribed
mbller in frisco

  moller is dependable just send the
young fellow here

  it was certainly an everyday occurrence


wonder stories

for spies of various countries especially the
united states and england to try to pry
out the secrets of the iguana islands

  already a bell was riging the door open-
ed automatically and one of the cars of
the electric house railway stopped before
it it was so fixed that it exactly covered
the doorwayvand there was no exit for the
occupant except into the room

  out stepped a small slender boyish man
he stood still as bob cast a glance at his
face though he had already seen these fea-
tures before on these features much more
mature than one would have expected in a
boy white detected something remotely
familiar

  the newcomer made a deep bow while a
bold sort of mockery lurked about his
mouth your excellency-i do not know
how to address the royal chancellor
bob white wrinkled his brow stop
this childishness my name is bob white
again the stranger smiled i do not be-
lieve that

  bob started what do you want why
do you force your way unexpectedly into
our country what impels you to behave
so improperly

  the stranger shrugged his shoulders
you have asked many questions which i
cannot answer all at once

  you have refused to show your pa-
pers

  because i have none-that is very sim-
ple

  who are you

  i i am elso dorn

  white sprang up who

  elso dorn and if i am not mistaken
-even if you are ten times over royal
chancellor or king or tyrant of the fabled
iguaua islands-you are my cousin robert
who was born not white but weiss

  bob stared at her and now understood
why this face had appeared so familiar to
him little cousin elso had been just a
girl when he had left germany years be-
fore

  she seined to guess his thoughts quite
right i was five years old when you sud-

denly disappeared now i am unfortunate
ly twenty-two already if you are still
doubtful i remember exactly that i of-
fered you my pancake when you came to
get your money that last time from my poor
father your guardian

  elsa-is it really you

  certainly but you do not seem very
polite since you have not even offered me
a chair

  bob stared at the girl please sit down

i

  you are surprised at my appearance
it is however very simple and understand-
able that for this trip i preferred to choose
mens clothing a lone girl does not like
to travel out into the world without dis-
guise

  then you are      bob sought for
words while elsa who had her hair cut
short in mannish fashion sat down

  all this is not so strange father is
dead and mother survived him only a few
weeks all that happened two years ago
i was all alone even if my parents had
educated me to be independent and had
made me learn all sorts of things

  i took a position with a german firm
and went to america a year ago i came
to frisco i must admit that i often
thought of you i had heard that you were
prospering somewhere in the world that
you had made your fortune then i thought
that fortune might be coming to me out
in the world unfortunately i was wrong
the german firm which had engaged me
became bankrupt luckily i knew sufficient
english by this time and i got a place as
secretary with smith  co in frisco v

  with our agents

  quite right we were all pledged to
maintain silence about the affairs of the firm

i must have become very useful for in the
course of time  became private secretary
tc mr moller and thus learned much about
the strange city of isabella and the still
stranger business which mr moller carried
on for this city it is only too understand-
able that i thought about it and cherished
certain hopes
utopia

island



a vexatious problem

r moller whom i tried to ques-
tion declined any information
therefore i resolved to attend to matters
myself i knew that the iguana islands had
something to do with it even though they
were marked in the atlas as simply desert
islands likewise i knew that every week a
zeppelin went there and that the craziest
rumors about the great mystery of these
island were current in frisco so i re-
solved to set out that was not hard i
knew that the zeppelins used to land on the
reef of santa rosa near los angeles in
order not to be surprised by the american
authorities and that a submarine handled
the business between this island purporting
to belong lo mr moller and frisco

  i got leave for a trip to new york slow-
ed away in the submarine and hid a few
days in the freight sheds which are placed
underground at santa rosa the zeppelin
came but there were no passengers to be
seen i sneaked into the cabin by night
of course i had food with me yet it was
not a pleasant hour when the good airship
moved out bound for  knew not where 

  the cabin was locked luckily without
any inspection of it being made if a pas-
senger had arrived at the last moment if
mr moller had learned something of the
trickery i really do not know what i should
have done

  the flight began it was splendid beau-
tiful beyond description below lay the
foaming sea while i floated high in the
air i was now perfectly safe the pilot
surely had no time while en route to bother
about me unfortunately it became bitterly
cold and there must have been a bad storm
because i felt wretched finally  became
better and i even ventured to move slightly
the curtain covering the glass door leading
to the pilots cabin at this moment my
courage sank to the zero point when  saw
that there was no pilot there i was all
alone in the ship flying over the sea i
roust admit that i thought myself lost and
supposed that the airship had broken loose
finally i became calmed by the evenness of
the course and the fact that the ship pet-

formed evidently intentional turns i real-
ized that an ingenious distant control system
was at work then the fairy ship sank in
great circles to earth we made an excel-
lent landing and a very rude man received
me

 you certainly are brave

 that is probably a family trait
 then you know that i was here in isa-
 bella

 not an idea of it but i recognized you
 at once when i saw you sitting here at the
 table

 and what do you want here

 the same thing you are doing to make
 my fortune in isabella nothing more

 bob walked up an ddown you have
 acted frivolously

 perhaps not

 you did not even know that the ship was
 coming to isabella

 where else was it to go

 what would you have done if i had not
 been here

 i did nol think of you at all

 do you know how you impressed the
 man who found you

 how should  know

 as a spy

 good heavens is that how i look

 i really do not know what to do with

 you

 get me a position in which i can do
 something

 i know of none we have only six
 europeau women here anyway

 then i am number seven let us hope
 not the unlucky seventh

 dont make poor jokes

 you need me

 no bob could not help admiring el-
 sas courage but the whole matter was very
 vexatious to him what was a single girl
 to do here

 you need a typist

 no our typewriters are so made that
 we jusl dictate into a tube and by the use
 of selenium cells the speech is changed into
 writing so the machines operate auto-
 matically

 wonderful i wanted te invent that
 long ago then you need  filing clerk

 ually the brave girl with the ever
 smiling face was making him better hum-
 ored

   a cook

   our machines attend to the cooking
   a maid

   the machines do that work

   a sport teacher

  to instruct men ou surely do not
 think you could do that

  exactly what position do you have
 here

   private secretary to mr cook to whom
 the islands belong

   what sort of a man is he

  i became acquainted with him when i
 came to chicago when i was a dishwasher
 in a cheap chicago lunch room he needed
 a secretary had confidence in me and saw
 that he could use me so he took me along
 then it was all the same to me where i
 went

  that was nice of him and now
 now i am so to speak his right hand
 man

   and later you will be his successor
   nonsense

   you dont deserve it either

   are you sure

   because you are a very bad man

   you do not know me at all

  this strange man had taken you and
 made something of you and you are not
 even willing to bother about me though i
 gave you my only pancake when you left
 berlin

   bob laughed do you still feel abso-
 lutely certain

   isnt it so

   it was no accident that mr moller took
  you into his business i knew of you and
  asked mr cook to try you out

   is that true she stepped very close
 to him listen bob you are a splendid
 fellow you must be and your mr cook
 must also be even if i still know almost
 nothing of this fabulous santa scientia and
 its capital isabella they say that this mr
 cook is the richest man in the world
 bob laughed he isnt badly off
 anyway you have become something

with him now show that you want to help
me keep me here take me to mr cook
speak for me and do not send me away
again

  if i only knew what to do with you
  then think

elsa had taken a cigarette from the box
which stood on the table lighted it and
seated herself comfortably in the chair
she appeared to bob to be the personifica-
tion of will power this girl who had flown
alone across the sea

chapter v
after five year

again a bell sounded at once the
door opened and a little table rolled
in automatically with a letter on it

  airmail from frisco bob opened the
letter laughed and handed it to elsa this
will interest you

         by zeppelin  your cousin elsa
      dorn is coming as a stowaway i
      intentionally allowed her departure
      to test her courage i advise you
      to keep the diligent and dependable
      girl there moller

  elso blushed and looked in embarrass-
ment at bob

  you see you did not succeed in deceiv-
ing mr moller the ship was purposely
not searched because they knew well that
you were in the cabin

  she pouted a little too bad i should
have been glad to fool you

  bob stroked her hand welcome to
santa scientia what is to be done with
you i dont know i will speak with mr
cook and i hope that since moller recom-
mends you he will keep you here firt
you must change your clothes and become
a gill again before i present you to mr
cook

  i certainly have no intention of going
around here as a man that was just as a
disguise

  have you any luggage

  this handbag in which i have a dress
and the most needful things you may
imagine that i could not take a trunk along
utopia

island



i left everything in hopes that i would find
something here

  on the glass plate a word appeared
telephone

  bob shook his head what is the matter
now

  on the plane which brought the letter
came a large trunk addressed to miss dorn
there is no lady of this name here

  yes there is the trunk is to go to
the hotel room 

  elsa had listened with astonishment
what has come

  naturally your big trunk which mr
moller carefully sent after you go to room
 and change your clothes

  where is the room i do not know my
way here

  just get in the car in which you came
wait a minute there now i have told the
good car where you want to go see you
soon i expect you in half an hour as a
girl

  bob had turned a few levers and pressed
some buttons now elsa got into the car
which still stood in the open doorway
looking at it curiously bob again pressed
a button on the long switchboard at once
before elsa could speak the door closed and
the car glided away it had no windows
and she did not know through how many
passages and over how many inclines whiph
she seemed to sense and around how many
corners it glided before it stood with open
door at the entrance to a room she en-
tered a large rectangular room bright and
cheerful having warm tapestries and com-
fortable furniture

  at once the door closed closing up the
place in the wall where it had been

  elsa looked around and stepped to the
window an indescribable picture met her
eye she was evidently high up far be-
low here lay streets but they were streets
in which there were no vehicles they were
covered with grass and edged with flowers
on both sides of the streets rose gigantic
building houses of glass and iron within
which lights shone for evening had come
above these houses two or three stories
above her lay gardens in which rose high

glass towers which radiated bright lights
it was all like a fairy tale

  elsa stepped back from the window she
knew perfectly well that previously the
room had been empty now there stood at
one side her large trunk which she had
left in frisco she opened it on one wall
appeared a circular light she stepped over
toward it when she was still several feet
from the wall a door flew open and she
perceived a bath with all sorts of conven-
iences

  half an hour later elsa wearing a sport
suit was again in feminine clothing she
looked at the clock aud saw that her cousin
was awaiting her but how was she to reach
him when she could not even find a door
then a bell sounded at once the wall
opened the car was ready and an unseen
voice called from a loud speaker please
get in she entered and at once the car
sped away with her

bob white was sitting in his room and
beside him dr george helling the di-
rector of air transport in isabella and a
young woman dear george let me pre-
sent to you the spy who arrived

  well who is that

  my cousin elsa dorn who has come
to isabella at the suggestion of mr moller
-dr helling our transportation director
-mrs helling will you be so kind as to
look after my cousin a little mrs helling
the young woman held out her hand to
elsa welcome to isabella it is delight-
ful that you have come

  when elsa looked around the two men
had left the room elsa was alone with
the young woman

  pretty little margarete helling was a
vivacious person what will you do here
she asked excitedly what work will you
take over we are all busy here that is
we work with our minds and go in for sport
to keep our bodies in trim for subordinate
things there are machines here but we
shall see you will become acquainted with
mr cook he will look at you and see
what you can do there are no incapable
persons here they are not admitted it ia

well that you came toward evening by day
nobody has any lime to spare

  but do you know what is wrong we
have too few women young women we
have no girls at all here i hope you will
not be the only one we havent even a
womans cluh in santa isabella yet

  she looked very charming and she evi-
dently was speaking rapidly because in
elsa dorn she was seeing for the first time
in years a young girl and the two were near
in age to feel an immediate kinship elsa
was at once delighted with the gay grete
helling

  while elsa dorn alone with mrs helling
was inwardly rejoicing that she had got out
of this ticklish meeting so well bob white
was entering the room of mr cook in which
the american who had already seen the
other gentlemen came to meet him

  dear bob if you expect some more
cousins from germany try to find a better
time for them to come

  then you know

  of course i know moller questioned me
beforehand onlywe wanted to surprise
you a little but be quick now our visi-
tors have been waiting for half an hour
and i cannot well tell them that your cousin
ie to blame

  mr cook seemed in an especially good
humor they went into the hall and at
once the american after excusing himself
for his long absence introduced the new-
comers to those who had been there be-
fore dr frank you know your colleague
prof weigand do you not mr van
rhyn you will be interested to see again
your former colleague mr gerard vetter
prof zolling you will find an old college
friend in mr eberhard romer

  the new guests looked more and more
amazed there stood the men who five
years before had been reported missing and
had been mourned as dead here they were
healthy and entirely unlike prisoners held
against their will

  the always vivacious gerhard vetter was
he first to extend his hand to van rhyn
heres to good comradeship i am very
glad dear van rhyn that you have been

saved for us and i look forward to good

work with you

  in some embarrassment van rhyn re-
plied we are simply guests here

  so were we you also will remain
all of you whoever has once lived in the
future no longer desires to go back to the
past

  prof zolling cast astonished glances
about among those present were also
schultz the noted city planner ottomar
goldner the man with the solar heat idea
and the rapid transit engineer grotefendt
who were likewise introduced

  i do not know-i have absolutely no
reason to doubt your words-but in these
few hours so much that is inexplicable has
happened to us if you really are the men
who disappeared at that lime-well there
can be no doubt my colleague van rhyn
has recognized mr vetter and i likewise
see that frank is looking with astonished
eyes at prof weigand all these names
which we remembered at home with sorrow
and reverence belong however to men who
were our teachers yet they look so youth-
ful that we in comparison seem old men

 now mr cook laughed that will
change once you have had a treatment in
the sanitarium of prof weigand we long
since came to the conviction that it is non-
sensical to die young nonsensical and waste-
ful

  would anyone let a watch get dirty and
then throw it away in what way is a per-
son any different on the contrary be is
the best machine in the world and treats
himself the worst councillor weigand -
 call him councillor because that was
your custom in germany here we have no
titles-has worked out the study of rejuven-
ation which is simply the art of not letting
the human system wear out and our mode
of living and our type of dwelling are based
on his investigations he uses no monkey
glands or artificial operations mr cook
nodded to them contentedly

  seriously dying is an extravagance we
cannot at present permit it since we may
not be frivolous with the material which
we possess we cannot take the first comer
into our union anyway the dying of per-
utopia island



ons in their so-called best years is simply
uneconomical in the first three or four
decades the individual just learns and de-
velops real maturity comes in the fifties
what rational mind would use a machine
which takes forty years lo build and then
operates only ten or twenty years as i
said to you dying or aging before natural
exhaustion at about one hundred and thirty
years of age is reached is a case of extrav-
agance and we are not extravagant

an incredible city

at this speech the gentlemen of the ex-
pedition had become dumb the ap-
pearance of their colleagues and the uni-
formly calm face of dr weigaud had robbed
them of speech

  now they went up the elevator together
and stood in the garden which surrounded
the room in which they had had their cof-
fee

  mr cook said casually unfortunately i
must leave now since i have an important
conference this evening in the capital of
puitu

  zolling looked at him aghast in the
capital of puitu

  but that is fifteen hundred kilometers or
about as far as from genoa to konigsberg
it is about the same our planes which
are of course constructed on the rocket prin-
ciple for speedy travel have a speed of
about a thousand kilometers an hour now
it is eight oclock i have an appointment
for half past nine and can conveniently come
back again will you excuse me

  they went up some steps and emerged on
the roof above the coffee room here there
stood in a sort of booth a table covered
with many electric switches

  mr white who had accompanied the two
as a silent auditor pressed a button and
cook said look out gentlemen the plane
is coming now

  it was not long before the well-known
buzzing sounded in the air a handsome
plane driven by propellers which were
placed above it and operated spirally ap-
peared and descended vertically upon the
platform and stood motionless at the same

moment that white pressed another button
mr cook got in once more white worked a
lever and immediately the plane rose verti-
cally into the air

  this is our distant control why do
we need pilots to be sure i just made
the plane rise high up in the air mr
cook himself will operate the rocket ex-
hausts from which oxygen and hydrogen
flow forth-on the principle of prof oberth
-and will shut off the rocket motor at the
right time then the spiral propellers
which during the rocket flight automatically
fold together and lie down again operate
to make possible a convenient landing--
gentlemen i should advise you to take a
little walk we have our work even at
night early tomorrow we may expect to
conduct you about

  mr white disappeared into the elevator
along with the other gentlemen the new-
comers remained alone they were too
confused to desire further conversation

side by side they walked along a reg-
ular park came clear to the platform
on which the plane had landed a splendid
garden full of blooming fragrant flowers
this layout was broken here and there by
deep depressions over which led handsome
bridges of fine wood having railings carved
in the japanese fashion

  the view downward was strange the

no auto no bicycle moved to whirl up dust

  people only people walked along the
pretty gravel walks these walks ran in
pairs and the people went to the right oil
one of them and to the left on the other
while between them stood blooming bushes
the sides near the houses were also cov-
ered with grass plots and blooming shrubs
these streets lay about four stories below
the level of the roof-garden

houses are of iron and glass and all of the

  prof ortler who had first behaved as
the least impressed was completely chang-
ed vthen there is no city in the world
with so mucb green space

  gumppendorf the geographer and meteor-

not be a fraud this must be a city but
here is a perfectly splendid air pure moun-
tain air full of ozone where are the odor
of the great city

  zolling stood still gentlemen i can-
not stand any more this is too much for
roy powers of comprehension i suggest
that we go to our rooms and collect our
thoughts again

  at the same moment there could be seen
before them in the middle of the path on
which they were walking between the palms
exactly the same luminous circle which
they had seen in their rooms when the door
bad opened for them to bathe

  frank cried almost angrily here ap-
parently all our conversation is overheard
naturally you have no more idea than 
as to where the hotel might be and at
once this circle is here see it is moving
slowly along the walk now it stands still
and now it moves on further it is just
like a dog waiting for his master

  then let us follow it confidently

chapter vi

more wondering

the men followed the guiding light
which led them over several bridges
and past the airport and tben found them-
selves unexpectedly before a door which
opened to the room where they had eaten
at once the door closed behind them they
were in a room with indirect lighting not
loo bright but just cheerful and in the cen-
ter of the floor was a table with bottles of
wine soda cakes cigarettes cigars and a
lighteraround the table were armchairs

  ortler cried out if only we were not al-
ways listened to

  at once a loud speaker sounded you
only need to indicate it and you will be

not be listened to and will be entirely un-
observed if you want anything please use
the switchboard

  well then we must believe it

  the men seated themselves

  what do you say to all this

  nothing at all i think it would be best
-i think none of us feels inclined to sleep
-for us to use the evening in perusing the
little documents mr cook gave us perhaps
we can learn something from them about
this strange city

  a person cannot read by this light
  there in the corner is a lainp

  now for the first time they perceived that
in the corner of the room stood a remarkable
apparatus a little cabinet at the front was
a desk and over it hung an electric light
bulb which radiated a strangely bright and
fluorescent light

  tben we must take turns reading

  first we will see

  van rhyn stepped over to it took from
his pocket a postcard which he had received
from home while in san francisco shoved
it under the bulb and tried to read

  but at the same moment he heard the
motion of wheels in the cabinet and im-
mediately a loud voice sounded through the
room dear husband i am sending you
my heartiest greetings please do not for-
get to wear good dry stockings and dont
put on six shirts at the same time again   
the professor quickly drew back the card
and the others laughed aloud while van
rhyn smiled in embarrassment

  what is it anyway

  van rhyn put the card in his pocket and
without answering laid under the bulb an
old piece of newspaper in which his pass-
port was wrapped at once the newspaper
was read aloud

  that is-the devil take the fellow

  bui explain to us

  what is that that is-gentlemen
there represents what i have been sitting in
berlin for years and years working on-
my life task now  come here-no pinch
my arm give me a box on the ear  want
to wake up at last

  but 

  we are asleep we are dreaming per-
utopia

kr- we are insane no i do not mean
of course you are not here i am simply
framing of you all

  i beg your pardon

  i pardon  nothing i am dreaming of
you all and i can shout all i want hello
hello i want to wake up

  at the same time he danced around the
room pinched himself nipped his cheeks
and made the maddest attempts to wake
himself from his supposed sleep

  the four professors watched with in-
creasing astonishment the st vitus dance
performed by prof van rhyn then dr
frank stepped close beside him but col-
league

  why do you say colleague v 

  you are not dreaming after all
how do you know whether i am dream-
ing you who are only a figure in my
dream

  listen shall i pull out a tooth or shall
 cut out your appendix so that you may
see that we are all awake dr frank
reached in his pocket and brought out a
little surgical case

  van rhyn looked at it doctor-are we
really awake

  certainly but explain to us what that
thing is

  doctor if you had pondered over some-
thing all your life say an impossible oper-
ation and now-here-in this unreal city
you suddenly saw that another person has
already solved the problem 

t erhaps dr weigand magician and
l rejuvenator will do that to me to-
morrow now see here drink this ipecac
it is horribly bitter if you taste that-
well it is a fact known of old that nobody
can taste in a dream

  is that so

  you know it yourself

  give me the stuff

  frank held out to him a large glass
  your health brr-brrrrr the devil
  do you see that you are awake
  doctor i accuse you of attempted mur-
  der my whole stomach is turning over
  there have you ever seen a person who

island	

dreamed that his stomach was turning

over

  if you have any mercy bring me a
glass of soda water

  now everything is all right agan
gentlemen we are then admittedly
alive if i had dreamed that  should
certainly have waked up so listen this
is a most incredibly practical apparatus
you know that attempts have already been
made to convert the human voice by the
use of selenium cells and all possible sensi-
tive diaphragms into light and then this
light into force for instance it must be
theoretically possible to build a type-
writer which automatically writes in re-
sponse to vocal dictation

  there surely is one here

  see this thing here is exactly the op-
posite a machine which converts written
or printed characters into light rays and
then into sound by some process at pre-
sent unknown to me you have just seen
that the apparatus read aloud the post-
card and the newspaper

  magnificent

  unbelievably magnificent actually
these things are my ideas once i spoke of
them in my lectures which this mr vetter
attended as a sort of last and far away
aim of our knowledge i have vainly
worked at it and now the thing is here
he has made it and put it in our room
for us

  truly magnificent this gives a sec-
ond life to the blind

  yes for one having the money to get
such a thing but never mind that i
should like very much to take the appar-
atus apart and study it

  do not do that i think we should
use it and make it read to us the history
of santa scientia

of course you are right i will sit
by the apparatus and turn the pages
the gentlemen sat down van rhyn
shoved the little book under the bulb and
clamped it into the steel grips on the desk

  at once there began very loudly and
plainly the reading aloud of the manu-
script which proved to be a journal the
professor was moreover spared the trou-


wonder stories

ble of turning the pages when he was
about to take hold of one the leaf turned
over automatically likewise guided by a
spring steel clamp

  all listened attentively to the journal
which was to reveal to them the history of
the marvelous city  instead of being on
the little yacht with almost certain death
before them struggling against the rag-
ing hurricane they were now sitting in a
comfortable room on soft armchairs see-
ing and hearing a most remarkable story

  yes they both saw and heard for the
book which mr cook had given them con-
tained in die middle of each page a pic-
ture while the text was being read aloud
there appeared at the same time by means
of an excellent apparatus like a televisor
the appropriate picture appearing above
the apparatus on a ground glass plate
this gave a perfect impression of a lec-
ture illustrated by pictures

  this was the content of the lecture

  

how santa scientia originated

  the congress in chicago which was oc-
cupying itself with the idea supporting fi-
nancially the greatest inventions and in-
ventors on earth was over actual excite-
ment had been aroused only by the speech
of -benjamin cook

  gentlemen all this is merely a half
way measure what is the use of a mans
devoting his whole life to a great new idea
if he receives a few thousand dollars he
is bound to his surroundings chained to
every-day life watched prematurely by mil-
lions of eyes how much has been wrecked
by being brought to publicity before it was
properly tried out how many hopes have
been vainly awakened how many men have
given up their plans in bitterness

  everything will be in vain as long as
it is impossible to find some little place
where great minds may work quite apart
from the rest of the world without being
fettered by time and money converting their
ideas into reality let us found somewhere
on a lonely island--a sort of world univer-
sity-not for teaching but for doing on
which city planners may realize their mag-
nificent plans on which the scientists may

pursue their investigations indeed that
will cost many millions i myself am ready
to contribute the first

beneath the sea

the proposal had been ridiculed as
is usual with such meetings it had
broken up with fine words far at the back
had sat unnoticed by the rest a very old
gentleman a man who a few years before
had been an eminent scientist and who for
a special reason was mocked at also it
was the aged professor alesius who had
asserted that he had found the treasure of
the incas and had hidden it again

  that evening when benjamin cook was
already packing his trunk at the hotel a
visitor was announced professor alesius

  cook had chanced to notice that the lat-
ter had been the only one who had nodded
vigorously at his words during the meet-
ing

  what can i do for you he asked his
visitor

  i simply wanted to tell you that your
proposal delighted me

  cook shrugged his shoulders and the
professor stepped nearer perhaps i bring
you what you seek i should like to found
the world university with you

cook looked at him sympathetically he
had also heard that the old gentleman was
considered no longer mentally responsible
he laughed have you the millions
alesius nodded the millions and also
the island

  cook was becoming still more nervous
but alesius said very seriously i think
there is a treasure of a hundred million
dollars or more which fate has entrusted to
me when i was by chance on the desolate
iguana island when i was already despair-
ing of saving my life  discovered the trea-
sure of gold and jewels which ruminjahui
the general of atahualpa the last inca em-
peror piled about the grave of his lord
cook gave him a blank look but ale-
sius continued i am not weak-minded
though i know people believe it i am pur-
posely deluding the world i saw the im-
pression produced by my report what
utopia

i vald have become of the money per-
the state of puitu would have paid its
i debts with it or there might have been ig-
cjna island stocks on the market

    through the centuries the treasure has
 i remained in sacred peace no one knows of
 it but myself no one knows how to find it
 it was intended to be buried the bold
 which fidelity placed about the dead shall
 not be desecrated but you have a plan
 vrhich can benefit the world together with
 you-that is in case you affirm in writing
 that you will use it exclusively in your sci-
 entific plans-i will bring it to light

    the old man had spoken with assurance
 wd enthusiasm and cook was beginning
 to waver will you show me the treasure
 to you alone

   when

    we can leave this very day but it must
  hr in secret time is pressing and i am
  old

    with the night train the two men set out
  for frisco they had only one companion
  bob white the young secretary of cook
  who had already given his word of honor
  tn maintain complete silence about this
  project

    in frisco mr moller the head of the firm
  of smith  co was taken into their con-
  fidence except that he was not told of the
  treasure he was simply commissioned to
  fit out a little yacht

 the weather was favorable in shortly
 over a week the desolate islands lay
 before them barren coasts from whose
 midst rose volcanic cones brown lava and
 heaps of rubble yielded under the human
 foot and made every step difficult wild
 rough reefs rose grey and bare from the
 foam of the surf

    they anchored in a bay the crew of the
 ship wondered not a little it was an un-
 canny bay ancient partly petrified frag-
 ments of ships lay on the beach covered
 with green algae and dead mussels

    it is an ancient pirate harbor barthel-
  ony roberts the king of the filibusters
  who was later tricked by brave captain
  ogle of the swallow used to have his place
  of refuge here

island	

  they landed and a tent was set up with
serious eyes prof alesius wandered along
the shore then he stopped at a little lake
it was no inland lake but the edge of a
crater one side of which the sea had torn
away thus there had been formed an al-
most circular bay blocked to ships by a
large bar

  cook and white looked in surprise at
the old man

  i have found the place

  the american started at hearing this
really

  six years have passed the sea has been
at work and the grotto which we must en-
ter is flooded with water probably this
part of the island has sunk

  what is actually to be done asked
cook

  we must dive replied prof alesius

  the diving suits were brought

  do you want to

  cook admired the will power of the old
man the three men put on diving suits
a small boat was brought into the bay in
which they rowed out to the middle they
had a solemn feeling at the shore there
sat on a stone a remarkable monster a
giant iguana reminding them of the drag-
ons of primeval times looking at them mo-
tionlessly with its serious eyes

  now the two companions again doubted
the sanity of the professor for he nodded
in almost friendly fashion to the iguana
are you still here old friend lizard do
you bring me good fortune you showed
me the way before

  a steel ladder was lowered deep into the
water and alesius was the first to put on
a diving helmet his wreak figure almost
collapsed under the weight but when he
was under water he did not feel it the
other two followed while above stood the
men of the crew tending to the oxygen sup-
ply and wondering about what was going
on

  the steps of the ladder ended they now
stood six meters below die surface on a
stony bottom they sat down for a mo-
ment while a new world opened up to them
they no longer felt the weight of the heavy
helmets there was a brilliance of color


wonder

stories

about them splendid sea anemones gay
coral strange fish with wonderful wing-
like fins which whirled about them as del-
icately as parrot feathers

  little short ugly fish with great mouths
sped up knowing no fear and snapped at
their garments with soft harmless lips
there were armies of tiny little animals
struggling there starfish jellyfish cuttle-
fish great crabs emitted grey clouds and
changed the clear water for minutes at a
time into opaque mist but over all these
wonders lay a sacred stillness while the
sunbeams shone down from above very dul-
ly and the keel of the boat lay above them
like a black shadow

chapter vii
a case of kidnaping

the eyes of the men were becoming ac-
customed to the dull light alesius
arose and walked about he nodded it
looked uncanny to see the great diving hel-
met move

  before them was an opening it almost
looked as though there were a stone house
standing here at the bottom of the sea
when they approached and lighted their
searchlight there shot out of the dark open-
ing thousands of fish

  back of the hole was a stairway a regu-
lar stairway made of stone slabs was it
the work of man had nature formed it
they began to descend the steps the thin
tubes which brought them air and were
their only means of keeping alive here
stretched out further and further ahead of
them a great octopus was dragging its way
down the stairs with its mighty spongy
limbs while alesius walked down with a
confident step the other two followed hesi-
tantly

  they reached a mighty grotto for some
moments the professor switched off the
light here it was perfectly dark for the
gleam of the sun never entered yet there
was life herg also uncanny silent life at
the very bottom far below them for the
grotto evidently went down much further
faint lights whisked about these were

deep sea fish they held before them little
glowing bodies on long antennae and with
these attracted still smaller organisms
which thus fell prey to them

  again the searchlight shone forth the
lights in the depths paled and alesius
climbed up other steps-they saw him col-
lapse under the weight of his helmet an
indication that he had again risen above
the surface of the water within the grotto
he sat down and took off his helmet the
others imitated him now they saw that
they had almost reached the end of their
air-pipes they gave a prearranged elec-
tric signal to shut off the air temporarily

  we are all right now we will rest
here said the professor

  his two companions were more and more
impressed by the intellectual greatness of
the old man the grotto even now still
arched high above them it was remarkable
to note that there was good air here even
though the space was a little confined
when the searchlight swept the walls they
saw that ancient paintings were there be-
tween the stalactites and that the remains of
weapons and puzzling objects hung on rusty
hcoks half destroyed by the water

  white gasped the professor painfully
you are the youngest of us there are
three shafts going up from here the cen-
ter one is the right one the exertion had
been too great and the old man sank back
unconscious

  they gave him wine and he opened his
eyes again up there up there ill wait
down here my bequest  have your 
word

  the two did not wish to leave him alone
but his imperious gesture made them obey
they untied the rope which the professor
had made white bring wrapped it around
his body and tied themselves together fas-
tening on their water-tight lanterns they
began the fearful ascent

  here are some steps

  they were ancient slippery steps which
rose in the worm of a winding stair hours
passed but the men no longer despaired of
success

  finally they saw the faint glimmer of
light from some unseen source they stood
utopia island



is a chamber that had once been cut and
mrxrothed by human hands-a room without
an exit in the center hooded by light
which came through a crack in the rock
at a solemn golden figure on a throne
half reclining wrapped in golden gar-
ments covered with jewels was a statue
of atahualpa the last-inca emperor about
him lay piled up bars of gleaming gold and
an infinite treasure of the most splendid
precious stones

  the two stood in dumb amazement

  the treasure of the incas

  millions and more millions

  they collected themselves we must no
longer leave the professor alone

  still impressed by the wonders of the
grotto full of reverent awe they began the
fearful descent

hours had passed before they reached
the lower grotto again alesius lay
stretched out where they had left him

  cook bent over him listened to his heart
and sprang up horrified he is dead it
was too much for the old man

  they knelt beside him

  he knew that time was pressing that
hi end was at hand he has left his treas-
ure to us

  cook arose one would hardly have
thought it possible for this man who gave
ihe impression of a cold business man to
bo able to weep i swear that i shall keep
my word you swear also

  he said it in a commanding tone and
white gave him his hand i swear it

  it was a solemn moment the two men in
the cave beside the dead man far below the
little lights of the lower world busily whisk-
ing this way and that up above the rocky
vault with the great secret of bygone cen-
turies and outside the roar of the waves
they beat against the rock

  again they got on board after once more
hitting on their helmets and making the

	ubterranean trip a second lime alesius
had come with them as a corpse they had
carried him between them and had guarded
his cold body from the greedy fish

  

  mr cook and his secretary white were

again in frisco sitting in the private office
of smith and co discussing matters with
the owner of the company mr william
moller

 what now

  moller laughed loudly you seem to
me just like a person who has suddenly
won a big lottery and does not know what
he is to do with it

  let us rather say like a politician who
has always grumbled and suddenly become
foreign minister of a great state i have the
money the bequest  have purchased the
miserable iguana island with all rights
from the government of puitu and paid
cash but what now i want to lose no
time

  the ever prudent moller reflected what
do you need

  clever men geniuses can you furnish
them

  smith  co furnishes every tiling you
have a barren island so you must first be-
come acquainted with its minerals and
know how they are to be obtained for this
the right man is eberhard romer who even
wants to mine the moon you must have
a physician to look after the main thing
health take the young cancer investigator
dr weigand you need ingenious engin-
eers how about the swiss ottomar goldner
and the berlin electro-technician vetter you
will want to build a city i think of otlo
schultz in berlin and some others such as
the rapid transit expert grotefendt these
would be the right men they are geniuses
who are not recognized at home

  but how can  engage them then it
will at once be recognized that 

  do not hire them

  what then

  steal them

 you are-

  by no means insane as you are about to
remark most kindly steal them very sim-
ply steal them or conscript them as the
soldier king of prussia called it when he
collected his tall fellows from all over the
world the end justifies the means says
a proverb

  are you speaking seriously

  we are here to do business even if it


wonder stories

is ideal business i will do it all right
first we will carry them off fjy force bring
them here explain everything to them and
if they actually are geniuses then they will
be enthusiastic

  and if they are not

  we must send them away before they
have seen anything

  will you do this

  with pleasure if you give me the money
for it

  this was the first conference six weeks
later a second one followed much stormier
than the first for the six men had actually
been carried off in airplanes autos sub-
marines and private yachts and had been
temporarily calmed after much trouble on
meeting in frisco where they had been
brought during the night they screamed ex-
ecrations at cook and moller and threatened
to call in the police until finally cook man-
aged to speak

  one moment gentlemen listen to rne

  the founding of santa scientia

he then delivered a speech in which he
revealed his plan and the men fol-
lowed his words with increasing excite-
ment

  the first to collect himself was schultz
 what am i to build such a city as  have
 imagined as i have described it in my mon-
 ograph

  exactly so

  that costs millions

  we have them

  romer was striding back and forth in
the room and i what shall i do go

to the moon

  not at present but you are to make a
desert island a volcanic island into a fruit-
ful land

   just listen if one properly cultivates and
 irrigates such volcanic soil then it will
 be splendid

  all right

  what is there gold silver ra-
dium

  i do not know you shall find out
prof weigand likewise sprang up a
cancer hospital

  what you will at any rate a complete

laboratory in which you can peacefully
consider all problems including perhaps
rejuvenation

  can  make the new city hygienic as i
wish

  that is your chief task

  money

  that does not matter

  the engineers were speaking at the same
time is there water for a power plant
i dont know at any rate there ia
plenty of volcanic power

  colleague vetter what do you think of 
a volcanic heating plant a giant steam en-
gine using a volcano for perpetual mo-
tion

vetter nodded we could also produce
power from the waves of the ocean
grotefendt sadly shook his head one
cannot use express trains on a little island
then run your lines right through the
ocean

  my tube railway-my- his voice al-
most cracked

  the six men who had come angry had
lost all their wrath they had completely
forgotten where they were they no longer
bothered at all about moller or cook or
white who could hardly take shorthand
fast enough to put down what they said
they were so buried in their new fantastic
plans that they forgot everything because 
their great minds reached out in similar
ways they speedily became friends

  but suddenly schutz sprang up in ex-
citement and stared at cook in horror is
all this true

  of course

  it really is not just a fraud

  certainly not

  can you prove it to us

  as soon as you have pledged yourselves
for five years and have given your word
of honor that yoji will in no event reveal
anything of what we show you before that
lapse of time we shall set out for the is-
land

  here is my hand

  i agree

  i too

  in a moment all the signatures were se-
cured
utopia

  can we go now i cannot stand it any
riore i must go out of doors i must think
k over

  unfortunately that cannot be nobody
must see you in frisco for now you must
remain missing from the world otherwise
curiosity will spoil everything

  but-

  outside are three autos in the night
we shall go to los angeles we have a
yacht there if you wish tomorrow morn-
ing we shall be on our way to the iguana
lfland

  iguana island that is no name for
uch a place as we contemplate

  of course we must find another

  weigand had been sitting very quiet and
trapped in thought is it your sacred
purpose to nlake no material gain from the
matter

  only ideal gain for humanity for sci-
ence

  weigant stood seriously in the midst of
them gentlemen then there is only one
name under which we can unite santa
scientia-sacred knowledge

  bravo

cook now stepped to the center gen-
tlemen i had thought of another name
alesia in honor of the noble professor the
first to give his life for his ideal but you
are right santa scientia the name is a
pledge gentlemen let us be off to santa
scientia

  six weeks passed a few days after the
little expedition with the scientists had
landed on iguana island another ship ar-
rived a perfectly ordinary ship with chin-
ese workmen on board in a short time
they built a number of sheet iron shacks on
the shore delivered a great amount of pro-
visions and great piles of all imaginable
machine parts and apparatus after which
they went away again

  soon afterward there came a yacht the
private yacht of cook now making its sec-
ond trip to the island with the ten fore-
men and engineers whom mollers agents
had likewise kidnaped they had not in-
deed been completely initiated but they

island	

had been induced by the high pay to sign
up for five years

  the yacht went away and for a full six
months it did not appear cook and his
secretary were supposed to have gone to
europe mr moller carried on the business
of smith  co in the old way as though
there were no iguana island at all and the
disappearance of tbe sixteen men was slow-
ly forgotten in the world

  to make up for this there was all the
more diligent work in the little settlement of
sheet iron shacks which cook half jesting-
ly called the city of isabella each of
the young scientists had one or two men
with him first the engineer goldner and
mr grotefendt had blasted a horizontal tun-
nel which led straight into the flooded cave
so that there was no need to reach it by the
sea

  then white and cook had again ascend-
ed the fearful route into the grotto of the
inca and had fetched on the return trip a
great amount of precious stones the gold
ingots they temporarily left there the
whole inca treasure was not to be brought
down until a proper treasure chamber had
been built when the six scientists saw what
the two had brought with them the last
vestiges of their doubts vanished

  if a person had come here quite unsus-
pectingly say as a traveller he would have
seen a most wonderful sight in a great
sheet iron shed in the fearful head there
sat in bathing suits otto schultz the city
planner and weigand who had interrupted
his cancer investigations and had become
simply a sanitary expert before them were
immense plans they drew discussed dis-
agreed and agreed again and what
evolved under their fingers was the plan of
a strange city such as the world had never
before seen

  in the early morning the engineer romer
would be climbing around in the lava fields
with the swiss goldner having blast-holes
dug at athe shore mr vetter would be
setting up electrical apparatus and making
experiments each evening all the gentle-
men came together in the largest house
which they had named the hotel because

 there a colored cook managed matters and
 prepared their evening meal

chapter viii
a new day

exactly six months later there was
again a great meeting

we must have a harbor 

 it must not be here no one should see
 what we are doing

 i had in mind the reef which lies about
  kilometers off from this island there
 is even a natural harbor there

 crotefendt nodded then i will run the
 first tube railway there

 of course cook said quite indiffer-
 ently as though it were a commonplace
 matter

 we must have electric power

 yes said vetter we will try to use
 for this the hot vapors of the geyser which
 is very near the old crater

 very good

 the ground is very fertile if it is dis-
 integrated by water and machine power
 which first crushes the lava and breaks up
 the rubble

 i am giving you the electric current for
 this by my steam engines

 i need only a laboratory and invalids
 with prof weigands help i have com-
 pleted the plans for an ideal city

 what do we need now

 people it is not possible for the six-
 teen of us or eighteen counting mr white
 and yourself to complete the work

 then moller must help again

 we need hundreds thousands of peo-

 pe

 first a hundred then a thousand if we
 can feed them

 but capable men

 only the fittest moller must get them
 steal them again

 that is up to him

 mr cook went into his so-called office
 and wrote an order as though he were or-
 dering six carloads of oleomargarine
 messrs smith  co frisco please de-
 liver us as soon as possible one hundred

capable trained workers and two hundred
chinese coolies also provisions for six
months and some sheet iron houses

 each month a plane came over from
frisco piloted by a man who had been in-
itiated into the secret thus far they had
not even ventured to build a radio station
lest by chance other receivers might pick
up something

this time the plane returned in three
days bringing a letter mr cook santa
scientia thank you for your order de-
livery within thirty days smith  co
cook laughed we can rely on moller

	 

  there was the soft ringing of a bell in
the room in which the professors sat the
light went out the pictures disappeared
and the reading machine was silent the
men wiped the sweat from their brows
stood up and stretched their limbs

  here everything seems to be rational
the apparatus is cleverer than we it is
already after midnight

  zolling wiped his forehead i am all
confustd that sounded like a story from
the arabian nights

  then that was the beginning

  we will save the continuation for to-
morrow

   should like a breath of air

 a door had already opened they
stepped outside balmy odors were wafted
toward them fountains plashed beneath
palm trees a dull light which did not
show any objects clearly lay over the my-
sterious city

  after some time they returned to the
room

  can you sleep

  it is impossible

  on the table in the middle stood six
glasses of a foaming beverage

here they truly think of everything
thtey drank the pleasantly cool lemon-
ade at the same moment the light again
illuminated the ground glass plate good
night gentlemen appeared there

  zolling stretched suddenly i have be-
come sleepy

  the men seated themselves in the chairs
travelled lo their rooms lay down and at
utopia island



bwt went to sleep while the mysterious
bsht continued to shine over the city of
aobella and its wonders

i  t six oclock sharp the next morning
itv there sounded in the rooms of the
kembers of the ocean expedition an insist-
m buzzing when the men who had slept
brellently looked up each saw before his
fcr a dark haired boy standing inaeed
fcxfe were not living boys but ornamental
kures apparently of bronze which smiled
bnd held out to them menu cards on which
irre all sorts of questions cofffp tea
chocolate  roast meat poached egg
lbmi ham fish cold meat marina-

i on the menu hung a pencil and the face
lt the artificial servant was so pleased the
ei moved so naturally and the great eyes
i lied so comically in the dark face that
kb gentlemen could not help laughing
ith pleasure they checked what they
becked what they wished then the dumb
ervant rolled away returning again
hrough a little door in the wall which
ipened only for this purpose this time
ach brought on a tray the desired food
i d by it lay a notice sam remains until
be button on his shoulder is pressed

  the men breakfasted bathed and dressed
polling asked frank did a moorish boy
appear to you also

  moorish boy no a little metal chi-
jese

  certainly the first servant whose watch-
rg me did not disturb my eating

  you are right about that

  zolling shook his head nevertheless
his artificial moorish boy has not pleased
me it is something bizarre which does
not go well with the technical clarity of all
re have seen

  soon there again appeared an inscrip-
tion on the glass plate above the desk if
ihe gentlemen are ready will they please
sit in the chairs

  this time they did it as though it were
perfectly natural and a few minutes later
h-y were all together in the reception hall
hhich seemed to be the central point of
ibe building

 bob white came to meet them did you
sleep well

   excellently

  i must beg your pardon

  what for

  i can see by mr zollings face that he
did not like the moorish boy

  frank laughed it was a good joke

	quite right sir even in the mystery
plays of the middle ages there used to be
a farce at the end in which the clowns per-
formed when there is work all day long
our experts sometimes feel the need of giv-
ing rein to their fancy and making such
playthings but now i should like to show
you some of our plants i must first pre-
face my remarks you will see a city which
could be equipped for hundreds of thous-
ands but which has still hardly any in-
habitants  want to point out that we do
not want to make an industrial city we do
not want to compete with anyone

  in all that we do here we are a model
a proof that the thing can be done an ex-
perimental laboratory a university if you
like and for the future a constant example
of how the world can and must look in
centuries to come if other ingenious per-
sona come and prove to us that our ideas
have already been caught up with then we
shall not hesitate for a moment to pull the
city down and replace it by a better one
the scientists looked at each other in
amazement while bob went on  this hall
which you probably think goes through four
stories really has ten

  in the middle of the tower-like hall was
a round platform which slowly rose like
a chain-drive elevator making a second ex-
actly similar platform arise from the
depths which then made way for a third
these three platforms were connected by
handsome pillars and except for four open-
ings which connected with radial passages
were enclosed by a beautiful bronze grat-
ing

   see this elevator forms the exact center
of isabella as we still call our city to-day
at the very bottom below the lowest story
is a smaller hall in which is the end of our
sea railway on which you arrived yester-
day


wonder stories

a gigantic plan

the men got on the elevator bob white
pressed a button and it slowly sank

  we are now in the lowest basement
you see that from here radial lines of
tracks run in all directions those are our
electric express lines in view of the small-
ness of our island they are very short but
in a real metropolis they would run far
out into the country this is as it were
the long distance railway station it is ob-
vious that we provide only one class and
that the cars are equipped with the great-
est comfort and conveniences

  to attain great speed we use the gyro-
scope system but we are also experimenting
with rocket propulsion for the moment i
will just show the arrangement we travel
at a speed of  kilometers but we have
no heavy locomotives and operate each
wheel-axle by a special motor thus the
force is cumulative and we have no long
slow trains it is just striking the hour at
exactly the same time trains are starting in
all directions we see to it thit all districts
are built up evenly so the same traffic pre-
vails everywhere

  the time table is perfectly uniform like-
wise the running time of all trains since
everywhere the stations are equally far
apart and all lines are the same length
this can all be arranged in rebuilding a
state as well as a city of course we have
no personnel on the trains our machines
are the crews and everything is done auto-
matically we have no switches to set
since each train keeps its direct line

  crossings of other lines are always tun-
nels below or above each signal is auto-
matically given and automatically obeyed
by the train the one person who accom-
panies each train is there simply to take
action in an unforeseen emergency but
otherwise he has nothing to do with the
operation we use for this work old people
who have the necessary knowledge and who
rest during the trips this is a sort of pro-
vision for the aged because physical
strength is not needed for this work nei-
ther is it necessary to be constantly alert
the machines look after that

  the men went to the next higher story
which was level with the ground

  here are the so-called tram lines for
the city and its immediate surroundings
there are neither cars nor trains merely
five bands gliding along side by side which
are arranged in step formation and go at
step in the middle of the tunnel has seats
ard glides fastest each one being slower

  from the slowest one can without dif-
ficulty step off on to the fixed pavement or
vice versa if yeu sit in the middle how-
ever you travel at a speed far surpassing
that of any street railway on the other
side of the tunnel the bands go the opposite
way these lines also go straight out in ev-
ery street you already have seen that our
building blocks are not quadrangular but
segments of circles this place is the meet-
ing point of all the streets in the curved
connection streets or rather circles other
lines run a story deeper down there are
of course no long distance railways there
now please one story higher

  they now found themselves at the height
of the first story above the ground there
they saw the auto roads

  the deuce those cars are making good
time they must be going at least two
hundred kilometers an hour

  surely

  do your motors accomplish that
absolutely not the people are not
going any faster than you do but the road
has just the same bands as the tramway
street below you see there is a dividing
wall half the height of the tunnel running
through the middle that divides the traffic
going in different directions the first
band glides very slowly it is not at all
hard to get from the parking place here in
the middle to this band then it takes some
skill by a quick bit of side steering to reach
the next band which already has a fairly
high speed in the middle the man drives
at a speed of about one hundred kilometers
an hour and is at the same time carried by
the band at the same speed making two
hundred there is little risk in this these
gliding bands make the autos always go in
line there is no driving in the side streets
hence there are no crossings skidding can-
utopia

island



   occur on the rough bands and a driver
   is not skillful enough lo steer his auto
   band to band is not allowed to drive

 n fact the autos in spite of their speed
 and their great number were all going
 ung in line at proper intervals

 exactly the same is true of the cycle
  a story higher there loo the gliding
 ds make the going easy

 dr frank laughed yet it is here the
   e as everywhere the poor pedestrian is
   worst looked after

 how so

 there are no gliding bands for him
 that is intentional we provide our
 izens with all means of transportation
 et of course  is to our advantage that

 	one delays transportation is given the
 abilants here as you provide water and
  travelling it is to be assumed that he
 ants to walk for the sake of walking and
 ht if anyone does not use these means
 r him there are the pleasant gravel walks
 tween the grass plots-hello our auto is
 ady i should just like to mention that
 se elevators of course go to all floors and
 d up in the twelfth story of this central
 use you will also go there that is where
 e have our airport for all our planes
 while the men were getting into the
 eat auto which had seats for ah of them
 b white went on even if we do not
 ant to carry on any business in santa
 ientia yet we hope that very soon ma-
 ines will be working in all our shops
 e will set in operation every type of in-
 ustry present on earth and procure for it
 r best minds in order to make it pro-
 ress but these factories are only to serve
 places of instruction they will hurl no
 the university is therefore to have ad-
 to it a mighty technical school with
 anches for each industry with our pro-
 tions we shall make just enough profit
 cover our expenses for even inca treas-
 es aie not inexhaustible

 they were now going through splendidly
 itivated fields

 it is obvious that we get much from
 at nature gives us in large crushing
 us we have the lava ground up and it

 becomes excellent top-soil absolutely no
 special minerals have been discovered but
 we have demonstrated that even the most
 desert of lands will produce by the aid of
 machines and the use of chemistry thus
 we raise man to his position of dignity in
 that- he only thinks and guides while all
 merely physical work is considered a waste
 of his intellect irrigating is done arti-
 ficially with machines to do the work

  do you operate your machines by vol-
canic forces

  we did for a time but then we stopped
you will get more details about it if you
continue reading our story tonight i am
now taking you to the immense power plant
which directly converts the waves of the
ocean into electrical energy this is a force
which is obtainable everywhere just as we
get nitrogen from the air and heat from the
suns rays

   certainly the volcanic power still pres-
sent on the earth is sufficient to heat almost
the entire world by means of long distance
heating plants-the geysers of yellowstone
park alone might provide a part of the
united states with heat but these are trans-
itory values for the volcanic forces wili
some day be gone

  once we are no longer compelled to
thus conceal ourselves from the eyes of the
world-and your presence is to be a sort of
general test for us-we shall ask the gov-
ernment of alaska for permission to in-
vestigate the valley ten thousand
smokes this  was discovered after the
eruption of the valcano katmai which bur-
ied the city of kodiak we would so use
the heat forces there that perhaps the en-
tire region of alaska now covered with
snow and ice might be warmed by them
though maybe only for a few centuries

  people are complaining about the crowd-
ing of the earth but are using a wasteful
kind of agriculture the earth still poss-
esses infinite expanses which are not used
at all think of the tropics of the huge
areas in guatemala and honduras where
formerly flourishing indian estates showed
high civilization and which are well suited
for it if once we change from human labor
to machines

a human repair shop

the men were now going along a fine
road by the shore before them they
saw a lovely valley palm groves waved
their feather dusters brilliant parrots
swayed in the branches

  here there lived the great iguanas and
the giant tortoises unfortunately we
drove them away except in a place which
we purposely leave wild and seldom enter
this natural park which is a reminder of
the former condition of the whole island
is also to serve as a model

  on an airy height there rose an extensive
glass building

  this is the laboratory and hospital of
prof weigand who is impatiently waiting
to show his results to you all especially
to dr frank i need not tell you that we
use everywhere a new type of glass which
allows the ultra-violet rays to pass through
hence even the inner rooms get full radia-
tion from the sun which here is especially
abundant

  now indeed you see above us a light
cloud it is artificial and simply serves to
lessen the excessive heat of the noon hours
on the other hand during the rainy months
our territory and especially the city are
lighted by electric lights having special
radiation which gives the same effect as
the sun there is still a great problem to
be solved by our irrigation we can pro-
duce artificial rain we shall not attain
our goal until we can adjust the climate
and weather perfectly

  the men whose astonished faces had long
since shown no doubts entered the great
glass house on the veranda which offer-
ed a truly gorgeous view of the sea prof
weigand came to meet them may i first
offer you some refreshment

  later later we are too eager to know
things

  even with us you see only a beginning
said weigand our knowledge unfortun-
ately still remains fragmentary i have
not yet succeeded in making a man it is

not so hard about the limbs but the brain
is still an unsolved puzzle

  the rooms in which the invalids lay were
high and made entirely of glass and iron

  i have a hard time i even have to have
my invalids stolen for me our people sel-
dom give us an opportunity for us to show
our skill unless some accident occurs i
shall have to get your personal histories
as  do that of every new arrival

  frank laughed is that all my
name is-

  no i do not mean that we have to
know about everyone that is about his body
it is natural that i have here in this file-
they were now in the office-a record of
each one namely x-ray pictures by the
latest process look this is the internal
appearance of mr white these tables
represent the heart action during and after
work and here is the essential blood test
you know the various groups of blood com-
position it is of infinite importance to
know this for future use what is the use
of my putting a new knee joint in a victim
if it comes from a person with another kind
of blood it just does not work

  frank shook his head a new knee
joint

  look here prof weigand led them
into an adjoining room it is wasteful
to discard a whole person as unusable or
let us say the failure of a single organ
caused his death if a person dies of weak
heart his limbs are still sound here you
see all joints here larynxes here whole
bones here a stomach and here kidneys
if you examine the vessels more closely
you will see that this solitary stomach is di-
gesting that this heart is beating

  are those-

  they are mostly experiments with ani-
mals but there are also a number of hu-
man organs among them

 you-

  no i am no desecrator of dead bodies
but there are here in our ideal city many
persons who desire that after their death
their individual organs shall benefit others
who are still alive this is not at all a vio-
lation and is actually no different from a
utopia island



blood transfusion and has already saved
many lives

  in the big accident on the mountain two
years ago one of our best mechanics was
nearly crushed it was a blessing that i
had a kidney on hand in a nutrient liquid
it was grafted in and it has been working
perfectly for two years a knee joint
which i got from a man whose leg i had to
amputate the first year has already been
doing duty for three years in another body

r mien you have here-

  x a repair establishment for hu-
man beings with the necessary spare parts
but as i said it is a question of the right
blood groups during the world war this
was not properly heeded by the american
physicians who already tried something of
the kind but my chief aim is the defer-
ring of old age why because a person
is more careless about his life than about
anything else if a gland no longer func-
tions one must either supplement it or re-
place it i am the oldest person here and

i	think no one can tell by looking at me
that i am not far from sixty-

  it had become evening when they ar-
rived again in the city

  do you wish to make another little
tour asked bob white

  no thank you this evening we should
like to keep on with the story of the found-
ing of santa scientia

  then please go to your rooms and we 
will eat in half an hour the apparatus is
ready you will hear the continuation in
the journal that i wrote

  with rather confused heads the scientists
went to their rooms

	 

  elsa dorn had likewise slept through the
night and was in her room the following
morning at the time the gentlemen were
beginning their sightseeing she was some-
what depressed after mrs helling had
bade her good night she had been alone
she was vexed at bob who did not bother
about her in front of her room was like-
wise an exit into the roof garden which
seemed to cover the entire city but the door
was closed

   she would have liked to see something
and to find out about the activity of this
city there was certainly life here even
if it was perfectly quiet about her there
was not a sound no machines could be
heard no one was visible on the roof
she could imagine that she was alone a
plane passed but not even the propeller
made a sound

   finally at about eight oclock when she
 was already becoming uneasy looking anx-
 iously at the doorless walls and feeling her-
 self a prisoner there appeared on the glass
 plate which was also in her room an in-
 scription the car please

   now the wall opened and the vehicle of
the previous day stood before her

   in a few minutes she was in an office
she could not judge where it was located
before her stood a tall slender man she
knew that this was mr cook he looked
keenly at her for a long time well
you are miss dorn

 yes i am

  i know about you after today you
will take over the mail service do you
hear receiving letters registering them
sending them is your work mrs helling
will show you everything beginning to-
morrow you will work alone this eve-
ning go to prof weigand for a blood test
and record there are eight hours of work
a day recreation is in the evening the
pay is one hundred dollars a month
thanks cook had finished and sat down
al the desk without giving miss dorn an-
other glance

   she stood in confusion not daring to ask
 questions and yet not knowing at all what
 she was to do now

   then someone behind her said please
she looked around there was no one
in sight but the same word now stood in the
glass plate of the vehicle she entered the
door shut and away she went she felt
rather ill at ease in all this

   then she came to a large room there
was a desk at which a whole system of tubes
ended in the next room she saw a great
number of typewriters busily at work fin-
ishing lines putting in new sheets of paper


wonder stories

without anyone tending them at the
large desk sat mrs helling

  the latter did not look up but simply
nodded to her and said hurriedly come
here and see how it is done in the work-
ing time i cannot look up the machines
will not permit me

  elsa stepped closer and was convinced
that she would never understand and learn
what was done here and was he to attend
to all this herself the next day every-
thing was quiet here the machines oper-
ated perfectly noiselessly only on the dif-
ferent glass plates stood words which light-
ed up and disappeared again

an intruder

the men had again taken tleir seats in
their common room adjusted the lamp
and fastened under it the second of the
booklets which cook had given them to-
day mr van rhyn did this as naturally
as though he were adjusting a radio loud
speaker

  at once there again appeared picture
and inscription

continuation of the founding
of santa scientia
the journal of bob white
we have been on our island for two
years and everything is acquiring a differ-
ent appearance as the result of the great
conference in which the plans of the dif-
ferent gentlemen were discussed we real-
ized that the establishing of adequate light
and power was supremely important

  prof weigand was excused and allowed
to go on with his work the rest of us
placed ourselves under the orders of eber-
hard romer and ottomar goldner we
made our way into the interior of the great
volcano step by step our dynamite
charges opened the shaft into the depths
and then we bored the tunnels

  it was dangerous work thousands of
brave miners have met their death from
chokedamp but we were boring into a
mountain in which the volcano was still
alive while vapors rose from cracks and
splits now weigand also had to help

we caught the gases in bottles while w

advanced always wearing masks of course

  weigand had to analyze the gases ac-
cording to his findings grotefendt had to
prepare pipes which would not be attacked
by these gases doing this in our hurriedly
erected foundry

  then came the day when we had to flee
the hot vapor shot toward us in a thick
stream it was well that we were provided
for this by wearing clothes which protected
us from the heat

  the pipe is laid the other chinks in
the mountain have been closed by a special
cement now our pipe is like a horizontal
chimney quite regularly almost like clock-
work the hot vapor of the volcano belches
out to us the air is completely spoiled
we have bored into this devils kitchen and
must now constantly wear our gas masks
and breathe artificial oxygen

  those were evil days but now everything
is arranged the great distillation plant
which vetter and goldner have established
takes up the poisonous vapor the differ-
ent constituents according to their chemical
composition sink into the retorts and pro-
vide us with chemicals the purified
steam which still possesses high expansion
properties operates our dynamos we
have light we have electric power

  again two hundred chinese coolies have
come they are here to crush the lava und-
ev romers direction and to mix it with
the vast quantities of manure coming from
the tortoises they are old inhabitants of
the islands and we live generally on their
meat

  meanwhile grotefendt is making the great
hoisting apparatus intended for conducting
the sea water over the entire island and
keeping moist the virgin soil which we are
preparing at ihe shore great salt works
are set up which first take the saline con-
tent out of the water we are beginning to
make the first planting because our workers
want to eat

  we need machines many machines for
we want to begin work at many places
we now have one hundred and fifty white
foremen and mechanics six of them very
intelligent people are married and have
utopia

island



their wive with them besides we have
three hundred chinese coolies they are
very industrious and easily suited and they
are not concerned with what we are doing
here their number varies because we
keep them only a short time and replace
them by others so that they may not learn
our affairs

  now we have built a treasure chamber a
vault blasted deep in the rocks it lies
where later on the ccntral house of our city
is to stand and it is so placed that it does
not interfere with the construction

  we have had an adventure which gave
us cause for thought we needed money
cook and i climbed into the inca grotto
when we were returning from it we thought
we heard footsteps nearby now there is of
course an electric connection in the large
grotto where alesius died i turned the
switch and when we looked about we saw a
negro who had wedged himself into a crack
in the rock and was staring at us a negro
how could a negro get to santa scientia

  the fellow did not reply to our questions
he seemed to understand nothing of eng-
lish not to mention german it perplexes
us how he reached the island we took him
out with us took our eyes off him a mo-
ment and he had vanished we have
searched the entire island but there was no
trace of him

  of course the island is not so large that
one person could not be found by nearly
four hundred others we thought that per-
haps he might have come over the ocean in
a boat but that would have been simply
impossible in view of the great storms pre-
vailing at the time he must have a cave
somewhere in which he lies perhaps he
is the cause of the disappearance of some
of our food lately in that case we unjust-
ly suspected our coolies it is a pity but
we must keep guard still what great dan-
ger could one single negro cause us and
many persons can certainly not be living
here in caves

  the transfer of our treasure is completed
the vault looks like the fabled treasure
chamber of haroun a raschid the gold
ingots are piled up high in special boxes
are the jewels there stand strange jugs

and pots fantastic weapons and costly neck-
laces just as the inca art made them cen-
turies ago a splendid museum we shall
use only the gold and the loose stones

  mr moller was here and appraised ev-
erything while i made the list it is a
mighty treasure it is incredible what
quantities of gold and other precious met-
als what innumerable jewels are piled up
here

  the inca grotto in which the stone
atahualpa now sits on his throne without
his treasure we have closed up by a plate
of iron before our grotto are mighty
vault-doors imbedded in concrete we
must also be on guard against the chinese

        chapter x
        the disaster i

the negro was here again and saw us
carrying the gold ingots suddenly
we saw him standing not far beneath us
and as we gazed he disappeared again just
as quickly as though he had sunk into the
ground i hear that the chinese are telling
stories of horrors on the island it is still
a mystery to us where the fellow lives

  now we are going to construct the city
the plan is ready and we only need to de-
cide the type of construction we have
only a few serviceable stones here and we
shall not use them at all we shall have
iron shipped to us in great quantities isa-
bella is to be made of iron and glass
ilomer has discovered that we have great
amounts of silicic earth here from which
excellent glass can be made

  it is well that we have among the mech-
anics young helling who worked several
years with schott in jena and has an exact
knowledge -of the manufacture of the new
glass which allows ultra-violet rays to pass
through it is also well that we have all
our chemicals furnished by our volcano
now we have ordered a million machines
daily the ships moor at the reef and unload
with curious sailors crowding the decks
then on calm days we have to bring our
property to our island in small motorboats

  moller has spread the ruiuor that some-


wonder stories

where in the ocean he wants to build an ar-
tificial island as an intermediate port for
airships people laugh at that and think
him crazy but they pay no heed to what
goes on nobody notices whether the big
packages contain concrete blocks or mach-
ine parts

  we are celebrating a festival of victory
now we can work for everything we need
has been brought to us we have not only
earth but everything-else for the manufac-
ture of glass

  will our new city be beautiful also
though we live in a practical age we real-
ize that all that is really practical can also
be beautiful simply because it fulfills its
purpose the plan which otto schultz
has designed and drawg in many colors is
certainly beautiful in its way he did not
work it all out himself grete helling the
young wife of one of the engineers helped
with it what is better work for a woman
than the display of good taste for a practi-
cal cause

  our prosaic city will resemble one from
a fairy tale we shall color the glass walls
ehosing green red and blue glass and all
sorts of pastel shades there is a purpose
in that also elizabeth muller also a young
wife of an engineer now assistant to prof
weigand has made a deep study of psycho-
logy and the influence of colors on the
moods of people we shall provide the
houses in which the work rooms are lo be
placed with red glass this stimulates the
nerves living rooms will be light yellow
or milky white rest rooms will be blue for
blue lessens the nervy tension green quiet
green is suited for mercantile offices

  our city is also to be healthful il is to
have more pafks and green expanses than
any other city and at the same time save
space therefore all houses are to be of
the same height all roofs are covered
with thick loam and gardens and parks are
put there the streets are all bridged over
so that the whole city surface at the height
of the tenth story forms a single great gar-
den in which we place artificial brooks
ponds and fountains

  we shall build a few important buildings
higher-such as hospitals homes for the

aged schools and hotels then these al-
though they wilf form the eleventh and
twelfth stories will look as though they lay
on level ground in the park in the center
of each roof will rise a slender four-corner-
ed glass tower which will pour over the
park a bright light softened by the colors
of the glass

   in the central point before the govern-
ment building we shall have a great open
square for public metings of course at the
height of the pedestrian streets it will be
cooled naturally by beautiful waterfalls
the water from the roof fountains and the
artificial brooks which flow through the
roof park will rush in cascades over ter-
races of glass we dwell upon the magical
effect of these waterfalls which we can
illuminate as we like the water is finally
collected and flows again to the stream which
feeds our electrical machines

this is to be the appearance of isabella
when it is finished now our workmen
are staking out the surfaces while the great
glass factories are being erected in the
iron foundry on the coast preparations are
being made to produce the iron girders the
beams of aluminum alloy and the other nec-
essary construction materials

   it is splendid to be ableto create things
in their entirety and work with clear healthy
minds and strength

  we have gone through the worst days
possible for us we were as though para-
lyzed and thought it was all over for us
during saturday evening the horrible thing
happened something so terrible that we
could not adjust ourselves for days it was
an earthquake really not a bad one but only
a subterranean shock which terrified us for
a moment such little shocks happen fairly
often in our neighborhood and have never
done any serious harm

   this time also everything was all over in
a few minutes but these minutes ruined us
our electrical power plant stopped sud-
denly the light went out and the power fail-
ed at first we thought it a temporary
disturbance the earthquake might have
deluged the machinery with some stones
but when we investigated we found the
utopia

island



machines were all in order but the hot
breath of the volcano which had puffed
through the pipes in regular beats like a
giant heart was gone the volcano was si-
lent the steam power had ceased we were
in dumb horror the electric light and
electric power were gone our fields were
bound to dry up for the suction machines
which conducted the sea water to them no
longer worked on work was at a stand-
still even our motor boats could not have
their batteries charged

  we stepped up on the hill to look out
had the volcano disappeared impossi-
ble the power which lived underground
in the mountain and the steam which used
to force its way out had had their course
changed a little the steam would have to
come out somewhere

  although we were acquainted only with
those which alesius had discovered before
us we knew that the whole island was a
network of such old volcanic passages
were there not perhaps other such caverns
beneath us at any moment the ground
beneath our feet might begin to rock an
abyss might open up and swallow the be-
ginnings of santa isabella in a glowing sea
of lava

  mr cook cried out there

  we looked where he pointed on the
sea not far from us a fire was blazing up

  a burning ship someone shouted

  how did a ship get so near our shore
how had it got on fire how could we
helpless ones give ny aid

 romer waved both his arms he had
run to the sheet iron shack and fetched the
telescope that is no ship that is a new
volcano

  he had hardly said this when a gigantic
column of fire rose apparently from the
waves a dark red column of fire in which
white hot points swirled up as in a pyro- 
technic display in the next moment this
column was already spreading out like a
pahn tree and everywhere the glowing mass-
s were falling into the foaming sea there
must have been great compressed glowing
bodies nevertheless filled with gas for as
vaon as they struck the water they exploded
they flew around as little white hot missiles

like fragments of grenades and fell to earth
even close to us

  we fled shrieking and burning fire-
works on their own account in their super-
stitious terror to lessen the anger of their
gods the chinese coolies ran up the slope
which led to the great crater which we had
called mt atahualpa and in whose peak the
inca grave is located we followed then-

  midnight we stand high up on the
mountain now we at least know that there
is no danger threatening here that no erup-
tion is to be feared that the infernal sub-
terranean forces have chosen another path
and santa isabella is saved from destruc-
tion

  a magnificent and fearful spectacle the
formation of a volcano we needed no
telescope we knew thal the volcano had
come into being on the little reef of santa
roca not far from our island alas for
the poor tortoises and iguanas that lived
there the crater had risen up increas-
ing from second to second there rose from
its midst a tall white hot column a tower

il	rose was played around by yellow green
and blue flames and burst at the summit
and plunged down floods of lava poured
over the edge of the crater with a ruddy
glow and flowed into the boiling sea

  how splendid this sea was we could
see plainly its play of colors in the light
of the devils torch yellowish foam dashed
uj high as though the water were scream-
ing from painful burns but then came a
deep azure stretch of calm waves and only
further on were the high billows again pro-
duced by the earthquake in the absence of
any wind

reconstruction

the whole night long we stood in silent
consternation slowly the first vehe-
mence of the volcano seemed to be lessen-
ing the column vanished plunging into
the ocean with millions of tiny sparks with
a volley of explosions

  when morning finally came when the
first rays of early red blended with the col-
ors of the fire-spitting mountain to make
an incredibly splendid symphony of colors


wonder stories

the reef was entirely changed a cone had
risen up over whose edge the lava was now
slowly flowing down by day the pillar
of fire was changed into a palm tree of
smoke which now stood seriously and calm-
ly above the newly made volcano

  romer turned to us it had actually jjeen
hours since we had exchanged any words
the danger is over for us

  but our electric power is gone

  vetter nodded it was certainly an er-
ror to build on things which are so transi-
tory and whose duration we cannot judge
we will at once set to work with all our
might to complete the second power plant
which is to use the waves of the sea ebb
and flow will always remain

  we climbed down and the chinese col-
lected about us the great barracks in
which they lived lay in ruins they had
been destroyed during the night by the glow-
ing projectiles we must change our plan
we must build the city of isabella on the
other side of the island where it cannot be
struck we should be cowardly and un-
worthy of our lofty task if we let ourselves
be intimidated now   

  we have made a discovery a spring has
broken through the rocks a fresh mountain
spring we do not know how long it will
flow or whether it is merely the outflow of
an inner chamber full of water or something
of the sort but we at least have water and
wt are digging cisterns and saving il
today is very hot since our water raiser
has failed which formerly provided cool-
ness and since the tropical sun is reenforced
by the fiery glow of the volcano it is hard-
ly bearable

  while the chinese are going to work und-
er the guidance of the engineers to put to-
gether hastily the turbines of the new power
plant which is to use the ebb and flow
and while mr cook is going over to cabo
martino the reef enclosing our harbor to
see whether anything has been destroyed
of the machines and supplies there  am
making a tour of inspection with prof
weigand

  it is natural that our first stop is the old
inca cave in which alesius died the
earthquake which did not seem very ser-

ious to us must after all have been quite
severe the shaft which he engineers had
driven into the cave is filled up in return
however the little crater bay where we
formerly had to dive has become an en-
closed lake for falling rocks have raised
the height of the bar and the sea can no
longer get in the whole lake is cpvered
with the bodies of animals strange bizarre
forms fish from die depths of the sea which
were hurled up from the bottom of the cave
lake there is now a natural entrance in
the rock we no longer need to dive

  there is a boat on the shore we push
it into the water take our lanterns which
we must use sparingly because we have no
way of charging their batteries until the new
power plant is completed and cautiously
go to the new opening

  the cave is completely changed we
have probably always been in great danger
when we climbed up in the shafts for the
rock was more brittle than we assumed
a great deal must have fallen down for the
lake in which the deep water fish made their
lanterns shine is filled up this explains
the fact that the flood wave which arose
because of the shock cast their bodies out

  the shafts have disappeared a giant
block of stone has covered the entrance to
the inca grotto it is well that we stowed
away the treasures now the entrance to
where they used to be is perhaps blocked
forever

  but the grotto is muefi much bigger it
is a mighty subterranean lake now that
soft sunbeams are entering it reminds one
of the much larger grotto of capri

  it will be the problem of our mining en-
gineer romer who is also a capable geolo-
gist to determine whether new falls of rock
are to be feared if not this lake can afford
us great pleasure and i have my own plans
for it

we leave the grotto close before the
entrance sits the giant iguana i
fancy that it is the same one which one
greeted alesius and which he took for a
good omen while weigand with tremb-
ling hands is collecting the cast-up wonder-
utopia

island



fal fish of the lake for his investigations i
return to the others   

  i again pass over a half year we have
already had two anniversaries of the day
vthich brought us all to the island we have
lost months through the earthquake and we
had to use all our power to make the new
electric plant it is completed now it
will never fail especially since the new
volcano has become a regular but slowly
operating valve for the subterranean forces
also our plantings which were drying up in
those days have long since been restored
now we are building our city

  the buildings are beginning lo rise and
already we can lay the concrete slabs on
our foundations of stone blocks and our
iron floor frameworks mounted on them

  we have done well to get the young en-
gineer helling he is building the city
under the guidance of schiiltz it is ridi-
culous one man building the city to be
sure that means that a head architect con-
trols a number of hundred workmen but
here it is to be taken literally helling
and twenty helpers are building the city
together with their iron assistants which
crotefendt has invented

  the iron girders lie piled up in the proper
order an iron arm of a crane sinks down
seizes in its claws one of the girders weigh-
ing thousands of pounds swings it aloft
and places it at the right spot at once
apparently automatically a riveting mach-
ines comes to it up at a dizzy height and
rivets the girder fast while at the same
time the crane is bringing up a new gird-
er it is an incredible maze of wires mov-
able cranes devices constantly rising high-
er by a screw motion and electric cables
over the whole thing as though on radio
towers there hangs on masts the mighty
searchlights which illuminate everything

  the entire shore of the island is a gigan-
tic construction site far down under the
earth runs the tunnels while trucks running
on rails automatically convey out the debris
and throw it into the sea of course even
this is done according to accurately drawn
plans for out of this debris we are making
c breakwater which is later to enclose the
real harbor which we must some day have

  often when i stand on the hill at night
it seems lo me as though all this were not
reality but the fantasy of a night of fever
yet all goes on according to definite rules
and laws and is only the work of ingenious
men

chapter xi
the crisis

besides helling the twenty newly ac-
quired young germans are at work
under their guidance under the finger pres-
sure with which they operate keys almost
like those of a typewriter the buildings are
rising up the iron arms are building the
iron city themselves and to them it is all
one whether or not the suns rays are blaz-
ing down upon their work they know no
hunger or thirst or weariness

  when the whistles blow at evening otto
muller and twenty other mechanics relieve
helling gigautic searchlights blaze forth
and the work continues dufing the night
even these searchlights would not be need-
ed for the accurately adjusted machines
would work in the darkest night only the
human eyes which observe their work re-
quire light

  at the same time other machines are ac-
tive the vitreous earths are continually
fetched in great amounts from the wastes
and are blended together they are then
cast in great plates colored and polished

  all the panes of glass in isabella are of
the same size cranes hoist the panes into
the ready rectangles of steel and set them
up the machines then putty them in obed-
ience to the commands of the electric key-
board the double glass walls arise with the
cooling spaces between

  under the hands of all these iron arms
the construction is growing visibly per-
fectly regular the house blocks rise the
glass walls are added to rooms the ceilings
of concrete slabs stretch across and finally
bridges span the future streets at once
other cranes carry up earth which has been
chemically changed from unfertile soil lo
rich loam and at last sowing machines roll
across the new garden land


wonder stories

  gravel walks come into being under the
guidance of the two engineers wives who
are busy as gardeners from numerous
pipes streams of water are beginning to fill
basins and cascades with joyous life while
diligent chinese hands are planting shrub-
bery and palms

  everything is happening exactly accord-
ing to the prearranged plans and in the
greatest quiet for each citizen works with
only the carefully devised machines as-
signed to him and these are silent work-
men

  thus the city grows for which everything
is on hand except the inhabitants

  the shaft under the new central building
has long been completed from it a tunnel
has been advanced to the sea soast here
a few hundred meters below the surface of
the water is an artificial cave in which mr
grotefendt the rapid transit expert has set
up his machines they are connected by a
further shaft with the melting furnaces up
on the short from here he has extended
his floating tube out into the sea for the
reception of his railway   

  it is splendid in santa scientia this
creative life everywhere and while the
houses are being finished here yonder the
crops are beginning to thrive and out on
the sea boats with divers are struggling to
connect up the parts of the tube forced out
of the pressing machine with their hawsers
it is wonderful to look into the shining eyes
of all these people who day by day will see
their bold thoughts become reality   

  our city is completed and our plans at a
turning point we must have people our
previous system no longer suffices it is
useless to have only ten or twenty persons
come to us annually

  among the first immigrants are people
from all lands that in itself can do no
harm america has proved lhat a good new
race can result from a veritable mixing of
all races especially if they come with intel-
ligent heads and sound bodies but we
must be careful for the police authorities
are very keen to spy on us the cards
which our pilots used to send in frisco
draw people no longer and if we should
venture to seek women and children in the

  same fashion and make them disappear we
should be considered the worst kind of
abductors

something must happen something
great which will get us past this crisis
but what for the first time there is fail-
ure of our thoughts which are only trained
for technique and machines it is a great
pity but our splendid city which is a cen-
tury ahead of the whole world is wasted

  is this good news moller has written
from frisco and sent us some german pa-
pers a german expedition is on the way
to our part of the world with a number of
noted german scholars there is a great
danger for us in this because the report
states that they are to study the air currents
on the west coast of south america ger-
man scholars they must not be lost they
must not discover our secret but they must
also not return home in failure

  we have discussed the question these
german scholars must become acquainted
with our work and we must as it were sub-
ject ourselves to their judgment can we
invite them openly no no other country
must suspect anything as yet they must
become our guests without wishing and
knowing it   

  we have received another report a
german criminologist named schliiter is en
route to discover what has become of the
germans who vanished previously   

  an airship just brings us the news that
the expedition has sailed from frisco on the
private yacht nightingale which belongs to
a man from chile this dr schliiter has
also gone on board now is our opportun-
ity now we must see whether we can bring
them to us   

  a fearful hurricane is raging on the sea
the yacht has fared ill we kept observing
it from on high by planes at heights where
the storm no longer rages

  our planes have succeeded in getting
somewhat lower we have a report that
will becker one of our best mechanics
was fortunate enough to be hired in frisco
a a machinist on the nightingale the
yacht uses electric power we are sending
utopia

  out a great zeppelin which has all requisite
apparatus on board for our plan

  the zeppelin is floating in the calm air
above the ocean it has succeeded in using
its powerful storage batteries to make con-
tact with the nightingale the yacht no
longer obeys the will of its officers and is
subject to the distant control of our zeppe-
lin which must bring it to the band of rad-
iation surrounding cabo martino

  a giant wave has hurled the almost
wrecked yacht through our hydrogen bar-
rier now it is in perfectly calm water
and so close to land that it obeys our long
distance control machine in the rocks of
cabo martino

  the zeppelin returns bob white sets
out for cabo martino to receive our invol-
untary guests we are afraid that they will
be angry at the violence we have shown
them we hope we can soon conciliate
them

	 

  the journal is ended the gentlemen
arise

  this is indeed an explanation but one
that only a giant brain can actually com-
prehend

  at any rate  am thankful to these
giants

  to think that you should say such a
thing colleague ortler

  this is if we may generalize simply the
technical and scientific future of the world

  the door opened and bob white stood
before them have you finished read-
ing

  we would not believe what we have
heard if we had not seen the city with our
own eyes

  van rhyn was deep in thought who
built the apparatus which allows us to see
at the same time as it reads aloud

  mr vetter of course

  he has taken away from me my lifes
work does ail that depend on selenium
cells

  no that was not possible yon see
that the books are in very thick print and
that the letters almost resemble those used
for the blind a special construction of
the lamps causes the writing to cast shadows

on a sensitive plate inside the apparatus
remarkably delicate cells of a substance
still more sensitive then selenium which
your colleague vetter will explain to you
are so arranged that electric currents are
released by those shadows which interrupt
the light on the surface

  these again produce radiations which
make it possible by their oscillations to
convert the writing into sounds and make it
heard in the loudspeaker all in all this
is simply a further development of the radio

it is a very beneficial invention especially
for our hospitals there indeed we have
the same apparatus with head-phones and
it is possible for each patient to have any 
book he wants read to him in this way
without his being tied down to the fixed
program of a radio station and without one
disturbing another

  van rhyn nodded vigorously yes if
one only has time money and an undis-
turbed place to meditate

  that is just our aim we now ask you
gentlemen to think over what you have
seen tomorrow we shall once more take
you through all that we have made then
mr cook requests your judgment and your
opinion

  bob white the only one aside from weig-
and who had spoken with them while the
other creators of this marvel remained mod-
estly in the background bowed and left the
room the scientists remained for a long
time earnestly exchanging opinions

conspiracy

disorder was again prevailing in the
republic of puitu the aged presi-
dent ronaldo ferreira who wanted to imi-
tate the great porfirio diaz of mexico had
conducted an iron rule conditions had
been better under his control but as is often
the case the debts of the little state threat-
ened to become enormous the attempts
which the president had made to get ameri-
can money brought with them the danger
of giving the control of the country to the
united states as had already happened in
most of the smaller south american coun-
tries


wonder stories

  a strong opposition party had developed
which wanted to unseat ferreira with
great gesturing it cried its watchword pui-
tu for the people of puitu and not for the
foreigners

  they were mostly fanatical young men
with revolutionary inclinations some of
them persons who being deep in debt
wished a revolution less for reasons of pat-
riotism then for profit joao ferreira the
son of the president a young man of un-
bridled ambition and adventurous temper-
ament was the soul of malcontents

  in a little country house outside the sea-
port of the state the conspirators assemb-
led among their leaders was especially
don christobal a gifted young man and
the chief secretary of the president the
little back room in which the pretended
gambling club used to gather was closely
covered with curtains and it was night

  don joao stepped toward his friends
an important message

  christobal was impatient time is
pressing if we do not make a proclama-
tion unseat the president and act quickly
all is lost in two weeks the gentlemen
from washington will be here if fer-
reira is still president then we will fare
like nicaragua and panama and be only
vassals of the uniter states

  another interjected and suppose we do
make a proclamation what is the use
have we money enough can we work
magic what is the use

  don joao stepped to the center what
if i have the money

  millions

  countless millions

  the others laughed where are they
my own father has given them to an
american they are on the iguana is-
lands

  the fabulous inca gold nonsense
my dear fellow

  no nonsense

  have you seen it

  no but i have someone here who has
seen it who was present when those slave
dealers those new filibusters carried it off
in great heaps

  the americans

   they and their german cronies what
 are they doing there what is the mys-
 tery what is the meaning of their allow-
 ing no one on their island  what are these
 puzzles i know more than anyone they
 are dangerous people god knows what
 goes on there the league of nations would
 have to interfere but- he laughed i
 think we will help ourselves

   they own the island you know that
 when there were such rumors once the gov-
 ernment made an investigation now the
 island has been sold fb them with all it con-
 tains

    because my father is an old doddering
 man

   christobal shook his head first we
 want to learn what is going on there on the
 island

    joao nodded i will fetch the man who
 will tell you

   he went out and immediately returned
 with a negro who was dressed in a fine mod-
 ern suit and spoke fluent spanish now
 answer again all questions who are
 you

    my name is sam and i was cook on the
 airship in which prof alesius was once
 wrecked on iguana island then i volun-
 tarily remained on the island when the pro-
 fessor was saved my wife stayed with
 me

   why did you remain behind

    i wanted to get the inca treasure which
the professor had discovered

    did you see it

 cit was in the cave of the mummy i
 a saw the gold bars and the quantities of
 jewels which were heaped around the throne
 then in the years of wretchedness i tried
 vainly to get into the cave the earthquake
 filled it in my wife died and i remained
 alone i could not leave the place of the
 treasure and i hoped that a ship would
 come i would have told the captain and
 made a deal with him but nothing came

 i lived on turtle meat and iguanas day
 after day i looked for the entrance to the
 grotto but i did not find it

    the treasure does not exist

   then-five years ago-a yacht came
utopia

island



  stood on the shore hidden behind bushes
d aw them land they were prof ale-
ius a tottery old man and two americans
 saw them dive into the crater lake by the
bore they disappeared for hours and
hen i aw them come back again the two
f them carrying the dead professor in their
rms

  they went away i was glad but i
was a fool and thought they had found noth-
ng then the americans came back with
ix other people they blasted a hole in
the mountain again they were gone a long
time and then they came back with the lnca
jpwels in bags and in their arms they
founded a settlement remained on the is-
land and i saw with my own eyes how they
carried down loads of gold and jewels and
flowed them in a treasure vault

  they are rich they have millions they
are dangerous men who steal people and
bring them to the island who knows what
i hey have in mind but i listened to their
talk they were stupid and did not know
that i knew every bypath on the island and
could disappear when i wanted to i took
what i needed and one night when there was
a storm i stole a motorboat and fled they
will think the storm destroyed it i sailed
by compass the sea was quite calm i
steered east because i knew that the coast
could not be far i met another ship a
fteamer they thought i had been ship-
wrecked and took me on board so here i
am

chapter xii
the conspiracy ripens

qttow  ou come t on jao
 jtl the negro was asked

  chance brought me to this house
  what do you want now

  the negros es rolled in wild greed
 want the treasure on the incas which i
have watched over almost ten years on that
lonely island i want it or at least a part
of it  will not give it all up to anyone
else

 the man created throughout a sincere and

sane impression certainly not that of a
madman or a liar

  please wait outside while we take coun-
sel

  the negro was led out and then joao
asked what now

  a scotchman macgonnor a soldier of
fortune who had recently come to puitu
shrugged his shoulders an immediate ul-
timatum to the government the sale is
invalid this man swears that cook when
he talked puitu out of the island knew of its
wealth it was deceit and-

 joao interrupted him why what
does it benefit us if my father now repairs
his error listen gentlemen listen friends
how does it help us

  what do you mean by that

  we ourselves must act is puitu happy
as long as my father is still president

  it lies under the yoke of the tyrant
  we shall make it happy

  loud applause ourselves at least
well then for ourselves the millions
the power and puitu

but how	j

  how many white people are there
there may be fifty but only six besides
cook and his secretary white are leaders
sam knows exactly

  and then

  of these six only the four engineers are
to be feared they know nothing of us
and for years they have peacefully con-
sumed their booty they are not even ac-
customed to post guards we are twenty
brave men determined for anything we
will sneak out to the island we already
have enough money to hire a seaworthy
yacht

  do you think they do not guard the is-
land thus far every ship that even ap-
proached the island has been turned away
by their notorious remote control system
every ship that they noticed we shall
not go to the island but anchor at the coast
of san salvador which is not far from santa
scientia and still belongs to puitu let
them think if their electrical systems de-
tect us that we want to catch fish there
we shall wait until sam tells us the time is
ripe and then we shall glide in the night


wonder stories

over the quiet sea then land and remain con-
cealed by day and attack the american
and his secretary we shall become mas-
ters of the island

  what do we care about the others when
we have the treasure let them be happy in
isabella sam knows what he is about
in a few hours of the night it can all be
over if they wake up if they defend
themselves-still the chinese coolies are not
soldiers and all the fifty whites are not even
three to one against us

  the young men surroufcded joao enthus-
iastically the plan was discussed and
sam was recalled do you want to guide
u purposely they addressed the negro
as senor

  what do i get

  how large is the treasure

  many hundred millions

  you get a million when it is in our
hands

  the plan was briefly presented to him
and he grinned i guide it is not at all
hard i think they have no weapons there
but shotguns and the chinese fear me as an
evil spirit which has often terrified them
when i went requisitioning as they say in
war i have been making war on them for
five years

  stand up everyone swear gentlemen
joao became solemn and serious swear
gentlemen to tell no one of our plan and to
keep the secret

  we swear

  it was late at night when the young men
went home purposely singing loudly and
pretending drunkenness sam had to stay
with don joao so that he might reveal noth-
ing even by chance

  the next morning notable news could be
read in the guayaquil newspapers the
yacht nightingale in a very miserable con-
dition had been towed into the harbor by a
steamer it could only be assumed that the
captain his officers and the four men of
the crew who had been found on board com-
pletely exhausted had lost their reason
the things that they told were entirely too
incredible

  the matter of the hurricane was certain-
ly true but nobody believed the yarn about

a iodestone mountain which had attracted i
them besides that there was the landing i
and disappearance of the six scientists i
afterward the yacht was supposed to have
wandered about for days and due to the
breaking of the rudder to have lost its pow-
er of being steered finally it had been
sighted by the steamer which had taken it
in tow

the port commander shrugged his
shoulders they have lost their rea-
son-or else they have marooned the expe-
dition somewhere and basely deserted it i
a telegram was sent to the owner of i he
yacht at santiago de chile van breeken
and his men were taken to the hospital but
they were guarded like prisoners

  only don joao and christobal who were i
sauntering on the shore together were of
another opinion the captain is right
the six germans have disappeared into the
mantrap of the american like the others
then we will do a good deed in saving
them

  at worst there are six old professors
more if they make common cause with the
others

  now be quiet we are on the street
come to my house senor my friends are
all assembled

  they walked silently together until they
had reached the lonely building in which
the eighteen other conspirators were sitting
around a roulette wheel and having the
balls rolled joao who felt his position as
leader and future president of puitu be-

men

  macgonnor laughed for bills on the
future millions of the iguana islands he
explained

  they belong to the state of puitu was
the answer

  there was a general laugh

  we are patriots and care for our father-
land we are sacrificing those eight men
because our duty demands it

  hello old man you shall play presi-
dent but the money will be divided

  let us say half and half half for us

 longs to puitu

 the whole belongs to us

 we are risking our lives

 we need no guardian

 christobal stood in their midst gen-
 tlemen we are dividing the skin of a lion
 which we have not yet killed

 christobal is right first the money
 then die division

 when

 even joao was again calm first one
 of us must go to santa scientia as the men
 call their robber city we have discussed
 everything don christobal shall be the
 one as secretary of my father he can gain
  ntry as a sort of ambassador from puitu
 not christobal

 why not

 because he makes common cause with
 yon drawing lots shall decide
 christobal was indignant i force my-

 then draw

 they drew lots and it fell to the scotch

-	the land of joy

 the six scientists formerly of the night-
 ingale who had by now completely for-
 gotten their reason for coming to this part

of die world were sitting at breakfast and

bob white was again widi them

  gentlemen you have seen that we have
made a sort of watering place about the
great clinic of dr weigand we have
named it alesia after our great professor
now we propose to you diat you go there for
twenty-four hours so that you may think
over everything in peace first we will
make another tour through the factories

  agreed

  they went of course by means of die
travelling chairs once more to the lower
rooms of the building naturally the four
lowest stories were without natural daylight
yet they were well lighted the light did
not come from any sort of lamps but rad-
iated indirectly from the grooves under die
arched ceiling there was a perfect im-
pression of natural daylight prevailing here

  that is just the trouble about an illum-
ination which comes from a definite glow-
ing body the eye is needlessly strained by
looking into a source of light you see
that here too according to the kind of work
to be done we have variously colored panes
before the sources of light these colors
are to act on the nerves of the workers
likewise there are the measuring appara-
tus giving at every moment the exact com-
position of the air those devices are of
course not here but in the air regulating
station

  a man sits there-later it may be a girl
-and has nothing to do but observe die
different air measurers and by simple move-
ments of levers regulate the access of ozone
or the ventilators which remove the bad air
here we avoid the mistakes made elsewhere
if you go into some ballroom you will soon
suffer from great heat tobacco smoke and
consequent cramping of breathing our
system on the other hand assures that the
air is everywhere and always kept to a com-
position which is pleasant and healthful
whether thousands of persons are in the
roomor whether it is empty you cannot
imagine how bad air wears out the lungs

  then you use huge quantities of artifi-
cial oxygen

not at all merely a system of pipes
which lake away the bad air pass it through

an explosive outrush of purple vapor hurled them backward
now george whispered


through the purple cloud



  a rather pretty girl was seated across
from george cleland on the other
side of the aisle they were in the rear
compartment of ihe gigantic four-motored
fokker passenger plane just taking off from
the alhambra field at los angeles for the
three-hour flight to san francisco - or
rather to meet as weird and astounding an
adventure as ever be-
fell human beings

george was returning
to his office in san
francisco and to his
engineering work after
a summers vacation

  he watched the girl
with interest as the
steward handed her the
little package of ab-
sorbent colton with
which to-stop her ears
against the oppressive
roar of the motors

clearly it was her first
long flight her smooth
cheeks were flushed
with excitement her
shining gray eyes
looked up quickly to
tee what the other pas-
sengers were doing
with the cotton

 her eyes met
georges she smiled
at him a little accept-
ing him as a compan-
ion in the adventure of
the flight he grinned
instructing her to
twist the soft cotton
into cylinders and fit
them into her ears

she smiled her thanks

  already the great
plane had rolled across the field with ever-
increasing speed powerful motors thunder-
ing had left the ground to rise easily
through the low gray fog into the brilliant
sunlight of the august morning

  george liked the girl she was pretty
soft brown hair glistening with ruddy
lights tastefully arranged bright face

 flushed with excitement gray eyes shining
 she wore a dark green traveling suit neat
 and trim the body beneath it seemed to
 be neat and trim ttoo athletic and well-
 developed she looked like a co-ed he
 remembered that the university at berke-
 ley would open in a few days and sup-
 posed that she was flying up to attend it

                      two other men were
                   sitting in that rear
                   compartment with
                   them-the great plane
                   did not have a full
                   load and four of the
                   seats were empty fac-
                   ing george was a slen-
                   der meager little
                   man whose black suit
                   was polished with
                   wear he wore enor-
                   mously thick-lensed
                   glasses and his face
                   was narrow pinched
                   bird-like so that he
                   gave georges imagin-
                   ative mind the sugges-
                   tion of a grotesque
                   goggle-eyed monster

                       presently he leaned
                    forward however with
                    the fnap of the route
                    that the steward had
                    handed him introduc-
                    ed himself as howard
                    cann said that he
                    owned a dry goods
                    store in oakland and
                    asked george to help
                    him locate the observ-
                    atory which according
                    to the map should be
                    in sight on mt wil-
                    son his voice sound-
                    ed thin and bird-like
                    above the unceasing roar of the motors

  george pointed out the silver domes and
 towers shimmering on the crest of the
 mountain in the bright august sunlight
 cann nodded his thanks and bent over the
 map again

  the other man was sunk sullenly into a
 seat facing the girl george did not like

 tp he world of our senses
  we arc coming to learn

  the real world may be ice
  have no means of knowing
  even our laws of nature
  are the product of our sen-
  sual observations and may
  be fraught with as many

  ceptions of the universe

    einstein has introduced
  into our scientific thinking
  an almost limitless vista of

him his clothes fitted his bull-like form
loosely grotesquely his heavy-jowled
face was black with a short stubble of
beard from beneath a disreputable cape
pulled low over his forehead he was star-
ing at the girl rather to her discomfort

  his ferret eyes were black shifty george
noticed that he swept the compartment
watchfully with them at intervals always
resuming his annoying gaze at the girl i
wouldnt like to meet him on a dark night
thought george

they had been up a little less than an
hour when the astounding catastrophe
took place

  the little spectacled
man who said his name
was cann had persisted in
his high-voiced questions

george had pointed out
to him the san fernando
and santa clara valleys
and tejon pass and le-
bec they were just com-
ing across the last gray
mountain range over the
southern tip of the great
san joaquin valley

 the air had been
smooth though the ship
seemed to rise and iall
with a slow almost reg-
ular motion the girl
had seemed to be enjoy-
ing her flight immensely peering out of the
windows with a lively interest once or
twice to georges pleasure she had leaned
over to watch when he was pointing out
something of interest on canns map

  once she had asked some little question
her voice above the mighty overwhelming
roar of the four great motors had seemed
clear and pleasant george began to re-
gret that the flight and their companion-
ship must end in a few short hours when
the great plane glided down to the alameda
airport across the bay from san francisco

  but the plane and most of her passengers
never reached alameda

  george happened to be peering out when
it occurred trying to locate for cann the

stories

town of maricopa which lay a little to th
left and ahead of the plane

  the air before the ship was suddenl
filled wiith a blinding purple light a
though a great shell had burst releasing 
vast volume of incandescent violet vapor a
moment before the sky had been clear
the purple cloud appeared suddenly as i
from thin air

  its diameter must have been many mile
extending from the ground into the cloud
less sky above them the great plane was
plunging almost at the ceftter of it and
far too close for the pilot to turn aside

  george thinks however that the ship
was suddenly tilted up at
the last instant as if the
pilot had attempted lo
zoom above the purple
cloud bui it was only a
moment after the cloud
appeared that they struck
it the tragedy was oc-
casioned by chance not
by any want of skill -
and no display of skill
could have averted it

  but as they pierced
through it george saw
the purple cloud con-
tract swiftly it became
a great smooth-surfaced
sphere of violet-rei radi-
ance then somehow it
semed to flatten become
thin until it was only a disk of red-blue
light

  it became a circle of purple flame a
hundred yards and more in diameter -
we can judge its size only from george
clelands guess based on that quick glimpse
of the amazing thing a disk of amethy-
stine fire hanging in the air with the great
plane plunging away from its center

  a long dreadful instant went by after
george knew that they had crashed through
it he had time to wonder what it was to
wonder if it could be only some trouble
with his eyes then he realized that others
could see it for cann shrank back from the
window and clutched at his arm

  without a sound or a vibration they had
through the

purple cloud



passed through the purple disk into a flood
of crimson light

  george was dazed

  one instant the blue sky was above and
the grecn-blue fields beneath the next
they were flying at some crazy angle be-
neath a sky that was red plunging toward
the foot of a precipitous cliff of jet-black
rock

  the cloud of purple had been like a gate
to another world they had flashed through
it into another plane of existence that
seemed to lie co-existent with ours yet more
distant than the andromeda nebula to the
science of a few decades ago such a thing
would have been incredible but einsteins
relativity with its four-dimensional contin-
uum with its destruction of the old con-
ception of space as an absolute dimension
brings it much nearer to understandable
phenomena and it is confidently trusted
that the implications of the incident nar-
rated here will result in a farther modifica-
tion of the changing theories of relativity

  the plane was hurtling toward tlie base
of a rugged towering wall of grim black
rock which had suddenly appeared beyond
the purple disk a crash was inevitable
the pilot had time only to bank the ship
causing it to strike the ebon cliff obliquely
instead of head on

  george was stunned by the crash

  his last recollection was-of their plung-
ing flight toward the sheer soaring wall of
black rock of the attempting turn that had
failed to save them of the splintering
crashes and the merciless bruising shock
of the collision with the mountain

the land of the scarlet sky

memory did not return at once as
he recovered he found himself ly-
ing in the bottom of a dark cramped place
with a soft human body beside him a
hoarse voice evidently that of the bearded
man was muttering curses while heavy
feet apparently belonging to the same in-
dividual were carelessly trampling georges
legs

  then george caught the acrid odors of
burning paint and gasoline

  his memory returned he knew that the
plane had crashed into the black mountain
wall that it was wrecked and in flames
the soft body against his was that of the
girl and it was the big man who was -
trampling on the others

  george tried to struggle up pressing a
hand to his head to try to stop the dizzy
pain to clear the faintness from his vision
and the ringing noises from his ears to
sweep the misty clouds of pain from his
mind

  a suffocating breath of flame came from
the forward part of the ship where the
blaze had evidently started

  the fuselage was on its side george saw
the door was above them and the big
bull-like man walking upon their bodies as
carelessly as if they were sacks of grain
was struggling to open the door

  suddenly there was a sharp snap as if
he had broken a lock with the strength of
his great heavy hands a moment later the
door was thrown back revealing the sky
above crimson dark and sullen red as if
deluged in blood

  for a moment the strange scarlet sky was
in view then thick masses of black smoke
touched with flickering lurid yellow
flames floated across it george heard the
increasing roar of the confllagration

  he tried to struggle to his feel still rub-
bing his throbbing head

  thanks mister came the hoarse voice
of the giant mockingly

  the huge man placed one heavy foot on
georges shoulder while he was still on his
knees sprang forward he clambered
through the door in the uppermost side of
the side

  george was sent crashing to the bottom of
the compartment again under the force of
the ruthless kick

  choking black smoke so hot that it sear-
ed his lungs was filling the little space
when it struggled up again the roar and
crackle of the flames was growing swiftly
louder a black and yellow canopy of
smoke and flame was rolling above the
door

  still his head throbbed with dull pain


wonder stories

  his thoughts were slow confused he reeled
  his knees buckled uncertainly

   not much time now he muttered
 guess they are all gone in the front part
 of the ship

    he bent beside the girl lifted her with an
  effort fighting to control his shaking
  knees she was conscious

   whats-matter she whispered in a
 slow uncertain voice

    plane smashed he said burning we
  must get out able to help do your
  best but we have time

    ill try she murmured through white
  compressed lips

    he lifted her in his arms she grasped
  the side of the door he pushed her up she
   scrambled through it for a moment she
  darkened the opening then she was gone
  from sight smoke and fire were still roll-
  ing over the opening

    the forward part of the plane was al-
  already an inferno white heat drove down
  the aisle blinding blistering smoke swirl-
  ed into the compartment gasping for
  breath tears streaming from his eyes per-
  spiration running from his skin under the
  scorching heat the engineer stood still a
  moment to recover from the exhausting ef-
  fort that had been required to lift the
  girl through the door

   a choking groan came from beside his
 feet

    he bent wiping the tears from his smoke-
  blinded eyes distinguished the limp little
  body of cann lying in a little heap in a
  corner of the compartment sprawled over
  the back of a seat

    poor cann cant he muttered in grim
  horror as he began the very serious task of
  lifting the inert body through the door above
  him

 in ever denser volumes the smoke was
 pouring into the compartment blinding
 suffocatiug tears were streaming from
 georges eyes so that he could hardly see
 the bright square of the door above the
 hot smoke seemed to dry and scorch his
 tliroat and lungs he coughed strangled
 sweat was pouring from his body the heat
 was almost intolerable

  and he was still dazed and groggy from
the blow that had stunned him when the
great plane crashed his head throbbed with
leaden pains his ears rang queerly his
thoughts were slow confused but he did
not hesitate in beginning the grim task of
saving the little man who had questioned
him so persistently in his thin bird-like
tones

  fighting the heavy inertia that tugged at
him george lifted the limp body and thrust
it up toward the door it was a terrific
task some malignant demon seemed to be
pressing back against him his aching
muscles relaxed despite the fiercest effort
of his will the unconscious man fell back
into his arms

  geoije bent sucked in a deep breath of
the cooler air that hung in the bottom of
compartment and raised himself thrusting
the body of the little man up again at last
his arms straightened the still body was
outside lying beside the door atop the
fuselage

  a blistering tongue of lurid yellow flame
licked through the compartment up through
the open door george gasped and stran-
gled from the hot breath of it he felt hair
burned from his head felt the bare skin of
his face and hands scorched

  reeling from exhaustion and the linger-
ing effects of the blow he had received when
they fell he bent for another gasping in-
halation of the still breathable air in the
bottom of the compartment then he stood
up grasped the sides of the door leaped
and struggled to draw himself through it

  burning smoke swirled up about him he
strangled tried to hold his breath his
muscles cracked the effort seined almost
beyond him in his weakened condition
and an infernal river of smoke and flame
seemed pouring across above the door he
shrank back from it

  then he saw ganns inert hand still
hanging in the door-glimpsed it through
streaming smarting eyes he had to get
out to save the little man

  with a fast fierce effort he swung himself
up got his feet upon the edges of the door
straightened up in a blast of smdke and
flame in a moment he bad snatched up
through the

cann again and leaped blindly desper-
ately into space

  he came down on bare hard rock the
moke was still blinding he could feel the
heating radiation of heat from the inferno
which he had just escaped but he was out
of its intolerable area

  gasping in great breaths of the cooler air
he dragged cann over the rock to where
the heat was bearable he dropped his
limp burden still drawing fresh air into
his tortured lungs and wiped his smarting
eyes

  an amazing world he saw when he was
able to open his painful eyes half of it
was hidden by the dense clouds of smoke
and the lurid curtains of yellow flame that
leaped from the blazing wreck of the plane
but in the half that he saw was matter
enough for wonder and amazement

  the sky was red intensely crimson dark
and oppressive like a dome cut from a
monster ruby and lit with a dull sinister
light from beyond it was unbroken by
cloud or sun or star a pall of scarlet
glcoin sullen and terrible

  beneath the lowering crimson sky was
a barren waste of black rock it resembled
obsidian without the glassy luster of the
volcanic glass it was a dead dull black
somber and unrelieved by any gleam it
did not even reflect the angry fire of the
scarlet sky

  it seemed that they were at the bottom of
a vast pit or abyss for sheer black preci-
pices like that against the foot of which
ihe plane had crashed rose about them in
a rugged wall leaping up to inconceivable
heights

  george estimates that the diameter of this
crater or pit must have been ten or a dozen
miles and he thinks the cliffs that ringed
a must have been fully five miles high no
-icvations of this abruptness are found on
ihe earth though several are to be observed
upon the moon the walls of several lunar
ring-craters rise vertically for several miles
this abyss appeared to be of similar for-
nation

  the floor of the pit was a rugged tor-
     wilderness of black rock cracked and
     ed pitted with innumerable chasms

purple cloud	

thrown up in miniature peaks twisted into
grotesque fantasies of lifeless black stone

  george saw no tree no bird or insect-
no living thing at all

  he had no time to wonder at it then he
merely swept the weird horizon of scarlet
sky and stupendous dull black cliff with a
single glance and turned back to the burn-
ing plane

an explanation

where was the girl she had been
conscious when he helped her
through the door had she been able to
reach a safe distance from the flaming ship

  he heard a faint cry and found her lying
on the ground several yards from the burn-
ing ship she had been able to slip from
the upper side of the fuselage to the ground
to stagger away a few steps before she col-
lapsed

  george carried her out of jlie smoke and
placed her beside the still inert body of
cann

  she was still conscious but weak and
dizzy suffering from concussion

  where are we she whispered the
sky looks red and these black mountains
-they are so high

  i dont know george said well
think of that after a while i was almost
wondering if i wasnt seeing things but
we have a patient here to look after

  he bent over canns limp body

  oh the girl cried suddenly with pain
in her voice you are all burnt your
face and your hands you stayed to carry
us out

what else could i do george asked

  there was another man that didnt stay
the girl said  he trampled all over us and
then climbed out and left us to burn

  wonder where the kindly fellow is
george said he looked about them over
the rugged desolate wilderness of twisted
black stone

  but george paused to wonder again at the
eldrich landscape spread out before him
the barren lifeless waste of burned and
tcrtured black rock the mighty cliffs that
plunged up beyond it-higher than any


wonder stories

 earthly mountains so high they seemed un-
 real they were nightmare mountains
 cruel looming crags from some drugged
 dream their rugged faces swept up far
 toward the zenith surrounding the horizon
 george had an unpleasant sense of oppres-
 sion as if those lofty ebon walls were
 crowding them smothering them

   and above the black peaks the sky was
 crimson red as clouds of blood-mist red
 as a dome of ruby lit with dull sinister
 lights it was lowering gloomy oppressive
 as the bald looming walls-it shone with
 a dark and sullen glare

    the red of blood the red of horror the
  red of death

   george cleland was frightened by it -
 though he took care not to show the girl
 his fears he dropped his gaze from the
 fearful wonder of the new world and re-
 sumed his slow examination of canns body

    the little man was still unconscious his
  clothing had been scorched and torn his
  thick glasses were lost and he looked oddly
  different without them-small and weak
  like a child or perhaps a crippled bird
  his right upper arm had been broken
  george pushed up vthe sleeve to examine
  it on the skin was the blue print of a
  mans heel the bull-like man who sat op-
  posite the girl had stepped on it breaking
  the bone

    george straightened the limb and tried
 to set it but he could find nothing satis-
 factory to use for splints there seemed to
 be no tree or bush-or any living thing at
 all-in the wilderness of black rock from
 which he could get a splint but during his
 search he made a curious discovery

    the barren waste of dead black stone was
  scattered with huge green crystals clear
  and transparent as if cut from monster
  emeralds

    in shape they resembled snow-crystals
 as seen through the microscope six-pointed
 stars with a delicate symmetrical fret-
 work never the same in two crystals be-
 tween the points but they were far hnger
  than snow-crystals three feet from point
 to poinf they were usually three or four
 inches thick the first one that george dis-
 covered lying in a deep crack in the black

rock not far from where the plane had
crashed weighed about twenty pounds he
is unable to make any suggestion as to the
material of which it was composed though
it seems that it must have crystallized in the
air and fallen as a snowflake falls in our
world

  while george was working over cann the
girl told him something of herself

  my name is juanita harvel she said
dad has a fruit ranch near los angeles
i was going up to berkeley to the univer-
sity i was to graduate this year-but my
prospect right now arent very good she
smiled a little then soberly where can
we be

  your guess is as good as anybodys
george told her

  you think- she asked and paus-
l ed oddly do you think that-we
could be-dead the plane smashed it
may have killed us all

  not a bit george cried for myself
i feel very much alive ahd real-especially
where the skin was cooked so its coming
off he grinned painfully

  oh im so sorry for you juanita
cried

  thats all right george assured her
it wont make much difference if im dead
and if im alive ill get well we can
cook up some sort of theory to account for
it all i suppose youve heard about the
so-called fourth dimension

  yes ive heard about it she admitted
but as for understanding it-

  theres been a lot of bunk written on
the subject but nobody seems to know much
about it einsteins theory of relativity
however introduces a fourth dimension
which is not different in any way from die
three odier dimensions we know he says
that to an observer on a different planet
the fourth dimension or part of it might
appear as a spatial dimension and one
of the dimensions that appears spatial to
us would be for him partly or wholly the
fourth dimension

  of course i may be putting an intepre-
tation on his work that he would not a
prove he devised the hypothesis of th
through the

purple cloud



four-dimensional continuum or space-time
as it is more generally called to account for
known facts he was not interested in other
worlds that might lie beside our own bil-
lions of light years distant in our space
but touching the earth in the fourth dimen-
sion

  the plane you know flew into a circle
of purple light that appeared suddenly
ahead of us it may have been a sort of a
gate to this other world through the fourth
dimension this planet may be so far dis-
tant in space from our own world that it is
i-i another universe yet touching it in the
fourth dimension

  how could that be jaunita asked in a
puzzled tone

  i dont know whether i can explain it
very clearly but a favorite method in such
discussions is to form an analogy in di-
mensions of a lower order suppose we
were two-dimensional beings with length
and width but no thickness suppose our
world were on the surface of a sheet of
paper and suppose this planet were on
the other side of the sheet just opposite

  being two-dimensional beings we could
not conceive of the third dimension which
is the thickness of the paper we could
not know of the other world so near nor
could we reach it except by going around
the edge of the sheet

  but suppose somebody stuck a pin hole
in the paper through the two worlds on
opposite sides then we might blunder
through into a new world outside of our
knowledge just as the plane flew through
that purple cloud into this strange place
so we must have fallen through a hole in
the fourth dimension

  and what can we do about it juanita
asked

   dont know my theory may be the
bunk anyhow but there was evidently
some phenomenon either of natural or arti-
ficial cause which swept the plane through
the continuum from our world to this it
may happen again we must watch if we
see it happen we may be able to find th
cause and manipulate it to act in reverse
lo take us home a slim chance but ouf
best bet

  it was not very long before the flames
of the wrecked plane died away only a
mass of bare blackened metal was left
scattered with charred bones when the
wreckage was cool enough george found
some traps of metal in it which he used
as splints on canns broken arm

  the little man remained unconscious

  for a very long time they stayed there
near the wreck-they did not know how
long george had lost  his watch and
juanitas had been broken there were no
days in this weird world no sun the
somber angry crimson of the sky did not
change no luminous object appeared with-
in it

  they grew thirsty for there was no wa-
tei to be had they felt the pains of hun-
ger they reeled with weariness and dared
not sleep but the physical hardships at
first were more endurable than the mental
torture

  they were in a strange world absolutely
foreign it seemed that chemical and phy-
sical processes here did not always follow
the same course as on their own earth
there was no syn-only the sullen gloom
of the crimson sky no living things ex-
cept themselves to break the terrible mono-
tony

blood-red rain

their minds struggled for an explan-
ation of it all how had they come
here  was there any chance for escape
what was the meaning of the red sky of
the huge green crystals that scattered the
stony wilderness of the inconceivably
colossal black mountains

  the air was neither cold nor hot its tem-
perature remained constant faint radiation
of heat as well as light seemed to fall from
the somber scarlet sky george suggested
that the higher atmosphere was filled with
some radioactive gas

  cann never recovered consciousness nor
did he die of his hurts he was murdered
it came about in this wray

  they must have been in the fantastic
world of the adventure for many hours for
both george and juanita were suffering


wonder

stories

keenly from hunger and thirst they were
still watching beside cann during those
long lonely hours they had talked a great
deal they felt drawn together by a pow-
erful sympathy as if they had long been
friends

  both of them were startled immeasurably
by the bullet they had been waiting there
a very long time anxious alert waiitng
they had been fearful of unknown dangers
fearful of the weird life that this world
might possess fearful even of the dead end-
less silence

  the bullet came whining angrily past
them it struck the sheer face of the black
cliff behind them with an explosive plop
and showered them with fine fragments of
broken rock

  george started uncontrollably juanita
half screamed clapped a hand to her lips
and apprehensively grasped th engineers
arm

  what is it she gasped

  sounded like a bullet he said uneas-
ily suppose the inhabitants of this world
have firearms

  look she whispered suddenly in a
strained voice something moving

  she pointed out across the cragged wilder-
ness of dull black rock following her
slender arm george glimpsed a dark object
slowly rising into view behind a twisted
black boulder

  a little wisp of bluish smoke floated up
beside it they heard a crashing report as
another bullet sang past them and thudded
against the precipice behind them scatter-
ing bits of shattered rock

  a man juainta cried

  george saw that it was a human head
covered with unkept black hair and a thick
stubble of black beard a human body
rising behind it grimy clothed in tattered
garments it was the huge sullen indi-
vidual companion of their voyage

  why its an old friend george whis-
pered the man who admired you so
much in the plane he grinned grimly

  what does he mean shooting at us
juanita cried

  gues it wont hurt to ask him george
said he raised his voice and shouted at

the man his tones came oddly shrill and
strange from his dry throat

  what do you want he called

  the man did not reply but he left the
shelter of the black boulder and stalked cau-
tiously toward them a huge terrible figure
a pistol ready in his hand-a heavy auto-
matic

  whats the idea shooting at us
george shouted again in a shrill thirst-
cracked voice

  im dyin for a drink the huge man
growled back no water in this damn
place im thirsty as hell ive got to
drink blood again and again as he
ran toward them he repeated the word in
a voice that had become almost a scream
blood blood  blood

  hes crazy george muttered

  cann still lay unconscious on the bare
black rock when the huge man charging
down upon them was thirty yards away he
shot again-into the body of the unconsci-
ous man george saw the body jerk with
the bullets impact

  oh the girl cried out in horror then
whispered lets run we cant do any-
thing

  george took her hand they ran off along
the foot of the cyclopean wall of dull black
stone they were weak from thirst and hun-
ger and weariness their bodies semed very
heavy and the black rock over which they
fled was so cracked and twisted pitted with
yawning chasms and broken with peaks and
boulders and hummocks that real running
was impossible many times they stumbled
they leaped and crawled and climbed-
jumped bottomless cracks crept across nar-
row ledges clambered up cliffs and boul-
ders

the huge maniac shouted at them to
stop but they paid no heed he fired
at them twice the bullets screamed past
and ricocheted among ie black summits
before them

  down george cried

  he leaped into a deep traverse crack in
the black rock between two massive twisted
summits helped juanita down beside him
they were out of the big mans sight swift-
through the purple cloud



if they stumbled on down the narrow
ravine

  half an hour later when they had cov-
ered perhaps five hundred yards they came
up to where they could see the lunatic
again the huge fellow was bent over what
was left of inoffensive little cann tearing
at his body like a hungry wolf

  horrified they stumbled on again

  long hours-tortured ages-crept by on
and on they drove themselves a man and
a woman lost in an alien world sick with
fear tortured with thirst weak from
hunger reeling from fatigue driven on
by the horror of what they had seen-one
human being rending another like a raven-
ing beast

  they did not travel many miles for
they were weak and the wilderness of
black rock was incredibly rugged twisted
into fantastic sharp-edged masses carved
w ith wild volcanic energies

  the cyclopean cliffs still hemmed them
in an impassable barrier inconceivably
lofty grim precipices leaped sheer half
way to the zenith all about them those
mighty black cliffs were terrible oppressive
like the stone walls of some ancient prison

  the scarlet sky still gleamed above the
jagged summits of the ebon cliffs with a
dark and sullen glare changeless monoton-
ous there was neither day nor night no
sun nor moon nor stars ever broke the
monotony of grim forbidding crimson twi-
light

  it was a long time after they had left
the sight of the wreck when the red rain
fell memory of the hideous orgy of the
maniac already seemed faint to george it
had become unreal a fantastic horror so
far past that it did not matter

  huge red drops began abruptly to fall
from the crimson sky

  but they were not water that could be
drunk-the laws of nature or at least the
chemical composition of the atmosphere
seemed to have been different on that weird
world

  the great drops red as blood were at
least a foot in diameter they came thud-
ding down with terrific force scattering the
waste of black rock they did not spat-

ter they remained lying about in spher-
oids shaped like drops of mercury-but
larger than footballs

  george and juanita sought shelter in a
cave beneath a sloping ledge of dull black
rock while the weird rain was falling

  the ground was by no means covered
with red globules george estimates that
no more than two or three fell on every
hundred square yards

  must be some new chemical with an
enormously strong surface film george
speculated mercury forms round drops
like that or water dropped in fine dust
but these drops are huge compared to
those atmospheric conditions here must
be quite different to what they are on earth
you remember those big green crystals
weve been finding they must be a sort of
snow that falls here some chemical cry-
stallizing in the air and falling as snow
falls on earth-

  theres one juanita cried

  she pointed from under the sheltering
ledge of dull black rock a broad rugged
ravine lay before them a deep cruel scar
that bore witness to the cataclysmic birth
of this alien world on its farther slope
fifty yards away was a glitter of green
standing out against the dead black of the
rock a huge six-sided emerald crystal
sparkling and brilliant like a snow crystal
tinted green and enormously magnified

  another of the riddles of this strange
world

  hours went by the enormous red drops
widely scattered still thudded down from
the sky the wanderers could see several
of the puzzling scarlet spheroids suddenly
george noticed that those they watched were
dwindling in size

  look he cried theyre going away
evaporating i suppose must be some red
gas in the sky which condenses and falls
as rain does on earth and they evaporate
to form clouds again

  it was not long after that an amazing
phenomenon took place a falling red drop
happened to strike the green crystal that
juanita had pointed out george chanced
to be watching the green formation specu-
lative when it occurred he heard the


wonder

stories

crashing explosion saw a vast cloud of
luminous purple vapor rise as if some vio-
lent chemical reaction had taken place be-
tween the scarlet spheroid and the emerald
crystal

  the great burst of shining red-violet
vapor rushed up as suddenly as the white
smoke of a bursting shell it formed an
enormous cloud the cloud of purple con-
tracted swiftly but then it seemed to form
an immense disk which they viewed oblique-
ly-

nearing the end

a few seconds went by as they watch-
in astounded wonder

  then the purple disk contracted swiftly
and vanished

  george broke their silence with an ex-
cited cry which came queerly through his
dry throat

  the purple circle that came in front of
the plane looked just like that he cried
we have seen the gale to our world opened
again-i am sure of it-

  theres a bird juanita broke in
see

  she pointed to a little gray sparrow flit-
ting uncertainly from where the purple disk
had vanished it circled aimlessly rose in a
wild bewildered flight became a little
brown speck against the sullen crimson sky
and vanished 

  yes george said slowly the bird
came through it a sparrow from our own
world it blundered through just as the
plane did i wonder- he fell into silent
speculation

  you wonder what george juanita
asked

  i must think dear

  he patted her hand a little hand thin
from starvation red with cuts and scratches
gained in their long struggle through the
desert of wild black rocks

  feeling a faint thrill of pleasure at the
dear she fell silent and sat watching him
with cool gray eyes brightened with a faint
light of hope a long time went by while
the engineer remained silent immersed in
thought the red rain stopped



  we might try it he said suddenly
theres no way of telling whether it will
work the other way we are pretty likely
to kill ourselves in the experiment but
its better to take a pretty big risk than end
our days here eh

  you mean- juanita cried tremulous-
ly you mean-theres a chance to get
back home

  her gray eyes were wide with excitement
and sudden hope

  a chance george said a bare chance
but better than staying here until we die
for want of food and water

  what is it she cried

  we can find one of the green crystals
of course and dump it one one of the red
drops there ought to be another explo-
sion-and another opening of the gate to
our world i dont understand the forma-
tion of the purple disk of course but
something that results from the explosive
union of the red drop and the green crystal
seems to break down the barrier between the
two worlds-some form of radiation per-
haps

  are you willing to try it

  he looked into her cool gray eyes

of course george she smiled at him

a little smile wan and strained it had
meant an effort against the weakness of hun-
ger and the torture of thirst ill do any-
thing you want to try but we must hurry
the red drops you know are going away
thats right george replied in the
hoarse whisper that his voice had become
id forgotten we must try it right away

it must be a rare coincidence for the green
crystals and the red drops to be on the
ground at the same time

  weak and reeling theyrose and tottered i
out from beneath the sheltering black ledge i
searching down the long ravine they camel
upon a few of the scarlet spheroids al-b
ready they were shrunken to the size of afl
mans fist they were evaporating swiftly
little streamers of pinkish vapor were rising
up from them one of them dwindled and
vanished even as they were watching it

  for half an hour they could not find one
of the green crystals

  then juanitas keen eyes discovered onej
through the purple cloud



landing on edge in a narrow crack in the
dull black rock george bent beside the
crack lifted it out a great six-pointed star
of glistening green brilliant and transpar-
ent the feathery structure between the
points delicate and perfectly symmetrical

  it weighed no more than thirty pounds
but the engineer weakened by long hard-
ship reeled beneath the burden of ft

  now to find one of the red drops he
muttered

  they struggled on down the ravine
george staggering beneath the weight of a
blazing thing that might have been cut from
a monster emerald by some gargantuan
jeweler juanita dragging herself along by
his side

  once they came upon one of the scarlet
spheroids but it was no larger than a base-
brill when they first saw it as they stag-
gered up to it it dwindled swiftly seeming
tn hiss like a drop of water on a hot stove
it was gone

  a sound came suddenly from behind them
a hoarse shout insane incoherent

  george turned in alarm he saw a man
running after them a huge man with a
slack bearded face-and red blood on his
hands the man who had reached this
alien world in the plane with them the
man who had fallen like a wolf on the body
f little insignificant cann

an automatic pistol was in his blood-
stained hand

  guess hes finished cann george whis-
pered looking for fresh blood

  oh it will be dreadful if he catches us
juanita whispered lets run

  i dont feel exactly fit for a marathon
george muttered

  but they broke into a stumbling run

  thewild blood-stained figure behind
them shouted gesticulated then they
biard shots bullets whined and screamed
about them crashing on the dull black walla
of the canyon

they ran on-or tried to run it was a
pitiful staggering pace they were almost
weak to move george reeling under
burden of the green crystal was gasp-
for breath iiis tongue swollen and

leathery seemed to fill his mouth choking
him juanita dragged her feeble abused
body along keeping back any word of com-
plaint

  the man running behind them was far
stronger he had had food recently swift-
ly he gained upon them pausing to fire
wildly after them with the pistol whenever
a straight section of the ravine put them in
his sight for a few minutes

  then they came to the end of the canyon

  rugged walls of dead black rock rose be-
fore them sheer impossible to climb they
stopped looked at it george dropped the
green crystal he looked at juanita

  well i guess this means good-by he
managed to articulate in a hoarse grating
whisper hope he makes it merciful any-
how being with you has made it a lot more
pleasant

  he took juanitas hand looked into her
cool gray eyes and tried to grin

  jor the first time in their terrible adven-
ture juanita burst into tears she fell weak-
ly into the engineers arms sobbing uncon-
trollably clinging to him with her thin
bruieed arms

  the huge blood-stained man came into
view again a hundred yards away he
slopped threw up his automatic and began
to shoot bullets rang against the cliff be-
hind them sent splinters of black rock fly-
ing

  then george holding juanitas sob-
shaken body in his arms looked over her
shoulder and saw the thing lying in a little
crevice in the ebon rock almost at their
feet a red spheroid nearly a foot ip
diameter with pale pink vapors hissing up
from about it

  several of the huge strange crimson
drops mut have run together in the crevice
forming a single larger drop which did not
evaporate so rapidly

  buck up the engineer cried pushing
the girl to her feet well try it yet well
beat our friend out of his dinner

  he picked up the huge glistening green
crystal that he had dropped tossed it into
the crevice upon the spheroid of scarlet-
red liquid

  the cosmic gun

by morrison f colladay

hartridge was dead and his body
was not a pleasant thing to look at
i had gone with dr goodrich who is cor-
oners physician to the old-fashioned house
where the dead man lived alone except for
n cook and a gardener who went to their
homes at night

  i had known hartridge fairly well but
not intimately he was a lonely sort of in-
dividual who usually kept to himself he
possessed enough money to live on and he
spent his time in scientific research  judge
from what i have since learned that his
life was embittered by the curious way he
was cheated of fame time after time because
of a few weeks delay in announcing dis
discoveries

  for instance he was working on what are

now known as x-rays when roentgen got
the credit for discovering them he had iso-
lated a radium salt before the curies achiev-
ed fame he had been investigating the my-
sterious highly penetrating short rays that
come from outer space for years before
millikan made his sensational announce-
ment	

  dr goodrich and i were familiar with
hartridges most recent work because he had
become alarmed by something that hap-
pened a few days before his death and came
to us for advice we thought he was suf-
fering from hallucinations due to overwork
and argued him out of his fears

  now he was dead and the condition of
his body indicated that the fears we had
made light of were justified perhaps the


easiest way of explaining our part in the
tragedy will be to give an account of the
inquest

  the authorities were convinced that hart-
ridges death was a natural one however
the dead man had carried a large amount
of accident insurance which would accrue
to the cousins who were his nearest rela-
tives if it could be proved that he died as
the result of violence and not of disease

  it was to lay the ground for a contest in
the courts that dr goodrich and i were
cross-examined by patterson the lawyer for
the heirs an inquest is a more or less
informal proceeding in which the ordinary
rules of evidence are often ignored suf-
ficient latitude was allowed tlie attorney by
the coroner to enable him to put on record
not only the few facts we knew but the
things hartridge had told us what i have
written is from the copious notes i made

during the hearing

 ft ft ft

  patterson was questioning dr goodrich
where were you notified that hartridge
was dead dr goodrich

about nine oclock saturday morning

 what did you then do

 i went to the hartridge house to exam-
 ine the body

 what time did you reach there

 i should say ten oclock

 it took you an hour to drive a couple
 of miles

 no i slopped for my friend warriner
 and took him with me

 was there any reason for taking mr
 warriner

 i thought so he was present a day or
 two before when hartridge told me about
 certain experiences he had had recently
 which made him afraid he was going to
 die

 i presume mr hartridge consulted you
 as a physician

 he did

 isnt it somewhat unusual to have a lay-
 man present at a consultation

 it was informal hartridge knew war-
 riner better than any of his other neighbors
 -the poor fellow apparently had no inti-
 mate friends-and when he became alarmed
 over certain occurrences he told warriner
 about them warriner thought hartridges

wonder stories

statements indicated some sort of mental
trouble and suggested that i be consulted
were you acquainted with mr hart-
ridge

  no i had never seen him before the
morning i was called to warriners house
to the best of my knowledge

  you and mr warriner have known each
other for a long
time

 yes weve been
friends for many
years

 did you examine
mr hartridge

  i did

 what did you
find

  i concluded he was
on the verge of a ser-
ious mental break-
down

  how did you reach
that conclusion

  as a result of my
examination and of the
story he told me in
fact the story had
more to do with my
conclusion than his
physical condition in
a great many obscure
mental illnesses there
are no physical chang-
es discernible until the
disease has reached an
advanced stage

 you found hart-
ridge normal physical-
ly

goodrich hesi-
tated i should
hardly care to go that far he was in a
highly nervous state

 i gather from what you have already
testified that you now think that highly
nervous state was justified

perhaps it was at any rate he was
killed in the way he expected to be killed
now doctor suppose you tell us as
simply as possible exactly what it was mr

 with modern investiga-v
 tions into the shorter
 wave lengths of the electro-
 magnetic spectrum such
 as x-rays radium rays and
 cosmic rays a limitless
 field of conquest is opened
 to man for in these un-
 known ultra-short waves
 there reside not only great
 sources of power and con-
 trollable energy but also
 potentialities for great de-
 struction

    the cosmic rays for ex-
  ample may be among the
  most potent forces that af-
  fect our lives with their
  ability to penetrate sixteen
  feet of lead with their ter-
  rific velocity they may have
  a disintegrating effect on
  animal tissue that may be
  the cause of the death by
  old age of all living things
  on the other hand they
  may be the source of a most
  terrible weapon of warfare
  were they possible of con-
  centration and control mr
  colladay whose stories ring
  so with life and truth gives
  us an exciting possibility
  that may occur with the
  letting loose of tremendous
  cosmic forces	

hartridge was afraid of

  goodrich frowned it is a little diffi-
cult to make the poor fellows fears sound
reasonable he objected

  i dont want you to try to make them
seem reasonable patterson said patiently
just tell us what they were

   think perhaps it will be better to give
 account of that first
interview with him as
i remember it and re-
peat the things he told
me

  was mr warriner
present during that in-
terview

  he was mr hart-
ridge insisted he
should be

  well go ahead
doctor and tell us ex-
actly what happened
in your own words

  i went to warrin-
ers house and found
hartridge there war-
riner had made the ap-
pointment as i said
i had never to the best
of my belief seen
hartridge before
though warriner had
often spoken of him
did you know any-
thing about him or
what he was doing
more or less of
course hartridge was
in a way a rather fam-
ous man among phy-
sicists i had often
wanted to meet him
go on doctor
prompted the lawyer as goodrich paused

  when i reached warriners house i
found a badly frightened man

  you mean hartridge

  yes he was in a highly nervous state
which was intensified as soon as i began
to question him about his fears finally i
administered a sedative and after it had
the cosmic cun



taken effect succeeded in getting a connect-
ed story from him

  yes it was the second time he had
heard it

  go  doctor

  i had perhaps better explain the kind of
scientific work hartridge had devoted his
life to he was an authority on x-rays and
radium in fact he wrote several mono-
graphs which received wide recognition
during recent years he had devoted his time
ti an investigation of what are now known
as millikan rays a few years ago they
were not known by that name-they were
not known at all it was suspected that
there were very short highly penetrating
rays which reached the
earth from outer space
but nothing was known
about them hartridge
found the subject fascin-
ating and spent the last
years of his life investi-
gating them

  this isnt a college
lecture room dr good- 
rich interrupted the cor-
oner suppose you tell
us in plain words what
killed mr hartridge

  goodrich shrugged his
shoulders helplessly as
patlerson jumped to his
feet i think it most im-
portant that dr good-
rich be allowed to testify
in his own way this is no ordinary mur-
der and cant be treated as if it were

  the coroner looked startled are you
seriously suggesting that mr hartridge was
murdered lie asked

  suppose you ask dr goodrich that ques-
tion

  ver well i shall er-ah-dr good-
rich you consider mr hartridges death a
natural one do you not

  i do not

  the coroner stared at him and there was
a stir in the courtroom you mean that
he met with an accident

  i mean theres no question in ray mind
that he was deliberately murdered

  the coroner took off his glasses and nerv-
ously wiped them on his handkerchief
there was a buzz of conversation among
the spectators and the reporters present
pricked up their ears and wrote industrious-
ly meanwhile goodrich sat gazing some-
what belligerently at the coroner

  that gentleman pounded on the bench
with his gavel he fixed his eyes on dr
goodrich you have testified doctor
that you believe mr hartridge was deliber-
ately murdered there must be a murderer
where there is murder dr goodrich have
you any suspicion as lo the guilty person

  i have a very definite suspicion

a surprising story

he coroner looked
surprised have
you communicated this
suspicion to the district
attorney and the police
authorities

i have

then i take it the mat-
ter is under investigation
and there is prospect of
an arrest

i am inclined to an-
swer no to both ques-
tions

that seems hardly
possible doctor

it happens to be true
the district attorney
laughed at me when  told him what had
killed hartridge and who i thought was
responsible for the murder

  indeed the coroner gently tapped the
bench before him with his glasses sup- 
pose doctor leaving the question of mur-
der aside for the moment you tell us ex-
actly what did kill mr hartridge

  before i do that i shall have lo explain
briefly the nature of the millikan rays
please answer my question interrupted
the coroner a little peevishly we havent
time for a scientific lecture though i have
no doubt it would be interesting

goodrich frowned doubtless your scien-
tific knowledge is sufficiently extensive to


wonder stories

comprehend the reply i must make but cer-
tainly the jurors will not

  the coroner sat back wearily in his chair
all right doctor have it your own way
but make your testimony as brief as possi-
ble

  goodrich turned to the jury i was not
casting reflections on your intelligence gen-
tlemen in my remarks to the court there
are only a few thousand persons in all the
world who know anything about the mil-
likan rays hartridge several years ago
investigated these short rays which come
from outer space with enormous penetrat-
ing power he found that there was noth-
ing impervious to them a thin sheet of
lead is a shield against x-rays but the
millikan rays will penetrate from five to
ten feet of that metal

  the coroner looked meaningly at his
watch but the gesture was lost  goodrich
who went on

  i must correct what i said a moment
ago in one particular i said that there
was no substance impervious to the milli-
kan rays i should have said it was sup-
posed that there was not until hartridge
invented his mirror it reflected these rays
and its composition was his secret i have
no idea what it is made of

  thats very interesting doctor said the
coroner but what has it to do with hart-
ridges death

  ill come to that a little later if i may
very well go  with your testimony
if you consider it relevant

  i am calling the machine which hart-
ridge invented lo deflect the millikan ray
a mirror because it is more like a mirror
in its action than anything else you gen-
tlemen of the jury doubtless remember that
when you were boys you used to reflect the
rays of the sun into the eyes of unsuspecting
victims with a piece of looking-glass well
hartridges machine did this for the rays
it did more than ihis however it gath-
ered them together in a focus just as a lens
gathers together the rays of the sun so
that you can kindle a fire with them now
remember that these rays are continually
bombarding every portion of the earth with
tremendous force hartridge had invented

a machine which would gather them to-
gether and direct them at any spot he de-
sired

  the coroner began to look interested
you mean the machine could be used as a
weapon

  it is undoubtedly the most powerful
weapon ever devised with a big enough
machine a city a hundred miles away could
be destroyed in a few minutes

  you mean mr hartridge had a machine
at his house that could do such a thing
the machine hartridge built was an ex-
perimental one to destroy a distant city
it would be necessary to construct a much
larger machine

the coroner looked sceptical  pre-
sume dr goodrich that mr hart-
ridge told you about this machine

  yes

  at the time you were called in to ex-
amine his mental condition

   think  have explained that i found
mr hartridge as sane as you or i besides
i went with him to his laboratory and saw
the machine itself

  oh you saw the machine did you  did
mr warriner see it

  he was with me

  i assume you didnt see it work
yes we saw it work i shall be glad to
describe it in detail if the court desires me
to

  the coroner hesitated a moment then
he said if this machine is of such tremen-
dous value as a weapon perhaps it would
be wiser not to describe it in open court
as you please however no description
of mine would enable anyone to construct a
similar machine all i can do is tell what
it looked like and how it worked

  do you happen to know doctor whether
the government has shown any interest in
this invention

  if you mean our government no two
foreign governments attempted to buy it
from hartridge and i may say i am con-
vinced that the agents of one of them mur-
dered him to keep the machine from fall-
ing into the hands of the other or any
other
the cosmic gun



  you know which two governments tried
jo buy the machine

  i do i think it would be hardly wise
to mention them here if you desire i will
write the names on a slip of paper for your
information

  never mind for the present suppose
you tell us of your visit to hartridges
house

  i examined hartridge in the morning as
i told you that night warriner and i
went to his house

  what was the particular object of your
visit-curiosity

  no i went because hartridge had an
idea that i did not fully believe his very
improbable story i saw he was sensitive
about it and i agreed to go to the house
and see his machine hartridge let us in
himself he had two or three servants but
they did not sleep on the premises he was
aljne except for two big police dogs
two police dogs eh were they pre-
sent when hartridge died

  they were

  doesnt that militate against your mur-
der theory doctor

  i dont think so

  the coroner raised his eyebrows i
should consider a criminal quite reckless
who attacked a man in the presence of even
one police dog

  i neglected to mention that we found the
two dogs dead with their master whal
ever had killed him killed them their
bodies were in the same condition as his

  a rustle passed over the courtroom the
coroners face was grave as he asked the
next question you referred earlier in your
testimony lo the condition of the body of
the dead man but i have no recollection
that you described it in what way did it
differ from any other body

  hartridge had been dead only a few
hours when i was called i found his body
was in an advanced stage of decomposition
it was bloated to twice ils natural size and
almost unrecognizable

  wasnt that very unusual doctor
most unusual you can easily verify
the fact by calling the undertaker as a wit-
ness

the machine in the cellar



 c vou said a moment ago that the two
x dogs were dead and their bodies in
the same condition as mr hartridges

 i did

 where did you find the bodies of the
 dogs

in the room with mr hartridge

 you judge then that the same agency
 killed them all

 theres no question about it

 and what was that

 the machine harlridge had invented for
 concentrating and reflecting the millikan
 rays

 you mean someone turned his own ma-
 chine on hartridge and killed him
 exactly

 i think you said lhat hartridge was
 afraid of being killed in the way he was
 killed

 yes he was it was this fear that
 brought on the nervous attack about which
 he consulted me

 why should he be afraid of a machine
 which he invented and controlled

 the trouble was he had built two ma-
 chines and one had been stolen

 you mean someone else has possession
 of one of them now

 he certainly had the night hartridge
 was killed and there is every reason to be-
 lieve he still has

  i see said the coroner thoughtfully
 it was after this machine was stolen that
 hartridge became alarmed for fear some-
 one would kill him

 events have proved he had good reason
 to be alarmed

 did hartridge have any idea who had
 the machine

 he was quite convinced that it was taken
 by the agent of one of the two governments
 which had unsuccessfully attempted to buy
 it 

 was he suspicious of one rather than the
 other

 yes he was he told me that the man
 he suspected had made veiled threats of
 personal physical harm if he refused to sell
 the new machine together with all the secret


wonder stories

formulae which would make it possible to
construct similar machines

  mr hartridge refused

  he refused widi considerable vigor he
said the only government which would ever
have an opportunity to use the machine was
his own the emissary of the foreign gov-
ernment gave him a week to change his
mind

  you say he threatened mr hartridge
i understand he intimated that if his
government did not possess the secret of the
machines it would certainly see that no
other government did hartridge realized
of course that the obvious way ot silence
him was to kill him

  you were telling us said the coroner
of the visit you and mr warriner paid to
hartridges house

  yes he took us to his laboratory
which was in the cellar it contained a
wilderness of apparatus which i did not un-
derstand-but i have made no effort to keep
up with recent revolutionary developments
in physics however the ray machine was
not in the laboratory after carefully lock-
ing the door he unlocked another leading
to a sub-basement we accompanied him
down a flight of stone stairs and found
ourselves in a large underground room
bare except for an instrument in the cen-
ter which looked like a half dozen search
lights joined together on an upright pedes-
tal

   dont move from this side of the
room  said hartridge this machine is
perhaps the most dangerous thing in the
world today  suppose i looked sceptical
for he continued youll believe it before
you leave here

  you will remember that at that time i
did not know the things i have testified to
today i knew in a general way about the
millikan rays i knew that they would pen-
bombarding every part of the earth all the
etrate ten feet of lead but as they were
time it was hard to think of them as particu-
larly dangerous to human beings  aid
something to that effect

  i cant remember the exact words off
hartridges reply but i can give the sub-
stance of it in the first place a very small

part of the rays that bombard the earth
reach its surface probably ninety-nine
percent of them are absorbed by the atmos
phere if a human being were able to get
above the earths atmosphere he would be
destroyed instantly by these rays as he
would be by an electric current of tremend-
ous voltage

l those that do get to the earth dont
x sem to do us any harm i said
how do you know he asked if it
were possible to protect ourselves from them
perhaps we should never die they cause
disintegration of tissue and that is what
death is

   im not much interested in abstract theo-
ries and i interrupted him impatiently
your machine doesnt do anything i sup-
pose that one can actually see

  he looked at me silently for a moment
that is what ill have to contend with
he said half to himself no one will be-
lieve me without proof he went on to ex-
plain the theory of the machine he show-
ed us the lenses which gathered the rays
into a focus and reflected them in any di-
rection come over here a minute he
said you see that hole in the wall ex-
tending diagonally downward he point-
ed to what looked like a tube about six feet
in diameter extending from the middle of
the rear wall

  keep away from it he exclaimed as
warriner and i peered down into its black-
ness

    what is it  asked

   thats what the machine did ive
kept it directed at that one spot

    where does it go

  he shrugged his shoulders thousand
of miles probably right through th
earth for all i know

  about that time i began to wonder whe-
ther he wasnt really crazy after all he
must have realized what  was thinking
ill show you he said you go over to
the other side of the room again

  he pulled a lever which as far as i
could see shifted what he called the lenses

  im not sure i can describe what oc-
curred if i dont make it clear you can
the cosmic gun



call warriner and let him tell what he
saw

  you both saw the same things didnt
you asked the coroner

  persons never see objective realities
what they see is the reaction of the visual
centers in the brain to nerve impulses from
the retina of the eye

  the coroner sighed suppose we take
that for granted tell us what your reac-
tions were

  as soon as hartridge pulled the lever
the machine was bathed in a violet glow
rather like the light you see in the tubes of
neon advertising signs  was so much in-
terested in this effect that at first i didnt
notice the tunnel through the wall war-
riner called my attention to it it was as
if a cylinder of incandescence itself invis-
ible extended from the machine i felt
as if i were looking down a glowing pul-
sating tunnel of light for hundreds of
miles

   tm afraid to run it anywhere else said
hartridge

  what would it do i asked

   destroy everything in its path as it
has here

   cant you regulate the power  ask-
ed

  he nodded t can diffuse the rays in-
stead of concentrating them

   id like to see the effect of weak rays on
animal tissues i said til be able to tell
better then whether the experience you had
last night was imaginary or not

    think i can manage that hartridge
said t went out with my gun for a couple
of hours this afternoon to steady my nerves
i got a couple of rabbits for tomorrows
dinner well devote one of them to
science

  he shut off the machine and went up-
stairs a few minutes later he came back
with the rabbit he tied a cord to one leg
and fastened the other end to a hook so
the animal hung about the center of the
tunnel opening in the wall first he said
ill deflect the rays in normal strength
against the rabbit simply changing their
direction from vertical to horizontal   
you see nothing happens rabbits bodies

are accustomed to the rays just as ours
are now ill gradually concentrate them

death by degrees

 i nphe body of the rabbit began to glow
jl as if there were a light inside it
first it was reddish and then it became vio-
let

  v turn off the rays i said a few minutes
lcter

  as soon as the machine was stopped i
examined the rabbit when hartridge
hung it up it had been cold from being in
the refrigerator now it was hot as i
looked it began to swell in ten minutes
it was double its original size and there was
every sign of unbelievably rapid decompo-
sition when i touched it it fell to the
floor a half liquid mass of decay

  hartridge was staring white-faced at the
unpleasant mess on the floor he turned
to me you see doctor i wasnt imagining
things he said

  what did he mean by that asked the
coroner

  when hartridge had me examine him
that morning at mr warriners house he
believed that he was already dead

  there was a murmur of astonishment
from the crowd and the coroners jaw drop-
ped believed he was dead he repeal-
ed you mean he was crazy

  i have already testified that hartridge
was perfectly sane however i am not at
all sure he was not to all intents and pur-
poses a dead man when i examined him

  the coroner flushed angrily how can
a man be dead when hes alive its ab-
surd

  perhaps i can make clear what i mean
there are certain slow-acting poisons for
which there is no antidote after a man
has taken one of these poisons he is prac-
tically a dead man though he may be a
week in dying in that sense i believe
hartridge was dead i believe his tissues
had begun to disintegrate under the effcct
of the rays and his body was even then
slowly decomposing that was what hart-
ridge himself thought and the reason he
came to me for an examination


wonder stories

  bui you have testified that he was all
right physically and only the victim of a
nervous attack

  that was what i believed at the time
  how long had this been going on

  it began the night after the ray machine
was stolen that night hartridge first no-
ticed the vibrations when he went down into
the sub-cellar

  how long before his death was this
dr goodrich took a slip of paper from
his wallet ive noted down the chrono-
logy of the case as far as ive been able lo
determine it this is monday hartridge
died some time friday night it was ex-
actly one week previously on friday night
that the ray machine was stolen hartridge
felt the first effect of the vibrations on go-
ing into the laboratory saturday night he
was not certain that he was not imagining
their effect and he thought there was a pos-
sibility that he was on the verge of a ner-
vous breakdown from overwork sunday
and monday night he did not notice diem
tuesday nighl they bored him considerably
the crisis came wednesday night when he
entered the laboratory he had turned to
lock the door as he always did when he
heard the thrumming which he had noticed
both saturday and tuesday nights but im-
mensely louder

  what was this thrumming asked the
coroner you havent mentioned it be-
fore

  hartridge said it was a little like die
wind in telegraph wires and also like the
buzzing of millions of bees he was not
sure whether it actually existed as a sound
or was an effect of the disintegrating action
of the rays on the body

  he didnt see anything

  goodrich shook his head i asked him
about that he said there were no visual
sensations any of the three nights

the coroner turned to the jury dr
goodrich is trying to tell you in his
scientific way that mr hartridge saw noth-
ing

  thank you said goodrich i asked
hartridge to describe his sensations the
first night he said they were nol unpleas-

ant it was a little as if his entire body
were being shaken by an extremely rapid
vibrator he turned to the jury

  you gentlemen have doubtless seen the
machines used in gymnasia and also i be-
lieve in beauty shops well it was the
sort of sensation they give that he first ex-
perienced the second night the vibrations
were so much stronger that they were de-
cidedly painful he said it was as if his
brain and nerves and muscles were being
torn apart however il was not until af-
tei wednesday nights experience the third
that he became convinced that he was either
going crazy or being slowly murdered
what happened wednesday night
asked the coroner as dr goodrich paused
hartridge could only guess

  what do you mean

  he told me said goodrich slowly that
when he turned to lock the door he heard
the thrumming sound but vastly louder than
it had been before he was startled and
tried to reopen the door before he could
escape somediing happened to him he
said it felt as if he had been enveloped in a
force that was tearing him to pieces he
couldnt move and the agony was so great
that he lost consciousness

  at this moment there was a sudden com-
motion in the rear of the courtroorfi peo-
ple got to their feet and at first we could
not see what was going on the coroner
pounded with his gavel until quiet was re-
stored he gazed sternly at two men who
had a third handcuffed between them is
it necessary to make arrests during an in-
quest he demanded

  were arresting this man for murder
said moloney the chief of die detective bur-
eau couldnt take a chance on him get-
tin away

  whats the case

  this hartridge case youre holdin the
inquest on

  the coroner peered over his glasses at
the sullen-faced man between die two detec-
tives indeed you have some evidence
you want lo present

  not yet- were asking you to adjourn
the inquest unul day after tomorrow

  the spectators began to drift reluctandy
the cosmic gun



 from the room moloney came over to
 goodrich and me weve got orders to
 guard the machine in hartridges laboratory
 and raid the house next door where this
 guy benz has been staying

 benz  repeated

 that guy we just arrested

 better not do any fooling with hart-
 ridges machine  advised goodrich

 i want you two to come along with us
 said moloney

 what do you want us for

 to keep us from making any fool mis-
 takes

the power of the ray

 we went first to hartridges bouse
 policemen were keeping curiosity
 seekers moving plain clothes men were
 scattered around watching for suspicious
 characters

 it took you a long time to get started
 remarked goodrich but yon seem to be
 making a thorough job of it

 its not only my men said moloney
 they musta sent every government dick in
 a thousand miles here theyre thicker n
 flies and none of em knowin what to do
 first any moren we do

 what are you doing by the way

 just keepin guard over that machine
 and seem nobody goes in the house or the
 one next door

 you havent got any men down in the
 cellar where the machine is have you
 sure and they got machine guns

 get them out as fast as you can
 cant do that dr goodrich we got
 orders to see that the machine aint touch-
 ed

 how many men are down there
 six

 come on said goodrich he ran tow-
 ard the house and we followed him there
 was a little difficulty getting past ihe
 guards at the door until moloney explained
 who we were

 what about those men down in the sub-
 cellar asked goodrich when did you
 ee them lasl

 they got orders to stay down there till

 theyre relieved replied one of the detec-
 tives

  goodrich stared down the stairs leading
to the laboratory a detective was loung-
ing there in one of hartridges easy chairs
everything all right there murphy
called moloney

  everything quiet here so far chief ex-
cept that hum you hear seems to come
from down where the machine is

  when we listened we could hear a sound
like bees in a clover field goodrich frown-
ed im afraid its too late moloney all
the men down there are probably dead by
this time

  you mean the machine got em
goodrich nodded moloney started down
the stairs but goodrich stopped him
want to die the way hartridge did

  we got to do something for those poor
devils penned in down there aint we
goodrich shook his head theres noth-
ing we can do as long as we hear that hum-
ming except get killed ourselves

  

  we waited for half an hour after the hum-
ming stopped then we started down the
stone stairs leading to the lower chamber
the metal door at the entrance was closed
but not locked when we opened it we
saw six bodies lying on the floor where
they had fallen

  get stretchers ordered goodrich and
take them out as quickly as you can theres
nothing to keep the men who have the mach-
ine from turning it on again and getting
the rest of us

  the bodies were already unrecognizable
and it was difficult to lift them to the
stretchers without their falling apart
rumors that something was wrong had
spread in the neighborhood and a great
crowd was pushing against the ropes the
police had stretched when the first of the
bodies was carried from the house

  after the undertakers wagons had driven
off moloney faced us pale and grim you
know any way of finding the gang that mur-
dered my boys he demanded

  find anything suspicious next door
asked goodrich


wonder stories

  not a thing nobody there either want
  to go over and see for yourself

  i dont believe its worth while
  whats to prevent them guys from turn-
  ing that machine on us now

  nothing if they want to

 we got to find it said moloney
 howre we goin to do it

  if you could make that fellow benz
  talk- suggested goodrich

  think he knows anything

 hes the man who warned hartridge
 what would happen to him if he didnt sell

  -	the machine

  why didnt you say so before roared
  moloney we only pulled him in because
  he was seen coming out of the house next
  door it was a bluff about holding him
  for the murder because we didnt have any-
  thing to hold him on

  i dont believe hell talk said good-
  rich

  six of my men have been killed down
  there

  but he was in jail so he didnt do it
  well make him talk all the same
  wherell you be when i get back

  well hang around here awhile in case
  anything turns up

  i wont be away long said moloney
  you come murphy ill need you

  two hours passed slowly while we wait-
  ed for moloney when he reappeared
  several men in uniform were with him his
  face was grim i phoned the governor
  and hes ordered out the militia

  what good is that going to do asked
  goodrich impatiently

  you dont know what were up against
  theyre going to try to steal the big mach-
  ine tonight

  benz talked did he

  hes a tough guy all right said mol-
  oney half admiringly

  how did you persuade him

  there was something wrong with that
  guys teeth

  what did you do pull them out
  moloney looked at us reproachfully
  nothin crude like that we had the den-
  tist there and everything he ground two

or three of em down with a nice rough 
burr

 helped him to talk did it

sure he wanted to talk when the doc
started on the third tooth

 the newspapers will get after you some
 time moloney goodrich warned him
 you cant get away with that sort of
 stuff

 moloney flushed darkly id of cut that

--- in little pieces if he

hadnt talked six of the boys murdered
today an mebbe more tonight

youre wasting time if you know any-
thing what did he tell you

 i aint wasting time the militia will
 be here in an hour and a gang of laborers
 what are you going to do tear down
 the house

that guy says theres an underground
passage between this house and the one next
door thats how they stole the machine
and thats how theyre goin to try to get
the other one tonight im goin to have
the militia surround the block and then set
the laborers diggin well catch em like
rats in a trap no chance of any of em
gettin away

no what did benz say about the way
hartridge was killed

he said they turned the ray machine
on him the one they stole

 and thats what they did this afternoon
 of course when your six men died now
 youre going to dig them out

 whats the matter with that demanded
 moloney aggressively

suppose they turn the ray machine on
your diggers nothing to stop their do-
ing it is there

 we got to lake a chance said moloney
 stubbornly we cant let em get that big
 machine

 did you find out where the entrance to
 the tunnel is

 under the stairway in the sub-cellar
 benz said think we can rush it

dont be a fool how far would we
get before they had the machine going
the cosmic gun



the great duel

the hartridge house stood back about
twenty-five feet from the street and we
had been talking lo moloney at the front
gate he turned and looked down the
street here come the soldiers now
what we better do with em

  station them around the block just as
you intended and then come back here

  what about the men i got to do the dig-
gm 	

  send them away instruct the soldiers-
to warn everyone out of the houses along
this side of the street tell them to have
everybody out in fifteen minutes

  its pretty late said moloney a lot
of em will be in bed

  get them out goodrich insisted fif-
teen minutes at the outside if they take
time to dress the chances are theyll look
like those six men we carried upstairs this
afternoon

  moloney hurried away the men in uni-
form who had come with him had been
joined by others now moloney held a
hasty consultation with them and then came
back to where we were wailing say
whats the idea anyway he asked
whatre you goin to do doc

  warriner and i are going down to the
sub-cellar where the big ray machine is
and i shall start it going if i can ill try
to regulate it so there wont be any danger
to anyone on the surface but i cant be sure
about it of course ill direct the beam
at the space under the stairs

  moloney stared at him thatll burn
em up

  it certainly will if theyre there

  ill go with you he said

  goodrich shrugged his shoulders all
right if you want to you know they may
get us before we get them

  the detectives and police had been with-
drawn from the house after the tragedy in
the afternoon goodrich switched on the
lights as we entered the hall he wasted
no time in the cellar laboratory but start-
ed down the stone steps leading to the sub-
cellar the door was standing open as it
had been left by the men carrying out the

bodies in the afternoon the electric lights
had not been turned off

  the ray machine stood on its revolving
platform with its projector facing the tun-
nel it had carved out of the earth the
three of us stood on the bottom step gazing
into the low room which might easily be-
come our tomb in the next five minutes

  keep close behind me said goodrich in
a tense whisper dont take any chances
now

  he ran across the cellar to the machine
take hold of the platform he said
weve got to turn it a second later the
machine was pointed toward the stairs

  he leaped on the platform and pulled
two or three levers immediately the mach-
ine was surrounded by a violet glow as the
incandescent column from the projector cut
its way through the stone stairs and the
earth beyond we could see down a long
vista of disintegrating matter but there was
no sign of an underground passage or
chamber

  the large ray machine was noiseless
now as we watched its incandescent column
penetrating into the bowels of the earth we
heard ihe dreaded thrumming sound we
both realized at the same instant what was
happening our machine was not directed
at the right spot the men we were after
had started their machine they knew ex-
actly where we were we probably had
only a few seconds to live

  quick shouted goodrich jumping
from the platform help me turn it again

as the thrumming grew louder we swung
the projector around to the other side
of the stone stairway

  something happened at this instant which
i am unable adequately to describe good-
rich and moloney confess themselves equal-
ly helpless i remember seeing the incan-
descence cut a path for itself as we turned
the platform the effect was a little like
that of directing a blow torch at a snow
bank when it reached the other side of
the stairway the thing happened

goodrichs explanation of it sounds reas-
onable to me we had finally struck the

 had become symbols of rescue


worlds to barter



outside the tall laboratory windows
the sun shone brightly on the gardens
i was that kind of june morning when one
forgets the deficiencies of our civilization
and everything seems for the best in the
best of all possible worlds certainly in
the minds of professor lestrange and my-
self there was no suspicion of any untow-
ard occurrence w e
had already been
working for some
three and a half sev-
erely practical hours

  lestraiige in that
year  was not un-
like the photographs
taken ten years later
which now adorn the
physics textbooks al-
ready at forty his
most striking charac-
teristics were that
broad white forehead
where so many mys-
teries were solved and
those piercing eyes
which saw so much
that was hidden from
ordinary men already
his adaptations and
improvements marked
him for success though
he had made none of
those revolutionary
discoveries individual
enough to be under-
stood and acclaimed
by the public

  the time was yet to
come when the name
of lestrange would be
more familiar than
that of edison had ever

been and when his commanding face would
peer out from a million printed pages

  the critical moments of our present ex-
periment were approaching i was at-
tempting to fight down my rising excite-
ment so that no trembling might show in
my hands lestrange was to all appear-
ances as calm as a frozen sea during his
work he preserved the mien of a poker

   fne of the fascinations
    of the time traveling 
   story lies in the endless
   source of speculation con-
   cerning its manifold possi-
   bilities so many elements
   of time traveling stories
   seem to be contrary to rea-
   son and lead the thinking
   reader into all sort of ab-
   surd situations some of
   these were pictured quite
   vividly in our readers col-
   umn by young mr nichol-
   son last month

    readers may find some
  of these apparent contra-
  dictions in the present
  story even the scientists
  of the nd century found
  themselves unable to follow
  the mysterious program of
  the owners of the silver
  vehicles who wanted to
  transfer a whole race
  through time

     but this story is thrill-
   ing from beginning to end

   it leaves one with a sense
   that there was much that
   our hero could have told
   us if he were able it
   leaves us with a haunting
   sense of mystery of un-
   namable fear and of deso-
   lation

 player not a hurried movement betrayed
 any anxiety as in the silence of the long
 laboratory he tested the last connections and
 inspected the final adjustments

   stand by he ordered at length in an
 unemotional voice

   as i moved aside his hand was on the
                    switch my eyes were fixed upon the in-
                    tricate apparatus be-
                    fore us in a few sec-
                    onds now the throw
                    of a copper bar would
                    prove whether w e
                    faced a marvellous
                    discovery or the sym-
                    bol of wasted months
                    of labor

                      there was a mighty
                    crash behind us

                         that noise so dread-
                       ed in our surround-
                       ings hit m y taut

                       dropped open a t
                       any other time the way
                       blank amazement suc-
                       ceeded intelligent con-
                       centration might have
                       amused me but now
                       i myself was too be-
                       wildered

                    two thirds of the
                  way up the room in
                  the middle of what
                  had been a clear floor
                  space lay a piece of
                  machinery a few
                  feet from it sprawled the figure of a man

   as we stared the man sat up

   he was dressed in a close-fitting black
 suit of a texture and finish resembling
 leather and apparently made in one piece
 his build was tall and strong and his face
 though it bore an expression of confusion
 at the moment showed firmness of char-
 acter	i

  for a few seconds he gazed about won-
deringly then alarm seized him his voice
was urgent as he addressed us

  quick he said some string
quick

  something in his manner caused me to
search my pockets without question

  here i said holding out a length of
packing twine

  he snatched it and turned to the machine
behind him hurriedly he raised the con-
traption from its side to a vertical position
more than anything else it seemed to re-
semble the skeleton framework of a minia-
ture building using instead of steel bright
silvery bars which crisscrossed in all di-
rections enmeshed in
them was a bucket seat
before which were array-
ed two rows of dials

there was no time for a
further examination

  the stranger leaned
over the instrument
board adjusted several
dials tied a loop in the
end of my bit of string
and slipped it over a
small lever he took as
many steps away as the
length of the string per-
mitted and gave a jerky
pull   

here was no mach-
ine before our
startled eyes stood only the stranger the
siring dangling from his hand a sigh of
relief broke from his lips as he turned tow-
ards us

  gentlemen he said i owe you an
apology

  you do sir replied lestrange i
should be pleased to know by what right
you intrude

  i admit i have no right i can plead
only whal they used to call in the old days
sanctuary you are mr lestrange-the in-
ventor of the battery my own name is
lestrange-jon lestrange

  my name is lestrange the professor
admitted but i have invented no battery

  nt yet said the stranger i am ear-
lier than i thought you must excuse me
my dates were never good

  there was puzzlement on lestranges face
as he replied

  i do not understand you no doubt
you will explain later meanwhile am i
to infer from your name that you claim
relationship

  certainly we are related but-er-dis-
tantly

  the matter must be examined i can-
not pretend ever to have heard of you be-
fore let nig present my assistant henry
wright

  the stranger held out his hand

  ive heard of you mr
wright he said with a
smile your rescue of
mr lest range was an act
of real bravery

  it was my turn to be
puzzled in all the six
vears i had known les-
irange he had never been
in more danger than any-
one who crosses a busy
street

  i see i have made an-
other blunder please
forgive me the man
apologized

  a change came over
his expression the smile
of greeting gave way to
a look of anguish his
eyes seemed lo plead as he asked

  tell me have you ever either of you
seen or heard of another machine like he
one i came on

  we shook our heads i could recall no
invention bearing any resemblance to it

  there was really no chance not one in
a hundred million he said slowly i
knew it wasnt possible but i had to ask
his gaze wandered round the room paus-
ing here and there upon apparatus until it
came to rest upon the material of our
thwarted experiment his eyes brightened
and he took a few steps towards it

  lestrange and i were recovering now
from our sense of unreality our eyes met

john b iiarris
worlds to barter



nd we knew that the same thought was in
both our minds all mystery was ripped
from the affair with a jerk-the man was a
py with the minutest care he was examin-
ing the product of our secret months of
labor lestrange pulled a revolver from
a drawer

  put your hands up he snapped the
other obeyed a slight smile on his lips

  ive heard that these were troublous
times he remarked

  come over here lestrange ordered
and tell us just why you are so interested
ir that experiment

  the other who called himself lestrange
opened his eyes wide in evident surprise

  surely he expostulated it is reason-
able to show interest in the discovery which
changed the face of the world besides i
may be mistaken but it seems slightly dif-
ferent from what i remember its a couple
of years since i saw a picture of it but i
have a distinct impression that several of
the connections ran differently  that
terminal on the left should be coupled di-
rect to  

  what on earth are you talking about
roared lestrange you must be mad the
things only been assembled four days

  oh lord said the stranger ive put
my foot in it again ill have to try to ex-
plain it all to you but its a long story
may i have some food first-i havent eaten
for twenty four hours

chapter ii
the man from the future

by the end of the meal the visitors
status had changed he was no longer
an interloper but a guest whom we were
calling at his own request jon somehow
in that desultory form of conversation ap-
propriate to the lunch table we had lost
our suspicions though we were no nearer to
understanding him he was curiously
ignorant at the same time that he was well
informed his broad outlines of current
politics were good but of the details he
seemed to know nothing

  in speaking of well known characters he

appeared to hesitate as though he might
commit himself his knowledge of liter-
ature was excellent though occasionally he
referred to works of which i had never
heard by authors whose fame was world
wide my condensed impression was that
while he appreciated the high lights of most
matters he was sure of himself only in a
few subjects

  youll smoke inquired lestrange as
we retired to his comfortable study
tobacco asked jon

  of course replied the professor with
a touch of surprise what else

  there are many things to smoke where
i come from-one has to be careful

  he settled himself comfortably in a big
chair and lit a cigar

  now he said if you can put up with
a long tale i would like to explain this in-
trusion

  our experiment   i began

  would not be a success in its present
form believe me i can tell you where
there is a miscalculation

  i accepted his statement he seemed to
know something of our work lestrange
too nodded agreement

  jon began

  i think the first thing to be explained
is why i chose to thrust my company upon
you rather than upon any one else per-
haps the first reason is our relationship and
the second that my studies have informed
me that you professor have probably a
more open mind and a greater grasp of pos-
sibilities than any man now living     
this relationship 

  our family has been proud of its direct
descent from you and your wife joy
lestrange and i looked at one another
now there was no doubt that the man was
off the rails somewhere

  but im not married i  

  please let me go my own way it is
a difficult situation but i hope i shall
convince you very few men can have had
the chance of convincing their great-great-
great grandfathers of anything i am now
an anachronism you see i was born in
the year ad -or should it be i shall
be born in -and i am-or will be-


wonder stories

a refugee from the twenty-second century
i assure you that you will be married short-
ly but i cant remember when-i think i
told you i was bad at dales

   it will probably be easier for you if i
tell the story in the past tense certainly
it is a past life for me you saw me burn
my bridges when  tied the string to that
machine

      f the nature of time we of the

       twenty-second century knew little
more than you of the twentieth habit of
thought still caused us still to think of it
in terms of progression along a straight
line though we were aware of course
that this was inaccurate yet for all prac-
tical purposes it served us as well as it
had served the world for thousands of years
before

  because i am here now i know that
time is somehow folded or circular so that
it is all co-existent or non-existent but
of the working principle of that machine
which brought me here i am as ignorant
as you  set the dials pulled the lever-
and there was your laboratory

   i darent keep the thing to examine it
its even betting that the owners had some
way of tracing it and that was not a risk
worth taking

  the world i was living in was not all
you twentieth century men expected it
would have disappointed wells and his fel-
low prophets to have had a true vision of
a d  we were on another swing of
the pendulum

   scientific progress in the sense of phy-
sics chemistry and engineering had slowed
its advance to a minimum while the world
caught up and readjusted by the end of
the twentieth century science was so far ad-
vanced that civilization was becoming ser-
iously lopsided so that nature tended to re-
store the balance even today i expect you
can begin to see how large scale production
has begun to upset politics and social con-
ditions which were designed to cope with a
simpler way of life it is making war no
longer the solution of difficulties it is up-
rooting the old order of things but not re-
organizing

  so you will see that i come from a
world in which mr wells sleeper might
awake but from an age which had spent the
previous century in improving its institu
tions rather than its machines

  since the year  the lestrange bat-
tery of which you heard me speak had
been almost the only driving agent for
machinery in  mr lestrange the
internal combustion engine will have pass-
ed away the whole worlds trains ships
planes radios cranes everything save the
most ponderous machines will be depend-
ing upon your discovery

   it is strange to tell a man of his results
before the experiment has been made nev-
ertheless i assure you that your little stor-
age battery is going to have a greater effect
upon the whole world than any other single
invention in the history of mankind even
the machine which brought me here depend-
ed upon a modified form of your battery to
carry it across half a million years

  but you said-

   oh yes i have taken only a little local
trip on it a mere jaunt of a couple of
centuries

the coining of the menace

t ookng back i can see that the

  -li first sign of the crisis we were to
face occurred about a year ago-to me-in
the summer of  an account was pub-
lished by newspapers and radio of the de-
railing of a train it was still more econ-
omical for heavy imperishable goods to be
carried by rail an investigation of the
accident so far from clearing up the reason
had obscured it

  among the debris was found the crook-
ed frame of what we later learned to call
a time traveller attention was first at-
tracted to the silvery bars by their strength
though the joints of the structure had been
strained by the impact rods a quarter of
an inch thick were found to be supporting
tons of wreckage without a bend this un-
known silvery metal itself set a problem
but a greater puzzle was the body found ly-
ing near the track

   there could be no doubt that the corpse
worlds to barter



was human though to us whose standards
were still those of ancient greece the thing
appeared a travesty

  in height it must have stood about five
feet the head had twice the volume of
ours though the enlargement was mainly
frontal the neck was thickened in order
to support the weight until the shoulders
barely projected puny arms ended in
small hands of which no finger carried a
nail and none was longer than two inches

  each foot was just a pad showing no
articulation of the toes when the dissect-
ors got to work on the body they noticed
many other curious malformations such as
abbreviated intestines atrophied aural sys-
tem and absence of teeth

  speculation ran rife everyone made
the creatures origin a sort of guessing
game it was suggested that the thing was
a natural freak a product of vivisectional
experiment a sensational hoax an attempt
at artificial creation and a dozen other
things all equally wide of the mark

  the only explanation which attempted
to account for the machine was offered by
an ingenious gentleman who claimed that
the body was that of an interplanetary ex-
plorer who had selected a singularly un-
fortunate spot for his landing it was curt-
ly pointed out that a metal framework is
not the best protection against a vacuum
it nevertheless transpired later that the
only thing seriously wrong about this ex-
planation was the inclusion of the word in-
terplanetary

  as the controversy began to cool it sud-
denly received fresh fuel from the finding
of a similar body in a coastal rock-pool
the boy who reported it said that there had
been a shiny machine near but when he
touched a lever it had disappeared again
the crop of surmise sprouted every sug-
gestion which could be made was made
save the right one-that the people of 
had gazed on the bodies of thir own remote
descendants could we have read in the
mystery the warning it carried it would
have been useless to us

  three months ago the curtain rose on
the last act of our drama-only three
months

jon paused and looked at us with bit-
terness in his eyes

  then he said it was a happy world
a civilization progressing serenely as it
thought to its appointed goal now it is
swept away all time and space are
warped distorted and incomprehensible

  it was my happiest night a dream had
started its flow towards reality-now fate
has ordained that the dream remains a
dream somewhere in the intricate tissue
of lime mary may still live but the dream
can never be fulfilled now

  across that evening which surely waa
made for lovers to discuss their future
clashedthe voice of our doom over the
whole broadcast belt in all the world those
unemotional tones were heard

  people of the twenty-second century
the voice began we of the five thousand
and twenty-second century offer peace we
come from a period in the worlds history
which holds no hope for us we have con-
quered lime that we may gain the earth
we offer two kinds of peace one is elim-
ination the other submission to our will

   we are not cruel we do not wish to
kill you our ancestors instead we give
transportation-you will exchange your
world for ours we will carry you across
the gulf of half a million years to a world
in which you a short-lived race will be
well suited as will your sons and your sons
sons for us who count our years by thou-
sands as you count by tens the end is too
near we have broken ihrough time that
wc may continue our work prepare your-
selves and your possessions that you may be
ready for the time and places we shall ap-
point

  neither mary nor i knew what to make
of it-indeed we heard it only subconscious-
ly tomorrow would explain tonight
we had more important matters to discuss

  the next day did not explain it com-
plicated where did the voice originate
how had it compassed all wave lengths
how was it of equal strength at antipodes
why did no picture of the speaker come
through on the television screens it
caused a vague uneasiness though no one
understood nor took much interest in the




wonder stories

message itself the curious form of- trans-
mission was disturbing to a world unused
to new inventions

  the general attitude to science had re-
sulted in the feeling that things were very
well as they stood and that tamperers should
be pul down with a firm hand even the
type who immediately attributes the incom-
prehensible to a form of practical joke felt
that easy solution to be inadequate the
mass of the people wondered unintelligent-
ljr suggesting hazily that something ought
to be done about it governments officially
disregarded it and privately did not know
what to make of it

  a few days later came the second
world wide call mar and i were
sitting at the open window when the voice
made us jump round

    but i shut tlie radio off said mary in
surprise

  i crossed the room and inspected the
switches undoubtedly they were out-
there might be a short somewhere i pull-
ed the leads from ihe speaker and then
stared at the thing in amazement for the
voice still continued

 -seems in view of the fact that no pre-
parations have been made that you have
not understood our intentions

  it was uncanny  picked up the speak-
er and carried it across the room i know
a few tricks to make an unattached speaker
work but none of them was being used here
the voice went on

  -not our wish to hurt anyone but
such as do not accede to our demands must
be eliminated it is suggested that for the
purpose of convincing yourselves that this
is no empty threat a committee shall be ap-
pointed to visit us and report its findings
to the world thus you shall be convinced
that obedience to our will is the only course
not leading to elimination this committee
will gather at die paris air station whence
we will provide a means of travel one week
from loday at exactly this hour

  i looked at mary and she at me there
was trouble in our eyes there was some-
thing behind that unemotional voice which
told us that this affair was far from a prac-

tical joke feeling not reason told us i

 was serious

    i am going on that committee i said
 ar last somehow or other ill join it amj
 find out whats at the bottom of all this
 mary nodded

    good jon thats like you she ap-
proved then a little frown appeared
you dont think its dangerous

    not a bit i assured her thered be
 no point in assembling a committee just to
 kill its members-or eliminate them as
 the voice puts it they might just as well
 start eliminating right away no i think
 whoever they are theyre on the square and
 though the whole show sounds insane theres
 something pretty big behind it

chapter iii	v

a mysterious adventure

a ar below we had seen the coast of
l france slip away from beneath our
queer craft now through the thick glass
windows ihe blue waves of the mediterran-
ean twinkled at us around me as i gazed
down buzzed the tentative suggestion of a
puzzled committee

   such influence as i possessed had been
 exerted with successful results a large
 air liner had carried me rapidly from home
 to drop our gliding tender at le bourget
 the paris airport there i had found a
 group awaiting the craft promised by the
 radio voice it was a cosmopolitan collec-
 tion of americans germans english
 french japanese chinese indian and most
 other nationalities

   not one of them officially represented
his government the rulers assumed an ig-
norance of the ultimatum nevertheless they
had assisted brilliant men to attend the
unknown had managed to infuse into hia
short speeches some quality which attracted
many intellectuals

    had left myself a narrow margin for
 within an hour of my arrival our craft was
 sighted at a great height the watchers
 saw a silver cylinder hurling itself towards
 us at that moment i believe some began
worlds to barter



 to realize the possibility of a menace all
 eyes gazed up

  only random guesses as to its size could
be made at such a distance but as it drew
nearer we judged it to be about equal to one
of our larger airships built of silvery
metal it tapered at each end along the
sides there ran rows of windows nothing
more was to be seen it gave no clue to the
manner of its propulsion

  suddenly from all the loudspeakers both
in the control tower and around the ground
snapped the one word

   landing

  the ground crew used for the lighter-
than-air machines hurriedly assembled and
then found that there was nothing for them
to do down and down the great cylinder
dropped to land as lightly as a leaf

   the committee will come aboard said
the voice we were beginning to know so
well

  simultaneously sections of the hull
opened outwards the hinges at the bottom
 that the doors themselves fottned ramps

  for a moment we looked at one another
in hesitation then we stepped forward as
though by common consent there was no
one to welcome us on board into a great
saloon-seemingly the full length of the
shp-we flocked with a click the doors
closed and we were off to heaven knew
where thousands of feet above the or-
dinary traffic levels we turned and sped to
the south

  after the first surprise of departure had
worn off we found our tongues again it
seemed as though most of us found them at
the same moment

   i do not like this affair not at all no
said a little frenchman whom i recognized
as m duvain of the french air roads

   it is all too mysterious are we chil-
dren that they make to us the effect of the
stage thrill it is a bad begin such non-
sense for the serious investigation no

  damn ridiculous the whole thing re-
plied sir henry deen standing near sil-
ly scare by some jokers in my opinion
however theyre in for it now we  boon
show em whats what

   the frenchman nodded his agreement

   and you msieur he said turning to
me do you not think it is as an insult to
treat a so distinguished party as a flock
of the sheep no reception no speeches

   if it is a practical joke i suggested
you dont want to be made mqre of a fool
do you

   then you too think that it may be a
practical joke asked sir henry

  i informed him that i had come to ob-
serve and to draw conclusions from those
observations i had no intention of mud-
dling myself by prejudice nor of building
theories without foundation not a polite
answer but the pair irritated me

  the desert shouted someone i turned
back to the window and saw that we were
heading over miles of rolling sands towards
the heart of the sahara

itfrrhree quarters of an hour later the
jl familiar voice gave its laconic land-
ing

  below us lay a building it was shorter
than the craft we were in some three hun-
dred feet by one hundred and fifty and ris-
ing about sixty the whole place was en-
tirely constructed of the silvery metal

  the ship settled without a jar the
doors fell open and we walked out to find
ourselves face to face with a seamless shin-
ing wall in which one patch of darkness
framed a waiting figure	-

  exclamations of surprise rose from the
party there can hardly have been one of
us who did not realize in that moment that
we now faced a living replica of those two
bodies which had puzzled the medical
world the same massive neck supported
the same front-heavy head from which two
intelligent eyes examined us for cloth-
ing he wore nothing but a brown shapeless
tunic and a pair of soft boots as we
stared a voice commanded us to follow
but the dwarfs lips showed no movement

  we passed into a large hall lit by some
sourceless diffused radiance in rows of
chairs we seated ourselves as if for a lec-
ture the five-foot figure took a chair in
front of us it was curious that in facing
the man i felt none of the distaste one has
for an abnormality it became forgottten


wonder stories

that by our standards he was stunted mal-
formed hairls toothless and deaf he
was of another race-no more abnormal
than a pigmy or a tibetan he addressed
us but still no movement broke his lips

   people of the twenty-second century
he formally began you are evidently less
advanced than we had anticipated so far
it would appear that you do not accept our
offer of transportation but neither do you
reject it-you completely fail to understand
if you must therefore be treated like chil-
dren to some simple demonstrations of our
power first you shall see the world we
offer

  upon the wall behind him a scene fad-
ed in not like a picture but rather as if
we gazed at a real if fantastic countryside
a level plain stretched away to the distant
mountains in the foreground stood build-
ings a city of gleaming metal each struc-
ture beautiful in line and proportion but
none rising higher than two or three floors

   the town of cyp said the voice it
stands on the bottom of the old mediterran-
ean sea close by mount cyprus you will
notice that it is low built this is neces-
sary as the air at such high altitudes is
rarefied on the atlantic or pacific beds
-here the scene changed-the towns are
loftier since the atmosphere remains dense
at such depths though the oceans have
dried it is no barren world the great
deeps still contain enough water and will
do so for some hundreds of years after
that is gone there are the machines

  a gloomy tooking tarn flashed before
us deep in its darkness was a reflected
glimmer of the red ball of fire above

   the sun is getting old said the voice
slowly he is dying as he must but there is
a long time yet before his end

 a confusion of time

iew began to chase view rapidly
across the screen the voice went
on

   all this is what we offer in exchange
for your world buildings which will still
be standing proudly when the earth has be-
come cosmic rubbish as the moon mach-

ines to make food supplement air create
warmth and produce water all are waiting
for you machines which are proof against
wear proof against breakdown wheels
which will go on turning when the unten-
anted world snuffs out the last smouldering
fragment of her fiery life

   though much of it will defy your
minds you will have all the accumulation
of wisdom and invention that the wit of
man has produced since he began-all save
one thing-the secret of time that is our
safeguard which even we must use with
care lest order become chaos

   still the scenes flashed and faded before
us mighty machines beautiful cities in-
tricate flowers limitless plains vast halls
huge flying cylinders a panorama of a
world shown to us half a million years be-
fore it should exist

  most of us were dazed but we did not
doubt conviction that this was the truth
came not entirely from the voice nor yet
entirely from the pictures but from some
power which seemed to accompany both
in the presence of the dwarf the fantastic
ceased to be fantastic and any thought of
bluff had long been banished the case
was slated with plain force he had made
us feel that the plan was as feasible as for
two nations to change territories-as feas-
ible and as inconceivable

  that our population could if it chose
move half a million years we had no doubt
but that it would not so choose we were
certain if the invaders thought that they
had but to say the word and we would re-
linquish our healthy middle-aged world for
one tottering on the brink of senility they
could not know much of our stubbdrness

  the tall professor toone of harvard
rose from his seat

   on behalf of all of us i should like
o know the reason for this plan he said
you appear to offer us much-what do
you gain that we lose

    you lose came the reply nothing but
familiar surroundings-we offer better
surroundings

   but objected someone what about
our children several generations are safe
worlds to barter



you say but you condemn the rest to ex-
tinction

   some but not all you ensure for the
others an infinite future if you under-
stand such a term-that is the object of
the plan

   but-

   do you not yet realize that we are
your descendants-the descendants of your
children we are the race your stock has
bred and though we have climbed far the
end is too near far us were we to stay in
our age we should die when the earth died
instead we shall take the more youthful
earth for our need is the greater from it
we shall climb to infinity as life climbed
from the sea to the land thus will we
your children approach the closer to our
destiny it was not meant that life should
cease with the earth-evolution was de-
layed do you understand

   hanged if i do murmured the man
next to me whats lie getting at is it
religion

  i did not answer him i was trying to
understand the speech had been far
longer than the repetition i have given you
much of it i still cannot grasp the vista
was too big the muddle of time too in-
volved but i thought i had the main drift
the next speaker almost voiced one of the
questions which troubled me though his
manner was facetious he was an english-
man whose voice sounded tired as he asked

   am i to understand that though we are
at present your ancestors you are shortly
likely to become your own ancestors

    yes said the voice and no

ttr  he englishman looked helpless r
  x round

   i give it up he announced in tones
even more tired than before

  you cannot understand that until you
know the nature of time was the reply
while you continue to imagine lime in
terms of progression you put more stumb-
ling blocks before you than did ever the
flat-earth theorists

  professor toone arose again to put a
question i cannot remember what it was
for at that point the discussion started to

leave me behind voices went on wriggling
into an abstruseness beyond my meutal
grasp it was a kind of knock out contest
-the survival of the mentally fittest when
sir henry deen rose to his feet a long time
later there can only have been two or three
of the company who retained any preten-
sions to following the slender thread of ex-
planation he broke the spell

   can we be shown something of your
works something concrete upon which we
can report so far we have done nothing
which will profit either you or those who
sent us the public we represent will
scarcely be impressed by hearing merely
of a philosophical discussion which most
of us have failed to follow any intima-
tion we could give them of the forms of
armament upon which you rely to carry out
this plan would be vastly more impressive
than an unlimited amount of discussion

   you shall look around our building
though there is little to see in the matter
of armament we must disappoint you i
sir henry grunted

   intending to keep that secret eh
very sensible too from your point of view
but if you could give a demonstration of
your weapons power    

   you mistake us the voice reproved
we cannot show armament because we have
none

   ha then the whole thing is a piece
of humbug-a bluff i had suspected so
from the beginning you think that by
tricks    

   again you do not understand why
should we have any need of those guns and
shells which are after all merely the ex-
tension of the stone-age mans sling and
throwing flint intellect has no use for
such uncertain toys-shells which may kill
one man or one hundred men we wish to
kill no one

  sir henry snorted again to show his con-
tempt for such an attitude or perhaps to
be ou the safe side in fheevent of this prov-
ing itself an extension of the bluff

  there was a pause during which several
more dwarfs entered and approached our
instructor in a manner which revealed them
as inferiors it was explained that we


wonder stories

should be shown round the building in par-
ties

    its a queer thing said my neighbour
as we rose but did you notice that the old
boy never opened his mouth all the while
he talked to us-nor has this one he
nodded towards the back of our guide

    also we know they cant hear yet they
understand everything we say rum  call
it just yu watch this fellow now 

  the dwarf strode straight at the metal
wall and a space appeared before him

    nothing queer about that i said i
know plenty of doors at home which open
when you tread on the mat

    no its not that you watch next time
that bit of wall neither swung back nor slid
-it just disappeared same thing happen-
ed when we first came in

chapter iv
a battle of wills

  i  he uide was frankly contemptuous

  x his was the manner of a major-domo
taking the lap-dog for a walk he threw
out occasional curt references to the objects
we passed these machines were water
producers those food makers one and all
were equally mysterious to most of us wc
trailed blankly along gaping as vacantly as
any savage at his first radio perhaps the
dwarf was justified in his contempt for
these machines unlike the travellers did
not use lestrange batteries and the source
of power was lo us as obscure as the meth-
ods of operation were unintelligible

   at length we reached a large hall which
at first glance seemed to be a jumble of
birdcages

   travelling machines came abruptly
from the guide

  we approached them and he became so
informative over what we guessed to be a
recent invention that contempt was momen-
tarily forgotten one of the two rows of
dials he explained determined the amount
of time to be traveled it contained seven
indicators ranging from an hour to ten thou-
sand years the lower row regulated the
position

  a certain amount of interaction between
the tworows was necessary for one thing
it prevented the machine from maintaining
its position in space without reference to
the motion of the earth within the limits
set by this interaction position could be cal-
culated almost to a foot

  whats that for asked one of the
party reaching towards a lever as he lift-
ed his hand the dwarf saw him and he reeled
back crashing to the floor afterwards
he told us that it had felt like a tremendous
blow between the eyes

   what did i tell you said my neighbour
excitedly force of mind thats what these
people use thats why their hands are ves-
tigial pure will power

  the dwarf seemed to hear him for he
jooked towards us

   i am surprised he sneered that you
even know of such a thing as will power i
judged by your reflexes that you had only
instincts

   you are insulting said a voice behind
me

   there are thirty of you he continued to
sneer let us see if your combined wills
assist you against mine

  we stared around us in amazement the
walls had gone the machines too every-
thing there was nothing to be seen in any
direction save unbroken desert

   playin aladdins lamp tricks growl-
ed my neighbour bending down to grasp
a handful of sand

  the dwarf almost smiled at our confus-
ion

   you know perfectly well where you
are he said but all you can see or feel
is the open desert thats how much all
your wills are worth against mine try
now to see whether you can bring the walls
round you again

  i suspect that it was the mind of that
remarkable man professor toone which
tipped the scales in our favour

  for a moment we felt the heat still
beating up from the sand then the shadowy
outlines of the hall began to reform slow-
ly from mistiness they grew more substan-
tial for a few seconds they began to fade
again then in a flash we were back in-
worlds to barter



doors the dwarf lay on the floor before
ut panting

   lord said someone played out like
hes run ten miles-anyway weve got some
wills between us

 ii  hen i had been home three days
vv i began to understand professor
toones decision that the committee should
meet and discuss in paris before scattering
to report

  he made the suggestion during the flight
back to le bourget the alacrity of accep-
tance was such as to make one suspect that
the delegates were so uncertain of what their
reports should contain that they were eager
for a few pointers toone by common con-
sent opened the proceedings

   gentlemen he began each of us will
be called upon in a few days to give his
comments upon the results of our investiga-
tion

   the questions we shall be asked will
appear ridiculous in the light of our ex-
perience but they will not seem so ridi-
culous to us as will our answers to our gov-
ernments they will say what form of
power supported and propelled the flyer
you traveled in we shall reply that we
have no idea they will be irritated

   they will ask how many of these
dwarfs are there we shall have to reply
that we saw at most about fifty they will
smile this will be followed up with
what kind of armament-we saw none
and have reason to believe that they possess
none how many flyers-we saw only
one what is their silvery metal-we
do not know

   so it will go on until with their amuse-
ment and their contempt we shall be in dan-
ger of becoming a laughing stock if that
is allowed to occur we have no hope of any
warning we may give being regarded as any-
thing but further embroidery to a great
joke

   seldom gentlemen can any committee
of investigation have produced less concrete
results had we found great guns strange
rays new gases they would have listened
to us-instead we have found a menace of

pure force beside which such weapons
would be childish

   we have found this i say but because
we cannot comprehend it we cannot des-
cribe it the grand total of our observa-
tion is one strange ship one equally strange
building a few dwarfs a number of mach-
ines reputed to be time travellers other un-
known machinery and what our critics will
call a cinematograph show-that is all we
saw we cannot tell them what we felt

   this then is the problem confronting
us how can we convey to a skeptical world
the sensation we received of potential force

   the peoples must know of that seeth-
ing mental battery that surging power of
will beside which we are scarcely reason-
ing creatures-they must know and they
must believe the burden of their convic-
tion lies upon us

fruitless efforts

i rphe conference had continued for two
x days two wasted days they seemed
to me speeches drifted more and more
from the main issue and steadily tended to
confine themselves to suggestions for com-
bating the menace again and again pro-
fessor toone dragged the members back
from their talk of tactics by his insistence
that the governments must first be con-
vinced of the need for tactics no solution
could be suggested short of the governments
themselves experiencing our sensations

  back home i was sitting in a palatial
office trying to convince a bored official
who felt that his time was being wasted

  i was growing irritated

   cant you think i demanded in any
terms but guns and gases

   they might have ignition rays he as-
sented

  i groaned

   of course they might have but cant
you see what im getting at they simply
havent been developing along those phy-
sical lines

   they seem to have developed physi-
cally a great deal if your description is ac-
curate

   their present form was probably

 reached lens of thousands of years ago-
 to them that is its their minds which have
 progressed since then-if only you could
 meet them youd begin to feel that terrify-
 ing force man alive it was as much as
 thirty of us most of them brilliant men
 coijd do to overthrow the menial suggestion
 of one of their inferior servants

   the official smiled

    and their flyer do you realize that
 there was no one save the committee on
 board-no pilot no crew the whole
 blasted thing was worked by a telepathic
 control of some kind

    we also have radio control he re-
 minded me gently

   i began to admit to myself what i had
 known from the first-that it was hopeless
 but still i hammered on

    you dont realize what they are work-
 ing for we speculate mildly about ihe fu
 ture of mind-they know its future they
 are out for discamate intelligence they
 know that given time they can achieve it

    nonsense there cant be a mind with-
 out a brain

    why not the brain is only the or-
 gan of the mind a sort of central control
 for the other organs already they can pro-
 ject their minds but they still have to use
 the body for a base for operations

    you seriously expect me to believe
 that

    theres proof of it did you hear the
 voice which issued their ultimatum

     yes

    and it came from the loudspeaker

   yes

    then perhaps it will surprise you to
 know lhal in london they took a record of
 one of the messages when they put it on
 the machine not a sound was to be heard-
 the thing was blank those messages nev-
 er came out of the loudspeaker but the
 dwarfs for some reason of their own made
 you think-made us all think that they did

 t n the evening when i met mary i was
 jl tired and discouraged nothing i had
 been able to say had even dented that wall
 of mechanical materialism my most tren-
 chant arguments had either bounced off or

missed fire the final blow had been when
in the middle of my efforts to convey my
impressions of mental strength he had asked
with ihe air of one who draws the conver-
sation back to realities whether i thought
that they might have tanks hidden in the
neighbourhood

    it isnt i said lo mary for or against
acceptance of the dwarfs terms-as for
that i only know that i personally am
going to no dying world-my job was to
try to make the fools realize that they really
were terms for two and a half hours i
tried to tell that smug know-all that an
over-whelming danger threatens him the na-
tion and ihe whole world-i made just as
much impression as i would throwing snow-
balls at a pyramid

  mary gazed at me intently

   its very difficult to grasp she said
even yet i dont really understand what
this great danger is if they havent got any
weapons

   thats the devil of it they may even
have some weapons in the way you mean-
though i dont think so-but that is nothing
to do with their strength oh if i could
only convey that sensation which scared us
all something might be possible but im
utterly incompetent if you asked a horse
to explain the activities of men hed be no
more at sea than i am over this business

   but dear if there are so few of them
why should they want the whole world
surely they could make a sort of colony
somewhere

   i dont know but i think this is a sort
of advance guard-supervisors of emigra-
tion and immigration we dont even know
how many of them there are probably the
world couldnt support both populations at
once so that the only way is a complete
change over half the worry aboul this
affair is that we know nothing of the details
-were just expected to do as were told
mary bent towards me and tried to
smooth out the furrows of anxiety

   darling she said firmly you must
slop worrying about it put it all away
for the present

  she took my arm and we strolled out
to the terrace a soft breeze pressed the
worlds to barter



trees so that they swayed gently slips of
torn cloud were gliding across the moon
far far away we could see the misty out-
line of the hills

   its all so beautiful she whispered her
eyes on the dim distance i think it makes
me afraid

  my arm went round her

   our lovely world said my voice

   but how long ours asked my mind

chapter v
a world at bay

  a month later hell was loose our
j civilization was broken up the
herd instinct which built it had given way
all the climbing from individuals to groups
from groups to clans from clans to nations
meant nothing to men who roamed the dead
cities as their ancestors had prowled the jun-
gles the veneer was off all our vaunted
progress had taken us no higher than the
first rung of the ladder that rung broke and
we were back where we started

  the dwarfs had stolen our power they
bad hit us literally where we lived all
the lestrange batteries went dead and with
them our world stopped save in the great
lide-stations which still made power for the
useless batteries not a wheel could turn
it was chaos

  planes fluttered from the skies ships
wallowed in the seas airships floated away
on the winds factories were silent eleva-
tors dropped trains were checked ovens
cooled radios died cars were pulled up and
every light failed

  it was nine oclock at night when the
great stoppage came and it was the darkness
which caused the panic across the world
in the sunlight they cannot have had that
catastrophic madness in which crowds rush-
ed milled and swirled without reason with-
out object

  how it was done nobody knew per-
haps it was a ray against which they shield-
ed their travellers perhaps-but what is
the use of speculating on the possibilities
of such minds

  i was in the city the roar of the citys

life rose through my open windows one
moment busy hubbub and bright lights
the next silence and darkness i stumbled
across the room and looked out into a pitchy
gulf which might have led to the bowels of
the earth so quiet-a quiet which seemed
to wait-a quiet during which men died
during which cages dropped down mines
divers got no more air loads fell from
cranes acrobats missed trapezes surgeons
cut too deep

  from below there came a scream and as
if at that signal a murmur rose the voice
of the crowd growing louder and louder
wilder and wilder my eyes could see
nothing but my mind saw devilish things
happening in that street bodies crushing
at tlie walls ribs cracking under pressure
eyes bursting from their sockets lungs lab-
 ing for air corpses trampled under foot
and corpses unable to fall while above it all
rose now the senseless roar of that wild
beast the mob destroying itself

  i moved back and sought the telephone
only to find it as dead as the lights it
was not until then that the full meaning of
the crisis came to me it had seemed an
unusual failure of current only now i real-
ized in a flash what it meant and knew it
for the dwarfs masterstroke

  they had been roused from their patience
at last of the several messages sent out
on their world-wide system since our use-
less investigation i had heard only one
it was almost pleading in tone

   our destinies roust be worked out
nothing shall stop that we wish you no
harm-we are not butchers-but you are
leaving us no alternative

  the voice went on to appoint stations
for transportation in the northern plains
of italy north and south france near
johannesburg south africa salisbury
plain in england in florida california
and illinois for the united states and so
on to the number of sixty or more

   i wonder said one of my companions
why they always make these announcements
in english

  another listener a blond young man
looked us

  you will excuse he said but i haf


wonder stories

chust heard them perfect german use nod
english

  i attempted to explain that the messages
were conveyed directly to their minds with-
out the use of sound that they merely
thought they heard after this each ob-
viously considered me more of a fool than
he thought the other

	 n the set days crowds flocked to the
v starting places except for a few
cranks such as daily expect the end of the
world nobody save the cameramen went
from any motive than ide curiosity a
holiday spirit was abroad there was the
prospect of a free show of some sort and
the likelihood of a good laugh at the dwarfs
expense the cameramen were the only
survivors

  all the world saw the films of what oc-
curred it was announced that the cinema-
tographers had been allowed to return in
order that we might see the simplicity with
which transportation was effected and there-
by lose any nervousness restraining us the
particular version i witnessed was taken at
one of the american stations and was i was
told typical of all

  around a structure resembling an enor-
mously enlarged time traveller stood a cor-
don of police and guards the space en-
closed was about two hundred yards square
reliable witnesses stated that a couple of
hours earlier there had been no sign of the
glittering framework with the result that
among the majority-still incredulous of
the idea of time traveling-there was a ten-
dency to regard it as a magical piece of
construction work rather than accept the fact
that it had just made the journey across
five hundred thousand years

  beyond the cordon the sightseers parked
their cars and got out to examine the mach-
ine with awe whatever they had expected
in their inmost minds it was not this huge
silver cage they were impressed in spite of
themselves

  the murmur of the crowd as we heard
it through the speakers seemed to betray a
nervous tension but curiosity backed by a
sensation of safety in their numbers kept
them waiting for the show to begin

  without warning parts of the enclosure
on all four sides fell apart making en-
trances

  a gasp of surprise went up from the
house as we saw that the guards whose duty
it was to keep the public clear had stood
aside from the gaps some of them even
motioned the crowd forward

  not a sound now came from the speak-
ers as though in a dream the sighteers
trailed slowly into the enclosure sugges-
tion hypnotism heaven knows but in
they flocked solemn faced vacant-eyed old
men young men women and girls alike
even the dogs joined the procession it
was as though some pied piper led the way
then when the last had entered the police
and die guards followed

  in the darkness of the theatre mary
gripped my arm

  now i begin to understand what you
mean by their power she whispered

  as the last guard entered the entrances
snapped sbul simultaneously a few yards
from the great transporter a dwarf ap-
peared on a one man traveller

  mary grew tense and another gasp rustled
through the audience-it was the first time
any of them had looked upon one of those
men of the far future he jumped from
his machine and ran towards the enclosed
crowd whose apathetic eyes appeared not
to notice him

  in a corner of the transporter we saw
for the first lime that a small cabin was
divided off from the main bulk we saw
him enter it we saw him turn the dials
we- saw his hand upon the lever and-noth-
ing nothing before us but the empty plain
and a little one man traveller

  the picture continued there was more
to come for five minutes the audience
sat in silence or whispered speculation
then as suddenly as it had gone the mach-
ine was back again but save for the dwarf
in his cabin it was empty   

a world aroused

 he world was roused at iasi no
j- type was heavy enough for the news-
papers no terms weighty enough for the
worlds to barter



radio announcers the casualties as they
were determined to call them at the sixty
odd stations came well on towards the -

	mark the old cry went up-some-
thing ought to be done the prestige of
governments was at stake the vermin
must be wiped out

  the members of the investigation com-
mittee were hastily summoned and this time
received a better though no more profitable
hearing a stern-faced official faced me
across a broad desk his manner suspect-
ed me of complicity his method savoured
of third degree

   what we want to know first is wheres
this base of theirs

   ive told you as near as i can all i
know is that we seemed to go south-south-
east from the algerian coast as far as i
could tell by the sun we went that way
for about three hours so if you know the
speed of the ship it ought to give you a
rough idea of the district

   you mustve seen some landmarks at
the height you were

   precious lot of landmarks in that des-
ert-and as we didnt know beforehand
where we were likely to be going nobody
happened to have a pocket map of the sah-
ara on him

   no need to get fresh weve got to get
a line on this business somehow and itll
be better for you if you help us all you
know how

   well  said ill tell you this if you
ever find that base youll have to thank luck
-not cross-questioning

   whatre you gettin at

  just this not one of us has any idea
where this place is or what makes it dif-
ferent from any otherplace that has a lot
of sand but even if you get there its pretty
good odds against you seeing the building
do you seriously think that a gang who
hypnotize a crowd of three or four thousand
men and women into an overgrown bird-
cage cant stop a few pilots from seeing
them

  the man snorted

   when one of our pilots knows where
they are-he began

   -then therell be one less pilot in the
force i finished for him

  of course they got none of the informa-
tion they wanted from us-we hadnt it
even then i had begun to realize that if we
knew a whole lot wed still be as helpless
as sheep against men

kt talian french english and german

   scoured the desert failed to find a
trace and brought home their bombs a
report of the position of the base reached
tripoli through hurry the italian offi-
cers in charge omitted to verify the infor-
mation their rocket shells destroyed a
french desert fort feeling already ran
high against france who was thought in
some circles to be in league with the dwarfs
undoubtedly they were on french territory
a french pilot made matters no better by
announcing his destruction of the dwarfs
cylindrical flyer at approximately the same
moment that the germans reported that one
of their airships had been bombed by a
french plane notes began to pass be-
tween countries and the threat of wrar added
fuel to the excitement

  it was then that someone at the suez
english base made an inventory with the
startling result that five days of profitless
searching showed twelve english airships
and nearly a hundred planes unaccounted
for

  the french german italian and egypt-
ian authorities investigated and revealed a
similar state of affairs in their own air
forces the fate of all those craft remained
a mystery solo searching over the desert
became less popular with the result that
instead of single machines disappearing
whole flights vanished together

  it fell to an italian pilot to do the world
the worst possible service with the best pos-
sible intentions

  he had become separated from his unit
and was heading for home in accordance
with the regulations that single planes must
not be risked when he saw almost below
him the shining building for which all the
world was searching whether his mind
was not susceptible to their control as was
found to be the case with a few or whether


wonder stories

they were off their guard never was known
and did not really matter what did matter
was that his five great bombs flashed down
together

  it must have been a rude shock to that
pilot when during his congratulations and
celebrations the voice spoke again

   people of the twenty-second century
it began with usual formality we appealed
to you first as reasoning creatures you
failed to reason you even failed to under-
stand that if we are not successful man will
count for nothing-he will have lived in
vain then we treated you as children who
must be led-you spoke of it as a tragedy
you described as casualties men and wo-
men who are now living in the future not
one cells life the worse for the journey

   now you have taught us to know you
for savages your ridiculous bombs did
no harm to our building but you killed
thirty of our men who were outside those
thirty were worth a thousand of you and
you killed them by an action no more rea-
soned than that of a frightened brute we
shall not kill you in revenge-the art of
living is not killing but we warn you that
those who remain here three weeks from
now will start to kill one another for the
rest the transporters will be at their stations
make good use of them

  hundreds of thousands laughed

   weve killed some of em-well beat
the lot was their attitude

  but other thousands heeded the warning
surging in crowds to the machines

  mary and i were of neither party i
suppose it was sentiment which held us
the road to safety was plain for the dwarfs
never lied yet the call of familiar things
was too strong we were standing by the
world we loved till the last going down
with our civilization

chapter vi
nearing the end

 t a ll governments published futile
edicts forbidding approach to the
transporters planes were headed off
trains stopped roads blocked but still the
crowds swept forward on foot infantry

and tanks sent to turn the stream joined
it the authorities reached their wits end

  the english sent rocket shells against
the salisbury plain station hundreds of
their own people died the transporter
was scarcely scratched

  in california two men finding them-
selves immune from the dwarfs influence
attempted to steal a small time traveller-
they were never seen again thereafter the
dwarfs arrived in pairs one to work the
transporter while the other guarded their
travellers

  for the full three weeks the huge mach-
ines made their two or three journeys a day
but the hundreds of thousands they carried
were like a few spoonfuls from a full buck-
et

  and now standing in my dark room i
knew that the end had come men and wo-
men had started to fight insanely in frenzy
of fear soon they would become hungry
they would prowl like famished beasts
ready to eat even each other the dwarfs
had thrust our ultimatum upon us it
would not be long now before the multi-
tudes were besieging the only means of es-
cape from a maddened world-the trans-
porters

  in my mind a plan was growing a
slender chance first i must get out of
this crazy city and find mary

  

hi i together we lay in a clump of low
-l bushes not far from our hiding
place a line of haggard men and women
was struggling towards a transporter

   the evacuation of a world i heard
mary murmur

  some dragged barrows of possessions
some could barely drag themselves there
was no need now for suggestion to impel the
crowds they were striving their utmost
towards those feared or despised machines
which had become glittering symbols of
rescue many staggered from fatigue to
fall in their tracks

   if the dwarfs use suggestion to help
on the fallen ones-count i said they
wont need much power and if you keep
your mind full it cant touch you fill it
up with figures multiply and multiply so
worlds to barter



that theres room for nothing else its our
odly safeguard

  luckily there was no test of our concen-
tration friends pulled the stragglers up
and urged them along the last lap of the
journey at last the transporter was filled
the entrances clicked together those who
were shut out retired to throw themselves
on the ground they would have to wait
for the next load

   get ready i whispered to mary as i
drew a rocket pistol from my pocket

  the two small time travellers appeared
one dwarf ran to the transporter the other
sat on guard in his saddle  reckoned that
the big machine would be away in about
twenty minutes since it would take that long
for the weary crowd to file out as the first
dwarf vanished with the transporter i drew
my aim on the second

  it is a horrible thing to kill a man
who is off his guard but it was necessary
merely wounded  might bring his friends
about us in a few seconds

   now i cried together we sprang
for the travellers as the dead dwarf rolled
from his seat

   get on i ordered setting the dials
i put marys hand on the lever

   pull i said but instead she leaned
out and pressed her lips to mine

   i love you she said she said it as
though she knew the end had come then
her hand flew back to the lever i shouted
to stop her but it was too late-ste had
gone

  jon paused in his tale we did not in-
terrupt the grief in his face held us silent

  where is she now  wonder he said
slowly

  when she drew back her hands it brushed
one ef the dials i had been so careful-
worked out the position f each to a hair
so that there might be no delay in our com-
ing here so that we might travel together
far away from our world of chaos far away
too from the threat of a dying world one

hasty move she made which may have car-
ried her further than the earths death or
beyond its birth she is a castaway some-
where in the jumble of time and space
but you asked lestrange how-
oh i jumped on the other machine
the crowd had seen us a hundred or more
of them were pelting across the field it
was as though i had the one lifebelt on a
sinking ship they jumped at me the
traveller rocked as they hit it it was fall-
ing as  pulled the lever-it fell in your
laboratory

  but whats the good of it all im
alone better to have gone on to the end
with the people of my time xwhy did i
come here when i knew she couldnt be
here if id kept the machine i might
have searched-id have searched all time
to find her

  a bell on the wall shrilled suddenly
quick wright said lestrange jump-
ing from his chair the laboratory alarm
somebodys spying-take this

  he handed me a pistol and held one him-
self silently we raced to the laboratory
wing and flung back the door

  a familiar silver framework glittered at
us beside it stood a figure clad like our
visitor

  mary by heaven said jons voice be-
hind us

  jon jon the figure cried and ran
towards us

  a few moments later jon lestrange
walked over to the traveller and examined
its controls curiously he looked up with a
smile

  obviously mary he said some pat-
ron saint guides your hand you might
have altered the setting by six hundred
years or six thousand but you did only al-
ter it by six hours

  he turned towards professor lestrange
if you please great-great-great-grand-
father he said i should like another piece
of string

utell all right said the brown-
vt faced general rolling up a map
its dangerous of course but as napoleon
said you cant make an omelet without
breaking eggs

   to be sure to be sure said the fussy
little man in a uniform covered with gold
braid and strips of ribbon who had just ad-
vanced the plan we must expect losses
we must expect quite severe losses in fact
it would not surprise me if the first division
of battleship tanks were wiped out but
we will certainly succeed in eliminating the
robot guns on the reverse slope of the
heights and perhaps some of the railroad

artillery also i think it is worth it rightly
worth it if we succeed any number of
plans will suggest themselves and with our
present superiority in battleships we can
well afford the loss

lets see that includes vengeance glory

smoke dirt flame-the sound of a million anvils as the fleets swept
about each other in a great circle

the other rang a bell

	 

it isnt the heat that gets you or the
noise said the man with the scarred chin
licking the end of a cigarette reflectively
before applying it to his lips its the
rctten smell petrol hot oil and sweat-
yes and leather    and that isnt all

you have to keep your mask on when they
start and those new makes smell like rubber

 and medicine

 he lit the cigarette and blew a snort of
 smoke through his nostrils last time i
 was that sick when  got out i couldnt
 even take a nip of whiskey

 mmmm murmured the short man with
 the bald forehead and i get seasick
 every time i go rowing on the lake

 the man with the scarred chin looked at
 him sharply you better not be seasick

the old mans nuts on you late draft men
that lay down what were you in before

  aviation i was on motor repair i
got a wife and three kids so they gave me
selected duty im a motor man

  well im married too  the man
with the scarred chin thought for a mo-
ment you must be on the right forward
motor last man on that job was killed
quick as a wink shell from one of those
robot guns came through the casemate and
burst right under the
motor drove one of
those levers  clean
through him theres
the place

  he half-turned and
waved in the general
direction of the tank
that stood like some
questing monster in
metal snout lifted to
sniff the air a few
yards away half
way down the hundred-
foot flank of the beast
workmen were busy
painting a new and
shining steel plate that
had been  welded in
just below a project-
ing broadside gun

  above their heads
two more guns pro-
jected from shielded
casemates while high-
er still a big gun in a
turret atop threw a
long shadow across
their work but if the
man with the scarred chin expected his com-
panion to exhibit any sigh of nervousness at
the remarks of his predecessors passing he
was disappointed the small man merely
gazed with a languid lack of curiosity

  you selected duty men said the man
with the scarred chin in a tone of contempt
why that dont mean a thing any more
with all the women whats your woman
in

artillery replied the short man at
least she was the last i heard they dont

pass artillery letters till theyre three months
old gives away positions two of the
kids are in the factories-ones thirteen and
the other fifteen the other one thats mv
little girl shes in the national schools
they put her there when my wife was draft-
ed

  mines an officer said the other with
a touch of pride captain dont know
where she is though last i heard she was
in charge of a company in one of those
black battalions in tire
south i should wor-
ry i got a girl in the
repair here and im
going to apply for a
divorce and marry
her

  the short man grunt
ed after a moment
he spoke again me

i	dont want no div-
orce the old lady
and me we get along

i	had a nice home
though lucky w e
were all away with the
wifes folks when the
war came that air-
plane gas attack killed
everyone in our section
and when we got back
to the house every-
thing was corroded to
pieces by that damn
gas curtains fe
apart when-

they were inter-
rupted by the
ringing of a bell like that of a glorified
alarm clok from a structure that might have
been a pigpen in bad repair the man with
the scarred chin tossed away the end of his
cigarette

  come on he said thats for dinner

  within the disreputable building a flight
of stone steps led down to an astonishing
concrete-lined catacomb dimly lit and
showing long irregular marks of damp like
the outlines of old maps along the wall a
hundred or more men were in the main

  txt have been hearing
  w great deal lately
  about the terrors of the
  next war all kinds of
  rays the use of terrible
  gases of electric currents
  are all on the way we
  learn to make extermina-
  tion of armies certain

     if the exposition of these
  things by military men
  have any purpose they
  should serve to frighten
  nations away from war-
  fare such a purpose is
  doubtless contained in this
  present story

    mr pratt is a keen stud-
  ent of military affairs
  he does not leave reason
  behind and jump into fan-
  tasy but looking calmly at
  present trends in warfare
  he gives us this realistic
  story of a future war the
  scene might be laid in any
  country and the antagon-
  ists might be of any nation
  or race

room talking in a repressed manner and
clattering tin plates as they filed past a
wicket where an orderly was distributing
portions of stew bread and coffee once
served they filed to tables made of boards
placed across trestles and ate silently and
with speed

  a whistle interrupted them before the meal
was finished striking the sound of dishes
to a momentary silence an under-officer
stood at the head of the room with a list of
names from whioh he read the short man
heard his called

  youre the new motor man from the
aviation the officer inquired when he had
joined the group that gathered outside 
have your papers why
werent you in the com-
bat sections before de-
fective eyesight-   

oh children they all
say that ever rim a tank

         o w

engine t

  no sir admitted the
short man

  well here ill show
you he led the way to
the metal monster un-
locked a door at the stern
and pointed the small
man down a narrow
machine-lined passage

mind your head

  heres your post he
added a moment later
pointing to a steel chair
slightly above and behind a big motor from
which a wilderness of levers projected
throttle here brake here signals on
this board red is full speed and black is
reverse the names are on them but they
use flashes when anything goes wrong this
lever is to throw your engines in for the
ammunition hoist of the turret this type
of tank has the eight-inch gun in the turret
on top instead of in the center below the
ammunition hoist is electric but its apt to
go out if we get hard hit then they have
to use a mechanical hoist connected with
your engine watch your signal for that
and never mind what the boys in the case-
mates are doing or the man at the other en-

gine thats all look it over duty in
fifteen minutes were joining up with the
main fleet then

  the small man bent to examine the motor
fingering its parts with practised hands and
occasionally wagging one of the levers in a
speculative manner to test its action then
looked about him his motor lay in a kind
of narrow shell well cut off on the right by
a steel wall at the left was the cat-walk
down which he had come leading forward
to another steel wall with a door in it-the
control station of the lank astride the cat-
walk and between him and the control sta-
tion the supports of the big turret came
down like the stout metallic legs of a titan-
ic spider across the cat-
walk to the left was an-
other motor its seat un-
occupied 

  a prolonged series of
hoots announced that the
rest of the crew were be-
ing called to their quar-
ters and a moment later
the surface of the catwalk
rang with the impact of
feel a door beyond his
seat was opened and four
men crawled through it
one after another
through the orifice he
caught a glimpse of the
gray mounting and par-
alleled recoil mechanism
of a gun with a row of
shells in racks around the casemate behind
it the last of the four gunners turned to
face him as he passed through the hole and
he saw it was the man with the scarred chin

  here we go he called in encourage-
ment this old tank shes a lucky ship
i been in her ever since the general used to
command here the casemate door bang-
ed an officer came down the catwalk
dived into the control station and emerged
with an armful of packages which he dealt
out to the crew the little man unfolded his
to discover a complicated vestment-helmet
gas-mask and bullet-proof shirt all in one
made of cross-braced strip steel each bore
the red hand shaking a thunderbolt that was

tlie emblem of the ship

  he struggled into the thing as a small bell
rang sharply in his ear and the indicator
before him jerked to slow he threw in
the throttle cocked his head to catch the
sound of the motor and felt the big landship
bump across the uneven ground as they
gathered way feet tramped on a floor
above his head

into battle

the whole structure shifted and heaved
with a motion not unlike that of a ship
in a steady swell he felt a curious qualm
wonder if im going to be seasick he ask-
ed himself and banished the idea as the bell
rang again and the indicator turned red be-
fore him   

  they halted in what when they got out
of the tank proved to be a high narrow
valley shut in by open pine forest there
was a cloistered air about the place that
made the ribbon of camouflage above them
seem grossly inappropriate the little man
pulled off his metal shirt and observing
that the others had merely snapped open
the face part that held the gas mask put it
on again in confusion

  all around them were gathered the un-
gainly rhomboids of more tanks three other
battleships each with its heavy turret gun
atop and its row of three to five broadside
guns a few whippets scurried about like
insects and up ahead where the valley split
in two to round a projecting shoulder of
mountain some cruiser tanks could be seen
-long and narrow with two or three guns
apiece

  the man with the scarred chin gave a
glance around and a low whistle must
be going to be a battle he said well
im glad were in a lucky ship

  his companion looked around wheres
the infantry he asked innocently

  infantry ha ha they havent had
infantry for the last two years you wait
youll see why too much gas and things
look

  he pointed up the valley where three
more tanks of battleship size were coming
to join the group one of them looked not

unlike a metal porcupine with spikes of
wire jutting in every direction the others
unarmed save for a couple of machine guns
had conical openings that seemed to run far
back into their interiors

  what are they asked the little man
the fuzzy one is a radio machine sends
sound waves to jam up the enemys robot
guns and radio waves lo jam their torpe-
does the others are gas-shoot big gas
rockets corrosive mostly to kill off artil-
lery and tanks

  hey jake called a gunner from one
of the whippets with a blue hammer on his
armor been up to the city

  naw no leave no more the citys
all done for anyhow they keep throwing
gas in

  but i get letters from my girl in the
national schools objected the little man

  all right all right said the other
rut do you know where the national
schools are now theyre out in the coun-
try along with everything else you aint
seen any newspapers but army newspapers
lately have you because there aint any
the conversation was interrupted by an-
other series of hoots and the irregular ed
dies of men in the valley separated into or-
derly streams which delivered themselves
into the tanks again an officer came down
the catwalk of the thunderbolt distributing
the composition gloves which were the pro-
tection against eorrosive gases likely to seep
even into the air-tight interior of the tank
a fan somewhere began a screeching buzz-
the air purifier that insured a gas-free sup-
ply of air for the motors of the tank a
moment or two more and the indicators
moved to slow again

  it was dark when they halted under the
shadows of another forest the gauges
showed no gas in the atmosphere the crews
stretched themselves luxuriously with open
masks drifting off to sleep without a word
and being awakened an hour or two later
when a convoy of provision machines
brought them fresh rations instead of the
pocket tabloid food they had expected to
use the smail man ate his with heavy-
lidded eyes went to sleep immediately and
did not wake again until he felt himself
the war of the giants



shaken and woke to see a non-commissioned
officer pointing him toward the tank

  it was in the false dawn lights and lum-
inous panels in the machine showed most
o the crew busy about some small concern
resolutely occupying themselves to relieve
the tension of the moment before a battle
the wood was filled with subdued whisper-
ings and rocked gently to the sound of dis-
tant oft-reeated thunder-far-away artil-
lery the small man guessed though he had
not heard it before

  there was a momentary pause the bell
rang and the signal moved going into ac-
tion he thought and breathed a silent pray-
er that this tank was indeed the lucky
ship his acquaintance had proclaimed it

far above them out of sight in the pur-
ple-black of the dawn sky an airplane
circled and its radio sprang into lively
clicking as the row of dots emerged froqi
the wood and started like slugs across the
low slope that led down to a river   

  the tanks were lumbering in orderly
ranks across the rolling slope that had once
been a grain field of some kind for a few
ears of feral corn could be seen among the
weeds that encumbered the irregular edges
of old shell pits

  the day grew paler the river swung sil-
very across the landscape there was not a
gun not a man not a trench in sight-only
the iron monsters moving slowly along with
the whippets nosing here and there among
them and the cruisers along the flanks
within his ship the small man could hear
nothing but the smooth sound of his motor

  suddenly there was a startling high
sciearn followed by a quick virile crash
and a fountain of earth and vegetation rose
smokily into the air two hundred yards be-
hind the tanks at the edge of the wood they
were leaving as if released by that sig-
nal clouds of intense black smoke poured
from them and from the whippets settling
along the ground in tattered ribbons in the
still air there was another crash of sound
and a tree tottered majestically downward
at the edge of the wood the smoke cloud
hid everything but the whippets at its edges
the thunderbolt rocked with sound as the

turret gun on her roof went off suddenly
aimed at a target eight miles away

  a cloud of airplanes soared like winter-
ing geese across the sky and from away be-
yond the river another cloud rose to meet
them the smoke surrounding the tanks
was shot with vivid flame as a shell burst
right among themthe fragments of its cas-
ing ringing against their walls then more
and more shells many of them adding a
curious white smoke to mingle with the
black effluvium of the land-ships

  the whippets clustered and then spread
at the edge of the water waiting for the
larger ships to force a passage shells were
falling more thickly now occasionally hit-
ting the small man felt a great heave as
his ship passed over the remains of a whip-
pet blown to disordered fragments by a di-
rect hit and still there was no sign of an
enemy save where the airplanes were locked
in their battle far above

  there was a sudden grinding crash in one
of the casemates of the thunderbolt behind
where the small man sat above his motor
he jerked his head round to see the door
bulged sharply inward with wisps of smoke
eddying through the cracks when he look-
ed again there was a red stain on the steel
he felt sick an officer came down the
catwalk clinging to projections as the craft
rolled looking like a deep-sea diver in his
helmet he did not even glance at the
bulged-out door and its bloody stain a
curious pale mist-the noxious mist of ming-
led poisonous gases filled the interior of the
ship

  the water churned to foam as the battle-
ship and cruiser tanks began to cross the
river wallowing clumsily and attended by
whippets that dashed through the shallows
like terriers behind the crest of hills that
lay two miles back from the opposite bank
the robot batteries of the enemy were work-
ing feverishly served from underground by
sweating gunners men and women who
piled shells on the elevators which carried
them to the guns from them mechanical
arms reached out to stuff the ammunition
into their maws the breech blocks snapped
shut animated by a spirit of their own
and the big guns making automatic correc-


wonder stories

hons for range and deflection by means of
disc-shaped mechanical ears concealed in
rubbish heaps under trees everywhere-
some of them even in ihe very ground the
tanks were crossing-fired themselves at the
moment when the range was correct
further back heavier guns on railroad
trucks had begun to fire slowly under air-
plane observation

   nor did all the shells fall among the
tanks for the porcupine-like machine the
small man had seen the night before had
improved the dark hours by digging itself
well underground and now from a dozen or
more sources was releasing waves of sound
that brought a good half of the shells from
the robot batteries crashing uselessly down
in the woods

   but now a new element entered the battle
as some few airplanes broke free from the
combat above the clouds and swooped like
swallows on the mass of black smoke that
hid the attacking tanks down after them
swung pursuit planes up from the round
rose slender interweaving bands of smoke
as the anti-aircraft guns of the whippets
went into a frenzy of action against them
here and there one burst into flame or fell
with the peculiar dizzy motion of a machine
out of control but the rest held on releasing
their missiles at the bottom of the long para-
bola then swung up and away

the war of the giants

as they made the turn their missiles
sought the tanks through the murk-
fish-shaped torpedoes with long wings at
their heads carrying sound devices like those
controlling the robot guns and trailing be-
hind them the pennons of smoke that indi-
cated rocket propulsion nearly all fell
fallow blowing great pits in the ground
their sound control failing in the multiple
uproar of the battle but one struck a
whippet and disorganized it into tattered
ribbons of metal and another its mechani-
cal ears caught by the sound of a badly
working motor on a cruiser tank struck the
landship squarely at the base of the turret
in a burst of intense flatne the moving fort
of steel folded together as though it had

been cardboard the turret pitching in on the
ruins of the rest when the fleet had pass-
ed only the forefront of the tank remained
leaning at an odd angle above the shattered
remains from which bright flames still burn-
ed

  right on the heels of the aerial attack
a pillar of smoke between two hills an-
nounced the approach of an enemy tank
fleet rushing up to support the now close-
pressed robot guns and at almost the same
time a titanic discordant buzzing beat down
all the other sounds of battle another or
perhaps two more of the queer porcupine-
tariks had followed the attackers in the rear
and were adding their sound camouflage to
the din the robot guns swung to and fro
helpless in this torrent of sound till the
operators were fain to come out of their
pits cut loose the automatic controls and
fire them by the old hand method

  of all this the small man above his motor
knew nothing locked in his gas helmet
he heard only the irregular shock of burst-
ing missiles around the tank saw only the
jerking indicator before him as more or less
speed was demanded to the gunner with
the scarred chin the battle was hardly more
intelligible the only thing his eyes could
catch through the malleable glass that form-
ed his window was the billowy smoke shot
with color here and there as a shell explod-
ed the odor of the helmet was fetid the
strain of merely waiting intense again and
again the turret gun above went off firing
at its far-away targets but there came no
call for the broadside artillery

  then without warning the smoke thinned
and altogether ceased he perceived they
were just mounting a ridge two or three
whippets dashed past for  the head of the
line and he noted that one of them had her
wide torpedo-port open and that an aerial
torpedo was pointing outward ready for re-
lease the bell for loading rang sharply
the thunderbolt pivoted round like a ballet
dancer and through his peep-hole the gun-
ner caught a glimpse of dim figures emerg-
ing from a low-hung cloud of smoke that
moved toward them down a gentle slope a
mile and a half away

   the turret gun fired again with a violence
the war of the giants



audible even in i hat torrent of sound and
the gunner just caught a glimpse of the
trail of smoke that marked the passage of
an aerial torpedo bound toward the enemy
fleet the thunderbolt changed direction
again a shell pitched a column of dirt
across his vision and a small voice cried-
fire at will concentrate on third tank
and to his astonishment he was looking
down the sights at a line of enemy cruisers
he went into a fury of action

  smoke dirt flame-the sound of a mil-
lion anvils as the fleets firing together
swept round each other in a great circle
perhaps five minutes that were an eternity
then from the opposing fleet billowed clouds
of smoke as too late they made the fatal
discovery that they were opposing a battle-
ship attack with mere cruisers too late-
a mushroom growth of smoke and flame
marked where one had been blown up an-
other was stopped where her fleet left her
with flames of a peculiar orange hue pour-
ing out of her turret a third staggered
out of line like an injured animal and
moved oddly across the space between the
two fleets still firing steadily but losing
motion and life as it became the target of
the concentrated fires

  but at that moment there came a huge
uprush of dirt right ahead- of the thunder-
bolt hammers pounded on her carapace
she lurched violently through a snowstorm
of dirt and rocks across the crater the shell
had made the gunner caught a glimpse of
whippets emitting smoke again of the ene-
my fleet which should have been retreating
closing in instead the robot guns-hand-
trained now were in action again and at
point-blank range

nothing visible but smoke a loud-
speaker voice began suddenly to call
off range and deflections and the gunner
with the scarred chin worked like a fiend
perspiring violently inside his coat of mail
setting his sights on the indicator that ran
round the gun mouth according to the data
shouted through the loud-speaker a thin-
ner streak of smoke through it a cruiser
visible canted over on her side and burn-
ing vigorously  deflection fifteen

right-ire they bumped violently over
something whether tree house ruins of a
tank or merely a lump in the ground the
gunner could not tell then a stunning ex-
plosion which drowned the insistent voice
for a moment the thunderbolt changed di-
rection with such speed as to almost throw
him from his seat and through his window
he saw the torn remains of a big tank her
forepart shot with flames one of her side
guns drooping like a melted candle while
two or three of her crew ran a step or two
from the wreck and fell writhing to the
ground on a still-intact stern-plate a
painted halo still showed

  my god thought the gunner the
glorys gone what did it mean de-
feat and he wondered would it would be
like to be a prisoner carried off to work
on the farms for the enemy or to dig in
their mines not so very different from-

  the smoke rolled clear again and he
looked out on a different section of land-
scape right against them stood the slope
of a hill out of the tail of his eye he could
see the wreckage of a big robot gun and as
the tank swung along caught sight of an-
other pointed right at them but riven by a
direct hit in the fraction of a second before
it could fire the enemys fleet must be
done for they were cleaning out the guns

  a jet of steam ran round the inside of the
casemate clearing the gas all over not
quite for the frightful uprpar without did
not seem to have decreased in the least
though there appeared to be no shells fall-
ing near the thunderbolt the gunner
swung his window in its pivots noted that
the thunderbolt was leading the line of
tanks along the reverse slope of a hill with
the turret gun firing occasionally as the
observers reported some new gun position
visible the battle was over for him how-
ever the turret gun would take care of
the rest of that robot artillery before his
gun ever got within range

  see there was one now tipped over on its
side the delicate mechanism smashed by a
direct hit the corpses of two or three gun-
ners lying about he could have laughed-
and then out of the shadow of the ruined

steaming jungles of venus his green

were staring wide his long reptilian tail
curling rigidly over his broad man-like
shoulders every nerve in his scaled up-
right body taut to the scent of a strange
smell despite the thick brittle vegetation
that almost hid him

he slid like the pro-

the air like an earthly

tail glide from his

 whose long hungry jaws snapped occasion-

 quent flashes of jagged lightning split i lie

 no heed to it

   the humans watched him in fascination
                    the creature stood upright like a man on
                    two scaled muscular legs ending in broad
                    two-toed feet scaled as he wa he looked

                    dragging but his arms
                    were well formed and

page recorded ihe beasts thick nose and
savage cruel lips and finally paused at the
tip of the undulating tail he regarded the
drawing for a moment and then returned
the pad to his pocket as the beast suddenly
concentrated his attention on their place of
concealment

   the anthropologists blood ran cold and
his hands trembled with uncertainty -the
man-beast of venus sniffed the air as though
trying to locate the strange mystifying
smell that dilated his nostrils he cocked
his head sideways and looked squarely at
the wall of tangled growths behind which
crouched the fascinated humans then ad-
vanced toward it slowly menacingly

  professor tyber
nudged bingham the
geologists high-powered
rifle slid into line with
the approaching menace

it made a scraping sound
as it was glided along a
brittle sun-hardened
growth the man-beast
had heard binghams
finger curled around the
trigger but he held his
fire hoping that the ap-
proaching man of venus
would change his course

  suddenly t h e weird
thing halted looked
around him calmly and
deliberately then rent the
still soggy air with a
shrill prolonged cry the humans crouch-
ed  aghast high-powered pistols were
diawn by tense bloodless hands tyber
picked up his motion picture camera and
held it to his eye for focussing

the scientists had not a doubt but that
they had been discovered by the fearless
man-beast and tyber was sure that the cry
had been a signal to others he knew that
it was hardly likely for their presence to be
unknown on this young world though the
electronic flyer had plunged down through
the clouds silently under the attraction of
gravity it must have been seen by countless
venusian eyes by tyber had a great de-

sire now to be within the protection of its
steel armor-plated hull he had a deep-
rooted premonition that a tragedy was im-
minent

   despite his great fear for the safety of
 his party he held his ground the camera
 began to click the man of venus stood as
 still as a stone idol only the lip of his mus-
 cular tail in motion regarded the jungle
 surrounding ihe invaders through unblink-
 ing eyes his head swung to the right so
 that his right eye covered the spot from
 which camethe strange clicking his nos-
 trils twitched and he sniffed again the
 camera clicked on in tybers shaking hands
 perspiration cxcited by fear and uncer-
 tainly mounted on his
 palms making the cam-
 era slippery watson
 eyed him excitedly

  hadnt we better re-
treat tyber he whis-
pered softly in a quiver-
ing voice

  not yet hissed ty-
ber between his tightly-
closed teeth if we move
the devilll charge us
well have lo kill him and
i dont want to do that-
yet

  bingham glanced along
ihe sights of his rifle he
had drawn a fine bead on
ihe center of the venus-
ians broad forehead
how close the creature was to doom he
cculd not know but a single twitch of the
geologists tense trigger finger would send
him into eternity but bingham was no
fool to pull that trigger would undoubt-
edly cause the creatures nearby companions
t swoop down upon them the savage cry
had been a call for help and he knew it

   better to kill him now than be killed
 watsons voice trembled almost under his
 breath

  and stir up a hornets nest watson
mumbled tyber this brute has friends
right handy

   watson was becoming too nervous for his
 own good his pistol was in line with tiiq

 beast who still stood in the clearing in an
 attitude of indecision watson seemed
 ready to fly to pieces at any moment ty-
 ber sensed it and he warned him to put
 away his gun watson did so reluctantly
 mumbling dire things to himself

  they were startled suddenly by the sound
of padding feet in the jungle off to the left
tyber watched the man-beast the crea-
ture cocked his head in the direction of the
sounds and his eyes flashed then out of
the dim aisles of towering ferns and vegeta-
tion filed a score more of these grotesque
venusians quickly they approached the
lone creature in the clearing they halted
there in a knot and the scientists heard some
sort of a strange discussion in deep-throated
gutturals

  tybers camera continued to drone
there came from it suddenly the slap of
loose film and he knew that the cartridge
had run out silently he slung the auto-
matic machine over his shoulder by a leath-
er strap and picked up his rifle his mind
worked rapidly in spite of his uncontrolled
excitement he nudged bingham again

  theyre getting ready to rush us bing
he whispered softly ive got a notion to
let em know that we mean no harm to
them

  bingham glanced up into the others
sweating face

  how he answered

  by going out there peacefully said ty-
ber quickly

  dont be a fool tyber the geologist
grumbled were not in africa among
people of our own race

  they havent weapons tyber argued
and you could drop them before they
harmed me

  dont do it insisted bingham its
foolish

  maybe so mumbled the anthropologist
but it might save us all from an attack
and probably death

  he shot a glance at the man-beasts they
were spreading out now in preparation to
rush the spot his blood ran cold and icy
beads dripped off his brow without hesi-
tation he stood erect rifle held menacingly
and stepped over the matted growths the

venusians halted abruptly in their tracks
and stared at him in astonishment

  tyber snapped bingham heatedly
come back

  but tyber ignored him and kept on tow-
ard the astounded beasts they seemed too
surprised to make a move and stood rooted
to the soggy ground binghams hands
shook he withdrew his finger from the
trigger for fear of pulling it accidently
without turning his head he hissed to the
others

  cover the idiot men he growled
shoot the first beast that threatens to
harm him

  they nodded grimly the jungle brist-
led with high-powered weapons flashing
eyes glanced along dancing sights a score
of venusian lives hung in the balance

chapter ii
hostilities

professor tyber boldly but cau-
tiously stalked toward the creatures
he held his rifle now in the crook of his
left arm his right elevated high above his
head in a gesture of friendship in africa
that gesture had gone to display his friend-
liness more than once but tyber might have
over-estimated the intelligence of those
whom he sought to convince on venus
they were indeed hostile their fire-fleck-
ed eyes appraised him in an unfriendly man-
ner their thin lips curled in a beastly snarl

  he sensed suddenly a growing hostility
among them and halted behind him he
heard a buzz of excited voices he knew
that he was amply covered by the guns of
his party but what if they were insufficient
to stop a headlong rush of the venusians

  tybers boldness was turning to regret
now quickly he glanced back in the di-
rection from whence he had come he saw
nothing but tangled masses of shrubbery
a guttural voice drew his attention back to
the creatures they were edging toward
him slowly their arms outstretched tails
undulating like the tail of a stalking lion
he backed away instinctively his rifle now
in readiness still he did not shoot
wonder stories

  we are friends and mean no harm to
you men of venus he blurted excitedly
they continued to advance their faces blank
of anything but what seemed to be a lust
to kill he knew they had not understood
he had merely spoken to relieve his instinct
for flight

  come on back tyber he suddenly
heard binghams voice call from the under-
brush watch that big fellow on the left

  tyber was watching him intently one
huge man-beast perhaps a head taller than
the others was advancing more swiftly now
the sound of binghams voice did not halt
him his clawed fingers writhed in a
frenzy and his reptilian tail curled and un-
curled like the spring of a watch

   tybers nerve was beginning to fail him
now he backed away steadily keeping his
eyes centered mostly on the big fellow who
seemed to be the leader of the pack then
suddenly something happened that brought
a scream to his throat

   the big fellow suddenly lashed out with
his tail it curled around tybers throat
like a bull whip his rifle flew from his
grip and he was jerked roughly to the damp
ground there was an explosion from the
brush he looked up expecting to see his
captor drop with a death rattle in his throat
but no such thing happened the beasts
were rushing past him toward the hidden
party only the big fellow remained be-
hind and closed in on him like a flash

   helpless and terror-stricken tyber looked
up at him there was a blue hole in the
center of his forehead from which oozed a
purplish liquid by all the laws of hu-
manity the fellow should have been dead
yet the slug seemed not to have affected
him in the least tyber lashed out savagely
t kick at his captor his booted feet col-
lided with scale and bone the venusians
lips parted in a strange smile and tyber re-
ceived a blow on the side of his head that
reeled his senses vaguely he felt himself
being picked up something cruel scratch-
ed him painfully across the back he
knew indistinctly what it was the man-
beasts claws had raked him mercilessly
then he became aware that he was being
borne away as he sank into a faint he

heard the crash of dry brush and the cracl
of a rifle he imagined he heard men
screaming fearfully but was not certain

there was something pitiful in the ap-
pearance of tybers men as they were
borne off through the stifling jwngles of
venus tyber had revived after a shorf
time and was straddling the bull-like neck
of the beast that bore him away his fre-
quent glances at the other informed him
that some were either dead or injured
binghams head hung grotesquely to one
side and his face was bloodless others sat
upon their captors shoulders in utter resig-
nation

  where were they being taken tyber
found himself asking that question silently
was there a village of some sort nearby
where they were to be sacrificed to some
weird god of venus or were they to fur-
nish the bill of fare for some savage ban-
quet try as he might the anthropologist
could arrive at no conclusion and he began
speculating on the strange connection of
the creatures with the homo sapiens

  he wondered if men had looked like them
in the dim days following the advent of the
devonian period at which time he knew
humanity on earth began to evolve from the
fish and reptile surely no skeletal re-
mains of such a creature had ever been
recovered from the earth he concluded
after a time that life on venus had arisen
in the same manner as life on earth but
pursued a different course man had gone
off to live in trees the superior venusians
had taken another path of evolution devel-
oping from the family of reptiles

  presently tyber became aware that his
chest was paining he knew what was
causing it the beasts gnarled overhang-
ing head armor was rubbing him with every
stiff step the creature made he noticed
for the first time that the venusians head
was bent far to the front to permit him to
carry his burden on his shoulders then
tyber had a peculiar idea a thought
raced through his head and he glanced at
the creatures neck

  so thats why the beasts didnt drop
he told himself silently their vulnerable
the beast of ban-du-lu



spot is protected behind their natural ar-
mor thats strange bullets dont hurt
them much from the front but ill wager a
slug in the back of the neck would drop
em

  he glanced at watson who was riding
the creature beside him the astronomers
gun was in his holster tyber instinctively
felt for his own pistol he found it nestling
in the holster at his belt his hopes soared

  grab your gun watson he yelled sud-
denly every man who can shoot aim
your guns at the back of their necks and
fixe when i do

  there were grunts of amazement from the
alert members of the party tyber stealth-
ily drew his pistol slipped the safety catch
and prepared to fire into the brute that held
him before he could pull the trigger
something whined past his face and curled
around his throat a bony tail held him
tightly he was yanked savagely from his
perch his gun exploded as he fell but
the bullet went into the air the weapon
was snatched from his grasp quickly by an
enraged venusian and he was cuffed sound-
ly for his daring act

  the others watching closely held their
fire fearing to meet with a similar treat-
ment fearful lest the beasts take their
guns they replaced them in their holsters
or hid them resignedly under sweaty soggy
shirts they saw tyber picked up bleeding
and subdued the procession continued
without further interruption

  they beheld as the procession went on
strange grotesque beasts slinking off in the
jungles monstrous reptiles of the saurian
species looked up from their feeding and
then ambled away as though afraid of the
upright creatures who bore fear-filled hu-
man burdens

  for hours the parade continued at a set
pace bingham had long since regained con-
sciousness he suffered a deep gash across
his scalp where the tip of a savage tail had
collided with it he had lost much blood
and his face was white and drawn but he
seemed very much alive to the situation
often he glanced at tybers blood-smeared
face- tyber heard him groan and looked
back at him

  hurt bad bingham he asked

  the geologist shook his head

mighty weak and have a splitting head-
ache he returned dejectedly and you
feel like fve gone through a mill said
tyber grimacing they beat hell out of
me when i tried to shoot at them

  i must have been out then bingham
growled i wonder where were headed
for and whats going to happen to us
dont know said tyber curtly glanc-
ing at the others and counting them men-
tally what became of the other four
men

  four men missing bingham began
counting he was silent for a moment and
then grunted gloomily  guess youre
right tyber four men are gone

  they beat it into the brush interjected
one of the flyers crew theyre as good
as done for they could never find their
way back to the flyer

  hard luck tyber shrugged we an-
ticipated such things as this how many
men dead

  five the mechanic stated flatly and
every man more or less scratched up from
those devilish claws

  youre the leader of this expedition
tyber another man suddenly snapped
its up to you to get us out of this mess

through the jungle

tyber glanced at the man coldly and
glowered

  i tried it didnt i he growled you
saw them throttle me for it

  mighty weak-kneed attempt the arro-
gant fellow snarled you had no business
going into the clearing when bingham warn-
ed you to stay back with us we might
have gotten away   

  every man of you was paid well for his
services tyber hissed authoritatively
when you signed on this trip you were told
plainly that grave dangers and possibly
death would be encountered you came of
your own volition ill do all i can to re-
turn you safely to earth thats all any
man can do

  hes right said the mechanic we


wonder stories

volunteered to come on this trip so lets
make the best of a bad thing and take it like
men not like a pack of snarling rats

 tyber eyed the man warmly and nodded

   thanks biggers he said evenly dont
 worry

   the other man scowled but remained si-
lent the man-beasts were likewise quiet
not a sound escaped their throats all dur-
ing the unpleasant discourse but their pace
was slackening now presently they halted
and placed their burdens on the ground in
a small clearing a sparkling pool shim-
mered in the center from which arose wisps
of steam the men looked at it and groaned
in chorus to cold invigorating drink here
and their throats were parched and dry

   tyber and his battle-scarred men stood
on the soft marshy ground and stretched
their legs the venusians now circling
them watched curiously the scientists in
turn appraised their captors with an air of
distrust then the big man-beast approach-
ed tyber and pointed to the ground ty-
bers eyes followed the gesture for the
first time he saw that the jungle floor was
laterally alive with spiral-shelled mollusks
and wabbling red-striped beetles he re-
turned his gaze to the fellow quizzically
i the big venusian switched his mighty tail
along the marsh and brought it up in a half-
circle in front of him the movement swept
up a mass of struggling mollusks and beet-
les he calmly bent over and selected some
of the larger creatures and cracked them
open with his powerful taloned fingers as
a man would crack an almond shell ty-
ber was appalled to see the beast remove
writhing creatures from the shells and gob-
ble them with relish the venusians point-
ed again to the ground and then to his
loathesomc mouth

   the man-beast was gesturing for him to
eat but tyber certainly had no appetite for
such a fare nor did the others they
watched in silence while their captors gorged
on the natural supply of viands furnished
by the torrid climate of venus after a
time tyber drew his pipe and proceeded
to smoke it the man-beasts looked up
from their feeding in amazement

   they did not appear over-hostile now

 instead they seemed bent on protecting their
 captives until their arrival at some chosen
 location perhaps a venusian village but
 how far they were from the flyer tyber
 did not know and he felt that the machine
 had gone out of their lives forever surely
 they could never retrace the venusians
 steps through the trackless nightmare of
 jungle whatever thoughts he might have
 had of escaping were gone now

  the big venusian moved suddenly toward
tyber and removed the pipe from his mouth
tyber scowled at him belligerently every
muscle taut it might be said here than
the scientist was indeed a young man being
scarcely more than thirty with the blood
of a long line of scientific explorers cours-
ing through his veins he was not a man
to be trifled with lightly though he re-
strained an urge to bash his heavy fist into
the savage face before him the cold
deadly look in his eyes would have warned
a human instantly but the venusian paid
no heed to it he turned the pipe over in
his claws and then stuck it suddenly into
his mouth

  the man-beast sucked on the stem
coughed violently and made a wry face
he opened his mouth and emitted a stream
of green saliva and tyber saw for the first
time that he was toothless he laughed at
the fellows discomfiture as the smoke from
the strong pipe choked him the pipe was
dropped to the ground quickly tyber pick-
ed it up

  serves you right he snapped coldly
men and belongings of men dont go with
beasts like you venusian

  biggers the mechanic who had been
watching closely chuckled

  you tell em tyber he grunted
theyre a bunch of hogs

  the venusian seemed on the verge of
striking the scientist but for some reason
refrained tyber sensed that the beast
blamed him for the nausea that came to him
from the well-caked pipe the monster
grunted the others cocked their eyes at
him the halt came to an end and once
again the humans were picked up to be borne
deeper into the jungle and farther from the
safety of the electronic flyer

        chapter iii

            bartered

 night fell suddenly on the strange pro-
 cession as it moved toward some mys-
 terious objective the skies became shot
 with incessant flashes of lightning the
 atmosphere was saturated with a vibrant
 electricity that made every object stand out
 in violet relief terrifying crashes of
 thunder pounded down upon the ultra-trop-
 ical world the sky was a display of fire
 and flame

  the venusians seemed tireless the
 went on at a rapid steady pace the hu-
 mans were close to exhaustion from the
 thickness of the stagnant air and they were
 thirsty and hungry tyber was dozing in
 a pleasant stupor when a solid sheet of rain
 fell from the heavens the water was al-
 most hot great drops splattered against
 his cheeks from an angle and he cupped his
 hands enough to wet his leathery feverish
 tongue the man-beasts plodded on stead-
 ily paying no attention to anything but the
 trail in front of them

  tybers blood ran cold suddenly when
 he beheld a gargantuan monstrosity loom-
 ing up ahead of his carrier who lead the
 parade of peril it was a gigantic diplo-
 docus more than a hundred feet long from
 the tip of its swage fang-studded jaws to
 the end of its long reptilian tail the beast
 was outlined with a purple glow caused bv
 the incessant electrical displays above it
 surveyed the procession through glittering
 eyes for a moment and then lumbered away
 tyber watched it wondering why the savage
 brute had not attacked from what science
 had determined from skeletons of such beasts
 found on earth they were indeed merciless
 fighters but why did they hold the man-
 reptiles of venus in such high regard was
 there some strange power of the reptiles
 that created the respect of the monsters

    a terrifying scream sounded somewhere
  in the jungle tyber and his men shudder-
  ed and tensed fearfully at the ungodly
  sound then another high-pitched shriek
  came from the same direction the man-

beast under tyber shrugged his powerful
shoulders and grunted

bal-un-deva-jas dev-ut-al he grunt-
ed in two weird syllables addressing the
others immediately they began to discuss
some event in their venusian language that
sounded to tyber like the senseless grunt-
ing of a hog but he was pleased to learn
that they had some means of vocal com-
munication he was eager suddenly to
learn it as he had learned many languages
on earth it seemed preposterous to him
however that such brutes could speak he

listened intently

j as-ut-deva-tol  grunted the beast be-
hind the big creature

they chorused a series of grunts that  y-
ber accepted as a sort of agreement he
was somewhat of a linguist but certainly no
language like that existed on the face of his
earth though it might have been a universal
tongue in the dawn of earthly humanity
he began speaking in various dialects to the
beast under him but the latters silence was
evidence enough that he failed to under-
stand any of them after a time he dozed
again his chin on his chest his body sway-
ing loosely with every step of the venusian
lulled by the hiss of the rain the crash of
the thunder and the hideous screams that
echoed through the jungles

  when tyber awakened the ram had
ceased and the skies were less forbidding
though lightning still flashed intermittent-
ly to set the dawn ablaze with its violet
luminosity it was a red dawn aglow with
the rare colors of the spectrum the sun
had not yet risen but its rays was not
needed to heat the jungle it sweltered and
steamed the air was soupy aud thick mak-
ing the men struggle at times for breath

   finally the procession forged through a
strip of denser jungle vegetation and
emerged into an almost bare area of con-
siderable size for a moment the man-
beasts halted to stare at the scene ahead
and then continued onward tyber was
amazed at what he beheld and bingham
behind him groaned inwardly

   this is where we meet our finish ty-
ber he said forlornly its a venusian
city


wonder stories

  tyber shrugged indifferently and studied
the strange sight he heard his few re-
maining men gasp in astonishment the
city in the center of the great clearing was
indeed a great sight it was totally differ-
ent from any on the face of the earth and
stretched far on every side

as though hewn from a great block of
blood-red sandstone the venusian met-
ropolis presented the appearance of a tre-
mendous honeycomb tybers interest in
the place increased a they neared it he
marvelled at the strange architecture that
appealed to the eyes of the inhabitants
surely creatures such as bore him and his
men toward the place could not have the
intelligence nor the ability to evolve and
construct such a mammoth structure he
concluded

  his eyes roved swiftly over the place
the honeycombing did not begin for per-
haps a hundred feet above a solid wall as
sheer as some terrifying abyss above this
the wall seemed to have been deliberately
chiseled in the shape of hexagonal apart-
ments though no galleries ran along the
openings on the outside he wondered
what lay within the place was as silent
as a tomb and in the increasing light of the
new day the city seemed a place of blood
due to the color of the materials

  in the foreground was a herd of strange
beasts browsing peacefully in a shrub-filled
pasture they looked up at the approaching
marchers and then rose into the air with the
grace of eagles to settle down again a half
mile awify tyber was awestruck to see the
monsters take wing with such ease to him
they looked like the results of a cross breed-
ing of a horse with a lion and an eagle
he glanced at bingham questioningly

  what the hell bing he inquired
blankly the geologist looked at him wear-
ily and nodded

  hippogriff he said quickly half
horse and half griffon a seemingly fabulous
animal with the body and legs of a lion the
wings of an eagle and the head of a horse
strange monsters arent they

  hell yes ejaculated tyber  won-

 	der if they are used by the venusians as we
 once used horses

   i wouldnt doubt it said bingham
they seem tame enough and powerful
enough to transport a giant through the
air

  suddenly the brute who carried tyber
emitted a shrill cry that pierced through the
clearing like the shriek of a locomotive
whistle instantly the call was answered
from within the venusian city the march-
ers halted in front of a huge solid rock gate
there came the sound of padding feet and
the gate was thrown open but the man-
beasts did not enter

  they deposited the humans on the
ground and formed a circle around them
the biggest of the horde facing the creature
at the gale the scientists were astounded
to see that the beings who had opened the
gate were even more human than those who
had captured them their tails seemed
only half as long their hands were well
developed each having four fingers almost
ckwless they had cleaner features and
eyes that were closer to the center and
around their waists they wore metal belts
from which dangled curved weapons of
black metal

   at a glance tyber knew that they were
a higher breed of the homo reptilis their
broad foreheads bespoke greater intelligence
and their whole attitude displayed a super-
iority to the captors of the earth-men

   the two factions began to argue in gut-
 tural tones tyber knew the reason the
 man-beasts were trying lo sell them to the
 city dwellers but for what price he
 wondered until a creature suddenly dashed
 away and returned with four of the broad
 sword-like weapons these were immed-
 iately presented to the big savage who in
 turn gave up custody of his captives

   throughout the deal the humans watched
intently but in total ignorance of what was
being said bingham wondered why the
city dwellers were so anxious to buy them
watson trembling edged up beside tyber
tyber encircled an arm around his shoulders
in a gesture of assurance

   buck up watson he said softly it
the beast of ban-du-lu



 could have been worse i dont think they
 mean to harm us

   watson shook his head sadly bitterly
j im thinking of the earth tyber he
said gloomily    the wife and kids-
pipe down watson snapped biggers
suddenly you aint the only one who
left everything dear to him to come on this
crazy trip

   tyber gave the man a savage glare which
silenced him at once the man-beasts of
the venusian jungle began moving off in
the direction from which they had come
tyber watched them for an instant they
never looked back but hurried away satis-
fied with the deal the men trembled for
what was in store for them behind the wall

the gaze of the ruler

without further ado the humans were
herded through the gate tyber
was not surprised to find a mob of the
creatures waiting for them in the center of
a hard-packed compound within but he
looked longingly at the great gate when it
swung closed behind them hundreds of
the venusians at once surged around them
and the guards were forced to draw their
weapons for protection

  this action made tybers hopes soar
surely the venusians meant them no harm
else the mob would have been permitted
to tear them to shreds he wondered why
they had been restrained were they to be
sacrificed after presentation to the ruler of
the city or were they to be looked upon
as some sort of slaves by these savage rep-
tilian men

j with a horde following their heels they
were led across the compound to a great
structure that stretched halfway across the
interior it was low and long and over
each corner stood a huge flaming ball that
was as red and blazing as an early morning
sun tyber was struck with a sudden idea
and he whispered to bingham who marched
at his side

  sun worshipers bingham he said
flatly ill bet my shirt on it

   bingham glanced at the great balls they
were made of some brilliant red material

and were as depthless as a tremendous un-
tarnished ruby

   believe youre right tyber said the
geologist decisively but it hardly seems
possible for them lo worship like the old
aztecs

  the pack following them howled savage-
ly at their heels the place was in pande-
monium with excitement but the creatures
did not appear as curious about the captives
as they might have been on seeing a human
for the first time this struck tyber as
exceptionally strange but he was soon to
learn the reason

  a wedge-shaped group of armed venus-
ians suddenly emerged from the long struc-
ture and confronted them the guards im-
mediately stepped aside and the captives
were taken over by the new arrivals they
were bedecked in red belts with vermilion
straps crossing their chests and back to hold
them up the human captives were at once
escorted into the building the place was
filled with glowing red spheres in every
corner of the wide corridor they stood on
narrow pedestals glowing like live coals
everything seemed red but not so vermilion
as the spheres a blood-color seemed to run
riot in the venusian scheme of things

  after a short march the captives were
escorted into a great chamber around which
stood a solid line of armed venusians with
the sword-like weapons lying across their
broad scaled chests their tails writhing on
the blood-stone floor at one end of the
room was a high throne on which sat a
monster venusian who glowered down onto
the scene through fiery ruby-colored orbs

  tyber felt the full force of the gargan-
tuan rulers stare suddenly and became so
fascinated that he could not tear his eyes
away from the creature he seemed held in
some strange power as a snake holds a bird
hot blood pounded at his temples his fin-
gers clutched into the palms of his hands
arid his eyes popped uncontrollably a
great force pounded on his brain almost
terrorizing him

  suddenly the spell was broken the
creature on the throne swung his gaze on
watson the astronomers knees sagged
under the force of the beasts will power


wonder stories

tyber grasped him firmly under the arms
catching him as he appeared to sink to the
floor in a faint

  dont look at him watson he whis-
pered softly keep your eyes away

  i-i- cant watson groaned in a
voice that sounded weird and alrfiost insane
i-i-i cant i-i-i cant i he began
to shriek

  being by nature a nervous high-strung
man watson needed only a new fear to cause
him to break mentally and the eyes of
the brute on the throne imbued him with
such a fear as he had never dreamed of
he went berserk like a lunatic running
amuck

  with a hideous scream he broke from
the guards and dashed madly toward the
throne tyber saw the grotesque ruler
bend over tensely to watch the frenzied hu-
man like a panther watson flung him-
self against the sheer wall of the throne
platform and tried to mount it the scien-
tists were stunned by the sudden unexpect-
ed scene and tyber impulsively stepped
forward toward the insane astronomer

  instantly four guards confronted him
swords ready to strike his head from his
body he glared at them belligerently for
an instant and then returned to his partners
in doom they stood together in a little
knot completely surrounded by venusians
and stared up at the monster on the high
throne watson was babbling and groan-
ing like an idiot at the base of the wall

chapter iv

the woman of venus

every man was tense the atmosphere
became charged with high feeling
tyber glanced at his men they glowered
back at him in return binghams hands
shook steadily and his eyes blazed wide
with fear the guards watched them con-
stantly ready for any sudden outbreak
tyber as leader of the expedition to venus
turned suddenly and faced the thing on the
throne his eyes were aflame with hatrqgi
and deep-seated fear but he controlled him-
self with a steel will

  now that we are here he said speaking
in english what do you plan to do with

us

  the ruler stared at him oddly through
flaming orbs tyber fought to hold his
senses realizing that the venusian had not
understood him then something happen-
ed that completely bowled him over

  a golden curtain behind the venusians
throne suddenly parted tyber had a
glimpse of a radiant human face peering
intently at him then the girl stepped out
in full view of every creature in the great
room and walked to the side of the ruler
a buzz of excited voices caused tyber to
glance behind him at the amazed faces
of his men

  a woman one of them gasped

  and a peach too said another with
an eye for feminine beauty

  the girl was indeed a peach her rare
delicate beauty was unbelievable along side
of the terrifying features and physical ap-
pearance of the haughty venusian ruler
her blonde hair was dazzling her gentle
features might have been taken from an
angelo masterpiece and her form hidden
only by a golden bteech-clout around her
thighs and a strip of golden material across
her breasts gave her the appearance of
some goddess of love and purity

  they heard her converse intently with
the creature in the guttural tongue of venus
her voice ringing out clearly and beauti-
fully the beast looked up at her for a
moment mouthed some evil grunts and re-
turned his eyes upon tyber then the girl
faced the group below her blue eyes flash-
ing in the brilliance of the room

  what brings you here my friends she
inquired quickly in perfect german

  tyber was stunned he swallowed hard
and groped for words the sound of the
german language was like music to him
he understood it thoroughly but in his
amazement he mixed it up terribly with his
own american tongue she smiled down
at him warmly scarcely able to hide a great
desire to gel to him

  you amaze me most pleasantly fraii-
lein he sputtered excitedly i had not
the beast of ban-du-lu



expected to find such a beautiful woman on

venus

  she hung her eyes modestly and ad-
dressed the ruler he grunted and scowled
as she told him what had been said she
looked down again

  the great ban-du-lu ruler of jan-du-
bar she began again inquires what brings
j ou here

  the men behind tyber shifted uneasily
and whispered in low tones among them-
selves bingham ignorant of the german
language stared at the convulsing form of
watson

  we came here on a scientific explora-
tion said tyber hastily as peaceful
human beings we meant ban-du-lu no harm
ask him why we were taken captive and
treated so cruelly by the jungle men of
jan-du-bar

  he paused and waited for the girl to
interpret his words to the great ban-du-lu
the ruler glared at them menacingly and
grunted a series of deep-throated gutturals
the girl paled slightly and seemed to fal-
ter she clutched at the throne as though
to prevent herself from falling tyber
tensed and stared at her

  ban-du-lu says you have no right here
the girl said in a trembling voice and
you are to be given into the keeping of
xip-pa-co-yan

  whats that fraiilein he asked blunt-
ly

  in our terms you are to be sacrificed
to the sun she said in a half whisper even
as my fathers men were sacrificed long be-
fore you come to jan-du-bar

  tybers face went bloodless and he
glanced at bingham

  did you understand bingham he
hissed

the geologist shook his head negatively

  the big devil says we are to be sacri-
ficed to the sun tyber informed him

  what for bingham asked growing
suddenly fearful

  tyber looked up at the girl again he
imagined he saw glistening tears coursing
down her cheeks

why are we to be sacrificed fraiilein
he said coldly we have done no harm

to any creature on venus and we planned
to return home in a week or ten days

  that part does not matter my friends
she said sadly it happened that you were
taken at a time when jan-du-bar offers liv-
ing sacrifices to the sun for the past
twenty-five years ban-du-lu has offered a
human being on each occasion when the
suns rays pierce the sun-globes outside di-
rectly 

  do you mean that there were other hu
mans here before us tyber cried strange-
ly-

  of course she returned my father
conquered space twenty years ago leaving
berlin secretly with a picked crew and land-
ed on venus the space flyer was smash-
ed and we were captured i was a baby
then

  well ill be damned ejaculated ty-
ber then the venusians have sacrificed
you one by one

she nodded fighting to keep from
breaking down

  only myself and my father remain
she said and daddy lies ill dying

but your mother fraiilein    
she died in space when i was born the
girl said she would not remain behind
father tells me when the flight to venus
began

  but why have they let you and your
father live tyber questioned

  the girl looked down at him appealingly
i am to be his woman she said grow-
ing suddenly resentful for that reason
we have been allowed to live ban-du-lu
has an idea that he wants to start a new
race on venus

  beauty and the beast eh tyber hissed
savagely glancing hatefully at ban-du-lu
the girl nodded

  venus the planet of love and beauty
she said is in truth a planet of savagery
and ugliness

  amen agreed tyber calmly

  she spoke again to ban-du-lu the beast
snarled like a tiger in reply

  ban-du-lu the girl addressed tyber
says that in a fortnight you are to be the
first human of your party to be sacrificed


wonder stories

but she lowered her voice cant you
do something are you weaponless
our guns are useless on these crea-
tures he said but why all the rush to
kill me

   ban-du-lu resents the way you look at
me she sobbed but he can be killed if
you shoot him in the back of the head all
venusian vital organs are centered at the
base of the brain

   she shuddered visibly and tried hard to
 smother the sobs that threatened to choke
 her before the assembly of court guards
 and the ruler himself

  thats what i thought said tyber
grimly we have several pistols not
enough to fight i guess well go the way
of your friends unless we can escape
there is no escape my friend the girl
stated flatly the jungles are places of
madness you can never escape

   do you speak french she said sudden-
 ly after a brief pause

  tyber nodded as well as german or
english he said mystified why
ban-du-lu understands some german my
father taught him she whispered in the
native tongue of france father taught
me french for want of something to do but
the beast doesnt understand it listen
you will be caged under this terrible build-
ing until the day arrives for your sacrifice
you will be guarded loosely because they
think escape is impossible tonight  will
help you to escape

   but you said there was no escape fraii-
 lein said tyber

   ban-du-lu looked up savagely at the girl
 and grunted loudly she jumped nervous-
 ly like a frightened fawn and stifled a
 scream she trembled from head to foot
 and then gained control of herself tyber
 looked on in wonder and heard her say
 something to the ruler

   whats wrong fraiilein tyber hissed
 intently

   she looked down again

   he suspects something she said and
 is about to pass sentence of doom upon you
 all but listen closely  she whis-
 pered softly  ill unlock the cages
 tonight in the room at the end of the jail

corrider you will find four machine guni
taken from our space flyer get them and
fight your way to freedom

   tybers hopes soared again but fell to
 the depths when he visioned the trackless
 jungle between the city and the electronic
 flyer yet he resolved suddenly to die
 fighting rather than permit his living blood
 to flow freely on some sacrificial altar

   thanks fraiilein he said eagerly
 you watch our smoke    tonight but
 what about you

   ban-du-lu would kill me if he learned
 i helped you she said fearfully but if all
 of you can escape to your flyer ill be glad
 ban-du-lu suddenly stood erect he tow-
 ered over the girl by at least three feet
 tyber stared at him hatefully murderously
 his temples pounding the beast opened
 his cruel lips and addressed the assembly
 in thunderous tones the girl emitted a
 little scream and sagged against the throne
 tyber knew what had taken place the
 ruler of jan-du-bar had passed the sentence
 of death upon him and his partners in per-
 il

cells of doom

watson screamed hideously when
rough clawed fingers clutched at him
to haul him off the floor two savage ven-
usians took hold of him and marched him
toward tyber bingham and the others
they were surrounded now on all sides by
the guards ban-du-lu stood upon the
throne glared down upon the resentful hu-
mans and watched them herded from the
room to be placed in confinement until such
times as he needed them for worship

   if might appear far-fetched to say that
 such a beast s ban-du-lu could worship a
 higher intelligence with any kind of respect
 but the venusians held more than respect
 for the sun they feared the blazing sphere
 that on certain seasons seemed to make a
 strange track through the heavens and burn
 down on them with a fearful intensity ban-
 du-lu as did his more savage ancestors be-
 lieved that sun-worship and human or na-
 tive sacrifice would prevent the seemingly
 impending catastrophe but ban-du-lu
the beast of ban-du-lu



preferred the human sacrifices in lieu of
those of his own kind for the humans had
come out of space and were therefore bet-
ter morsels for the sun to consume

  but tyber had only the old earthly ideas
of sacrifice in his mind as he was led down
a ramp to a chamber below the throne
room through his mind raced the thought
of being laid out on an altar to have his
living heart torn from his body as the az-
tecs had done to victims centuries before on
earth he did not stop to consider that
there might be a new wrinkle in sacrificial
affairs on venus moreover he had little
hope of ever getting back to earth escape
into the jungle might be possible through
the aid of the girl but deadly peril lurked
on every side there and he had but a vague
idea as to the exact direction of the elect-
ronic flyer which had been landed on ven-
usian soil early the morning before

  the scientists received another shock
when they were finally led into the cham-
ber of confinement it was indeed a large
room with sapling-barred cages or cells
lining either side of a wide corridor as
soon as they entered the place became a
chamber of bedlam tyber quickly learn-
ed the source of the shrieks and ungodly
screams that rent the stillness of the place

  in the cells on one side of the room were
scores of venusians of even a higher devel-
opment than the man-beasts of ban-du-lu
tyber stared at them in amazement as they
passed their tails were short and pointed
and useless as weapons and their features
were more human-like and their chests were
bare of scales their eyes were close to the
bridges of their noses and the natural ar-
mor seemed like loose skin instead of
gnarled bone this drooped down over
their backs and shoulders like the feathers
of an indian chief and rippled like the
light headdress in a breeze with every
movement they made

  they bellowed and shrieked madly at the
guards hissing at times like reptiles to
show their hate for them tyber under-
stood at once why they were held captive
they were to be sacrificed but where had
they come from was there another great
city on venus that was inhabited by this

higher culture he concluded that this
must be so and sacrificial subjects had been
taken from it by the hordes of ban-du-lu

  each human was placed in an individual
cell but tyber had die good fortune to be
incarcerated beside bingham and the raving
watson

  the other members of the expedition sev-
en in all were placed in cell-cages beside
the leaders across the hall were the ven-
usians they peered through their bars at
the humans who in turn glared back four
guards loafed in the place two at either end
of the corridor their black sword-like weap-
ons sheathed eyes dull with apparent lazi-
ness they seemed unconcerned about the
presence of the new human captives

  watson raved in his cell like a madman
tyber was appalled by his hideous inhu-
man screams the venusians across the
corridor finally turned their eyes upon him
and began grunting in low almost musical
tones the astronomer hurled himself
against his bars with a force that threw him
backward to the hard floor from his lips
escaped a continuous prattle his mind had
snapped and with it had gone all his con-
trol will power and humanity he was a
caged beast literally tyber held little
hope for him now and watched him intently

  buck up watson he said softly get
control of yourself were going to get out
of here tonight

atson crouched at the sound of his
voice his lips trembled frenziedly
from the dribbled a stream of blood the
result of his terrific collision with the bars

  we are doomed he shrieked loudly
we are doomed we are doomed
not yet watson tyber whispered we
are going to escape tonight

  there is no escape he screamed you
lie you lie

  tyber still wore a small haversack around
his shoulders it contained medical sup-
plies and antidotes for snake bites and drugs
for combatting malaria quickly he pulled
the sack around and fumbled for a brass
box from this he selected a hypodermic
needle stuck the point into a small vial and
glanced decisively at the astronomer


wonder stories

  stick your arm through the bars wat-
son he said easily  want to look at it
watson eyed him durably and approached
slowly to the side of his cage tyber watch-
ed him closely centering his boring eyes
into the insane mans pupils watson came
forward as though in a trance and then
grovelled on the floor tyber reached out
suddenly and grasped the astronomer by
the arm turned it over and jabbed the hypo-
dermic needle into the limb the as-
tronomer shrieked and jerked away but the
drugs had been injected within a min-
ute he became quiet and finally crumpled
over to lie still on the floor

  hated to do it tyber said to bingham
but the poor devil will kill himself against
the bars im afraid for poor old wat-
son

  a bad case said bingham i pity
him but hell be a charge on us tonight
tyber glanced toward the geologist with
a scowl

  hell be a charge alright he said firm-
ly but if we return home he goes with us
we are partners in peril and will be part-
ners in safety as well

  of course of course said bingham
hastily i did not mean to leave him

  i did not think so said tyber i
just want to set you straight

  thanks snapped bingham curtly it
will be your job then to lake care of him
its every man for himself now

  thais mighty rotten of you bingham
growled tyber of course the strain is
telling on you now

  bingham sulked in his cell and turned his
attention to the fascinated venusians across
the room tyber studied the lay of the
place and finally learned the location of the
room in which the girl had said were four
machine guns he wondered if there was
ammunition for them

chapter v
hope

night approached slowly the jail
room became a place of ghostly shad-
ows a feeble light filtered through a lone

hexagon-shaped aperture high up near the
ceiling the place was stifling sweat
poured off the tense fearful humans in
streams it seemed that every bit of mois-
ture was being sucked from their bodies
tyber kept a ceaseless vigil on both ends of
the room hoping for the appearance of the
girl at one of them

  the venusian guards sprawled on the
floor now tyber wondered if they slept
the room was getting darker with each pass-
ing instant but the stifling heat did not
decrease as the sun sank out of sight the
muffled roar of countless voices come to him
from above there seemed to be some
great excitemnl in the compound above
the voices gave him the impression that he
was listening to a pack of snarling beasts

  hours passed and the room was engulfed
in an inky blackness the usual nightly
thunder of venus pounded down with ter-
rifying crashes lightning flickered
through the heavens in an almost ceaseless
sheet casting finally a violet gloom over
the doom chamber still tyber watched
bingham paced his small cell in circles
watson lay in a stupor and the fear-filled
men cursed under their breaths the ven-
usians across the room were silent but ty-
ber could see their beady eyes flashing in
the gloom

  despite their exhaustion the men could
not sleep thoughts of rest were remote
from their minds now tyber had told
them what to expect and they were ready
but as the hours passed and the girl failed
to appear they grew restless tyber order-
ed them to be still and they crouched in
their cells like dumb beasts waiting

  tyber was aware of a gnawing hunger
and thirst no food had been brought to
them much less water he searched his
pack and found some hard moistureless bis-
cuits he hissed at bingham

  pass these along the line bing he
said biscuits

  bingham reached out and took hold of
the bag picked out a biscuit and passed
the remainder to the men tyber heard
them grunt with satisfaction and blunt all-
meaning thanks

  looks like the girl is going to fail us
the beast of ban-du-lu



ptyber said bingham with no trace of his
former antagonism

  shes prohahly being detained

  you think the big leader got wise to
her

  maybe but the next hour ought to tell
shell get her neck garroted if shes
caught

  tyber winced inwardly

  not as long as i have an ounce of
strength in my body he said grimly
bingham chuckled amusedly

  you wouldnt have a chinamans
chance lo defend her tyber he said gloom-
ily even machine guns wont stop the
devils unless you hit em inlhe throat
would be different if we had one of the
flyers ray guns said tyber

 but we havent grumbled bingham
i wonder if the men who escaped the fight
reached the flyer	

  tyber grunted in surprise

  id forgotten all about them bingham
he ejaculated they might have found it
again if they did theyd have a hard time
operating her

  thats right said bingham they
were observers not pilots i had a secret
hope that theyd take off to locate us

  im afraid theyd crack up if they tried
ir said tyber dejectedly if they do
were completely sunk

  tyber tensed suddenly and hissed a warn-
ing at bingham at the end of the hall
stood a motionless figure hugging the wall
a flash of brilliant lightning illuminated
the room for an instant the figure crouch-
ed slid past the prone guards and came for-
ward as silently as a ghost tybers lips
went tight his veins bulged he glanced
across the room quickly

  glittering eyes were watching the lithe
form of the golden-haired girl as she crawl-
ed along the floor but no grunts came from
the jailed venusians did they suspect a
reason for this silent visit of the strange
creature of ban-du-lus tribe were they
looking upon her as a goddess of freedom
or would they give warning to the sleeping
guards tyber wondered with his blood
racing to his head like burning lead

  this way he hissed in an almost in-
audible whisper

he girl paused in her tracks and tooked
toward him

  over here he said softly sensing her
ignorance as to where he had been placed
hurry

  quickly she glided toward him and stood
erect in front of his cell he reached out
and clutched her hand it was warm and
trembling with fear

  i-i-lm sorry to have kept you waiting
my friend she whispered fearfully much
excitement reigns above

  are they preparing for our deaths
tyber inquired

  not yet she trembled they fear an
impending raid upon the city of ban-du-lu
by the warriors of hamund-sik the ruler
of the domain beyond the jungle

  then there is another cily of higher
venusian culture here tyber inquired
softly is there to be war

  she peered toward the guards and then
looked toward tyber

  there is she sobbed and there is to
be war ban-du-lu raided their domain and
took captives for sacrifice now hamund-
sik retaliates

  then said tyber decisively ct dien
i serve hamund-sik if he will have me
j he is good she said but savage his
warriors are held across the jail chamber
can you speak their tongue miss-
call me cassandra she said i was
named after my father who is professor
c as sail bohler yes i speak the tongue of
hamund-sik

  my name is tyber said the scientist
squeezing her hand james tyber of
new york but listen cassandra-if you
will release the warriors across the hall
they mayaid us to escape

  she looked at him strangely her eyes
flashing with understanding without an-
other word to tyber she crept across the
room and he heard her whispering in low
tones to one of the venusians presently
she returned and informed tyber that the
venusians would fight for them if they were
released the scientists hopes soared and


wonder stories

lie whispered the news to bingham who in
turn passed the word along to the others

  then open our doors cassandra said
tyber eagerly we will wait until all of
them are open before setting with the guards
how soon do you expect the warriors of
hainund-sik

  even now they approach ban-du-lu
she whispered in a few minutes they will
be here riding the air on their flying
beasts

   the hippogriff tyber squinted
thats what father calls them she said
but here they are called the piah

what about your father cassandra
cassandra hung her head reverently
my father died a short hour ago herr
tyber she sobbed i am alone now
not by a long shot cassandra said
the scientist patting her hand in assurance
now hurry and open all the doors then
ccme back here to me we will always
stay together

the duel

once released from their cells the war-
riors of hamud-sik became ghosts of
doom tyber with cassandra bingham
and his men beside him watched as they
silently approached the sleeping guards
their presence was discovered by the man-
beasts of ban-du-lu too late a hal hun-
dred invaders swooped down upon them
and gloried in the act of spilling their lav-
ender blood

   in the flashes of vivid lightning that il-
luminated the room not infrequently they
saw the guards torn to shreds within a min-
ute they had scarcely lime to grunt in
surprise before they were hurled into eter-
nity by the deadly warriors then they
returned in triumph toward the fearful hu-
mans and cassandra taking advantage of
her position as goddess of liberty addressed
them softly

  follow me and you will have swords
she said in the tongue of the higher venus-
ians the humans appraised her in wonder
as she spoke now in a cool fearless calm
she looked at tyber in the chamber at
that end of the hall you will find guns and

swords arm yourselves and be ready to
fight hamund-siks warriors have ar-
rived i hear fighting above

  thank god said tyber our chance
has come

  with a bound he leaped toward the cage
in which watson had been placed the
astronomer lay in a black heap on the floor
quickly tyber threw open the door and en-
tered he was appalled at what he dis-
covered watson lay in a pool of his own
blood coagulated and sticky a gaping
wound across his throat and a pocket-knife
clutched tightly in a blood-stained fist told
tyber what had happened watson in a
fit of insane despondency had committed
suicide he mumbled a silent prayer over
the body and returned to cassandra

  in the chamber at the end of the hall
tyber found four ancient machine guns
the airless room had kept them from rust-
ing in a corner lay belts of ammunition
venusian swords were piled in a heap
around it quickly he ordered his men to
pass them out to the venusians who accept-
ed them with delight then with belts of
ammunition draped around them they
charged the guns picked them up and began
the perilous ascent up the ramp toward the
throne room of ban-du-lu

  cassandra clung closely to tyber for pro-
tection she glanced fearfully about her
ns though expecting momentarily to find
ban-du-lu himself stalking her with lust in
his beastly eyes tyber whispered assur-
ance to her

  keep calm cassandra he said softly
im so afraid herr tyber she said
ban-du-lu will kill me 

  forget about him tyber snapped
hes as good as dead right now

  but you do not know ban-du-lu my
friend she cried he is a shrewd cun-
ning beast inhuman in his cunning devil-
try

  well clean out the throne room first
men tyber hissed ignoring cassandras
warning he turned to her tell the ven-
usians what i said cassandra

  her clear soprano voice rose and fell as
she interpreted tybers orders to the stalk-
the beast of ban-du-lu



ing man-beasts of hainund-sik they lis-
tened and grunted in chorus

  finally they attained the top of the ramp
and peered into the throne room the
place was partly deserted only a few ven-
usian warriors of ban-du-lu stood near the
throne as though wailing the arrival upon
it of the gargantuan ruler they looked
around at the sound of footsteps in the room
instantly they crouched swords ready sur-
prised at the appearance of the hamund-
sik fighters they caught sight of cassan-
dra at once they realized that she had re-
leased them and approached jjienacingly
fearlessly looming like purple ghosts in the
gloom

  with a solid shout of joy the erstwhile
sacrificial subjects raced forward to meet
the warriors of ban-du-lu there was a
clash of swords the ring of savage cries and
silence in the center of the room lay a
heap of dead warriors of both ban-du-lus
and hamund-siks ranks

  outside a great battle raged the clash
of swords the scream of the dying and the
triumphant grunts of the victorious rent the
air above the crash of the thunder despite
the semi-darkness the two races of venus-
ians fought steadily tyber led his men
to the throne room entrance and paused
there to watch the raging fight the warriors
writhing in a great knot in the compound
which was lighted almost constantly by the
incessant lightning that glowed through the
skies

  the unexpected raid upon ban-du-lu by
hainund-sik was an event tyber considered
much in his favor indeed without such a
battle as now raged in the city they would
have had little chance to escape into the jun-
gles surrounding it but he saw only free-
dom now and safety  if they could
but locate the electronic flyer and gain the
protection of its steel hull after that
ban-du-lu and hamund-sik could fight until
the end of time for all he cared

in the violet light of th flickering heav-
ens tyber could see mat the forces of
ban-du-lu were outnumbered considerably
by the grim dogged fighters of hamund-
gjk the latter surged into their enemies

cutting them down in droves their swords
stained to brilliant purple swords flashed
in the night wielded in mighty venusian
arms heads were clipped neatly from
shoulders the city of ban-du-lu was a
place of terror horror and death

  before they could be restrained by cass-
andra the venusians she had rescued broke
from the throne building and raced frenzicd-
lv into the milling mob their head-growths
waving behind them so that they looked like
american indians going into battle they
wanted vengeance against ban-du-lu for hav-
ing cooped them up tyber yelled at them
as they went but they paid no attention to
him they were swallowed up at once by
the milling snarling pack

  with machine guns mounted in the en-
trance of the throne structure tyber and his
men were ready to defend themselves should
the fighters of ban-du-lu retreat toward
them as he lay beside one of the guns
tyber was startled by a sudden tumult be-
hind him he looked up quickly to see
ban-du-lu himself and a score of his private
guard approaching from the throne room
with a shout of warning to his men he leap-
ed erect snatched at a sword that lay near-
by and thrust cassandra behind him

  the guns men he shouted cassan-
dar screamed and clung to him an auto-
matic exploded beside them a purple hole
appeared in ban-du-lus scaled chest a 
stream of lavender fluid shot out but he
came steadily forward then a machine
gun rattled dryly the man-beasts halted
in bewilderment some fell headlong with
gaping holes in their throats the backs of
their necks lorn to shreds binghams aim
was true

  in a mighty leap ban-du-lu came for-
ward in the face of a deadly fire from bing-
hams gun his body was being riddled
yet his vital organs had remained untouchcd
by the steel slugs that whined around him
cassandra screamed again and clutched
frantically at tyber hampering him ban-
du-lus great sword song past his face and
he fell back shaking the girl from him

  back cassandra he bellowed in eng-
lish forgetting in his excitement that she

understood little of it back hold your
fire men

  ban-du-lu now perilously close lashed
out suddenly with his tail its lip struck
bingham a terrible blow across the face
sending the machine gun over on its side as
well the stupefied crey of the electronic
flyer crouched aghast but suddenly another
un rallied above the din of the elements
and the tumult created by the struggling
hordes tyber saw more of ban-du-lus
private guards go crashing lo the floor but
the ruler himself seemed to have a charmed
life

  the man-beast lifted his sword bis eyes
wide his cruel lips curled into a significant
snarl cassandra suddenly raced forward
to stand between him and tyber ban-du-
lu sent her sprawling with a savage blow
across the face she fell into a heap

   with a bestial cry tyber leaped forward
ban-du-lu towered head and shoulders above
him like goliath over david but tyber
had no time to make comparisons the
rulers sword shot toward his throat he
leaped aside the blade sang past his chin
and came back again in a tremendous arc
ripping his shirt across the bosom he felt
a flush of something hot streaming down
over his abdomen and in the instant he saw
red

  ban-du-lus hideous features loomed up
oddly through the barrier of flaming hate
that danced before tybers eyes his brain
cried out for an opportunity to sink his blade
into that awesome throat but the man-beast
was indeed a master swordsman and coun-
tered every thrust tyber had never held
a sword in his hands prior to this but the
blood of bis ancestors who had wielded
swords in defending america in the days
of its infancy welled up in him and filled
his hand with skill

  he heard the shouts of his men as he
fought to keep that terrible slashing weapon
of ban-du-lu from his throat he heard
biggers scream a warning and ducked the
venusians blade whined about his head and
then his opportunity came

the end of ban-du-lu

ban-du-lu lifting his mighty sword
high above his head for a final killing
thrust opened his guard in the instant
tyber dove forward with all his weight
with an insane shout he aimed the blade at
the thick throat of the man-beast and felt it
strike yielding flesh a strange surprised
look flashed across the rulers hideous face
a stream of lavender liquid shot forth from
his tliroat and sprayed over the scientist
then ban-du-lus sword clattered to the
floor and the beast sank slowly toward it
his tail curled and uncurled savagely and
for minutes after his life had fled it con-
tinued lo writhe like the tail of a snake in
the throes of death

  tyber had won an unequal battle lie
stood over the fallen venusian and buried
his sword again in the scaled body then
he hurled the weapon aside and raced tow-
ard cassandra she lay on the floor hiding
her face in her hands he lifted her up
gently

  its all over cassandra he whispered
softly

  oh my friend she sobbed how hap-
py i am to see you alive

you mean you care then he asked

  she threw her arras around his neck and
sobbed on his shoulder he carried her
back to the group of humans and deposited
her among them in the compound the fight
still raged in all its terrible frenzy a mob
of ban-du-lu began retreating toward the
throne structure

       a

  let em have it men tyber shouted
the devils are coming to the protection of
the building blow em to hell

  four machine guns began to rattle a chor-
us of doom the retreating man-beasts
halted in the face of the deadly fire only
to le cut down steadily by the warriors of
hamund-sik they fell in droves from both
front and rear and now it appeared that the
ban-du-lus would be wiped out entirely

  cassandra shuddered at the terrible sight
and stood up suddenly tyber tried to pull
her down fearing that a sword might be
thrown at her by a veangeful subject of
the beast of ban-du-lu



ban-du-lu but she pushed him away then
her voice rang oul above the din

  oh brave warriors of ban-du-lu and
hamund-sik she cried in ihe common ton-
gue of venus it is useless to fight the
great ruler of the ban-du-lu is dead and his
spirit has gone to xip-pa-co-yan who will
now be satisfied with the royal gift and let
jan-du-bar continue unmolested by the heat
of the skies ban-du-lu has given himself
as a sacrifice to prevent further bloodshed
xip-pa-co-yan speaks through cassan-dra
and asks that there be peace

  she paused to see the effects of her speech
the ban-du-lu in the face of inevitable de-
feat and annihilation suddenly threw down
their swords hurled themselves flat on their
faces and grunted loudly the forccs of
hamunk-sik stood upright sheathed their
swords and faced the flickering heavens
rain suddenly splattered down on the com-
pound in a solid wall a terrific wind
lashed the jungle into an uproar and whist-
led through the honeycombed walls of the
city with wails of menace cassandra look-
ed at tyber in astonishment

  the tornado she said fearfully it
is coming it is the first time the feared
tornado has ever struck this portion of ven-
us my father told me that it never came
here if it does not kill these people it will
frighten them into a belief that the sun is
angry at them for fighting

  she faced the compound again tyber
watched amazed that the words from this
slip of a girl could cause the man-beasts
of venus to lay down their arms in peace

  xip-pa-co-yan sends -the great wind to
shake the jungles of jan-du-bar she droned
it will pass and jan-du-bar will be a place
of peace and contentment let there be a
great banquet in which all venusians will
participate i cassan-dra who takes ban-
du-lus place oir the throne command it
thats marvelous cassandra said ty-
ber whatever you told them sure had its
effect

i commanded them to a banquet herr
tyber she said looking into his eyes
there will be peace now  for us all
it is unbelievable fraiilein he said

that they would listen to you

  there was a searing flame appearing sud-
denly in the heavens beyond the jungle it
looked like some great comet passing close
to the surface of venus a blinking light
informed tyber what it was

  the flyer he yelled gleefully the
electronic flyer the men got back to the
flyer cassandra and they come for us
she looked at him hopefully

  do you mean that it is your ship she
asked incredulously

  our space flyer fraiilein he said joy-
ously it will lake us back home you
will go with us

  she rested her head on his shoulder
together they watched the flyer her rock-
et exhausts seared the heavens with streaks
of blue flame the venusians watched in
wonderment then the ship paused over-
head at a great altitude tyber had a
sudden fear that it might go away but
binghams voice diverted his thoughts

  they will see that something is up here
tyber he said eagerly theyre observ-
ers and nothing will escape their sharp eyes
but lord i hope they dont make a mis-
calculation and crack up

  a moment of uncertainty passed then
the flyers tail belched a sudden spurt of
flame her nose dipped sharply down-
ward finally she settled in the compound
within five minutes the elated humans were
aboard leaving the venusians gaping

  tyber led cassandra to the observation
bridge as the flyer dropped away from
venus

  the earth lies far ahead cassandra he
whispered presently she stood very close
to him he caught the fragrance of her
golden hair as it fuushed his face

  im so thrilled she responded quick
many times have i prayed to go to the
world of my father and mother

  we will land within a fortnight eri  ur
world cassandra tyber nodde-i

  she glanced at him with udden fear
you will never come back to mu
oh i will cassandra hr replied bat

  i congratulate you said the brown-
faced general it was a much better re-
sult than i had hoped for of course they

were foolish in trying to stand off the at-
tack with their position artillery and in sup-
porting with nothing but a squadron of
cruisers but i think you were lucky all
the same

  the fussy little man could not forebear
a smile of triumph yes he said on
the whole i am satisfied with the result
the positions along the river will certainly
force these people to try an attack sooner
or later and then we know what we can do
   and our losses were not so extraordin-
ary either two battleships and three
cruisers

  an explosive out-rush of purple vapor
hurled them bodily backward against the
canyon wall they crouched there a few
seconds waiting george had an arm
around juanitas waist half-supporting her

  abruptly the red-violet vapor receded
from about them it became a straight wall
of purple light the surface of a great disk

ran forward leaped into that wall of red-

  the next thing the engineer knew they
were lying sprawled in soft green grass
juanita had fallen across his body he sat
up with her in his arms he gazed at the
world about him and shed tears of relief
and joy the sky was no longer a sullen
angry red-it was soft and warmly blue

  cyclopean nightmare mountains of dull
black stone no longer hemmed them in-
they were surrounded by the green fields of
the san joaquin valley on one side of
them a herd of jersey cows was grazing
beyond them stood a pleasant-looking farm-

house on the other side was a fence and
beyond the fence an unpaved country road

   the sound of an automobile engine reach-
ed georges ears-sounding strange after his
ages of silent imprisonment in that other
world

   a farm truck loaded with cans of milk
was coming down the road

   a milk wagon he whispered to juan-
ita lets stop it

   she responded feebly and they struggled
over to the fence

   the farmer stopped to investigate these
poor tattered bruised humans who clung
weakly to the fence crying for joy a few
minutes later he had given each a few sips
of milk from one of the cans and was tak-
ing them tothe pleasant farmhouse on the
hill where they would find many things
that in their terrible stay in the other world
they had known only in delirious dreams

passage way and the underground chamber
the men we wre after had already started
the stolen machine whose thrumming we
had heard with the idea of destroying us
the rays of our more powerful machine
concentrated by the lenses met the rays of
the smaller machine

  we all had the impression that there was
a tremendous explosion as no explosion
was heard by anyone in the neighborhood
the effect must have been a subjective one
we all saw a great flash of light through
which millions of fiery worms seemed to be
writhing that is as near as i can come to
describing the overpowering experiences
which resulted in unconsciousness for all of
us a few seconds later the last thing i
remember is seeing goodrich reach for the
levers of the machine

  afterward we decided that we were not
unconscious long and we all recovered
about the same time where the stairs had
been was a great hole four feet high and
fifteen feet across there was nothing vis-
ible in the blackness of itsk interior

  well have to find out whats hap-
pened said goodrich feel well enough
to come along

  i feel all right i answered

  goodrich took moloneys torch and went
ahead just inside the hole we found frag-
ments of the stolen ray machine beside
it were two human bodies and in a large
chamber beyond we found ten more they
were all black and swelling rapidly

  no chance of identifying them said
goodrich

  not a chance

  therell be a lot of explaining to do

  its a pity the bodies werent destroyed
altogether i said

  goodrich looked thoughtful if we
turned on the machine for a few minutes
longer theyd be gone i suppose

  we agreed with moloney to say nothing
of what had happened in the sub-cellar
there were mysterious rumors of course
but no attention was paid to them by the
newspapers the hartridge house was
closed up by the authorities and afterward
purchased from the heirs by the govern-
ment

  to this day no one knows positively who
was responsible for stealing the ray mach-
ine and using it to murder hartridge and
the detectives we know of course which
foreign ambassador had been suspected by
hartridge the day after the tragic events
in the sub-cellar the authorities tried to get
in touch with him it was stated at the
embassy that he had gone out of town and
the date of his return uncertain other high
officials of the embassy including the mili-
tary and naval attaches were similarly ab-
sent

  it is not knowft whether they ever re-
turned in fact a great deal of mystery
hangs over the appointment some weeks
later of a new ambassador announcement
was made of the recall of the previous am-
bassador but no record exists of his having
applied to the state department for his pass-
ports

  the governments lack of interest in
hartridges invention has since his death
been atoned for after the next war when
the necessity for secrecy is no longer a fac-
tor doubtless a monument will be erected
to him incidentally that next war has
been indefinitely postponed because certain
foreign governments have at least an ink-
ling of the nature of the weapon hartridge
bequeathed to his country

  it is after all the same system thal prof
oberth the inventor of the space rocket
has provided for his ships besides we
would need all thisn these rooms no more
than light here arc simply to be the mach-
ines for the different industries which we
shall carry on as models while the key-
boards belonging to these machines which
activate them will be in the airy rooms

  imagine a carpenter shop consider
the harm done by the continual breathing of
bits of shavings and the bent position one
acquires by planing here everything is
different the machines work down be-
low and the worker sits up above he has
before him a keyboard and at the same time
a television screen in which he can always
see his machine below automatically ac-
cording as be uses his levers and buttons
the boards move under saw or plane a
single finger pressure brings them by mach-
ine power into the right position

  the electric plane or saw works more ac-
curately than a person could even the
finest work will be done here when for in-
stance a skilled machine carver completes
his patterns and arabesques with the mach-
ine when this is done the machine arm
lays the completed board on a moving belt
and in the next room in a similar manner
the boards are assembled to make a cabinet

  there are no laborers here any more
nor any soiled clothes for our people sim-
ply operate keyboards merely a few over-
seers and machinists with perhaps a few
young people to help them are below and
watch over the correct performance of the
machines likewise this has the great ad-
vantage that in all work now entailing noise
the disturbance will be in the cellar stories
completely sound proof

  that these workers are to have constant
medical supervision both in their general

to be

health and also in their nervous condition
is a matter of course likewise we are pro-
viding in a most magnificent way for hard-v
ening their bodies by healthful athletics

  we shall also make experiments to see
whether it is beneficial to have music play-
ed during the working hours enjoyment
is always the main thing in details which
must be performed quickly a merry march
or dance music will involuntarily enliven
the work in other work which must pro-
ceed slowly and demand a more thoughtful
regularity a dreamy violin solo might well
be useful who knows whether it will not
later on be a perfectly natural thing to have
an industrial music director who has exact
knowledge of industries and always adapts
his music to a tempo and mood to the dif-
ferent work and in this way has a spiritual
influence on the workers

  you all know how a happy march in-
fluences one walking how weariness de-
parts and the legs step out almost of them-
selves why else should there be military
bands everywhere thus there shall be
work bands in santa scientia to make work
a joy for everyone so diat it shall not
oppress him it is incredible what the ef-
fect that mental attitude has on every per-
son it makes all the diference in the world
whether he is glad to work or if he simply
sits out his hours against his will

  but all this is of the future as yet
we have indeed a city but no inhabitants
and most of our industries are waiting their
beginning-coming 

  this time they took the express train in

minutes they were at the catering place of

  science fiction authors have in many cues erred
by not explaining more fully what they mean by dif-
ferent kinds of rays

  in nature we have the emanations of energy in
wave form in the electromagnetic spectrum there
are the long radio waves the shorter heat waves
emitted by radiant bodies the still ohorter light
waves the ultra-violet rays the still shorter x-rays
t it o radium rays and the cosmic rays which are the
shortest known

  now many authors have constructed their own ray
of various kinds by intensifying and changing the
character of these fundamental rays the rays from
the ultra-violet down to the cosmic as well as the
heat rays certainly possess power for destruction as
many of our authors imagine and it is possible that
many of them will be used in the future as they are
pictured in science ficuon stories-editor

  a revolver kick

editor science questions and answers

  in tho science yuestions and answers depart-
ment in the march issue there was an interesting
diagram of a revolver suspended in a vacuum illus-
trating the principle of rocket propulsion in spaco
at first sight it was obviously conclusive evidence


wonder stories



but mby i suggest hint ihe revolver moved becausa
the rush of gases pushed against tho side of the ves-
sel in which it was suspended would the revolver
act the same in a very largo room or hall which vaa
exhausted in the same fashion t

                    andover hants england

  of course by using a small veaael it la not at
all possible to determine without accurate instru-
ments the exact cause of the revolvers kick but
it can be done the kick will come al the very in-
atant of firing not when the gases have escaped
from the barrel of ihe revolver by delicate time
measuring devices the very instant of the kick can
be compared with the swinging of the revolver due
to the eases the latter motion we believe would
be more erratic than a simple kirk for the gasses
on striking the wall would spread immediately
throughout the entire vessel-editor

   at  feet below sea level a submarine
would encounter n pressure on it from the water of
practically  pounds per square inch although
metala are now known that stand such stresses in
tension or compression it is to be doubted if they
can stand them as n buckling stress which would
ho acting on the submarine it is probable that if
the submarines walls were made thick enough to
stand this terrific pressure the weight of the sub-
marine would bo so great that it could not even
float on the surface certainly no glass or other
material to be used for observation windows could
stand this pressure the glass would probably be-
come liquid under the pressure and begin to flow

  	for use within the earths atmosphere the bul-
let-shaped rocket vehicle would certainly be superior
to tho spherical for the resistance of the air would
be a minimum but outside the atmosphere where
air resistance does not exist and where maneuver-
ability and stability are the important factors the
spherical form would undoubtedly bo superior

the velocity of light

editor science question and answers

  will you kindly answer the following questions
that have been puzzling met

  	ib the speed of light altered by traveling
through the atmosphere

  	do electromagnetic waves travel at the same
speed as light wavest

   itesearches that have been made on the speed
of light indicate that its velocity in air is practically
though not exactly equal to ita velocity in a vacuum
the famous experiments of professor michelaon of
the university of chicago were aimed at determining
the velocity of light as accurately as possible and
the figure found in  was  miles per sec-
ond experiments that have been carried out indicate
that the velocity of light becomes smaller as the
medium that it passes through becomes more dense
thus the velocity through water is less than through
air this variation is just the opposite of that of
sound which seems to travel faster through a denser
medium

  at present professor michelson is working on an
experiment which will probably be the most exact-
ing that the world lias seen for the determination
of a new and more accurate value of the velocity of
light he is constructing a mile-long tunnel com-
pletely evacuated of air through which the beams of
light whose velocity la to be measured will pass
when hie experiment is completed we should have an
almost exact value for the velocity of light in vacuo

  	light itself is an electromagnetic wave just as
are the x-ray the radio wave the ultra-violet etc
the velocities of the other electromagnetic waves that
is other than light vary from the velocity of light
very little the generally accepted value for all of
them is  miles per seoond thus a radio
wave will travel around the earth in less than
- econd-and if a man were addressing an audi-
ence before him and speaking into a tnicrophonc
simultaneously a listener at a radio receiver on the
other side of the earth would hear the speakers
voice before a person in the audience a hundred feet
away from the speaker could hear him-editor

 editor wonder stories

     the current issue of wonder stories is cer-
 tainly tho best in a lone time if there is to be a
 poorest story in it and all are far above your recent
 level it would be either francis fluggs synthetic
 alonster or ed earl repps from out of tins
 karth probably the latter marcliioni is good but
 his sketch went quite far to spoiling hepps story

   here is a question-a pretty technical one-that
 was aroused by dr breuers two time traveling stories
 published some time ago the three lorentz-fitzger-
 ald contraction equations are

a l-xyti

 c

l

 btv vi
  c 

 icim

 tn

vtf

   where i t and m are tho length time and mass of
 a body at rest and l t and m an- the corresponding
 figures for the body at velocity v c is the velocity
 of light	

    he dealt with velocities v near tho speed of light so
 that thousand of centuries became a few moments to
 those in the time traveling ship ho furthermore used
 a photon ship so that only tho men in it would bo
 affected by the increase in mass now for the ques-
 tion i hope some one can answer it for i am not

 at all clear on the matter	

   equation c shows that the inertial mass of any
 body will approach infinity with velocities approaching
 that of light now will the gravitational mass become
 infinite alsot what if any is tho relation between
 gravitational and inertial massf

   the reason for my question is qnite apparent at
 the velocity of light the inertia of any body will bo in-
 finite it cannot bo accelerated by any force but sup-
 pose it became infinite gravitationally  try to itnag-
 ino tho effect of an infinite gravitational mass let loose
 in the stellar universe i the result should offer a per-
 fect synonym for nnnihilatimi and an anfwcr to tho
 old teaser of irresistible force ttho infinite gravitational
 attraction exerted on and by every body in the uni-
 verse meeting an immovable body with infinite in-
 ertia it would be quite effectively the end of all
 creation it would collapse space-time to a point in no
 time at all then blow it out to infinity with the force
 of exploding matter it would be one glorious finale-
 and it probably wouldnt happen for  have a feeling
 that tho gravitational mass of a body would not
 change i would like to have dr breuers opinion

    am certainly glad to see r f starzl in your
 popes for to me at least he has become one of the fin-
 est figures in science fiction his command of at-
 mosphere and plot-all the things hint make good stor-
 ies-is supreme and more life-like than even cum-
 mings between them they lead the field of those
 who make fiction rnther than technical detail their bas-
 is they conceal their science like the girders support
 and shape a skyscraper in the frame of their story
 and build strongly aliout it

    in brief they are good

   now that the science correspondence cluli ib firmly
 established with laboratory brunchc springing up 
 library and a museum started and active work pro-
 gressing in all directions we hope to be able to become
 international in our scope wo want foreign mem-
 bers and even more than that wo want foreign branch-
 es units in themselves for when it is justified each
 country will have its director its representative in our
 governing body even as the united states is divided
 now at present a foreign member moy not hold nf-



  ficc but as soon as our members in other parts of tho
  world amount to a reasonable percentage of the tota 
  that will cbuiige at leust to a degree we hope it will
  bo noon

   if any foreign reader of wonder stories wants
 to join or would merely like to correspond with some
 congenial person before deciding ou membership i
 will do all i can to help him

   moreover we would like to hear of the work of
 organizations like the ilford science literary circle
 mentioned in the march number whether ihey are
 basically literary or scientific our interests aro wide
 and i hope representative and we wish every fortune
 to those who are trying to popularize science and
 science fiction in england and elsewhere

                        foreign director s c c

                        ten broeck st

                        scotia new york

    we have forwarded mr millers stimulating letter
  to dr breuer and will publish nu answer if dr
  breuer wishes in the june issue ieaowbile wo in-
  vite the comments of our readers on the perplexing
  problem offered

    we offer the following tentative suggestion since
  the inertia of o body increases with the mass then tho
  energy necessary to increase its velocity continually
  grows larger ok its mass aud velocity increase in
  other words we assumed by tho newtonian laws that
  to increase the velocity of a body by a given amount
  required a fnrco proportionate only to the increased
  velocity for the mass was assumed as oonstant now
  since the mass increases with the velocity the force
  necessary to increase its velocity becomes larger as the
  velocity grows

    therefore os tlm velocity approaches the speed of
  light and the mass approaches infinity the forcc neces-
  sary to still fnrther increase its velocity is also becom-
  ing infinite  therefore the situation necessarily cor-
  rects itself if there were an infinite force then it
  could cause a body to reach the speed of light sinfce
  no infinite force exists the velocity becomes limited by
  its own increasing mass and therefore in increasing
  inertia

    the science correspondence club which we under-
 stand has boeonie the international scientific society
 has our best wishes for its career and the spread of
 its good work-editor

to create anti-war sentiment we plead guilty to tho
belief that we should not say uufih hush when the
quohtion of war is mentioned ior hush liush wo

to be dramatic but only succeeds in becoming ridicu-

editor tvoider stories

   perhaps this letter doesnt deserve n place in your
 reader speaks- column as i am not planning to
 throw any brick bats or bouquets i will however
 get something off my mind that ive been thinking
 about for some time

   a short time ago i noticed a full page article in ft
 tocal newspaper the title read as follows all
 aboard for the moon in  the author
 was frank cjarlyn i imagine that a title like this
 would catch and hold the eye of almost everyone aud
 it certainly did mine as i am somewhat of a bear
 for articles which deal with interplanetary travel
 that is i devour everything i can get hold of which
 might enlighten entertain or what have you now
 curiously enough perhaps the part of this title which
 attracted my attention first was the flrt four figures
   one hundred and nineteen years from now
 is this man trying lo toil us that interplanetary travel
 wont become a reality until 

   the editors may snicker at this and so may many
f the readers ii they art fortunate enough to read
this but i actually bad hope that someday i might
roam through the vast stretches of interplanetary space
might even be among the first to se foot on our near-
est neighbor the moon silly-isnt it still sillier
-i think oven after rending that article to hope that
i shall have tho chanco yet

   just why mr editor should it take  years to
develop tho rocket ship mr curlyn stated that this
was the only way known of reaching the moon that
deserved consideration to a point where interplane-
tary travel will become a reality i realize there
arc mnny difficulties however many attempts will
undoubtedly be made before a ship ib built which will
successfully span the gap which separates us from the
lunar orb the article btated that a speed of 
miles an hour must be attnined before travel to the
moon is attempted porhaps loooo miles per hour
is not so far awav as some think it seems to me that
i heard of a gentleman dr r ii goddard who in-
vented a fuel which would -eject gases at a rale of

	feet per second about  miles per minute
or  miles per hour not exactly crnwline is it

   thu author of tho article stated that those living in
 this generation were asking too much of science to
 eea interplanetary travel although that didnt upset
 my hopes it made them sort of groggy asking too
 much of science-well wall

   thirty years ago if you had spoken suriouhlv of
spanning the atlantic in jn airplane non stop flight
talking to a ship a thousand miles at sea by radio-
phone from your home sitting in your parlor and

 the awkward zcpt will have passed nut of existence
 as being toil slow and clumsy-also dangerous i then
 why mr editor would it be asking too much of
 scienco to see interplanetary travel in  or 
 one tiling it seems to me is quite evident thai
 when nooo miles per hour bv rocket planes does be-
 come a reality it will be due to the efforts of german
 hiventor like von opel that will be nice wont it i
 rliat is unless american scientists take more interest

    mr lawtons desire to roam interplanetary spaces
 is not at all silly and if it ia then hundrads of thou-
 sands of men and women are equally silly from tlio
 letters we receive and opinions we hourthe desire to
 explore new lands and see new sights resides in the
 hearts of all persons with a spark of imagination 
 however we must temper our enthusiam with enn-
 tion conquering the interplanetary spaces is no sim-
 ple problem such as building a machine to fly in tho
 earths atmosphere the problem is one of a new or-
 der dealing with the great spuces with tremendous
 distances and tremendous velocities the velocity nee
 essary to fully escape from the earth is  raileb per
 second or nearly  miles per hour we must
 deal with huge quantities of the most powerful and
 explosive of fuels we must provide equipment to exist
 in interstellar space and possibly to exist on the hos-

    this in my first lelter to you but not the last

 horrible fate i

    first i wish to reply to the letter of miss carmen
 mccable which appeared in the august  issue
 though of the same age as miss carmen i do not see
 why she should object to supor-steam-shovels and
 twenty-foot ants these things are not impossible
 also at nny moment the earth is liable to be pounced
 upon by a people from another world perhaps for
 superior lo us in brainpower and t-o defend ourselves
 in such a crisis our authors must go on conceiving
 so many different ways of making a kill for scien-
 tists to work upon what kick she asks does
 one get out of reading a lot of numbers  i reply

 i i am an ardent reader of your discussion columns
 and have n puzzling question to ask

    in the march issue your illustration of the rocket
  principle-the sketch ofthe gun beiug discharged in a
  vacuum jar-you have the gun suspended in tho cen-
  ter of the jar liy a string

    now admitting that the recoil or rookoi principle
  causes the gun to move as soon as the recoil force
  lias been spont the gun will return to us original posi-
  tion iu tho jar now what causes this return you
  bay gravity but the gun is in a vacuum or sus-
  peded in absolute nothingness then what medium
  does gravity act through in order to act upon the
  gun

    or comparing it with magnetism-will magnetism
 iftct through  vacuum wo have a steel pin a
 vafcuum jar will a magnet in that jar attract tho
 pin i yes-but through what medium-for a vac-
 uum is nothingness

    the question that mr lord puts is one of llio
 most puzzling to science we know that electromag-
 netic energy reached ua across a vacuum of inter-
 planetary and interstellar space scientists felt for
 a time that a medium was necessary to permit the
 travel of this energy and the etherwas invented-
 the ether being assumed as material which pene-
 trated all spaco and all other material but tho
 ether theory has practically broken down aud we are
 again forced to search for a reason why emptiness
 can be bridged by energy if electromagnet ism were
 the emanation of miuute particles of energy and if
 all material bodies sources of gravitation emanated

what can a girl know

editor wonder stories

   practically nil of your letters i noticed -were from
 mm wbo obviously stand nlono in their interest in
 seienco and i suppose they will nay pooh i wliat enn
 u girl know about science i ocrrcct i dont know a
 darn thing or rather  didnt

   when i first purchased one of your magazines
purely out of curiosity i had absolutely no knowledge
whatsoever of the scientific world my curiosity led
me into a truly delightful realm

   on he surface the stories appear  bo stuff and
 nonsense but throughout all ihi-re is a foundation of
 sound reasoning coupled with present day facis t have
 had no education beyond junior high school but due to
 your woni kk stories  have gained sufficient knowl-
 edge of any subject in science to hold my own with
 others whohave had the advantage of more schooling
 than i	 

    the so-called slush is perfectly alright ard although i
 do not eare for too much of it myself i see no reason
 for vour not continuing it for those that do

 blame for its fermenting and turning into wine i drink

 she must recall madame curie who gave to the world
 its first real knowledge of radium

   many of the successful researches in modern day
astronomv have been worked out by women and al-
though they have done nothing spectacular to earn
th-ni first page newspaper space their work lias been
extremely necessary in solving many of the difficult
astronomical problems	

   it is safe lo say that the future will see an in-
creasing number of women engaged in science and
making contributions of real value we hope anti
believe that many of them will acquire their first
interest and taste for science and get their firbt reali-
zation of the tremendous adventure of science through

  radiation in intertellar space

editor woxder stories

   due to the fact that i just received my january in-
 ane this letter is reaching you two months late

   i disagree with your statement that a person would
 freeze solid aud not explode out in empty space
 through experiment i have found that  vacuum ia
 the best means of retaining heat in a body an ev-
 ery day example is the thermos bottle the liquid is
 surriiundcd bv a vacuum to prevent conduction of the
 heat conduction is the main factor in the loss of
 heat in space that is done away with

   radiation then is the remaining factor i will cite
 an experiment to show that not enough radiation
 takes place to cool he radiating body quickly i con-
 nected two christmas tree bulbs those coming eight
 in a set in series with a twenty five watt lamp and
 the house current then the glass of one bulb was
 broken leaving the uninjured filament exposed the
 other bulb was for a cheek when llie current was
 tlirned cn the broken bulb did not light but the whole
 one did and so did the twenty-five watter tho rea-
 son the broken bulb did not fuse or oxidize was that
 the air around ihe filament conducted tho bent away
 fat enough to keep the filament barely warm this
 was ascertained when tho lips were placed over tho
 filament and a small current of warm air was felt

   my deductions were that the whole bulb lit because
 of he rarity of the air in it and because it was not
 radiating enough heat to cool the filament

   tho same applies to a human body in space the
heat is constantly being replenished by chemical ac-
tion my opinion is that the body would not radiate
enough bent to freeze the body tt is possible on
the contrary that a person might become overheated
but having no fans i cannot say

   a recentsurvey conducted liv the american inter-
planetary society on the question of radiation of heat
from a human body in interstellar space revealed tho
startling fact that the body would lose only - degree
vahvenheit of temperature each minute it was dis-
covered also that a ten degree drop in temperature of
the whole body was necessary to kill the body thus
permitting a half hour of exposure to the absolute
zero of space this discovery seems to upset general-
ly held beliefs and is in conformity with the beliefs
expressed by our correspondent the experiment with
the clectric bulbs mentioned by mr osofsky is an in-
teresting verification of this-editor

near to disintegration

editor woxder stories

   i wish to say a word nltouc the letter of victor a
endersby which you published in the -unrcb issue

   the fine way in which he dealt with a very diffi-
cult subject is worthy of special mention and praise
i happen to be in a position in this community to
know much of the troubles of my people and  un-
hesitatingly say that in every cose so far where i
linve known oi divorce separation or serious marital
difficulties tho matter csn be or has been traced
directly back to tho excessive ust of the life organs
by one or other of the parties involved nearly all
of l he other difficulties have been directly traceable
to that

   it is well known that too much of anything is not
good for humanity whether it be food clothes or en-
joyment the principle is equally true of sex acti-
vities continence and  clean mind bring with them
n zest for life and on enjoyment that is unkown to
those habitually using their life forces for self-gratifi-
cation to excess

  i may add that there is another custom connected
with this question thut to my mind unquestionably
has much to do with disillusion in married life and
unsatisfactory married life aud unsatisfactory mar-
ried relations i refer to the obscene story to ob-
scenity in conversation and the manner in which ob-
scenity has fastened its blackened hooks upon so
many of tho ideals that are truest and best in life

   trulv it is time we were awakening to the fact that
self control in sex matters and pure beautiful ideals
consistently upheld will do more than anything el bo
to re-establish the american home which is so peril-
ously near to disintegration

                     lysite wyoming

  our correspondent makes here a smashing indict-
ment againrt married life the letter of mr enders-
by has created quite some comment and the attitudo of
most correspondents is similar to that published in
this letter the question is of such importance that
it deserves thorogoing study we maintain labora-
tories to study the sex life of the androsipbila fly in
the liopo of obtaining valuable information that may
be of use ultimately to man but we hesitate to go
to tho fountain of information-the sex life of man
himself but future generations may realize that man
is building o lop-sided civilization if he investigates
only tho nature of inanimate of or non-human things
nnd stops short at the threshold of the most important
object to him in the universe-himself-editor

history repeats itself

editor wonder stories

   by far the best short story that has appeared in this
magazine during the past few months was edmond
hamiltons powerful nnd gripping account of the
man who evolved in the april issue not only was
tho story exceptionally interesting to read but it
possessed one of the major attributes of all good rcience
fiction-it sat the reader to thinking

  lust what data the future hold for man is he
destined to evolve into a mighty brain a vast intel-
lect omniscient and omnipotent but devoid of all
sentiment all emotion all that is human-as wo
understand it today truly the picture that ham-
ilton paints of future man is fearful yet fascinating
at once desirable and repellent

   but hamilton goes even further and suggests that
mankind will ultimately revert to the protoplasmic
slimo from which ho rose thus completing a natural

fortune teller do this

 editor wonder stories

   being ft charter subscriber to your most excellent
 innguzine and having been forced to go through the
 agonies of rending the time traveling stories you insist
 upon publishing i feel compelled to enter upon the
 discussion of this subject

   taking the view that time is like a river and that
 all the event that have ever happened or shall ever
 jiappen lie along ijs banks isnt it perfectly obvious
 that time traveling never can or never will be accom-
 plished considering that no one from the future has
 ever traveled back to u

   this to me would indicate that in all the ages yet
 io come no ono bus ever invented a time machine
 therefore time traveling will never bo accomplished by
 man some enthusiast may say that our time traveler
 misped our day and age but i maintain that if such
 an event had token place at aov time in the past it
 would have taken a very prominent place in our folk
 legends

   ill retract my above remarks to this extent-that
 if time traveling is ever accomplished it will not be
 lo the extent of being ablo to establish physical con-
 tact with the peoples of the age traveled to that is
 ridiculous our traveler will have to be content with
 what he can see and fortune tellers have professed
 to be able to do this for centuries

                        w st st

                        cleveland ohio

   mr prabst it seems refutes his own argument
 for if time travelers remained unknown to the age
 they visited there would be no records to indicate
 that they appeared in our midst at any time in the

 past polk legends have certainly in various nations
 spoken of almost every conceivable thing as having
 happened if they are to be believed mr prabst is

 right in hinting that fortune telling is a form of time
 traveling no doubt an occasional fortune teller does
 have an intuition and makes a remarkably corroct
 guess in reading the future life of a subject we
 have no evidence to indicate that is more than a
 guess-editor

 by common consent de maupassant
   ha become first rank among the
   naturalistic school 

    the literary perfection of his work is

    he remains and trill remain a master
    of style a man of the art of tala

    the value of his work lies in his as-

    lets have a lot more from mr repp too his
from out o the earth was the best short story
in tho issue

  for n long time ive bad an idea or a new type
of contest for our magazine here it is and 
think youll like it readers  hope no at least a
rogular stf story ib published in one issue with an
illustration and remarks on il by tho editor the
namr and photo o the author being omitted the
contest is that the reuders submit letters of five hun-
dred words or less for instance slating why they
think the story was written by edmond hamilton or
somo other author i think it would be interesting
to see how well we know our authors each always
has some little characteristic that is possessed by
himself alone what do you think ol it readers

  the boys scientifiction club now has a senior

marks an epoch

editor wonder stojiies

  tho current april issue of wonoer stories marks
an epoch in the history of science fiction for six
months tho mugazino has been steadily progressing to
an unsurpassable point bach issue eclipses the pre-
ceding ones and what is more every story is writ-
ten by a headliner i can hardly conceive of any
further improvements the magazine as it stands to-
day is my ideal of the perfect mag

  but one thing i sincerely hope that yon will not
contemplate discontinuing the book reviews they are
the only means that i have of keeping in touch with
science fiction novels i have-followed many of their
recommendations and i have certainly not gone amiss

  now for n general criticism of this months stories
in the emperor of the stars schachner and zagat
have once more outdone themselves these versatile
authors are making science fiction history

  tho return from jupiter is an appropriate sequel
to its predecessor i consider mr edwards one of
your most talented authors although he writes spar-
ingly ho has the ability to produce a masterpiece each
time

  why doesnt someone construct a cross-word puzzle
based on science fiction it could be solved by those
well verssd in the famous storios authors and heroes

                      mortimer wcisingor

                       van corllandt ave

                    bronx n y

  its too bad that we have reached the unsnrpassable
point that gives us nothing to look  forward to-
except a brick-bat wo must constantly have the in-
centive of a new goal to reach

  for mr weisingers information we understand
that science publications is providing a means for
science fiction lovers to obtain the famous science
novels an advertisement of tbis will appeal- in
this issue of wonder stories for lovers of the
stones of gawuin edwards and the schaehner and
zagat team we anticipate having home news soon of
some new stories that will delight our readers

  tho cross-word puzzle idea is intriguing if one of
our readers sent in a good one wo would be inclined
to print it-editor

quayles invention by john taine
  pages stiff cloth covers size x
 published by e p dutton and company
 new york price 

  john taine u the pseudonym adopted by  rather
well-known american professor of mathematics mr
taine is no doub on excellent scientist hut lie is no
less a master of exciting adventures tho preseit
volume for sustained drimn and tremendous narra-
tive power is one of his best

   to the reviewer the first chapters detailing lie ex-
periences of a young inventor marooned on n iil -alc
and lifeless island by an avaricious banker -for th

sood of humanity are among the best iu the hook
luayles invention has been deemed by the banker
of such tremendous power that quayle would almost
automatically if allowed to produce it became ilt
ruler of the planet such a man iu the banker s op-
inion must be done away with and quayle is left
with several months supplies on a sun-scorched island
in the south pacific bui quayle struggles through
aud returns to civilization to upset the plans of tho
banker to uso his invention for predatory ends

   peculiar to mr tainus method no real clue of the
nature of the invention is giveu until the story is iu
its last phases tantalizingly mr taine bints at tha
power and scope of it but its real nature remains iu
the background of the story a terrible monster of insns
mind an abortive creation of the human brain pos-
sessed of unlimited powers for good or evil

   as in all of tainus stories the human motif is never
submerged the couflict of human beings working
out their hates jealousies greeds and lusts take equal
part in his stories with the play of cosmic forces
hoth science and human plot are blended by taino
into an irresistible combination the present volumo
is enthusiastically recommended

in the beginning by alan sullivan
 stiff cloth covers size v x  published
 by e p dutton and company new york
 price 

   much of ihe purpose of science fiction is fulfilled in
the portraying of two widely different types of civili-
zatiou coming into contact and perhaps into conflict
with each other civilization we know has been
made possible by science or control over nature and
it is interesting and stimulating to read of the inter-
actions of man clothed with science and civilization
met face to face with his unclothed brethren for
then ho can say there but for the grace of scieuce
goes myself

   mr sullivan presents such a dramatic situation in
this volume when he bring an expedition of scientists
to south america to investigate the existence there of
an area still in the pleistocene stage of evolution tho
expedition finds not only prehistoric animals-tha
saber-toothed tiger the mastodon the glyplodont and
others hut also pleistocene men and women who speak
in clucks and have never heard of fire

   to portray such a situation needs great skill and
considerable imagination ytet mr sullivan achieves
his effects remarkably easy so it seems the reader
is constantly in a daze of wonder as he tries to as-
sociate these prehistoric men with the cultured scien-
tists who have sought them out it seems impossible
to us that we had once been as they throughout
the story is woven an excellent though not too orig-
inal plot but it helps to sustain tho interest and givo
our author the canvas on which to paint this moat
tremendous drama of interracial couflict

 the gambler

    he gambles that a lucky break  will
    come to him in the courte of time

most men live in the hope that their lucky break will
come tomorrow or next week or next year

they gamble that fate same day some way will make 
them rich they risk their whole lives on what may come to
them in the course of time

    thia is a worse form of gambling than gambling for
money with a card sharp or a three shell game expert

    gambling on what time and fate have in store tor you
u more costly than any other form of gambling known

    you lose more than money you lose your self-
respect you lose the self-respect of those about you

    and as each year passes your chance to amount to any
thing becomes slimmer and slimmer

     you get discouraged you begin to feel that fate is against
you you complain secretly about your ill luck perhaps you hide
your shortcomings behind a whole flock of easy excuses

     but the hard cold world doesnt care about you

    youre got to look out for yourself

     time alone cannot help you if it could every man over
 would be rich

     you cannot count on luck or fate or circumstances if you
could everybody would get rich at some time or other

     your life is too precious to waste away waitind for some
thing to turn up

    theres one sure way-yes only one sure way-to
jet what you want out of life

     nothing can help you but your own brain make your brain
just a little bit more effective and you will multiply your
earning power

     there is no limit to what the human brain can accomplish
scientists and psychologists tell us we use only about ten per
cent of our brain power ninety per ccnt is unused it lies
dormant the longer it is unused the harder it becomes for us
to use it for the mind is like a muscle it grows in power
through exercise and use it weakens and deteriorates with
idleness

    what can you do about it that is the question you are
asking yourself hen is a suggestion

tion whatever you need not spend another penny
