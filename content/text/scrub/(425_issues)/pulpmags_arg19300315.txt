wouldnt it be great if we could buy
muscles by the bag - take them home
and paste them on our shoulders then
our rich friends with money to buy them sure
would be socking us all over the lots

  but they dont come that easy fellows if
you want muscle you have to work for it
thats the reason why the lazy fellow never
can hope to be strong so if youre lazy and
dont want to work-you had better quit right
here this talk was never meant for you

full inch yes and ld tyo inches to your chest in the
tame length of time but units nothing vve only

pulmonary cavity with oxygen this will load your
blood with red corpuscles shooting life and vitality
throughout your entire system im going to give yoii

every inner muscle as well toning up your liver

to those who think
  learning music is hard-

perhaps you think that tak-
ing music lessons is like tak-
ing a dose of medicine it isnt
any longer

 as far as youre concerned
the old days of long practice
hours with their horrid scales
hard-work exercises and ex-
pensive personal teachers fees
are over and done with

 you have no excuses-no
alibis whatsoever for not mak-
ing your start toward musical
good times now

  for through a method that re-
moves the boredom and extravagance
from musical lessons you can now
learn to play your favorite instru-
ment entirely at home-without a pri-
vate teacher-in half the usual time-
at a fraction of the usual cost

  just imaginea method that has
made the reading and playing of music
so downright simple that you dont
have to know one note
from another to begin

  do you wonder that
this remarkable way of
learning music has al-
ready been vouched for
by over a half-million
people in all parts of
the world 

 easy as can be

  the lessons come to
you by mail from the
famous u s school of
music they consist of
complete printed in-
structions diagrams
and all the music you
need you study with
a smile one week you
are learning a dreamy
waltz-the next you are

mastering a stirring march

as the lessons continue
they prove easier and easi-
er for instead of just scales you are
always learning to play by actual
notes the classic favorites and the
latest syncopation that formerly you
only listened to

 and youre never in hot water
first you are told how a thing is
done then a picture	you how

then you do it yourself and hear it
no private teacher could make it
clearer or easier

  soon when your friends say please
play something you can surprise
and entertain them with pleasing mel-
odies on your favorite instrument
youll find yourself in the spotlight-
popular everywhere life at last will
have its silver lining and lonely hours
will vanish as you play the blues
away

 new friends better times

  if youre tired doing the heavy look-
ing-on at parties-if always listening
to others play has almost spoiled the
pleasure of music for you-if youve
been envious because they could en-
tertain their friends
and family-if learning
music has always been
one of those never-to-
come-true dreams let
the time-proven and
tested homestudy meth-
od of the u s school
of music come to your
rescue

  dont be afraid to be-
gin your lessons at
once over half a mil-
lion people learned to
play this modern way
-and found it easy as
a-b-c forget that
old-fashioned idea that
you need special tal-

joe played for sue dayton alone in that
circus broadcast

  caged

joe barry was a captive of the city he had tried to conquer nor could he

             guess the amazing turn his captivity was to take

       by courtney ryley cooper

chapter i

a prisoner of the slums

there seemed to be a new sullen
note about the roar of the l
trains that joe barry never be-
fore had heard the cobblestones be-
neath that ancient bellowing structure
appeared slimier as he crouched behind
a scaly iron pillar to let a truck rumble

past with a double glance up and
down the tunnel-gray recesses he ran
across the street car tracks to the pro-
tection of another pillar huddled
there glanced swiftly again and leaped
for the curbing joe barry a country
lad at heart hated new york

  there were reasons of course one
of them made itself apparent in his
clothing much lighter in color and


caged



weight at the elbows and knees than in
the rest of its texture his suit was
that peculiarly colorless gray so often
selected by those who purchase with
the idea of durability paramount his
hat also gray except for the dark
marks of perspiration had been out of
shape long enough to assume a block
of its own his shoes were unshined
just as his suit long had been un-
pressed

  there was however a different
bagginess about it from that of the
clothing of other third avenue habit-
ues theirs were out of shape merely
from lack of the iron joe barrys
clothing possessed deep creases and
manifold wrinkles such imprints as
could only result from having dried on
the body after a thorough soaking

  in the young mans lapel buttonhole
was the limp discolored remains of a
field flower crossing east seven-
teenth street before the traffic he no-
ticed the withered bloom and with a
quick gesture threw it away

  the movement was impulsive the
one which followed was equally so
joe barry turned his head for an in-
stant and looked back to where the
dead flower lay in the path of truck
and taxi it was only a glance like
some one saying good-by too awk-
wardly to show emotion then the
young fellow hurried on again dark
eyes centered upon an objective half-
way down the block

a misshapen three-story
frame building stood there its
ill-painted clapboard front con-
ferring a queer sort of comparative
dignity to the dingy red-brick tene-
ments which squeezed it from each
side

  this old place had no placards in the
windows a second-hand store on the

street level only added to its air of dis-
habille  a warped door at one side an-
nounced faintly the word  lodg-
ings

  into this doorway joe barry turned
and moved swiftly up the creaking
stairway halting however at the first
landing a dim figure had shown it-
self groping about the dusky hallway

   whereve you been the lodger
complained  a hell of a note this is
-six oclock and no beds made-

  joe barrys features took on a deep-
er tone of harassed grimness  oh
dry up he said in a tired voice

  then he went to the third floor and
unlocked the door leading to his mock-
ery of a room-a frayed piece of dirty
chinese matting on the wide-cracked
floor a bed such as it was a wash-
stand and its accouterments bearing
the black check-marks of age there
was a chair also half hidden by a
scant burden of clothing and a bu-
reau from which the veneering had
ballooned in large patches once in
the room joe barry slumped to the
bed his features flaccid except for one
particular his eyes

  dark deep wistfully alert they
stared beyond the tawdry things about
him as if looking upon vistas of glori-
ous contentment but after a time the
look vanished the eyes hardened as
if with protective intent his hands
peculiarly fine-fingered for the breadth
of them went upward to an awkward
smoothing of his dark hair

  youth had departed in a sudden ma-
turing process which made even twen-
ty-five an inadequate estimate of his
age finally he rose

   theyll all be squawking pretty
soon he mumbled  id better snap
into it

  he went down the steps then after
locking his room-mainly a gesture


argosy

since it contained so little soon to
the complaints of the early arrivals he
was at his work-the cleaning up of
the box-like rooms a dab at sweeping
the making of cot-like beds

  this job was a side line which meant
free lodging for looking after the
twelve rooms whidt the rickety build-
ing contained he was in fact a sort
of agent chambermaid and scrub-man
for a shiftless owner who never
troubled himself to appear unless joe
should be late with his weekly collec-
tions then a greasy unkempt man
would hobble over from his miserly
quarters on east fourteenth street
cursing the unreliability of the present
generation

  more roomers came home stumbling
up the worn steps and instantly began
their complaints joe barry turned his
head

   give a guy time he snapped

   time  asked a protesting voice
 how much time do you want  these
rooms ought to be made up by noon
you aint even touched mine yet

  another lodger joined the quarrel

   you werent here last night

  oh yeah asked joe barry
surlily

   oh yeah what a joint this is a
lousy miser for a landlord and an ac-
cordion player for a chambermaid

  then every one laughed while joe
barry stood and scowled one hand
beating slowly into the palm of the
other at last his shoulders slumped
and he went silently back to his work
a silence which continued in spite of
complaining and of taunts until his
last job was done

with a sudden new air of hurry
he went to his room shaved
with cold water changed to the
less shabby suit which hung over the

chair and drew from beneath the bed
an oblong case of battered black a
moment later he wras on the street
bound for his work of the night

  he walked nickels were precious
long ago he had convinced himself
that a wralk from third avenue and
sixteenth street to below washington
square was good for a fellow some-
times he strolled looking in windows
to-night however he all but ran his
arm ached from its burden and he was
out of breath when at last he reached
louie bertolinis italian restaurant
on the fringe of greenwich village

  a loose-featured waiter slumped on
his hips hands limply clasped behind
his back rolled his eyes toward the
stairs joe barry knew him as full-
house sometimes they called him
kendall

   upstairs for you he said then
in reply to a swift question  louie
he aint come in yet at that he
grinned  youll know when he gets
here

  joe nodded acknowledgment to the
information and started toward a stair-
way leading from the main dining
room the place could be matched a
thousand times in new york made-
over rooms from an old residence
small square tables with imitation
flowers in cheap vases on limp damp
linen a telephone booth in the hallway
joe barry knew it so well that the
slightest deviation wras arresting he
halted at the stairway

  when did he get the radio he
asked

   las night when you never
showed up said full-house and on
his flat feet moved away but joe
barry remained at the bottom of the

               m

stairs looking with something of fright
at the unobtrusive brown cabinet and
its connection wire leading to a light


caged

                     



socket the instrument was quietly
prophetic

  a few persons were upstairs and
waiters moved - abstractedly about
louie bertolinis restaurant was a
straight joint there was no incentive
of liquor to promote the service de-
rived from heavy tips joe barry made
his way hastily to an old storeroom at
the rear and opened the black box an
accordion of the cheapest professional
kind lay within he brought it forth
and bent to receive its strap then he
went forth to his job of the night
 playing the tables

  it was only ordinary music accom-
plished without interest and received
in the same manner no one looked up
no one applauded joe barry with his
tired features and the grim lines at the
corners of his lips was merely a part
of the place to be accepted along with
the damp linen and imitation flowers as
a penalty for the cheapness of the fare

  he played softly sometimes he
played so softly that the tones could
not be heard above the conversation
and clatter of dishes at such mo-
ments he seemed to forget his sur-
roundings and a wistful light would
come to his eyes

  often too during these abstracted
periods such waiters as were idle
would saunter closer and listen with
idly cocked heads to a sort of music
different from joes usual offerings it
was only temporary there was a noise
from downstairs which needed drown-
ing the insistent voice of the radio
after a time however it ceased and
full-house shuffled up the stairs

   come on down he commanded
 the radios gone blooey

  joe barry obeyed wordlessly the
lower restaurant was crowded now
louis had arrived and was talking
noisily in his cubbyhole of an office

  after a long time the customers
thinned there was only a party of
four stringy-haired women from
greenwich village at the round center
table and a quietly dressed man who
dropped in nw and then joe noticed
that he sat as usual at a little table in
the right-hand corner of the room
where his back would be to the wall
and his eyes toward the door

  joe barry had thought nothing of
that the table was there many persons
sat at it the entertainers only inter-
est in fact had been primarily that
this man seemed different from the
usual clientele it had deepened how-
ever one night when on departing
the man had given him a dollar but
he had not been back since until to-
night

  the entertainer looked in his direc-
tion and smiling started toward him
-the advances that a friendless dog
or a friendless human instinctively
makes toward any one who even pre-
tends a kindness

just then the radio responded to the
tinkering of full-house and as if
on signal louie bertolini shiny-
haired dumpy his short arms swing-
ing out from his wide girth his short
legs striding rapidly came from his
office

   so you came back huh he asked
choppily  after you get over your
drunk you come back to louie

  barrys lips tightened

  you know i dont drink he said

    i know what they tell full-house
at the rooming place i know you
werent here i know you did not send
me some word you did not say  i am
sorry i am sick get another boy kiss
my foot where did you go

  joe barry swung his accordion to a
chair


argosy

   up by newburgh you wouldnt
understand

  you should want i wouldnt un-
derstand  why you should go by
newburgh

  joe fumbled at the accordion strap
 well its spring if youve got to
know

   and what of it i should believe
that where did you stay

  joe barry tightened his lips

   you wouldnt understand that
either i slept in a haystack

  louie bertolini opened wide his
mouth and made clawing motions at
his slick hair

  am i a fool he asked you
slept in a haystack you were out
here in new york with a cheecken
and you come back and tell me funny
stories

  the young man scowled

   ive told you the truth he
snapped  i know where i was i
can take you to a man who saw me
a farmer i tried to stay all night at
his place hell remember me i guess
i could find the farm came after a
pause  it was somewhere below orrs
mills there was a truck turned over
on a side road about a mile above it i
could go by that

  ha ha said louie bertolini it
wasnt a laugh-it was merely the two
ejectives uttered without expression
 i should go clear up to newburgh
to find out if you asked somebody to

stay all nighti should get along

without crazy people he added after
an instant then he pattered away
 go wherever you pliss after to-night
ive got a radio then over his shoul-
der   come back saturday and get

your pay

  there was no answer to make
there was nothing to do the four
stringy-haired women were leaving

their table the man in the corner had
asked for his check joe looked in his
direction and forced a broken smile

   i guess thats that he said the
man smiled in return then raised his
brows sharply joe obeyed the sum-
mons as the diner surveyed the room
quickly with a seemingly casual glance
of his dark blue eyes

   broke

    yes sir flat

   its tough he chewed at his
lower lip then he leaned closer
tell you what you do be at chris-
topher street and seventh avenue in
an hour just stand on the corner ill
pick you up in a car well take a little
ride together it might be something
that you cant afford to pass up

    yes sir

chapter ii

a strange escape

it was some time after the machine
had picked him up before joe barry
could pull himself out of his daze
he had not expected a limousine and
a chauffeur

  he hadnt noticed the car when it
had pulled swiftly up to him where he
waited other than that it was big and
rich and gleaming neither did he now
notice that the rear curtain was pulled
and that his benefactor sat well back
in his side of the seat so that no lights
fell upon him from the street for a
time there was silence then

  well since weve got to get ac-
quainted sooner or later im an attor-
ney tohn b martin  wall street
yes sir

  there was silence for a time it was
nearly midnight now traffic was light
the car eased swiftly along fifth ave-
nue across fifty-ninth street and into
caged



the park martin straightened and
leaned forward

   well boy he said  been in new
york long

   yes sir three years anyway it
seems a long time

   i guess that depends on how things
break whered you come from
missouri waverly its an old
town  the river my folks lived
about four miles from there

   still live there

   no sir theyre dead

   got lots of relatives around there
most country people have

  joe barry shook his head

  no sir we just sort of drifted
my dad was a farm tenant

 and so in a jam like youre in now
-broke and out of a job-theres no-
body you can really turn to that it
yes sir then suddenly ive
kind of lost heart here in new york
got you whipped well its done
a lot of them that way at last
why did you come here anyway
 i thought id set it on fire toe
barry said bitterly the other man
laughed

   didnt anybody tell you it was fire-
proof 

   everybody told me i could get rich
here interest had loosed the gates of
a taciturnity developed through the
long knowledge that nobody cared and
nobody wanted to know  i used to
play the accordion for dances around
waverly and everybody thought i was
great finally it got so they didnt want
the regular orchestra at all just me
then i sort of fixed up the dance hall
for special things you know id have
a halloween party with pumpkins and
all that and one for christmas and
new years and valentines

   i kept saving and everything and
finally i got a forty-eight base accor-

dion  thats a professional one its got
a piano keyboard but the real big
ones the kind they use on the stage
like phil baker they use the hundred
and twenty base-thats the little keys
you work with your left hand i can
play that kind too

   so they thought you were pretty
good around waverly said the other
man shifting the subject from lengthy
enthusiasm  then they kidded you
into coming to new york and when
you got here broadway told you to go
get a  rep is that it

   yes sir

   i guess i know the rest its old
stuff now youre out of a job no-
body cares what happens to you you
dont care much yourself do you

   no sir

   then how would you like to get
ten thousand dollars for a few years
work

joe barrys lips parted but he
said nothing even if he could have
thought of something to say there
would not have been the power to utter
it martin leaned closer

   ten grand as they say on broad-
way all youve got to do is keep quiet
and leave new york for a while
where to

  the man shrugged his shoulders
 oh up the river a piece as youd say
in missouri

  toe barry laughed thats what
got me into trouble just now-going
up the river a piece

   maybe it made you a lot of dough
how about that viewpoint  had a
good time did you

   i sure did joe chuckled  every
spring i just think ill go crazy here
in town so yesterday morning i woke
up early and i just didnt even stop to
consider i took all the money i had


argosy

and went out and caught a bus and got
off somewhere up around newburgh
i got away off on a side road and
found a crick there and fooled around
it until nearly dark all of a sudden a
rain came up gee i got soaked it
was kind of fun he added  still
it got me to thinking about what id
done

   the wide open spaces didnt look
so good eh

   oh it would have been all right
except that it kept on raining well i
got under a tree and waited a long time
until it stopped then i started out and
got off  another side road it must
have been after midnight before i came
back to the main highway i guess
there had been an accident there were
some red lights out and something
that looked like a truck turned over

   anybody around to tell what hap-
pened

   i dont know i thought afterward
that maybe i should have gone up
there in case any one was hurt-still
theyd put out red lights so people
must have been there i just kept on
until i saw a light in a farmhouse and
went up and asked if i could stay all
night the old fellow must not have
liked my looks he ran me away so
i sneaked over in a field and burrowed
into a haystack

  come into town this morning
asked martin the machine had
started upon a second circle of central
park

   no this afternoon i must have
been dog-tired i slept until after one
oclock finally when i did come out
some fellows were in a field in a
wagon they yelled and started after
me i heard one of them shouting to
the other about getting a gun and call-
ing the sheriff so you bet i ran joe
barry laughed  i guess farmers in

the east here are a lot different about
people getting into their fields from
what they are back home

   yes i suppose so martin lit a
cigarette holding his hands care-
fully about the lighter  outran
em though

   yes sir easy they didnt see
me again after i ducked into a little
grove i caught the bus about four
miles down the road joe barry
shifted suddenly  but here ive been
going on-

   quite all right it was very inter-
esting then at quick variance mar-
tin asked  i gather you havent a
sweetie here in new york

   no sir

   no girl youre crazy about or one
who is crazy about you

  the young man laughed

   no such luck mr martin why
 just thought id ask his voice
became more crisp  now about my
end of this affair as i told you im
an attorney now and then i am called
upon to represent persons who get into
trouble i have a case now a young
fellow i knew tried to beat the jones
law-transporting liquor you know
 i dont fool around liquor much
myself

   so i gathered that makes it all
the better a clean record you know

   yes sir said joe hazily

martin went on

 naturally my client doesnt
care to suffer the penalties its
largely a matter of circumstantial
evidence so we come to the point
how would you like to step into his
shoes

  there was a moment of waiting

   i dont think i understand 

   well i dont know how to make
it any plainer you give up your free-
caged



dom for a while-the jones law in it-
self you know isnt so bad courts
have the right to use their discretion
on first offenders its only the hard-
boiled ones who get the maximum five
years with time off for good behavior
my client cant afford to take the
 rap as they call it you can im
offering you ten thousand dollars to
do it

   but id go to prison the youths
voice carried a tremor martin met it
with matter-of-factness

  all right he answered well
suppose that you go to prison the
only things prisons accomplish are to
rob a man of his social position and
his freedom to make a living and give
him a sense of shame think that over
iyou havent any social position your
freedom doesnt make any difference
because youre a prisoner anyway
arent you a prisoner he asked
sharply  are you getting any sense
of freedom out of this life youre liv-
ing

  no sir its just a bed and three
meals a day

                                 r

   then youre caged in a way
there wouldnt be any shame because
a person must have something on his
conscience before he can feel sorry
for an act youre innocent that
leaves one more point the matter of
income suppose you had to do two
years youd have a roof over your
head three meals a day comparatively
kind treatment as long as you obeyed
the rules care in case of illness the
chance to play in the orchestra and be
a trusty  and besides that youd have
the knowledge that you were doing a
job for which you were being paid
nearly fourteen dollars a day sundays
and holidays included

  joe barry felt suddenly dizzy

   but how would i know-

   that you were to be treated
squarely the man drew a hand
from his pocket  lean forward and
count that-theres enough light from
the dash

  the dizziness increased joe barrys
fingers fumbled with the bills his lips
moved with audible undertones

   nine hundred and forty nine-
sixty nine-eighty a thousand

a fellow could do a lot with
ten times that much money
the voice beside him was say-
ing  whats a few years anyway
youre only about twenty-five

   but i wouldnt know what to do or
say id have to give myself up and
say id done things that they could
prove i didnt

   dont let that worry you all you
have to do is to refuse to answer any
and all questions thats no difficult
job well he asked quickly  do you
want to keep that money

  joe barry rubbed a hand across his
eyes

   i dont know id get everything
balled up oh it isnt that i care about
the-the other he broke forth sud-
denly  id as lief be dead as the way
ive been going

   there you are im handing you a
chance to trade a few years for a good
time all the rest of your life think it
over

   but- 

   kid the man leaned closer  that
word  but  has licked more men than
all the penitentiaries in the wrorld can
it look here he said  ill give you
to-night to think it over keep the
money come to louies to-mor-
row at noon if youre going to be
a welcher if not get yourself on a
morning train and hop out of town for
another days good time just look the


argosy

country over and see if it isnt worth
trading a few years for

   gee id like to barry leaned for-
ward still fingering the bills they
were his if he wanted them  but
theyd raise the devil over at the
house

  the lodgers you mean ill
handle that got a pass-key havent
you  give it to me ill have the chauf-
feur drop by and fix up the place for-
get that part of it youll get your in-
structions when you come back from
the country to-morrow night dojit
worry about that

   but when should i be back
martins vague form moved jerkily
-a shrugging of the shoulders

   suit yourself he said  be back
at your room some time around mid-
night ill probably be waiting for you
if im not there right on the dot youll
hear from me within a few minutes

an hour later joe barry stood
 trembling in his gaslit room

     one sweating hand was clasped
about the heavy roll of bills in
his trousers pocket what were
a few years to a young fel-
low a person had to get a start
in life somehow-and that would be
better than half starving-half starv-
ing and being caged up here in the city
in a room like this

  a late l train roared past shaking
the old building a truck clattered and
back-fired on the cobblestoned street
below joe barry spread the certifi-
cates out before him one beside the
other until they covered the entire
center of his bed there would be nine
times this many more put to his credit
wherever he should say

  ten thousand dollars would buy a
little business maybe a music store
and a home in some small town start

him up in life where he could amount to
something

  after a long time he counted the
bills again then with a feeling of
great riches he extracted a hundred
dollars and stuffed it into a pocket
following this he carefully slit the
soggy mattress at a seam tucked the
rest of his fortune deep within the
damp interior sewed up the hole with
a needle and thread from his bachelors
kit-and tried to sleep

chapter iii

brief holiday

money had done its work by
morning symbol though it
might be of impending lack of
freedom it now held the lure of some-
thing exactly the opposite

  just above the stratum of the flop
house lies a plane of new york life
in which anything out of the routine
seldom happens joe barry had led
this sort of humdrum existence he
knew of the citys happenings only
through the newspapers and then with
insufficient background to grasp them
truly

  his ideas of penal institutions were
still based upon these things as he knew
them the small jail in waverly where
the incarcerations of the town drunk
were more a subject for laughter than
anything else the county institutions
he had seen here and there

  these were places to be avoided it
is true yet not imbued with the formid-
able aspects which a knowledge of a
true prison can give one dannemora
sing sing-these were merely names
without giving anything to aid in their
visualization

  such thoughts however were not in
joe barrys mind in detail he only
caged



knew that he was going to lose his
identity- for a few years in some sort
of an institution and that he was
to be paid ten thousand dollars for it

  toe had never before seen more than
a hundred and fifty dollars at one time
-that was when he had saved for
three years to buy his accordion now
he could call one thousand dollars his
own and there were nine thousand
dollars more to come he was rich

  it was with this feeling of wealth
bathing his brain with anaesthetic un-
guents that he took an early train out
of the city a day out of town to do
as he pleased with no thought of any-
thing except that he was wealthy and
free

  that was strange he thought here
he was a fellow who had made a con-
tract to go to prison and because of
that he was free free from the
querulous demands of that dirty lodg-
ing house on third avenue from the
invectives of louie the uncomplimen-
tary remarks of full-house and the
apathy of diners gobbling spaghetti

  best of all he was free from fear
that gnawing sense of the ominous
which every country boy has in new
york-fear of traffic fear of the noise
fear of the friendlessness and coldness
fear of actual hunger when a job has
departed and days elapse before a fel-
low can stumble into another one

  those contented souls who love to
talk of new york as just a collection
of little country towns have never
come from an inland village seeking
its counterpart in a land of cement and
steel and taxicabs

by noon joe barry was eighty
miles from new york in a penn-
sylvania factory town that is in
the physical sense mentally he had
crossed the continent-an entire

sphere in fact to a new and utterly
different life

  he went to the barber shop and for
once did all the things he often had
longed to do from the bath onward to
the last item upon the list of tonics and
massages then had come a clothing
store where joe had bought recklessly
through his ideas of wealth were suffi-
ciently warped to hold his purchases
far within his resources

  at last everything else purchased a
different joe barry newly if not
stylishly dressed alert pleased with
himself the hard lines gone from the
corners of his lips paused in the fitting
of a new hat

  i thought i heard band music he
said to the clerk

  the salesman looked at his watch
then went to the door leaning far out

   the parade he said on returning
 late as usual ever see a circus
parade on time

  joe barry heard only two words

  circus parade he said and
grinned  gee a big circus

   not so big dayton brothers
pretty good-at least it was last year

  joe barry saw the fag end of the
parade-small shows which exhibit in
small towns have a privilege denied
larger attractions these days cities
and traffic killed the grand glittering
pageant several years ago but this
was not a city and this was not a big
show

  after joe had eaten his luncheon he
went out to the circus grounds free
a pocketful of money new clothes
shoes that hurt a little and a circus

  three hours later he was still on the
show grounds merely wandering
around he had seen the big show
and the side show twice now it was
simply a matter of making a lingering
farewell


argosy

  this day seemed to have made him
wholly naive as though the adultera-
tion of the city had been utterly erased
he stopped to talk to canvasmen and
roughnecks

  he peered into the wagons and won-
dered at the mystery of a circus com
ing out of the night to transform a
vacant lot into a wonderland then dis-
appearing into the shadows leaving
only the bare circle-marks of the rings
and a litter of empty peanut sacks to
prove its actuality

  he gawked at the portable electric
light plant chortling busily in a red
wagon he listened to the post-matinee
ballyhoo on the kid show platform and
to the gruff roarings of the animals in
the menagerie tent

   at last he paused before a small tent
set apart from the dressing tent proper
looking down with sudden longing
upon a glittering thing which rested
upon a chair there

  gee he said at last its an
iorio

  after a time he glanced about like
a boy about to go under a fence to an
apple orchard then he leaned for-
ward and touched it

   gee he said again in an awe-
struck whisper

  it was the first time he had ever
seen one outside of a music store show-
window there were mother of pearl
base-keys the sides were of silver-
stone celluloid reflecting in the late
afternoon sun with bursts of kaleido-
scopic colors the bellowts were of
milk-white kid

  again joe barry glanced about him
then impulsively picked up the instru-
ment to run his fingers over the piano
keyboard and to tap the tiny mother-
of-pearl proturberations which denoted
that it was indeed a  hundred and
twenty base

  temptation was strong at last he
yielded

he used the bellows softly surrep-
titiously as if he were actually
stealing the melody a truly
professional instrument like this had
figured in many a dream of je
barrys the music of true steel-reeds
the soft action of delicately balanced
piano keys the instant response to
pressure

  unconsciously his fingers played
more swiftly upon the keys and the
pull of the bellows grew stranger the
circus faded he was nowhere in par-
ticular just standing somewhere in
space fingering the sort of instrument
he had longed for all his life and giv-
ing to it the soul that had been caged
by disappointment by lack of interest
by disillusionment and hardships-

    thats pretty a voice said

  the music ceased joe barry felt
the blood streaming into his face he
gulped and hastily replaced the accor-
dion upon the chair

   i didnt mean to play it he said
boyishly dazedly he realized that the
girl who faced him now in street cloth-
ing had been a person of silk and tulle
when he last had seen her swinging
gracefully about the center ring of the
circus upon a dapple gray horse then
haltingly

    its yours i guess

   its in my act she said

  a pause followed awkward yet
natural the mutual dispersing of all
else while two young persons took
stock of each other

  the girl was young only a year or
so more than twenty she was vibrant
and alert with something more in the
blue depths of her eyes than mere
beauty her lips were the kind that
laughed easily yet which could settle
caged



as quickly into firmness joe looked at
her hands unconsciously some one had
told him that a circus girls hands were
hard and coarse but these were fair
with tapering fingers

  then the sun came gliding about the
end of the little tent and crept into her
hair weaving a thousand meshes of
gold there she straightened the clean-
limbed vivacity of her rounding into
evidence even under the handicap of
clothing

  joe liked her shoulders they would
have a delicious swing about them if
she should be walking with a fellow
along a sleepy hedge-lined road sud-
denly the girl said

   why dont you play some more

  joe barry stammered

   i dont know many things he
fenced and belied himself by reaching
eagerly for the gleaming instrument on
the chair  a fellow doesnt get a
chance to meet up with an iorio every
day

   a what asked the girl

   this kind of professional accor-
dion you know theyre different from
most kinds know much-about accor-
dions

    im afraid not the girl confessed
and came closer  you see uncle
dan-mr dayton you know-

  oh hes your uncle asked joe
barry somewhat awed

   yes im sue dayton she smiled
at the puzzled look in his eyes  youre
thinking of mile la fleur-thats just
my sawdust name my father and
uncle dan were partners until dad
died uncle dan really reared me in
the ring dad always looked after the
business end of the show

   i see as a matter of fact joe
barry had paid little attention now
with quick fingerings he drew a soft
melody from the responsive instrument

in his grasp then again  gee i
oughtnt to be fooling around with
this its too valuable

i wish blackie jordan thought
j so said the girl  this is the
second time hes just left it out
here by my tent without telling me
good thing uncle dan didnt notice

   hes the fellow who plays for
you queried joe

   you saw the act did you

   yes joe was awkwardly silent
the girl smiled

   go ahead-you didnt like it

   oh i liked you

  but you didnt like the act
well the girlishness of her had faded
into a youthful maturity  i know it
isnt what it should be you see in
the beginning the idea was fine uncle
dan and i were looking for a dif-
ferent way to put on an equestrian act
there was a young italian in the show
then who could play the accordion so
between everybody we decided on
dressing lombardi in a pierrot cos-
tume with me as a pierrette and shut-
ting off the rest of the show to have
him sing and play in the center of the
ring while i rested between turns we
could do that all right the tent is small
enough for a voice to reach all parts
of it

  strangeness had vanished between
the two now youth has a habit of be-
ing able to wipe out extraneous matters
when a common bond has been found

   wed planned it a lot different
from the way blackie does it but
lombardi was hurt just a week before
we opened and i dont suppose hell
ever be able to troupe again wed al-
ready spent all this money for the best
accordion uncle dan could buy so we
thought wed salvage what we could


argosy

of course blackie only plays a little
and he hates it so he doesnt help
much

   you know i thought that i kind
of felt he hurt things joe confessed
 you were so-so pretty and graceful
riding around there and so oh you
know sort of fresh and sweet-looking
and everything-

   be careful sue dayton laughed
and grasping a guy rope put her head
against her upraised arm

   well-you know i was just tell-
ing you what i was thinking if there
were somebody in there who just loved
to play then instead of just the circus
shutting down maybe there could be
some of those flower-ropes i dont
know what you call them let down
from above with those girls that are
in the grand entree-is that what you
call it-moving around slowly weav-
ing them in and out of course it was
kind of silly ive never seen anything
in a circus like that

   silly the girl touched his arm
just because its never been done
suddenly she whirled and called
 uncle dan

  a red-faced man with gray hair and
a bulbous nose halted abruptly in his
swift course from the padroom en-
trance of the big top a riding crop
banged angrily against his shiny ris-
ing boots he glared lips pursed then
jamming his free hand into a pocket of
his tight-fitting riding breeches he
jerked forth a flaming handkerchief
with which he wiped at his forehead

   wheres blackie he demanded
brusquely   theyre just about set up
over there

 i guess hes gone as usual sue
said at last  i found the accordion
on the chair outside my dressing tent
 every time i want that fellow hes
somewhere else

   you told him we were going to
broadcast didnt you

   told him i made a speech about
it again he looked toward joe bar-
ry as if trying to understand his pres-
ence you with the broadcasting
outfit

  sue dayton laughed

   no she explained  mr-he
and i just happened to meet here uncle
dan hes got the most wonderful
idea for my act

  theatrical business

   no sir said joe hesitantly

  he just happened to see the act
and we got to talking about it
said sue again  really it
would be beautiful-

  again the riding crop banged against
bootleather

   what time have i got to be talk-
ing about acts now asked dan day-
ton in a tone of exasperation  talk
about it after awhile ive got that
broadcast on my mind never saw it
to fail with one of these private sta-
tions i bought their hour for three
oclock here they are now delayed
till five oclock with half the people
off the lot well come on sue well
have to frame up some kind of a pro-
gram-anything to get by with then
he whirled and started away only to
halt  play that thing-a-ma-jig he
asked of toe barry

   a little

  just listen the girl chided he
plays it beautifully

   looking for a job uncle dan
daytons choler had given way to in-
terested showmanship

  joe barry stammered

   well i dont know yes-i guess
id sure like one

   sing any

    a little

                      a


argosy

at the microphone laughing and talk-
ing to an invisible audience some
clowns still in make-up standing in the
background cat-house green the me-
nagerie superintendent fussing about
as he made ready to extract roars and
growls from a cage of lions and tigers
which had been hauled close to the
point of broadcast uncle dan making
announcements

  these things had passed almost un-
noticed yet they would live forever
with joe barry then too there had
been his own act when fright of the
microphone had been forgotten in a
greater sensation joe had not played
for the radio audience he had played
for sue dayton smiling at him from
the sidelines and making the motions
of applause

  after the broadcasting had finished
he had still lingered even though there
had drummed through his brain the
galling insistence that he must hurry
away back to the city and to a man
who was awaiting him for a verdict

  it had been strange happiness this
mixture of fear and agony and joy
this constant conflict of watchfulness
and naivete of friendly conversa-
tion and inner guardedness

  there had been so many things to
see and do dinner in the cook-house
wandering around the lot during the
cool of evening and after that the
performance and a seat in the first row
where he could watch sue as she came
into the ring and dream of how won-
derful it would be if he could only take
the place of that lackadaisical blackie
who played as though he hated it

  ambition had truly come to joe
for the first time in his life for the
simple reason that for the first time he
had found himself in the atmosphere
for which he was fitted

  the circus

  to grow with it to learn it and
understand it to build with it and for
it and make her know that he was the
kind of a fellow who could broaden out
and accomplish things   

but finally the act was over and
joe barry found himself outside
the circus tent stumbling along
in the moonlight because she had told
him to meet her-and talk over his
salary and contract and the old fear
was on him anew that there could be
no contract because there was a pre-
vious one by which he must cease to
exisjas a human entity

  at last he saw her awaiting him at
the padroom entrance dressed for the
street now they were walking and
he had taken her arm as if to guide her
over the roughness of the lot the
warmth of her flesh had crept through
to the palm of his hand and was thril-
ling onward to his heart

   as if i hadnt walked around the
lot all my life she said but she did
not draw away

  onward they went past the place
where her little tent had been already
it was dismantled and being shoved
into the canvas wagon while property
men were running with her trunks to
another tableau that they also might
be packed

  the horse tents were gone too and
the cook-house vague bulking forms
the elephants were leaving the lot and
the sidewalls were being dropped from
the menagerie as the last of the animal
dens was hauled forth to start upon its
journey to the loading runs the cir-
cus was dismantling in a dozen places
even while it offered its wares to the
night audience

  for the first time joe really under-
stood its magic the speed and system
by which it worked
i

caged	

  here went a stake-puller method-
ically yanking out the heavy spines
of wood which had been so painstak-
ingly driven into the ground that
morning over at the side show set
off to one side now by the descent of
the midway concessions the lights still
gleamed and the triangle clattered as
the ballyhoo man strove for just one
more audience before disintegration
must begin there also

  in the darkness six- and eight-horse
teams stood quietly patient shadows
awaiting their loads their drivers
drowsing upon their backs menagerie
boys passed whistling against the dark-
ness with the led stock shetlands
goats llamas and the one camel back
at the big top the band flared into a
blatant chord and began rapidly with
new music

   uncle dans railroading the show
she said  weve got a long run to-
night

   i thought you always railroaded
said joe

   circus slang for hurry said sue
dayton  making it move a little
faster so we can be loaded and out of
town for a long trip weve always
got to be thinking about to-morrow

  she paused then and by her action
turned joe about to follow her gaze
they had progressed almost the
breadth of the lot now the circus
was in the far away a squatty bright-
spotted tent shaded at the eaves by the
shadows of the spectators

  the flags had been lowered from the
mastheads the menagerie tent had
disappeared even in this short space of
time there was no trace of it save the
stark poles standing black in the bril-
liant moonlight and the shadows of
men doubled over the ground as they
went about the unlacing of the round
top  and middle pieces

  but the big top was there the moon
rode high above it giving a mellow ap-
pearance to its splotches of light and
to the canvas itself a pearly brilliance

  its the only time we ever look
back thats the wonderful thing
about the circus she philos-
ophized  yesterdays dead to-days
just to-day-itll be yesterday too as
soon as the performance is over but
to-morrow will be a new day with a
different town and a new lot and new
faces and a new chance for a big house
and a good performance isnt it won-
derful-to live always in to-morrow
joe barry cleared his throat he
jerked at his shoulders as if to free
them from a sudden weight

   to-morrow may not be so good for
me he said huskily it was an uncon-
scious admission the girl paused

   but why she laughed  thats
not very complimentary to us

   oh i didnt mean it that wray
companionship confidence the feeling
of a friendly person had all but broken
the barriers of secrecy  i want to
come here more than anything else in
the world he burst forth  if i can
 but maybe you can get out of this
other job i hope you can sue went
on  do you know you just seem
to be showfolks thats the highest
compliment we know-to call outsiders
showfolks but you really seem to be
meant for the circus we can tell
pretty easily whether a person genuine-
ly loves it or not

   yes-i guess so

   and dont let uncle dan make you
nervous thats all exterior hes
really as gentle as a kitten

   he doesnt mean anything said
joe dully

   and really hes terribly excited
over your idea

   was he  joe barry bucked up mo-
mentarily  ive got a new one he
added hastily  it came to me while i
was watching your act the old stage
manager out in waverly used to call it
a snow-box anyway you could have
one of those hung away up above you
and it would sift out pieces of paper that
would look like apple blossoms falling
and then you could have colored flood-
lights to throw on it-you know when
the playing and singing is going on

   oh that would be just beautiful
sue dayton clapped her hands  ill
take it up with uncle dan well have
it all fixed up bv the time you come
back

oe barry rubbed a palm across
his eyes

   what if i shouldnt come
back he asked boyishly  would
you feel mad about it

   of course not we realize how
those things are wed like to have
you though if you can arrange it
they were merely strolling now  cir-
cus people have to be a lot different
from most persons in business the
time element forces us to use snap
judgment but she laughed  were
pretty good judges of human nature
we dont make many mistakes

   you-you think im all right
then he asked haltingly

   why of course why not

  joe barry stumbled

   oh im in trouble miss dayton
he blurted reserve for the moment
had vanished  a man is trying to get
me into a mess i promised id do
something for him-he was paying me
for it i was broke id got fired
from my job and he came along and
offered me a lot of money and i wasnt
thinking wrhat i was doing now may-
be hell make me go through with it

and i dont want to i dont want to
do anything that isnt right miss day-
ton

  she laughed there was surprise in it

   any one could tell that then
soberly  i knew you were worried
about something

   im awful worried said joe
 and i cant tell you what it is-ex-
cept that it isnt anything ive done

   everything will come out all
right she put a snap into her voice
 youve got to make it come out all
right

   thats it he said hurriedly he
reached for his cheap watch  gee
ive got to hurry the last train back
leaves at ten oclock i cant afford to
miss it miss-sue ive got to catch
it because he said hed get my an-
swer to-night and im going to tell him
i wont take his job i oughtnt ever
to have thought about it in the begin-
ning

   people dont stop to think much
when theyre broke-joe she said

   i didnt but i ought tve but
ill see him to-night and ill tell him
i dont want his old job gee miss-
sue id rather be here than any place
in the world

   id like to have you here she an-
swered and there was something more
than politeness in her tone

  joe held his watch to the moonlight

   gee ive got to hurry he held
forth a hand  goonight-sue he
said

   good night joe she answered
and took his proffered hand  good
luck well be watching for you

he said something in answer
husky and unintelligible then
stumbling over the ruts he hur-
ried onward across the lot but at the
edge he turned for an instant and
caged



looked back to the faint form of a
girl moving in the opposite direction
toward the circus train then she too
turned and he could see that she raised
her hand

  after a moment joe barry caught
hastily at his throat rubbing it as he
walked

  down at the station the train
screamed in and a tight-lipped young
man climbed aboard carrying his
bundle of discarded clothing wrhich he
had checked there before going to the
circus lot he had almost forgotten it
there was only one thing on joe bar-
rys mind now that man named
martin

  there couldnt be any argument
about this thing joe would simply
have to tell him what had happened
honestly frankly and demand that he
be let out of his bargain

  hed make his offer of repayment
for the money he had spent-nearly
seventy-five dollars as he remembered
it perhaps he could pawn his accordi-
on for part of it he could send the
rest from the circus sue dayton had
promised him thirty-five a week at the
start and more if he lived up to expec-
tations

  hed tell martin all that and hed
try to convince him but if the at-
torney tried to hold him to his bar-
gain there was a remedy an inspira-
tion had told joe he could go to the
police

  it had not occurred to him until the
necessity of escape arose that he might
be taking part in something approach-
ing the criminal he had looked upon
the law only as a voracious thing de-
manding a penalty not as a bulwark of
society that exacts a price which a par-
ticular person should pay and no one
else

  but it had to be done quickly-joe

knew that the element of time struck
joe barry with sudden forcefulness
down at police headquarters they
might think it queer even now that he
hadnt reported this before

  then came a new fear what if it
had gone too far already he erased
that nothing had really been arranged
yet he didnt even know the name of
the man whose place he was supposed
to take or exactly what he had done
martin had said he would take that
matter up after joe had really made his
decision

  well ive made it joe barry
mumbled

  the train seemed to drag after that
at the station he took a taxi for the
first time in his life at last he was
standing before the smear-faced old
wooden building that was his home
joe barry strangely weak in his knees
opened the old door and started up the
creaking stairway

  well where you been this time
it was a querulous angry voice from
the first landing  no beds made no
sweeping-

  joe barry snapped a rejoinder and
went on so martins chauffeur had
not been there it gave him sudden
hope what if this were not so seri-
ous after all some perverted form
of humor on the part of an idle person
just to see what a desperate young man
would do under such circumstances-
what if that were it

when he reached the door of his
room he pawed deep into his
pocket for his personal key
sent it into the lock the door yielded
a faint v of light went into the room
from the gas jet in the hall

  joe barry halted his lower jaw loose
in surprise on the floor before him
lay something metallic something


argosy

which had been pushed tinder the door
then he sat on the bed and laughed

  it had been a joke it had been a
joke thats all-just somebody playing
a joke on him theyd sneaked up
here during the day and returned that
pass-key he had given martin by slip-
ping it under the door

  but just as suddenly he sobered
nobody would give a fellow a thousand
dollars for a joke he fingered the
remainder of the money which he had
saved from his two accounts he
looked at the pass-key suddenly he
went to the gas jet and struck a match
illuminating the room he searched
the floor for a note there was noth-
ing he jerked out his cheap watch
suddenly ticking with clock-like res-
onance

   i wont give him any leeway joe
had almost slumped to the bed again
the pass-key still in his right hand
again he studied it why had they
just come up here and slipped the thing
under the door

  a minute passed joe confirmed it by
looking at his watch then he began
to count-one two three four five-
he wrondered how much a person would
have to count before it all made a min-
ute

  he fumbled his watch it slipped
from his sweating hand and he caught
it with the other clicking the pass-key

against it he remembered how the
old photographer back in waverly used
to count for time exposures one thou-
sand and one one thousand and two
one thousand and three-

  he started and listened he settled
again only some roomer several of
them stopping at the second landing
and the high-pitched complaining
voice of a lodger reiterating the fact
above the mumbling questions of others
that no beds had been made up no
rooms swept out

  then the stairs creaked as if men
were moving quietly upward or may-
be it was just a lodger going down to
the street-

  suddenly joe jerked to his feet as if
jolted by electricity some one was
outside his room the staccato hol-
low pounding came again joe barry
moved forward he swung wide the
door

  four men stood there well-dressed
men staring quietly at him one
flipped his coat back and the edge of
a shield gleamed in the gas-light

  youre joe barry he said the
words were more like a statement
than a question

  joe could not answer two of the
men dodged swiftly behind him

   fan him for a rod came a coldly
monotonous voice  better not take

any chances

 bad luck  croaked old dan-but not
a man on that whaler guessed what mad
mysterious quirk of fate was to be
visited on that greedy crew

by r w alexander

t

hell brewin he muttered for all the world like some villainous old parrot

old dan whittled at the stick
of tobacco he was gray-
bearded and dirty muffled to
the ears in thick woolen garments

   mates theres bad luck aboard

  garth the hunter looked up from
the harpoon he was sharpening
 how

  old dan gestured with one gnarled
hand  wimmin an things he said
vaguely

  what things garth was in-
sistent

   wimmin an things old dan
said again  sailin friday an such
like

   theres only one woman aboard
carroll said

  old dan nodded

   ones enough he looked at the
faces about him dim in the shadows
of the focsle  aint that so

  a rumble of assent came from them
 who ever heard of a woman on a
whaler said old dan querulously
 taint right

   shes only a girl said carroll

  old dan turned rheumy eyes on
him youre young you dont know
nothin you-

  garth struck in  wheres the bad
luck dan

  old dan became surly

   you wait an see there never yet
was a red-headed woman as wasnt un-
lucky he stuffed tobacco into his
pipe leaned over to the lamp  back
in the sixties i reckon it was-

  carroll went on deck the stars
were shining and the sky was bright
the rigging creaked in the steady rush
of wind the man at the wheel sang
softly

   rolling down rolling down rolling-
      down to rio-

  carroll leaned against the rails
watched the sliding sea the waves
were big and black topped with a dim
white

   were rolling down to rio

  a paring of moon came up yellow
as orange touching the sea with gold
with brooding eyes carroll watched
its slow climb among the stars

  red-headed girls were unlucky 
carroll smiled at the yellow sickle
her hair was more gold than red he
thought

garth the hunter stood beside
 him

        that darned old fool is out
to make trouble

  carroll stirred to look at him  old
dan

   yes he has the men talking

  carroll was silent he could not
agree that old dan was likely to make
trouble

   you see garth said settling him-
self against the rails  dans old he
cant realize that things have changed
since he was young

  carroll watched the moon old dan
interested him little

   when dan was about your age
garth went on  he sailed with bully
hayes-who was one of the biggest
ruffians in the pacific dan cant
realize those days are past ever seen
him drunk 

   no carroll said

   he sings songs thatd make yout
hair curl he was pretty tough when
he was young i guess now he thinks
the skippers girl means bad luck
aboard and hes all for us having him
land her somewhere but the old man
wouldnt agree to that

  why the hell should he said
carroll hotly  dans a cursed old
fool

  garth glanced at him

   guess youd prefer her to stay
eh well i dont blame you shes
as pretty a girl as ever ive seen

   i have nothing to do with her
carroll shrugged

   thats not your fault then
garth seeing carrolls frown changed
the subject  about time the luck
turned isnt it

  carroll nodded in the past six
weeks the brig had sighted one distant
whale which had vanished almost im-
mediately

   maybe were too far south car-
roll said

   maybe garth sniffed the air
 wind somewhere i guess he
glanced up at the clear sky  queer
   dont be surprised if its blowing
before sunup

carroll was aloft when the sun
rose taking in sail before a
strengthening wind the north
was dark with cloud the sea leaden
he saw white horses marching down
upon the brig in serried ranks stretched
from horizon to horizon the black
cloud spread until it blotted out the
sun lightning flickered palely on its
edges

  the girl was down there watching
carroll saw the tossing red of her hair
as she fronted the wind the white oval
of her face glanced at the men working
feverishly above was she afraid
sperm



he doubted it there was in her atti-
tude something of defiance as if she
dared the storm to do its worst car-
roll smiled as he went down

  she was watching him he knew go-
ing forward she was interested in
him then he turned swiftly looked
back along the length of the deck
she laughed at him then at the dark-
ling sky that showed him how very
little she feared the sea and the storm

  swaying lightly on wide-planted
feet he watched the gathering black-
ness the clouds were piled one on
another to a tremendous height shut-
ting out the sky and the sun beneath
them the leaden sea changed to a dull
purple the broken crests became gray
never before had carroll seen any-
thing like it as yet the wind came in
gusts with long spaces of calm be-
tween the brig rolled uneasily jerkily
under bare poles

  masters the skipper came on deck
he glanced aloft and at the blackness
to the north the girl joined him as
carroll went below

  t hell brewin old dan muttered
 hell brewin

  carroll answered nothing

  old dan leered at him  when i
was your age-

   stow the gab said carroll sourly
 wimmin wimmin- grumbled
the old man

   what the hell do you mean de-
manded the younger man sharply

  old dan snarled quick obscenity
two hours after dawn wind caught
the brig heeled her over until her star-
board rails were under water then
passed suddenly leaving her rocking
there on the troubled sea

   hell brewin old dan muttered
for all the world like some villainous
parrot  hell brewin

  the wind came again with increased

violence the oregon staggered rolled
deep shook herself and drove for-
ward with her scuppers a green roar-
ing tide

   guess were in for something out
of the ordinary said garth the
hunter

   when i was a lad- began old
dan and carroll fled

  pie clawed his way on deck clung
there watching the dark mountains
called into being by the wind the
last vestige of blue was shut from the
sky the mass of leaden cloud hung
heavy everywhere the oregon pitched
writh a sharp sickening motion spray
swept like hail along her deck

  aft carroll saw the girl sight of
her sent a little thrill through him of
admiration and apprehension at once
she was in danger and knew it and
cared not at all

  pie went slowly aft clinging to the
ropes stretched taut along the rails
as the brig rolled water swirled about
his knees tugged at his feet with care-
less strength his face was sore from
the sting of the spray his eyes smart-
ing the wind roared hollowly about
the naked masts

  intent on the troubled water the
girl had not seen him come she stood
lithe and slender against the deck-
house one arm crooked about a dan-
gling rope her head was bare her
red hair streaming water her cheeks
whipped to pink by the laden wind
carroll took her by the elbowt and she
turned startled eyes to him

   youd better go below he roared

   what

   youd better go below

  he sawr the flame of anger leap in
her eyes

   what do you mean 

   its dangerous here he explained
tritely


argosy

   i know that

  carroll laughed of course she had
known it but her knowledge made
no difference  you might be swept
overboard

   whats that to you

  a wave came seething over the rails
lifted them flung them across the deck
carroll gripped the girl with one arm
sought with the other for the lifelines
he could see nothing hear nothing
but the roar of water the girl was
struggling though not to break his
grip he felt rope caught it twisted
it about his arm the water receded
and they breathed deep the oregon
righted herself heavily drunkenly

   you see carroll said

  she laughed

   fm wet through id better go
down

  carroll helped her to the companion-
way

   youre not hurt he said in sud-
den concern

  she smiled at him was gone car-
roll fought his way forard

four days the oregon drove on
before the storm until the men
were red-eyed and surly and short
of speech and even old dans gar-
rulity was checked late the fourth
day the wind dropped and by night-
fall of the fifth day the sea was calm
the oregon floated idly

   something over there garth said
pointing in the gathering dusk

  carroll saw it a thin black line on
the horizon shadow-wreathed

   looks like land

  garth nodded  wonder where
we are

  a long-drawn cry came from aboves
   there she blows

  the skipper was on deck swearing

 where away man where away
the voice of the lookout came again
 two points off the port bow sir
masters leveled his glass the night
was fast swathing them in darkness

   theres land out there sir car-
roll said

  masters snarled at him

   land be damned theres no land
within a thousand miles

 we saw it sir garth insisted
but the skipper was gone muttering
 i dont blame him garth said
 our lucks right out this run seven
weeks out and we havent filled a
barrel

  the night darkened stealthily
shadows closed about the listless ship
the oregon floated in blackness with
not even the sound of waves to tell of
the water everywhere

  late in the first dogwatch carroll
heard a whisper of sound it was a
whisper no more like something
breathing out there in the darkness
yet a flat calm held the ship and her
masts were steady against the sky he
listened an instant then called softly
to the man who kept watch with
him

   hear that sam

  the man came to him looming ab-
ruptly from the shadows

   hear what 

   listen carroll said

  they listened and the sound came
again a long-drawn sigh as if some
half human monster rested out there
on the placid sea

   thats waves on a beach sam
said

   but the seas calm

   there never yet was a sea so calm
that it didnt make waves on a beach
better call the old man eh

   maybe so carroll said dubiously
  masters came swtearing on deck
sperm



   youre imagining things man he
stormed in disgust

   its waves on a beach sir sam
said doggedly

   be quiet a minute then let me
listen

  they listened and the whisper came
softly through the darkness to car-
roll it seemed a little louder than be-
fore

   heave the lead masters ordered

  the lead splashed overboard

   fifteen fathom sir sam reported
presently  shingle bottom

   try again

  the lead went down again with a
strange gulping sound

   on the mark fourteen sir

  masters grunted

   call the bosn and have the anchor
down well see where we are at sun-
up

  the boatswain came on deck sleepy
and blasphemous the anchor went
down with a splash and a rattle of
chain

  what in hells that sam said

  there were sounds of movement in
the darkness about the brig strange
heavy sounds splashes and surging
but presently they ceased and silence
fell again

   ill be glad when light comes
sam said  i dont like this

carroll later watched the east
pale and flush at the promise of
day a mist lay on the water
pearly white it swirled in little eddies
here and there although there was no
wind

  the sun rose and the mist thinned
patches of blue water showed in it

   look there sam said and gripped
carrolls arm

  a dark bulk passed lazily through
one of the clear patches the lookout

saw it with them and his voice floated
down

   there she blows

  masters came on deck in trousers
and shirt

   bose where the hell- pipe the
men on deck you fool

  the voice of the lookout came again
   an sperm at that

  now that the sun was up the mist
cleared quickly the blue patches
spread and the voice of the lookout
came monotonously

   there she blows    there she
blows 

  the mist was gone a few cables
lengths away was an island low flat
covered with short scrub

  get the boats away masters
roared the water was black with
whales

  garth caught him by the arm
 listen sir-

   what the devil get to your boat
damn you masters flung himself
free

   you listen to me said the hunter
pale with rage  look out there
he waved a long arm  theyre cows
theyve mostly calves does that tell
you anything

   it tells me were in luck masters
answered savagely

  garth caught him again in a grip
not lightly to be shaken off

   it tells me were at the island where
the whales come to have their young
youve heard of it often enough and
so have i wed better leave them
alone

  go to hell masters said and
with an effort tore himself free  ill
take your place myself if youre so
squeamish

   you can take mine as well car-
roll said  ill have nothing to do
with this


argosy

  one boat was down ready the men
waiting

   heave away masters cried he
climbed into the second boat and the
men lowered her swiftly he looked
up at the few left  deck

   dan follow with the third boat
now men row

the first boat was already fast to
a whale carroll watched the
killing with anger and a sense of
horror it was the first he had seen
and it sickened him the whale had
a calf by its side and struggled little
yet two hours or more had passed be-
fore the final flurry was over and the
men began to tow the carcass to the
brig the calf followed

  the other boats too had each made
a kill masters was jubilant as he came
aboard he halted in front of garth
and carroll

   see my hearties we can get along
without you

  garth nodded

   maybe so anyway youll get no
help from us

   ive a mind to put you in irons

   time enough to talk like that when
you get awray from here ive heard
of ships that found this island before
and nary a one of them got back to
port

  masters went away laughing

  the girl carroll noted had stayed
below all morning that was as well
he thought what had threatened to
turn his strong stomach must surely
have proved too much for hers

  all day the men worked and all
night by the red glare of blazing oil
arid when dawn came the three denuded
skeletons wtere let drift away gulls
descended on them in wrhite clouds
screaming sharks had gathered and
feasted royally the troubled water

was thick with a scum of oil and blood
lyet a few hundred yards distant the
mother whales played with their
young

  that day and the following night
the men slept and dawn saw them in
the boats once more

   its murder garth said savagely
  carroll nodded in silence

    those gulls are hell

   theyre driving me mad carroll
said

  the first boat was headed back tow-
ing its kill

   therell be bad luck over this
garth said  im not superstitious but
i have a hunch-

  again masters halted before them
as he came aboard  still squeamish
he said curiously

   do you think youll get to port
garth said

  masters shrugged

   why not he nodded toward
the whales dotting the placid water
 whats the full of a ship from that
number  nothing

    its not one ship said garth  its
hundreds youd come back again
yourself the men would leave you
and sell their knowledge to other skip-
pers every whaler in the pacific
would be here inside a year then-
he spread his hands  you know
what would happen then

   partly thats why im going when
these three are barreled masters said
 partly that and partly because my
daughter is against the idea of this
slaughter as she calls it as for
coming back i havent taken the bear-
ings of the island and i dont intend
to so the men wont be able to lead
other skippers back and what youre
afraid of wont happen

   im glad garth said this
place wasnt meant to be found
sperm



   maybe youre right masters
nodded and went aft

on the day that the oregon was to
sail old dan showed his hand

        me an the men he told
masters has decided to stay he
turned to the crowd behind him
 aint that so mates

  thats so

   you can decide what you damn
well like masters said  we sail

   theres a fortune here snarled
old dan

  its staying here get forard

   its your gal-

   leave my girl out of this get
forard i say

   get to hell i say old dan
mimicked and pulled a revolver from
his pocket he fired twice and masters
crumpled to the deck

  you old dan snarled turning
the gun on carroll and garth not a
whimper now or youll get the same
from now on im skipper aboard this
hooker an dont you forget it make
trouble an- he made an ugly ges-
ture  im not a man to fool with

  carroll watched the men they were
with old dan their faces told him
that some might have been shocked
by the murder but it had failed to
alter their stand they saw riches be-
fore them and a life or two would not
block their way

  whats it to be now old dan
said menacingly

   guess well sit in with you said
garth

   an you  the muzzle of the gun
turned square on carroll

   ill answer for him garth said
easily

   right old dan pocketed the re-
volver  get two boats out mates
an do a bit more killin

   the girl carroll said unsteadily
to garth  you tell her

   theres no need

  she stood at the head of the com-
panionway a long moment she stood
staring then came forward

   get her below garth whispered
somehow carroll got her below
she seemed dazed bewildered

   best stay here carroll said
 well bring him to his cabin

  with garth he carried masters
below laid him on his bunk

   keep quiet and wait garth said
softly  let them think youve fallen
for their scheme we cant do any-
thing now

   im afraid for the girl carroll
said

   we can keep an eye on her

  they stretched a sheet over the dead
captain then went on deck the two
boats had made fast to whales

   this cant last garth said

  they watched the kills saw the first
boat head back toward the ship old
dan waved it off

   bring it ashore mates its handier
to work ashore than aboard he
turned to the men on deck  get the
barrels out an well float em to the
beach

  the barrels were floated ashore in
long strings rolled a little distance up
the beach fires were lighted and black
smoke climbed slowly into the bright
sky

   them fires dont go out old dan
said  until every barrel aboard is
full

in the days that followed it seemed
to carroll that old dan had spoken
the truth always the black smoke
rose heavily from the beach always
the sea bore a scum of blood and oil
gulls screamed unceasingly and tore


argosy

at the fragments of blubber with bills
dyed red through the scum moved
fins of sharks

  the men were drinking heavily at
night they held carouse on the brig
and the deep roar of their voices rang
across the quiet sea carroll then
leaned against the door of the girls
cabin ceaselessly watching even there
he caught fragment on fragment of
old dans obscene ditties and paled
with rage

  the girl now frankly showed her
liking for carroll he saw her often
when he brought her food for now
she never left her cabin

   i have only you to trust she said
once  soon or late these others will
kill me

  kill you carroll echoed

  she nodded  they would be fools
to let me live i think they will kill
you too and maybe garth for their
own safety they must

   garth and i he said unsteadily
 will protect you-always

  fleetingly she touched his hand

   i know youre different jve
often wondered about you

   i dont understand said carroll
 youre not one of them-you
werent born to this

   no he stared at her curiously
he had not dreamed she knew him so
well  my father owns a few vessels
and im learning to be a sailor before
taking charge of one of them

  he had a difficult subject to ap-
proach and found himself at a loss for
words

  youre thinking of my father
she said  well have to bury him of
course

   ashore carroll said

   ashore her eyes widened  the
sharks i had forgotten them thats
horrible the whole thing is horrible

  she began to cry brokenly and car-
roll helpless as a man always is at such
times left her

  they brought the dead captain
ashore that afternoon and buried him
in a little clearing in the scrub

   not too far from the beach the
girl said  so that he can hear the
gulls and the sea

  it was two nights later that the
oregon caught fire carroll saw the
smoke against the stars saw the masts
begin to quiver stared an instant
then leaped down the companionway
and knocked at the girls door

   better dress quickly he said

   is anything the matter

   the ships afire

  her voice was steady when she
answered him

   ill be ready in a moment

  garth they found on deck grim
lipped bitter

   the dirty fools growled the
hunter  this is the end of all their
plans

  the boats were alongside carroll
lowrered the girl into one dropped
down himself followed by garth they
pushed off rowed ashore carroll took
the girl in his arms carried her
through the shallows

   guess we better go back for some
provisions garth said

  the alarm had been given and men
were shouting old dan took charge
with a volley of blasphemy

  water an grub look alive you
lubbers

   try to put her out a man yelled

   you might as well try to put out
hell wait till the oil begins to go
water an grub water an grub

  a thin red line of flame spurted
across the deck blazed a foot high
sank to a dull glow

   hurry old dan roared
sperm



  a muffled explosion shook the after
hold old dan leaped to the side

   there she goes its every man
for himself now he dropped into
one of the boats  come on blast
you im waitin half a minute thats
all

  the boats were full the brig de-
serted

   push off push off shell go any
minute now

  a second explosion came and a
scarlet tongue leaped from the deck
turning the sea to blood throwing the
shadow of the masts huge distorted
on the great cloud of smoke above

   there goes a good ship said
old dan regretfully

  the flame was leaping leaping leap-
ing they felt the hot kiss of it on
their faces and rowed for the beach
sea and sky and beach were red as
blood the mother whales moved
slowly off

the girl had vanished carroll
knew where she would be found
and found her there in the clear-
ing where her father lay he watched
beside her until the stars paled and
gray dawn came even then he did
not waken her but waited patiently
until she stirred sighed and sat up
she came to her feet stared at the sea
the oregon was gone charred tim-
bers floated on the water that was all

   im glad she said simply

   well have to get away garth
said to carroll that day  the fools
are drinking themselves mad

  carroll nodded

  garth came to him that night as the
fires died down

   dont wake the girl he whis-
pered  old dans set a man to watch
the boats

   ill account for him carroll said
 no this is my job come on
they went softly through the scrub
reached the beach saw the dark figure
of the watcher as he leaned against a
boat for the first time carroll knew
that garth held a harpoon

   its the only way garth whis-
pered bringing back his arm a mo-
ment he poised the shaft then threw
the watcher fell

   go back for the girl said garth
garth had a boat in the water when
carroll returned with the girl carroll
lifted her in

-  quiet garth breathed and they
pushed off putting out the oars they
rowed gently

   theyll follow carroll said

  garth smiled in the darkness back
on the beach a flame was born leaped
high

   whats that

   the boats said garth grimly  i
set a fire going in their lockers when
you were away

 what then-theyre marooned
 yes garth said  i meant
that  i set the brig going too
those murderers will kill each other
in a week

  the girl shivered carroll slipped
an arm about her

   better sleep he said gently

  later a little wind blew up and they
hoisted the sail when morning came
the island was out of sight

  after two weeks they were picked
up by a whaler

   where in hell have you come
from said the skipper

   the oregon said garth  she
caught fire

   youre the only survivors

  garth looked at carroll at the girl
and nodded

a wanderer returns

many thousands of cattle filled
the country along the western
boundaries of jasper and new-
ton counties missouri the town of
baxter springs in the southeast cor-
ner of kansas close to the missouri
and indian territory lines was prac-
tically blockaded with many more
thousands of longhorns being hurried
to the congested area before the frost
should kill the grass

out of more than a quarter of a mil-

lion cattle only an insignificant part
were destined to reach a profitable
market a tremendous loss was result-
ing from the missourians refusal to
permit the long drives to penetrate the
state and reach the missouri pacific
railroad

  no other railway head was nearer
than that of the kansas pacific at to-
peka the atchison topeka and santa
fe would afford no shipping points for
several years it is true that the ray-
duffield oittfit starting with a thou-
sand head in may managed to reach

pulsed at baxter springs by missouri
men this herd was driven around the
settled portion of kansas crossed the
kansas river at st marys entered
nebraska and crossed the missouri to
find a market as an example of grit
and determination this drive was epic
as a financial enterprise it was disas-
trous

  some herds had been taken east

from baxter springs along the mis-
souri-arkansas line until they had got-
ten beyond the hostile region and could
make north to a railway point east of
sedalia but much of this country was
mountainous and heavily timbered
and the cattle finished the drive foot-
sore and in poor flesh there was no
profit from this venture and to prevent
a repetition of the sorry experiment
men from benton county arkansas
were gathered at baxter

  these with missourians from mur-
physburg leadville georgia city and
gibsonville completely sealed the bor-
der feuds existing prior to the civil

    a

war and those engendered
by it supplied the rough
reckless element that kept
outlawry alive and the
sheriff busy in the border states

until bribed to permit the passage
of a herd these hard citizens cited the
spanish or  texas fever as an
excuse for the embargo this sickness
was a peculiar disease and could very
well be put forward as a legitimate
reason for  no thoroughfare

  texas cattle in poor condition were
carriers of the fever but did not neces-
sarily suffer from it themselves it was
fatal to northern cattle however even
if they grazed over the same ground
that had been occupied by an infected
herd texas cattle that had wintered
in the north were not carriers but were
susceptible to it if brought in contact
with an infected herd only those re-


argosy

ceiving it directly from a texas herd
suffered

  but these reckless border-men were
not so solicitous about their cattle
once they had been paid for a right of
way the border banditti killed many
drovers and stole thousands of cattle

  what added to the ire of the frantic
owners was the knowledge that beeves
would bring as high as fifty dollars a
head if delivered in good flesh at se-
dalia missouri they cost from three
to five dollars a head in texas and
those golden profits were vanishing
daily at and round baxter springs
cattle were dying or being stolen by
entire herds

a three-diamond waddie felt
a strange homesickness as he
sat cross-legged and stared to-
ward the forbidden land a long-
limbed long-haired man lazily ad-
vanced and gruffly demanded  whats
gnawin you texas  some one cut
your bridle

   i was just thinking bill

   this jam of longhorns is nough
to make a coyote sick with a grunt
bill dropped beside his friend and cu-
riously peered under the huge hat-
brim bill had a long twisted jaw and
yellowish eyes he lazily remarked
 ten years since you threw in with the
three-diamond

   and you were my first and best
friend bill

  u how you git thataway if i was
a friend youd a told me what was
gnawing you all these years youd
face your cards up an tell me to take
an eyeful

  texas glanced around at the motley
groups close by was a noisy north-
erner buying cattle he could not move
with a worthless check an indian
from the shawnee nation was offering

to return stock he had stolen for two
dollars a head

  youve been a powerful good
friend to me bill insisted texas

   derned liar if i was a friend
youd open up stomick a botherin
you

   bill i feel mighty blue

   reckon we all do with them steers
hogged up with no place to go so
many behind us we cant even drive
back to texas

   it aint cattle its something else
bill  i was raised across the mis-
souri line here in newton county
thats bad hoarsely whispered
bill and he glanced warily around
 but you an me be the only ones that
knows i wont spill a word you had
nerve enough to pull out

   my folks are buried over there
the cabin on hicks run is mine
theres a smart parcel of land out in
the hills thats mine    ever look back
an pity yourself when you was a kid
bill shook his head emphatically and
said  i always want to kick that other
bill cant remember a time when i
want plumb loco

  texas his thoughts still detached
continued  my pap was the best man
god ever stuck into boots honest as
sunshine liked fun made a pal of
me  we lived two miles north of
danby

  lead mining country no range
and bill spat in disgust

  texas informed him  but theres
several long thickly grassed valleys
where the herd could go through and
make the missouri pacific

   yeah if them hombres would let
us but that aint what makes you sit
like a toad all scrunched over

   i was rememberin how pap fin-
ished we went to town-danby-to
tell jedge byenck that pap had found
bad hombres



a lead mine that is pap was goin to
tell if he found the jedge sober i was
to keep my yap shut if the jedge was
on a drunk or startin one

   im just tother way round ea-
gerly interrupted bill  when they
picked me up drilled through by a
lipan comanche arrer i wouldnt tell
my name or outfit just shy in a mean
way    your pap showed you the
mine an you kept shet 

   of course i never was a talker
its in a briery place where i saw my
first bear i can see that ragged road
an feel the cool dirt under my bare
feet and hear the early morn in bird-
calls

   you young poetry cuss exploded
bill

rxanby was filled with specu-

   j lators gamblers outlaws then
as it must be now mighty bad
hombres from all over they was
thick even afore the war well we
found the jedge sober he wore the
most glistenin boots i ever see near-
ly jumped out of his chair when pap
tossed the ore on the table and let on
how hed found a lead mine he
clapped pap on the shoulder an cried
 damme thomas calm if you aint
hit it this is a big day i must break
over

   then he was fishin glasses an a
bottle from the table drawer pap took
his drink but put his ore in his pock-
ets an winked at me the jedge
tossed off two more drinks and asked
about the mine pap give me a side-
look and said it was on the home
place

   your name must be calm mused
bill

   washington calm but keep call-
in me  texas i remember that morn-
in like yesterday it was the last time

i was happy  you sabe the jedge
would blab things when drunk but it
had to be told him jest as he was start-
in in he never toted anything over to
the next drunk and pap wouldnt take
any chances hundreds of men in town
whod jump a claim and kill the owrner
in a second

   ornery road-brand you give them
caballeros but finish the drive

   the jedge went along with us
when we took to the street hoss face
come up an dared pap to wrestle
they wrestled nearly every time they
met-nip an tuck atween em pap
was keen for it and the jedge said hed
be refree

  we went to an open shed writh a
dirt floor with a heap of men follerin

i	held paps coat he winked at me as
he always did when he reckoned on
bestin his man then they was at it
round an round they whirled crowd
pressin closer yellin an bettin pap
an hoss face swung into the circle an
busted it i nigh split my throat a hoot-
in for pap to finish the job hoss face
went down on one knee tryin to fetch
pap over his hip crowd then spoiled
my chance of seein anything men
was howlin  toms got him bested 
 he musta been a humdinger in-
terrupted bill

   then jedge byenck was swear in
at the crowd an tellin em  stand
back give em a show toms down
fall back so they can go at it again 
texas paused and turned his head as
if watching the poker game being
played near by on a blanket by some
arkansas men and northern gamblers
bill kept quiet respecting his silence

  speaking rapidly and fiercely to
cover his emotion texas went on

   my heart was smashed like id
been kicked by a bucker when some
one cried toms hurt he was hurt


argosy

to death he died there on that dirt
floor

  texas jumped to his feet fiercely
winking back tears and then hurried
to interview his trail-boss after a
brief talk he roped out a horse sad-
dled it and galloped across the line
half a mile inside the state boundary
he was halted by a man armed with a
double-barrel shotgun

   youre from texas where the
cow-fever comes from challenged the
guard

   that fevers all in your eye

   you got to go back

   bein missouri-born im goin
ahead said texas

  the guard eyed him speculatively
his big gun thrust through the waist-
band of the trousers carried an argu-
ment the huge hat high-heeled boots
and big spurs all spoke of texas

   how do i know youre a missouri
man asked the guard

   i dont know nor care im goin
through if youre curious ask jedge
bvenck

   jedge bvenck youre sound if he
speaks for you but hes in danby

   i was raised two miles above the
town on hicks run give me the
road

   all right you sound straight but
whats your name

   washington calm

 dawg-gone was any of your
tribe that died in a wrrestlin match in
the old days

   my pap died while wrestlin

texas used the spurs and made
quick time for the rest of the
wav he found the town filled
with speculators miners desperadoes
the backwash of the civil war but he
scarcely was conscious of the colorful
scene as he made for the square and

dismounted on the north side he
found what he was looking for the
weather-beaten sign of jonathan w
byenck attorney-at-law the sign had
been brave with much gilt paint when
as a boy he had set out to find a new
home

  leaving his mustang at the hitch-
rail he entered the office his huge
spurs making a great clatter for a
moment he did not recognize the judge
for his hair was white and his face thin
and deeply creased on the desk before
him was a bottle and an empty glass a
glance and the dark eyes of the judge
were quickening with recognition
with both hands outstretched he
quickly advanced and exclaimed

   bless my soul little wash calm
grown up to be a man what a big
hat you look like a wild cowboy
he shook hands warmly and listened
closely while his visitor gave a brief
history of the lost years

  the judge nodded sympathetically
and insisted  you must stop at my
house while in town im an old bach
at present but have a wonderful cook
 im just driftin jedge shant be
in one place much as paps friend i
lowed to look you up an there are
some papers

   right here in my strong box you
shall take them with you better stop
at my house your old place has burned
down

   they couldnt even spare the old
shack mused texas his eyes nar-
rowing  well the soul of the house
died when pap went away i felt
mighty lonesome stayin there alone
after pap was murdered

  what exclaimed the judge
 murdered  what a terrible thing to
say why washington there never
was any proof of foul play why do
you say that my boy
bad hombres



   i squirmed like a rat between the
legs of the men after some one cried
 for gods sake keep the younker
back there was no keepin me back
jedge pap was lying flat on his face
his arms flung wide hed been stabbed
in the back  his left side and his
sheath-knife was on the ground two
feet from him he couldnt have fallen
on the knife

   but you never suggested foul play
washington why have you waited
until now to say it

   i was young and i was awfully
scared my heart was plumb busted i
had to light out now im older i
wanted to come back

   and get your papers here they
are my boy im sure youd be better
off if you could believe what others
believe-that in some unaccountable
fashion the knife fell to the ground
that your father fell upon it

   pd be a million times happier if i
could think that jedge say who
could have wanted to kill him

  no one he never had an enemy
on earth what you imagine is im-
possible

  texas stuffed the thin parcel of legal
papers in the bosom of his shirt and
said noncommittally we wont talk
any more about it jedge

  the judge sighed and said if it
had happened to-day with so many
rough characters in town your suspi-
cion wouldnt be so surprising

   rough characters here then
jedge

  but i believe were worse off to-
day    step here to the window see
that fellow dressed like a fashion-
plate wearing boots of french calf
velvet collar on his coat and a hat that
cost moren a nigger can earn in a year
linen always white as snow and the
diamond in his shirt front is worth

several thousand dollars hes eb
whilks got his thousand a month as
a pilot on the missouri till he was run
off the river for killing a sleeping
man    there comes one you ought
to remember jo sling he rode with
quantrill and he fetched his killing
notions back home    and on the
corner theres old hoss face who
wrestled with your father that sad
day

  id know him anywhere and
texass voice was choked with emo-
tion  a kindly man whos the old
coot behind him

   laughin diggs crazy as a loon
see the ribbons dangling from his but-
tons always laughing and grinning
and talking to himself but bad men
aint anything new to you i reckon

   we have our share in texas now
ill be ridin see you again afore i
pull out

on gaining the street texas flew
into a sudden rage at seeing a
group of men around his mus-
tang laughing as eb whilks struck his
hat close to the brutes nose each time
he did it the mustang threw up his
head but did not attempt to bolt

  texas roughly pushed his way
through the group snatched the hat
from whilkss hand and scaled it high
in the air he shot three bullets
through it before it hit the ground
turning to the startled owner texas
snapped

   ive got three shots left-an ill
bet on myself quicker n i would on five

aces

   hit him in the head whilks so
hell eat hay like a hoss yelled an on-
looker

   what the hell you mean putting
your dirty paws on my hat demand-
ed whilks


argosy

   i dont like your hat or you and i
do like my pony

  you dont know who i am im

eb whilks

   yeah heard about you at baxter
springs they say you knifed a man
up the river while he was asleep an
had to make it a foot-race now you
abuse a poor cow-pony

   im unarmed gritted whilks
 put up your gun well settle this
later-if you dont skip out

   kill the damn cow-driver yelled
a voice from the open door of the sa-
loon  feed him lead candy

   he hasnt quit town yet whilks
grimly tossed over his shoulder

   im puttin up my gun said tex-
as  i know youre wearin one i
wont start to draw till yours is in the
open what say

   you havent left town yet re-
peated whilks with deadly meaning
but he made no attempt to draw as he
turned and entered the saloon his bluff
called

  texas vaulted into the saddle and
rode up the street his body half turned
so he might watch the saloon and the
loafers in front of it he kept a hand
on his gun until the corner blocked his

view

  he rode slowly eager to catch each
familiar bit of the landscape his gaze
quickened as he beheld a tall gaunt
woman with a red bandanna hand-
kerchief tied like a turban around hei
head coming toward him it seemed
as if he had seen her but yesterday he
would have sworn she was wearing the
same handkerchief she had worn ten
years back he used to be half afraid
of her because of the common belief

she was a witch

  he reined in but before he could

speak she was quietly greeting

   i knew i should meet you here at

this place and time washington
calm

  he dismounted and took both her
wrinkled hands and softly cried
 mam lize natural as life an twice
as hansome remember how you put
a spell on me so nothing could hurt me
the night afore i pulled out

  her keen old eyes read him through
she said  youve lived clean youll
die clean nothing else matters my
spell has worked

  rather bitterly he complained  i
wish some spell could have been put on
poor pap

   he died clean she quietly replied
 all must die some time he went
clean thats what really counts   
youve come back to see the old place
the cabins been burned

   jedge bvenck told me i shall miss
the mornin-glories

  you can build there your pap
would like to have you

  he shook his head

she insisted  some time you will
 im just a brush-popper mam
lize a cow hand folks know me as
texas im goin back its all im
good for

   find a lead mine stay here she
urged

  he smiled sadly and told her  i
can go straight to paps mine then
his dark eyes glowed brightly and he
whispered  show me the man who
killed pap-then ill stick here an work
that mine

he noticed she did not attempt to
dissuade him from believing in
foul play

   youll have the house facing just
as the old one did she said  i have
morning-glories grown from the seed
of those you knew as a boy you shall
have some
bad hombres



  he began to remember that mam
lize was accounted peculiar to the
point of dementia the ignorant feared
her but all young people instinctively
liked her she abruptly turned into a
woodland path and over her shoulder
called back to him  around the next
bend in the road youll meet some one
you know one who pitied you when
you lost your father she cried much
after you went away

  he rode on deeply touched by her
reference to his leave-taking but not
at all inclined to consider her words
seriously he rounded the bend at a
gallop and beheld a young woman
walking toward him she was bare-
footed and her dainty head was
crowned with a mass of corn-yellow
hair

  instantly he was recalling the
glory of her hair throwing himself
from his horse he cried out

  you remember me ellis jones
you remember me

  much startled she halted and
stared at him steadily then she was
exclaiming  washington calm
grown up to be a man

  he was quite demoralized to have
her burst into silent weeping as she
gave him her hands

   good land ellis dont do that
he begged

   its all so awfully sad she pit-
eously told him  many a night ive
wondered where you were and how
the world was using you

  his tanned defiant face softened
he awkwardly patted her hands and
confessed  ive sometimes pitied that
ornery little cuss myself but lets talk
about you    your ma used to make
cookies with caraway seeds in em
shes livin

   dead im living at the old place
with my aunt

   i remember her she sang a heap
at church meetins    im told our
old place was burned

   some one burned it she whis-
pered  some one i know she added
in the same low tone

  how they must have hated us
he bitterly exclaimed

   or feared you you must be very
careful until you learn whos your
friends

   im pullin out for baxter springs
in a day or so

  she was visibly disappointed  i
was hoping youd come to stay to
look for the lead-mine your father
found he must have found one he
gave mother a piece of ore thats rich
in lead

   pap told me everything i can go
to it i wanted to tell jedge byenck
this mornin but hed been drinkin
ellis ive promised the trail-boss id
be back but ill try to come here again
on many lonely nights id a felt a
heap better if id knowtn you remem-
bered me

   i shall always remember you
wash  be careful-say nothing to
anybody about the mine    now lets
go to the house and ill put on my
shoes and stockings and be a lady
then well walk to your old place
youll see lots to remember

   ellis i remember too much as it
is danby hasnt changed nor bettered
much seems to be filled with bad-men
and plain skunks hard work to rope
out an honest man from the crowd
ive seen so far

   judge byenck is surely one she
reminded

   one of two honest men here old
hoss face is tother i must see him

anything he says she warned

chapter ii

the strange cabin

texas slept at the jones cabin
and was off for town at an early
hour after promising to return
by midday pie arrived before the gam-
blers were abroad nor was judge
byenck in his office leaving his mus-
tang in front of the office texas com-
menced his search he drifted from
resort to resort and found most of
them empty he returned to the saloon
nearest byencks office and was stand-
ing outside the door when a blowsy-
looking man swaggered to a halt be-
fore him and asked

   be you the younker eb whilks run
out of town yesterday 

   no he didnt run me any

  if you be youd better be goin
fastern the devil can whip a bear
who are you

   reckon youve heard my name
its known from the end of louisiannv
to the end of texas im jo sling

  the name was spoken impressively
and the owner waited

  texas said jo what

   jo sling damn your eyes cant
you hear

  not with my eyes sling queer
name you must be a stranger in these
parts

   a stranger jo sling a stranger
the mans rage choked off further
speech for the moment he went for
a gun and received a kick on the wrist
that sent the weapon spinning

   i dont believe your names sling
-keep away from that gun

  the man was cowed although the
cowboy had not drawn a weapon

walking into the street texas picked
up the gun and carried it inside the
saloon he handed it to the bartender
and directed  at ten thirty this morn-
ing you can hand this gun over to a
man who calls himself jo sling

   an what if i give it to him now
 id feel sorry for both of you but
mr sling wont take it now even if you
offer it

  the bartender glared and bawled
 hi jo come git your gun

  sling came through the doorway
hesitated then turned back over his
shoulder he told the bartender  ill
call for it later

  as he vanished from the scene
texas airily remarked  feller like
him shouldnt be trusted with guns
im lookin for hoss face aint seen
him for years

   he comes in bout this time for a
quencher sullenly replied the barten-
der then maliciously  be you the
feller eb whilks dusted out of town
yesterday 

   youre the second hombre to ask
me that sling was the first if youd
been on deck yesterday youd a seen
mr whilks hivin up to this bar an
not interested in any man in the street
you can tell him i said i aint left town
yet

   eb whilks can take a scut like
you-

   take me like this cut in texas
and he darted across the bar and caught 
the mans nose between two fingers
and tweaked it smartly  dont pull
away there that what you mean

the barkeep rubbed his nose and
wiped the water from his eyes
and said  i got work to do
cant stand here chinnin

   well said my son work keeps
men out of trouble texas turned to
bad hombres



go but the bartender detained him sul-
lenly saying

   here comes old hoss face now
desiring to talk privately with the
man texas hastened to meet him out-
side the door in a low voice he said
 hoss face im tom calms boy
just back from texas i want to talk
with you

  jumpin hoppers little wash
calm growed up like a giant an
totin a he-mans gun talk reckon
ill talk my derned head off come in-
side while i appetize

   not here up along ill make
the bar free to you he linked arms
with the old man and led the way to a
more secluded saloon where he bought
a bottle of whisky and set it and one
glass on a corner table

   pour yourself a house-warmer
he invited  you remember that
wrestlin-

  dont groaned hoss face i
still dream about it god knows tom
an me was prime friends how could
that thing a happened with his own
knife

  texas waited until two more drinks
were gulped down then he reminded
 some folks say his knife fell out of
his belt that he fell on it

   all a derned lie spluttered hoss
face forgetting his first expression of
merely suspecting foul play  i was
goin to ask him to put his knife aside
when we started but it want in the
way of just a friendly scuffle he
pitched into me afore i could say any-
thing even if id wanted to the crowtd
got too close we swerved near a post
your pap had me round the middle an
was breakin me over he swung me
round to keep me clear of the post i
slumped down to bust his hold an fetch
him over my hip

  he paused and rattled the neck of

the bottle against the glass until he had
poured another stout dram

   you saw something whispered
texas

  hoss face advanced his lips close
to the waddies ear and murmured  i
see a hand come round the post it
grabbed at your paps back i see it
snatch the knife just the hand mind
you i see a tiny white line like a scar
on the second knuckle of the thumb
where the hide was drawn tight by
grippin at the haft it happened in a
jiffy i can see it any time all the
time never dared yip a wrord then
id been killed

   you saw the blow struck hoarse-
ly prompted texas

  hoss face shook his head  but i
felt your pap weaken i swung him
over my hip and he sprawled out on his
face i never dreamed he was mortal
hurt if id had time to think id
lowed some one grabbed the knife so
he wouldnt fall on it an bruise his-
self

   thats all hoss face my pap
was murdered but ill tell no one
what youve said ive a thousand in
gold down in texas ill give to learn
who grabbed that knife

   an i couldnt tell you for a mil-
lion whispered the broken man
 ive looked for that hair-like white
line on thumb knuckles ever since i
reckon it dont show if the hide aint
strained by grippin something as you
kindly said i aint told you nothin if
id bleated a word of this in as tough
a town as danby id woke up dead
long ago

texas had been convinced from
the beginning that his father was
the victim of an assassin he
knew the chances of discovering the
murderer even be he alive were most


argosy

remote few of the spectators of that
fatal match were alive the civil war
had intervened to account for some
old age disease and violence had
whittled down the remainder

 what had puzzled him and had
blocked any definite inquiry through
officers of the law was the entire lack
of motive his father had been one of
the most popular men in the county
he had kept out of politics and had
participated in no feuds it remained
a black mystery

  he allowed hoss face twenty min-
tites start and then made for his mus-
tang seeing judge byenck in his of-
fice he entered to give him greeting

   im mighty glad to see you
wash said the judge but im
peeved you wont put up at my place
just been movin round got to
be headin back soon met jo sling
this mornin hes got the notion he
thinks hes tough

   hes tough and very dangerous
warned the judge

   he might do drivin the drag but
never  the point looks to me like a
man whos sold his saddle

  the judge went to the door and
glanced out to make sure there were
 listening ears lowering his voice
he explained jo sling standing on
his own feet doesnt amount to a
damn hell kill in a second if he can
get the advantage but that doesnt
make him dangerous its the crowd he
herds with

   reglar outfit of em huh

   organization would be the better
word you hit one and you hit all
you might kill one or two but you
cant kill all

   whos the head killer

   ah my boy if we knew that there
wouldnt be any organization wed
lynch the leader as a lawyer accus-

tomed to undertake the defense of any
man criminal or honest i cant try
to purify danby its one of the tough-
est towns in the state no rascal can
afford to kill me as sometime he may
need me to defend him yet i never
take the street without these pieces of
jewelry in my waistcoat pockets
from each of the two lower pockets
he extracted a derringer of murderous
bore  now wash both as a lawyer
knowing criminals and as your friend

i	want to give you some good advice

   that id better pull out for baxter
springs interposed texas

  the judge bowed his head then
he summed up youve won the ill
will of whilks and sling i heard
about your run-in with sling when i
came down to the office wash i ear-
nestly advise you to ride for it before
the organization can snag you

   im likely to pull out pretty soon
but what does this gang do to make a
profit

   ive defended them for stealing
cattle and horses for jumping lead
claims and for counterfeiting north-
ern greenbacks also for the crime of
manslaughter

   texas folks wont take any paper
money too many confederate bills
down there mexicans wont take it
either

   nor will our folks here in danby
touch it but northerners prefer it to
gold that makes the game safer for
the gang money has to travel east
before its found out to be bogus our
criminal class goes on the old theory
that dead men cant talk

  	hanks anyway jedge ill be
ridin pretty soon an baxter
springs aint no piece of
heaven    queer that pap should be
killed just after finding a mine
bad hombres



   he had excellent specimens wash-
ington but i could find nothing on
your land as your lawyer and in a
way of speaking your guardian i put
down test pits after some miscreant
fired your cabin there were traces
aplenty but no body of ore your pap
must have picked up his specimens in
the hills somewhere

  he paused and produced a bottle and
two glasses texas shook his head
the judge drank a brimming glass
neat texas wished he might confide
in him but he was remembering his
fathers advice the judge was apt to
talk unwisely when under the influence
of liquor

   ril be talcin a pasear back to the
 run  an then to the springs found
some old neighbors left ellis jones
has grown to be a young lady

   remarkably handsome girl en-
dorsed the judge his gaze quickening
 fit to grace any station once shes
removed from hicks run

   an theres mam lize

   shes a damn nuisance said the
judge testily  she stirs folks up
cant get a nigger to work within a
mile of her

  texas took to the sidewalk and his
pony in the road kept abreast of him
when at the end of the street and be-
yond whilkss favorite saloon he
whistled and the pony came to hi-m he
finished the distance to the run at a
smashing gallop and dismounted at the
jones cabin ellis was quick to ap-
pear in the doorway to welcome him

  any one try to bother you she
asked in quick concern

   only sunday-school folks he
lightly replied  what say to a ride
out to the place of briers in the rainy
hills

   im ready now lunch packed

   ill start afoot you follow on my

  pony hes used to a loose rein and
a few pats on the neck

   youre thinking wrell be fol-
lowed

   i really dont not to-day later
yes give me half an hour and then
come hot-foot judge byenck
spoke real handsome of you

  she blushed and made a little curt-
sy  hell be going to congress aft-
er the carpet-baggers clear out hell
find him a handsome wife there

  leaving his mustang texas went
alone to the place of briers where he
had seen his first bear the spot had
not changed he thought except for a
narrow trail that led back into a fold
of the hills it had not been there in
his bovhood

   hossmen been out here quite a
bit he mused in surprise as he stared
at the trace

  then came ellis jones imitating
bird-calls he hurried to meet her
and found her quite resplendent in a
flower-besprigged dress and a beflowr-
ered bonnet it was her best apparel
and but poorly suited for the place of
briers

   folks been out here quite a bit
he remarked as he helped her from the
saddle

  the trail puzzled her too and her
questing gaze followed its winding
course until it dipped from sight be-
hind a ridge

   its the first i knew this was a
short cut to any place she remarked
 theres nothing beyond except your
land

leaving the mustang the two fol-
lowed the narrow trail clear of the
bush-growth and over the ridge they
found the track continuing into and
across the valley it seemed to end in
a growth of oaks texas in the lead
suddenly halted and pointing to the


argosy

oaks whispered  what in tarnation
does that mean

she stepped back into cover and
drew him with her he too had
heard it the sound of a door clos-
ing instinctively secretive both
crouched low and waited texas did
not relish concealment on his own land
but the girl pleadingly touched a finger
to her lips

  texas was quick to diagnose a new
sound that of a horse walking toward
them soon the head and shoulders
of a man showed above the bushes
the rider was eb whilks he pricked
his mount into a gallop and cantered
up the slope and over the ridge

  what next whispered the girl
 take a peek at the cabin

   why not  its on my land

   other men may be there

   i own this land he said harshly
and his hand dropped on his gun

  he led the way toward the half con-
cealed structure and no longer made
any attempt at secrecy the house
solidly built of logs was long enough
for two cabins the windows were of
glass and were protected in a measure
by bars of oak staring between the
bars his big hat shading the glass
texas remained silent for nearly a min-
ute the girl asked him what he was
seeing

   bunks for eight or ten men
tother end is partitioned off im
mighty curious to see whats in the back
end

   youll go in  she asked there
was shivery expectancy in her voice

   why not  its my house because
its on my land but id rather not
let folks know weve been here may be
more in this than just jumping a mans
land

  he passed to the windows of the

  shut-off portion and found them cov-
ered with thick slabs spying through
crevices was made impossible by inside
curtains of black cloth

   now i know im going to get in-
side this place he whispered  you
hide out in the trees if you see or
hear anything caw like a crow

  s id rather you wouldnt she pro-
tested  but-id like to go along
with you

  he smiled in understanding and mo-
tioned her toward the protective cover
she hastened to conceal herself while
he experimented with the door it was
secured by a staple and padlock he
solved the problem by finding a dis-
carded ramrod and using it as a lever
in withdrawing the staple

  once inside with the door closed be-
hind him he hastened half the length
of the interior and came to a second
door this also was secured by staple
and padlock he again used the ram-
rod and stood on the threshold of a
room that was in shadows

  an oil-lamp hung from a cross-beam
but he did not light it once his eyes
became used to the semi-darkness he
discovered a small printing press be-
side this was a small trap door which
he proceeded to open reaching down
one hand his fingers encountered pack-
ages of paper seemingly of equal
width and length fishing out one of
these he was amazed to behold what
purported to be greenbacks

   counterfeiters he softly ex-
claimed  workin on my land
damn skunks

  he scarcely had finished his little so-
liloquy before a shrewd scheme for
running the cattle through the south-
western part of the state past these
blockading outlaws and highwaymen
was forming in his quick mind

  further examination revealed all the
bad hombres



bills were tens with fifty in each pack-
age he took ten packages then re-
placed the trap and left the room

  driving the staple back with the butt
of his gun he soon had the door as he
had found it he repeated the process
at the outside door after dropping his
plunder in an old gunnysack

the girl came running to join him
eagerly asking questions he
hushed her with lifted hand and
quickly led the way up the ridge but
not along the trail he crossed the
ridge some distance east of the trail
and descended to the valley on a long
diagonal

  he soon found his horse and lifted
the girl into the saddle he walked
ahead leading the way farther east
and came to an open valley that ex-
tended northeast his eyes glittered as
he imagined it filled with texas cattle
swinging south in a wide curve he
continued his detour until back of the
jones cabin

  slipping to the ground ellis jones
fiercely demanded  will you talk
now

   just achin to young lady he
rapidly recounted what he had done
and found

   theyll know some one stole
them she warned

   but the locks are in place they
wont suspect nothin until they count
their money then theyll suspect each
other mebbe whilks was up there
alone to git some sort of private-like
every man in the outfit must have a
key to the outside door they cant
suspect us

   but why did you take any of the
miserable stuff you wouldnt use it
to cheat folks

   now now-

   i know you wouldnt washing-

ton you always was an honest little
boy

   only to cheat cheaters id use it
for that mebbe these outlaws are
skunks any game is fair to play on
em fight the devil with fire i must
git back to baxter springs in a rush
 oh  i hoped-thought you would
stay on the run for a while

   but im cornin back ellis some
day im cornin back for good im go-
in to work that mine

   why not now

   they wouldnt let me got to be
some house-cleanin before honest
folks can do much work

   youll see and talk with judge
byenck before you do anything hes
for law and order

  texas became grave as he explained
 i want to tell him things but i
dont dast to pap warned me when
i was a younker how the jedge would
babble things when on a drunk i must
play my own game until i need him as
a lawyer then he can talk all he
wants to

  he went with her to the house and
was glad to find her aunt absent he
stuffed a portion of the bogus money
into his boots and concealed the re-
mainder about his person he chuckled
and said  if anything bumps me hard
ill sorter scatter money all over the
country dont be sprised if you hear
the rattle of longhorns up this way
poppin like pistols if we can make
sedalia the herds all right an then i
may turn lead-miner

  if only judge byenck wouldnt
talk she sighed

  a man carries too much extry
weight that does that we use most of
our breath for breathin down in
texas now pm strikin due west
hittin the line north of the springs
he paused then said in a lower tone


argosy

 ellis-itd help a heap if you could
say youd wait for me

 m wait wash she whispered

chapter iii

a risky game

he rode that afternoon several
miles north of the town and
through unfrequented ways he
crossed the missouri-kansas line a
mile above his outfit and attracted no
attention as he galloped south

  his first easiness was to secure the
attention of bill and this required
much finesse as his fellow brush-popper
was winning at poker two minutes
of talk aside caused bill to forget the
game and his weathered face reflected
a continuing satisfaction

 its too tarnal good to be true
exclaimed bill  cuss th luck why
couldnt i been along what next
 i must talk with the boss none
of the boys must know anything about
it only you the boss an me sabe
 si senor go it you young devil
the trail-boss was in the depths of
despair the congestion of cattle ex-
ceeded anything ever experienced in
the history of the cattle trade he was
curt and inclined to be explosive when
texas insisted on a private audience

   keep your young troubles to home
ive got moren i can stagger under
he growled

   you just got to listen boss

   yaah listen to hear how glad
the home folks was to see you clear
out id be a dangerous man for even
john wesley hardin to trifle with

just now

   but you just got to listen how
do you like the looks of those and
he displayed several ten-dollar green-
backs

  forty dollars damsite moren
the old man will make out of this drive
clear out afore i spile a good gun-bar-
rel over your thick head

   but fve got lots of this-

   yankee money sneered the boss
 no one in texas will touch it

   its good as gold with the govern-
ment behind it softly insisted texas
 fve got five thousand in that sort
of money boss bill an me will buy
this missouri crowd an git a road
through to sedalia

   what train or bank have you two
scuts been triflin with harshly de-
manded the boss

   wrong guess when the game
opens have the boys understand its
the most tarnal hustlin game they was
ever up against put me on the right
point you goin ahead with the chuck-
wagon an the horses-the remuda
give us two days an well be clear of
this mess an so far toward sedalia all
hell cant turn us back

  the bosss eyes began to glow with
the toe of his boot texas drew an
imaginary map of the country north
and east of danby

   i know it texas impatiently
broke in the boss  i was over it afore
they put up the bars but whered you
git that money

  texas glanced around to reassure
himself of privacy and whispered
 its make-believe money i found
where they was makin it helped
myself the folks that git it will be
simply takin in what they themselves
were plannin to pass on poor unsus-
pect in critters no one knows i have
it

  the boss drew a deep breath hope
and a sardonic humor began to sparkle
in his deep-set gray eyes he said
if this game works you can have any-
thing the old man has
bad hombres



   bill an me will begin work to-
morrer now best begin fetch in the
cattle in closer to the line day after
to-morrer perhaps sooner oughter see
us on the trail

    ill have the steers ready fit to win
a foot race texas

   bill an me are goin out a ways
an dirty up this money looks too
new

   texas im goin to fix it to-mor-
rer so folks will be slow to wipe you
out if they catch you in a jam im
goin to use my right to draw on the
old man an put a credit of a thousand
dollars in the bank what will be paid
to the man who kills any man who kills
you

  it required half a minute for the
full significance of this arrangement
to penetrate texass understanding
then a slow smile lightened his usually
taciturn face he softly said  boss
that is the humdingest plan any hom-
bre ever thought up there aint one
in that crooked outfit who wouldnt kill
any other man in it for half that
money an any man whod want to
kill me would know he was just setting
a price on his own head

   ill start for danby at sunrise to
fix it promised the trail boss

   bill an me will make a early start
an git busy in buyin trail-rights
texas jubilantly assured him

texas was accompanied by bill
on his next visit to danby the
day after the trail-boss had gone
alone to town leaving bill outside
judge byencks office texas entered
and was warmly greeted after the
handshaking was finished the judge
said

   whats this business about your
boss arranging with the bank to pay
money to the man who kills your mur-

derer never heard of such a thing
before

   oh he got fidgety he reckoned
some one here might be rubbin me out
he thinks he needs me in the outfit
funny notion of his yet a pretty good
idea a thousand dollars is a lot of
money

                  

   it should thoroughly protect you
even in this rather rough community
my boy but its a cruel shame that
the son of one of our old citizens has
to fear for his life when he comes back
home

   sorter low-down agreed texas
 but lots of new folks have blown in
here since i was a kid you under-
stand jedge that reward money was
the bosss notion not mine i can take
care of myself

   not against a bullet from behind
moodily corrected the judge  but
who could wish any harm to come to
you

   eb whilks would laugh right out
loud if he heard i was dead so would
jo sling either one of em would pot
me in a second if he dared i had a
run-in with each of em when i was in
town before an whilks as good as
vowed hed git me

   piell think and talk differently
now grimly assured the judge
 whats doing now another hol-
iday while your boss tries to decide
what hell do with the herd 

   ive thought of a way out of it
jedge

   go along howr can that be 

   first we have twenty-five hundred
prime steers that will be worth nothing
if they aint moved soon baxter
springs for miles round is grazed out
tother herds cornin along make it
worse we cant move west we cant
drive back into the injun nation

   thats true regretted the judge


argosy

u and if you enter the nation the in-
 dians will steal all your cattle or tax
 you outrageously even-stephen but
 whats your notion of undoing this sad
 business

    buy our way through southwest-
 ern missouri to sedalia

   the judge whistled softly then
 warned  but that would take a heap
 of money

    well pay five thousand dollars for
 an open trail for our herd said texas
  gold 

    no no cant be gold weve
 been that desperate that weve sold
 some steers to northern men they
 had nothin but paper money the old
 man back on the home-ranch had con-
 siderable paper money that aint wordi
 a hoot down there he sent that along
 with the outfit thats just what weve
 got five thousand dollars in green-
 backs

   the judge grimaced and said  of
 course i know its sound as wheat but
 folks down here as in texas hate
 greenbacks the war made us all shy
 of paper money were still remember-
 ing our confederate money

    you reckon the toughs wont take
 paper money asked texas his voice
 uneasy 

    oh theyll take it but theyll
 want to discount it a lot

 rthey can call the five thousand
  anything they want to if theyll
 let us drive our herd through
 said texas sourly  but five thousand
 is all we have united states green-
 backs are worth a hundred cents on the
 dollar if theyre taken to st louis  
 see here jedge-an this is my real
 business with you-why cant you fix
 it for us youre a lawyer youve
 defended lots of these hombres you
 must know em you can handle it

  byenck shook his head and firmly
said  even the devil is entitled to hav-
ing his rights protected in court i do 
defend these roughs but i cant
stamp with my approval this sort of
bribery if you were buying a right
of way from the state that would be
different youre filling the pockets of
our worst citizens they know the
texas fever cant hurt anything
through this region but they use that
as an excuse to extort money it will
set up a bad precedent

  texas looked greatly disappointed
byenck walked to the window and
back then said im mighty sorry
my boy but id be particeps criminis
a partner in a crime id be encourag-
ing extortion bribery blackmail what-
ever you choose to call it but i un-
derstand your hard position i cant
blame you for making every effort to
save the herd i sympathize with you

   sympathy wont save our herd
jedge see here is there a man  can
go to an pay the money an have him
arrange it so it will stay fixed

  byenck stared at the ceiling and was
silent for a minute then he said

 whilks is your man if he agrees
to take your money hell pay off his
friends and your herd will go through

   an ive shot his nice newr hat full
of holes sighed texas

   he can buy several new hats with
his share of the money dryly re-
minded byenck

  texass overcast face brightened

 ill hunt him up pronto may have
to lay a gun on him till i can explain
things

   hes in his favorite saloon he
may shoot at sight

   with a thousand goin to the man
who nails him

  dawg-gone i was forgetting

    jnone of whilkss crowd will for-
get it an theres not one of em who
wouldnt pop over his own dad in a
second for half that money all right
jedge an thank you

texas rejoined bill and briefly
explained the situation and add-
ed  thats the way the game
lays bill you go in first an stand be-
side him hes the slickest dresser at
the bar git his attention till i can
drift close lay a gun on him if he
tries to act up then ill gentle him
bill nodded quite happy over his
part in the maneuver with straddling
gait he bore down on the saloon near-
est the law-office and entered he
heard a voice say something about a
 damn herder but for once he was
impervious to insults he recognized
whilks with one swreep of his gaze
down the long bar the man was
standing at the lower end and facing
the open door

  bill advanced and walked behind
him whilks instantly faced about and
glared at him suspiciously and
growled

   you got the whole state of mis-
souri to drink in what you crowding
alongside of me for

  whilks felt something pressing
against his thigh he glanced down
and saw the six-shooter bill had drawn
under cover of the bar

   you be a little gentleman stran-
ger murmured bill  got a little
business deal to put up to you you be-
have till my partner comes to explain
make a move an ill spile your person
wait an listen to my friend an youll
want to kiss me after its all over
beads of sweat dotted whilkss fore-
head both his arms were resting on
the bar

   a damn trap he muttered

    a

   no trap at all just iny visitin
card here comes my friend now he
comes with a peace-pipe if we meant
you mortal hurt it wouldnt take two
of us my friend wants you to do
something for him an hes willin to
pay high for it

  whilks glanced toward the door and
beheld texas swinging in the big gun
disquietingly in evidence  hell pay
high for what im goin to do for
him rasped whilks

   dont forgit that thousand blood-
money-an the joker im holdin
warned bill

  texas came down the line the
curious patrons turned their heads and
watched his advance on whilks with
keen interest and expectancy then
one by one they began drifting awray
from the bar some to take to the
streets the more resolute to seat them-
selves at small tables at the back of the
big room

  without any preamble texas his
arms resting on the bar began

   whilks we dont like each other
but i have some business you can
handle for me jedge byenck said you
was the hombre for me to go to this
means money for you-while if im
rubbed out it means a thousand dol
lars cash for the man wtho gets my
killer

   ive heard about that mumbled
whilks  but i didnt believe it

   its true but lets git down to my
bosss business im here talkin for
him his cattle will be a dead loss if
they aint driven to market pronto if
youll fix it for him to drive the herd
through to hit the missouri pacific
somewhere near sedalia ill hand you
five thousand hollars what say
whilks was nonplused  what sort
of a gum-game is this he managed
to ask


argosy

   its a five thousand dollar gum-
game our herds worth nigh to a hun-
dred thousand if we can git em to the
railroad quick theyre prime stock
an should bring forty dollars a head
easy twenty-five hundred odd of
em all steers theyll drive twice as
fast as a mixed herd an give no trouble
on the drag now can you make the
trail safe for em we shall put em
through mighty fast

whilks fanned his steaming
face with his soft hat and his
eyes grew lurid as he beheld the
bullet holes but the thousand in the
bank waiting to be paid over for the
body of the slayer of this offensive
cow-waddie was a deterrent to action
nor was whilkss share of the prof-
fered five thousand dollars to be light-
ly ignored clapping on his hat he
gruffly said

   you stay here you say youve
talked with byenck i want to talk
with him

   well be here calmly drinkin
beer assured texas just tell your
friends not to take no pot shots at us
whilkss lips twisted into a vicious
grin and he answered  they know
about that b  o o d-m one y too
damnedest notion i ever heard of

  he swaggered out to the street and
the two cow hands ordered beer and
drank contentedly after some fifteen
minutes whilks returned walking
smartly he advanced on the pair and
nodded his head saying  i can pass
the word to-day free trail for your
herd well have men watching to see
no other herd hogs in when do you
wish to work the riffle an when do
i get the money i must pay off a
heap of the boys

  we can start em day after to-
morrer spoke up bill  our herds

nearest the line well pass north of
this burg an make a forced drive the
first day

   then be at the line early in the
morning day after to-morrow and
the money

   ill have it ready for you before a
steer crosses the line promptly prom-
ised texas

  they parted and the two waddies
took to the street and swung into the
saddle and never once looked behind
them by this time the whole town
knew of the unique life-insurance
texas was carrying when the pair
were on the outskirts of the village
laughin diggs halted them by stand-
ing in the road and weaving his tat-
tered hat

   whats the matter old pard de-
manded bill

  hes crazy whispered texas
and then aloud  good mornin mr
diggs

   laughin diggs corrected the ec-
centric and he laughed infectiously un-
til he had to wipe the tears from his
eyes the two travelers guffawed in
sympathy

  no one shoots me along of my
bein queer said diggs  an they
dont dast shoot you along of the heap
of money in the bank but ive been
thinkin he was addressing his re-
marks to texas and the latter nodded
for him to finish

   i was thinkin why some of our
town smarties dont shoot you an then
kill some man that aint got any friends
an swear he done for you

   he may be crazy but he aint no-
bodys old fool said bill in a low
voice

  texas frowned slightly and told the
eccentric  that game wont work
genuine proof that the man killed was
the hombre who wiped me out must

be made at the bank cant be no
guessin about it no takin whilkss
or jo slings say-so

   folks clown this way can lie them-
selves out of tophet continued diggs
 i got a bad place in my head makes
life seem funny to me but i aint
crazy although my head is queer you
watch your step young feller

chapter iv

running the blockade

during the remainder of the ride
texas was silent much of the
time bill shrewdly guessed the
tenor of his thoughts and encouraged
 it ml soon be good-by to this chunk
of country our boys will see no one
pots you without showin hisself

   i wasnt chewin over that entirely
bill but as diggs says some outfit
down here could play that game name
a man they didnt like as the one who
had done for me but whats worryitv
me most just now is the chance of
whilks seein that our money is the
funny kind

  not in a full mooil bill firmly
assured  its been shook up in a dirty
bag an is crumpled an creased it was
too good a lookin job at first but now
it looks just like the greenies them
northerners play poker for

  when they reached their camp they
found the trail-boss had developed a
bad case of nerves he took texas
aside and eagerly listened to his re-
port

   once we git started we got to go
through with it the boss told him
 there cant be any turnin back if
the money dont set right weve got
to shoot our way through an save what
steers we can ive hired eight extry
men from other outfits whose owners

cant use em steers must go through
even if they spot our game

   once weve covered twenty miles
an are well north of danby well have
the worst of it behind us texas ad-
vised him  the whole drives about
two hundred miles as i figure it there
are several long grassy valleys where
we can slow down an make up for the
feed the herd loses at this end good
water all the way let me ride right
point an have bill pointin on the left
put all the new hands on the drag

  herd owners and trail bosses had
noticed the unusual activities about the
three-diamond outfits camp and
were trying to guess why extra hands
had been hired the shrewd trail boss
permitted them to believe that the herd
was to travel north along the kansas-
missouri line up to fort scott the
next day saw the cattle being driven
toward the missouri line with the out-
lying bunches being thrown into one
big mass the dust and rattling of
horns evidenced some radical action
and desperate owners vainly besieged
the three-diamond foreman to learn if
there was any advantage in which they
might participate

  early in the morning of the appoint-
ed day there was a definite movement
toward the line the trail boss and
texas came up on the right point

  some fifty men heavily armed
guarded the missouri border when
he got within a quarter mile of these
men texas galloped ahead carrying
a gunnysack across his saddle he
spotted whilks in the foreground and
rode up to him

  texas had no reason to believe the
bogus money had been missed from the
hidden cabin whilkss face was
screwed up in a frown but that was
his habitual expression handing
down the sack texas said


argosy

   here it is 

  whipping out a bowie-knife and
slitting the bag whilks cried  hold
back those damn cattle until i can
count it

  count it fast then twenty-five
hundred beeves make a lot of pressure
an we must go through a flukin or
theyll bull an stampede

whilks rapidly examined the
money counting a thousand of
it out in small sums and call-
ing each henchman by name to ad-
vance and receive his pay

   looks like it had been all over
hells half acre he told texas in a
loud voice for the din of the approach-
ing herd was rapidly increasing

  the chuck-wagon came up the  old
man  wearing a gun with several
notches he yelled  damnation
give us the trail we cant hold em

  he passed on before any one could
remonstrate whilks lifted his head to
survey nearly two miles of steers trav-
eling smartly  reckon its all here
boys if it aint well collect with in-
terest later and the  guard  fell
back to give the surging herd the right
of way the remuda passed on a mad
gallop seven extra horses for each
herder and texas was racing back
to take his position on the right point

  over the line swept the head of the
drive the missourians reappeared to
ride along the flanks and prevent
other herds from joining in the drive

  rival owners and trail bosses were
cursing and shouting and desperately
endeavoring to make last minute ar-
rangements for a right of way but
the great din reduced their outcries to
grimaces

  spurring up beside texas the trail
boss cried  it worked damme
texas if it didnt work

  drawn of face texas nodded and
wondered how long before whilks and
his followers would discover the truth
texas had sketched a rough map of
the route for the boss the course he
had selected would pass through the
long valley down which he and ellis
jones had ridden after the raid on the
counterfeiters cabin

  he considered this patch of the
route the worst danger zone as the
movement of the herd might draw the
lawbreakers to their cabin did this
happen it might follow that the cache
of money would be inspected and found
to be short but it was the most direct
route and texas knewr to shift the
course radically would arouse suspi-
cion

  ordinarily the herd would be driven
slowly and allowed to graze through
the early hours while kept gently mov-
ing in the right direction this time
the normal order was reversed and the
cattle were pushed

  as the herd strung out the natural
leaders forged to the front gaunt
steers that never would be content to
loiter with the drags since this was
not a mixed herd the drag-drivers had
less to do their work consisting mainly
of turning back chronic bolters steers
that had formed the habit of bolting
from the herd were shot down to pre-
vent stampedes

  through brush and broken country
the long line was maneuvered and
when it came time for the usual rest
and plenty of water they were urged
on the men on the point kept the
head a little east of north one great
advantage in the nature of the country
traveled was the absence of any  big
swimmins considering the country
all trail records were broken by the
time the weary animals were halted
for grass and water in the long valley
bad hombres



  texas tired in every muscle and
joint dully wondered how he could see
ellis jones after the drive was com-
pleted with whilks ultimately dis-
covering how he had been tricked with
his own bogus greenbacks texas was
certain no amount of  blood  money
in the world would serve to protect
him with the drive finished however
texas knew he would return to hicks
run let the odds against him be ever
so great

only the trail boss texas and
bill sensed the drama of the sit-
uation the rest of the outfit
were carefree believing real money
had bought the right of way they
wondered why there should be such
great haste in making sedalia

  the long hours of daylight were used
to the full when the herd entered
the grassy valley down which texas
and ellis jones had fled after their vis-
it to the counterfeiters cabin there
was no fear of a stampede the weary
cattle crowded along the run and drank
their fill grazed a bit and then lay
down

  the night-herders rode along their
flanks singing dolorous songs while
others sat on their horses above and
below the herd the continuous croon-
ing of the singers completed what ex-
haustion had commenced and the herd
slept

 the  old woman a grizzly
grouchy deadly specimen of humanity
despite his misnomer dished up grub
from his chuck-wagon he rejoiced
in an abundant supply of firewood the
caboose or  coony -an apron of
hide stretched under the wagon to hold
what stray bits of wood might be
picked up in plains country-was not
drawn upon the barrel of water
resting inside the wagon-bed with the

spigot protruding through the side of
the bed was emptied and filled with
fresh water from the creek under
such conditions the cook was almost
human

  cattle will not stampede so long as
they can hear the reassuring voices of
their herders and the timbered ridges
on each side of the valley discouraged
wandering from the bedding ground
two men were stationed a mile down
the valley one in the rear and one on
each side these were to guard against
surprise attacks the men could not
understand why such precautions
should be taken after thfe boss had
bought the right of way

  early in the morning the night-herd-
ers came in to snatch a bit of sleep
the day men went on duty and the
old woman served breakfast and fol-
lowed by the remuda pulled out to be
ready for the midday meal

  before sunrise the herd was up and
grazing the guards from the rear
came in and reported all quiet the
drag drivers took their positions the
long line was started moving and the
clattering of hoofs and the rattling and
popping of the longhorns drowned the
sound of early bird-calls and reduced
conversation to gestures

  along the top of the inclosing ridges
rode horsemen who were to look for
men coming in haste and on mischief
bent for the first three miles the herd
moved leisurely grazing as they ad-
vanced then the pace was increased
although it was more difficult to accel-
erate the herd on this lush grass than
if the trail had been hard-packed earth
at the end of seven miles the herd went
to water and were allowed to lie down
and rest during the noon-day heat

  texas nervously alert and picturing
many dangers was for pushing the
herd along but the boss insisted noth-


argosy

ing would be gained by such ill-advised
haste also he wished the herd to take
advantage of the rich grazing so they
might be in good flesh at the end of the
drive he estimated the first days
drive was thirty miles he planned to
cover twenty miles on the second day
and to average fifteen miles for the re-
mainder of the drive

only a miracle could permit the
repetition of the first twenty-four
hours penetration of the coun-
try small creeks could be death-traps
did the herd crowd down into them too
precipitately and it was difficult to
get the head of the herd out of the
water and on the trail again and to
round up half a mile of the thirsty
creatures fringing the western bank

  stubborn leaders had to be roped
and violently urged to mount the far-
ther bank the men on the flanks
crossed the cattle and then drove them
into what was to be the trail the
drag-drivers collected all strays and
kept the rear of the line in motion to
those who had popped cattle out of the
jungles of southwest texas this work
was not arduous but the new hands
who were used to driving in open coun-
try found much to learn

  day after day however the herd
forged on the chuck-wagon and the
remuda always on hand when needed
and always ahead when the straggling
files were in motion

  citizens of the state appeared occa-
sionally and complained that their cows
and oxen had been absorbed by the
drive when there was definite proof
of such assertions the boss made a
settlement when there was doubt the
complainant was generously told to go
in and pick out his property and re-
move it none of the latter class cared
to venture among the milling cattle

  many such complaints were so many
hold-ups and the trail-crew was hard
to bluff

  every now and then a sheriff ap-
peared and ordered the drive to be
turned back but there was no turning-
back two miles of longhorns by ca-
jolery defiance and a judicious pay-
ment of claims the herd was kept mov-
ing in the right direction

  the country people as a whole how-
ever realized the herd could not have
crossed the line without the permission
of the newton county men the drive
left considerable money among those
who had eggs butter bread and milk
to sell although there were threats
much grumbling and occasional shots
fired from a distance each day saw the
herd nearing its destination

  at last came the great day the day
when final arrangements were made
with the railroad to ship the steers
east the day when the trail-boss
clapped a hand on texass shoulder
and said

  young feller it worked damme
if we didnt put it through the old
man should make you a handsome
present its made you lots of enemies
in southwest missouri so well cut
across into kansas hit johnson county
an swing wide of newton county an
baxter springs this whole outfit is
about as popular just now as so many
trail-inspectors along the injun na-
tions line

 sorry boss but i must go back to
newton county just have to do it
 you damn young fool want to
git your throat cut  that money pro-
tection aint good any more

   ive just got to go back boss

   then youve got a fight down there

chapter v

  the man in the linen duster

it was late afternoon when texas
broke his last camp and finished a
five mile ride to hicks run sup-
per smokes were lazily rising from the
several cabins along the stream

  ellis jones was carrying a bucket of
water into the house as he swung off
his horse and whistled shrilly the girl
turned her face lighting up wondrous-
ly but almost instantly it became over-
cast

   you were glad to see me an now
you aint said texas as he took the
bucket from her

   ill be mortal glad to see you any-
where but here she told him  i am
horribly afraid

  his lips smiled but his eyes nar-
rowed  some one been lookin for
me have they found out how they
were sold

  she glanced up and down the creek
apprehensively and in a low voice told
him  armed men have been here
they asked no question just looked
around whilks and jo sling were
among them i feel as if they were
watching us now mam lize says its
dangerous for you to come back here
i was planning to write and send it to

ter springs laughin diggs was to go
down and find a man to carry it

   im keen to read that letter
ellis  mam lize believes in signs i
believe in my gun

   we mustnt stand out here come
inside supper will be ready in about
an hour

  the girls aunt received texas rath-
er coolly after the aunt had with-
drawn to the kitchen texas asked
 why doesnt she like me

  elliss face flushed yet she smiled
slightly as she explained  she thinks
i should go to washington

   wants you to marry the jedge
texas gravely asked and she nodded
he morosely continued  mebbe shes
right some difference in marryin a
jedge who can go to congress an
marryin a waddie

   all the difference in the world
washington so marrying a judge is
out of the question well go over and
call on mam lize

  as they walked toward mam lizes
cabin a horseman came riding down
the creek he reined in on beholding
the couple and grinned sardonically
and swept off his hat and bowed low

   howdy do whilks greeted
texas

   howdy driv finished i take it
going back to the ranch 

   i opine to after ive neighbored
here a trifle

   no trouble with the drive

  not moren ordinary

   glad to see you back and with
enigmatical smile whilks bowed to the
girl and pricked his mount into a gal-
lop swerving to enter the danby road

   hes up to something ellis re-
marked texas as the rider disappeared
around a bend

   hes up to something bad she


argosy

whispered  i do wish youd go-and
come back when its safe for you to be
here

  his bronzed face hardened  its
a pretty howdy-do when a native of old
missouri can be run off a crick he was
born on by an out-stater an a prime
scallywag at that

she placed a slim hand on his arm
and whispered if youll go now
-well be married and ill go with
you her eyes were pleading

  he caught her hand  youre a
yard wide an all wool ellis but i
cant take you down into the brush
country where id be just another
brush-popper i own land here its
my home i own a lead mine out in
the briery lotyou never can lose

will stand by me jedge byenck he
has powerful influence in these parts
 yes he has much influence in dan-
by but anything might happen up here

diggs is my friend he will be yours
texas smiled whimsically and mur-
mured  crazy

   hes queer but he knows more
than folks reckon oh heres mam
lize

  the eccentric woman was standing
in her doorway her white hair stream-
ing down her back at her side with
arched back stood a big black cat she
called out to the young people  glad
to see you two together a handsome-
looking couple but youre foolish to
come back here washington bad men
are talking about you in danby  ou
played some trick on them

   just what trick do you mean mam
lize

an old witch but come in

  after they had entered mam lize
demanded  now washington calm
you tell me why youre hanging around
these parts

   ellis an me will be married i
shall build a house on the old place an
work my lead mine

  mam lize nodded and said  i re-
member when your father came back
with his samples of lead-ore she
dropped a pinch of tea in a cup and
moistened it with water and threw the
contents into the fireplace the par-
ticles remaining in the cup interested
her vastly even texas was impressed
by her serious eagerness as she studied
the  signs with a little sigh she
put the cup on a shelf and warned

   danger deadly danger you can
escape it by riding back to texas
but-

  for half a minute the two waited for
her to complete her warning

  but what prompted texas

   youll never marry a girl from
hicks run if you go away

  nonsense mam lize protested
ellis

  the signs showr it if he goes to
texas itll be a weary long time before
he comes back

   im stickin here growled texas
 never had any other notion he
was very skeptical although he ap-
preciated the old womans solicitude
and sincerity he said jedge by-
enck wont stand by and see me rubbed
out those bad hombres know he can
make a lot of trouble for them

   even he cant fetch you back after
youre killed warned mam lize she
studied the tea-cup again and her gaze
grew less somber  i believe i can help
you washington you two leave me
now and ill set to work

  as the young couple walked toward
the jones cabin texas suddenly de-
bad hombres



cided  i must ride to the brier patch
where pap made his strike ill be back
in two hours about sunset the girl
wished to accompany him but he in-
sisted  i must work fast and be back
here before whilks can return with a
parcel of friends i shall want a pick-
ax

   we have one but if youre not
here by sundown i shall come looking
for you

   dont i may swing around to the
east and return a different wav stay
here

securing the pick-ax he took
the old trail but this time he halt-
ed short of the brier patch and
concealed his mustang in the woods
north of it

  much brush had grown up since he
was a small boy here with his father
and he was hard put to it to visualize
the place where he had seen the bear
in his mans eyes the place had
shrunk but he located the corner
where his father had found the signs
close to the surface

  he cleared away some of the bushes
and brambles then struck pick to earth
at the depth of a few feet he struck
native lead sulphid he noticed that
the bluish-gray luster tarnished after
a brief exposure to light and air

  another ten minutes satisfied him he
had struck the lode uncovered by his
father scattering cut bushes over the
spot he hastened to his mustang and
rode east for half a mile he dis-
mounted to dip up water in the wide
brim of his hat the mustang whin-
nied and texas started to scramble up

  the impact of cold metal on the
back of his neck turned him to a
statue

   stick up your paws commanded
a low voice

  he promptly obeyed and a hand
reached around his waist and secured
his gun he was next told  now
your teeth are pulled put your hands
behind you sling got him covered
 off comes top of his head if he
as much as winks came the reply

  texas did as he was commanded
and his hands were instantly caught
in a slip noose and tied fast then
whilks was before him taunting

  you reckoned you was a mighty
smart devil-be-damned sort of a cuss
eh how do you like that and he
buffeted the tanned face viciously

  texas breathed deep and slowly
said  i dont like it ill prove the
same some day

  sling raced from the bushes and
struck texas with his fist texas
kicked him off his feet with one swing
of his long leg getting to his feet
sling yelled  let me plug him
whilks intervened and ordered
 keep back you fool cant you re-
member orders help lift him on his
pony then up the back way to camp
they lifted texas astride his mus-
tang and one led the way while the
other rode behind with revolver ready
they crossed a low ridge and turned
west texas quickly got his bearings
they were taking him to the long
cabin but by a different route from

  	w

that followed by him and ellis jones
jo sling in the lead rode at a gallop
and that pace was maintained on ar-
riving at the cabin the prisoner was
roughly hustled inside and thrown to
the floor so that his ankles could be
tied

texas looked up at the gloating
whilks and reminded him  a
thousand to the-

   that bluff wont work roared
whilks  your boss withdrew the

money when the herd crossed the
line    whats bulging your pock-
ets 

  he thrust in a hand and fished out
the specimens his eyes glowed with
exultation

   youve fetched us a lead mine he
softly cried  that  pay half of what
you owe us for stealing our money an
paying it back to get that herd through
oh we know all about that business
now

  texas managed a grin with his
swollen lips and jeered  clear as a
christians eye now youve swallered
the bait youre cunning devils

   lead mine pays half that debt
your life pays tother half whered
you find the stuff

   i cant remember a thing while im
thrown an hog-tied

  whilks laughed shrilly almost like
a hysterical woman as he promised
 oh your memry will freshen after
we start a blaze an warm your feet
sling came through the doorway
announcing some one cornin lick-
ety-larrup

  whilks whipped out his two guns
and jumped to the door ordering
 stand by it may be strangers
texas heard the sound of several
horses outside raising his voice he
cried  inside here im a prisoner
look out for guns

  whilks chuckled and put on a tnaslc
sling did likewise five men all
masked filed into the room pointing
to the prisoner whilks proudly re-
ported  we bagged him chief and
hes found lead-his ore samples are
on the table

  unlike the others the leader wore
a long linen duster that came to his
heels and was tightly buttoned from
chin to below the wraist outside of
this he wore his belt and two revolvers

his slouch hat was too big for his head
and rested on his ears he stepped
briskly to the table giving no heed
to the prisoner all heard the queer
sucking noise he made as he drew a
deep breath between his teeth he
whispered something to whilks who
answered  he wont tell

  the leader pointed to the fireplace
and nodded to sling who at once
started a blaze texas glared up at the
leader and called out  listen you tall
galoot you cant burn nothin out f
me

  the leader appeared not to hear this
defiance he whispered again and
whilks explained  he was takin a
drink from the crick when we jumped
him chief it should be easy to find
where he found this ore

  the leader removed a shutter di-
rectly over texass head and held a
specimen to the light exposure to the
air already had dulled the luster but
there was no mistaking the lump was
rich in lead the leader inhaled again
with a soft hissing sound and gripped
the specimen more tightly texas ex-
claimed aloud as he saw the thread of
white the hair-wide scar on the second
joint of the mans thumb over-
whelmed by rage he cried  you
damn murderer you killed my pap
the leader whirled and glared down
at his accuser then he returned to the
fireplace and said something to whilks
the latter announced

   chief believes this man should be
rubbed out any reason why he
shouldnt be

  no one objected whilks then asked
it can be my job cant it i caught
him

  the leader nodded

  texas would have expected imme-
diate execution if it had not been for
the man busily heating two iron rods
bad hombres



he burst into discordant laughter and
defied  pache injuns couldnt make
me tell

the leader murmured in whilkss
ear who turned and directed jo
sling to cross the valley and look
for signs near where the capture was
effected sling galloped furiously
awav the leader sat with his back to
 
the prisoner no one spoke during the
period of waiting sling was back al-
most as soon as a fleet horse could go
and return

  the gangs caution was extreme
however when the thudding hoofs
were heard five men with drawn guns
stepped to the door one softly an-
nounced  slings using his hat for a
basket

  sling swaggered in his evil face tri-
umphant as he extended his ragged hat
to the leader the latter examined sev-
eral specimens critically and then pat-
ted sling on the shoulder all the
vicious company knew that the pris-
oner no longer possessed a secret

  whilks laughed silently and told
texas  hot irons couldnt burn it out
of you eh well we have it

  the chief stepped to the fireplace
and pulled out the iron rods whilks
eagerly advanced but was waved
back and the chief tapped a gun
whilks went for a weapon but the
leader caught his wrist and murmured
briefly then he passed into the second
room and closed the door two men
brought bacon and eggs and measured
coffee into a big pot

  like one in a trance texas watched
these preparations for a supper to be
genially eaten after he was dead he
had always believed in his destiny or
luck and now his faith was crumbling
the leader was as remorseless as fate

  you know what im skeered of

that old witch suddenly complained
sling  she oughter be rubbed out
 fine said whilks  go ahead
and do it

   ya-ah an have a damn spell put
on me

  texas spoke up saying  she made
a powerful medicine and told me just
what was to happen she told me
where i would find lead she saw death
for all of you if anv harm came to
me

  whilks gave vent to a volley of
oaths and kicked the prisoner in the
side and snarled just what would
happen to us if you got away to blab
 ill kill you for that kick whilks
ill git you just as ill git the beast who
murdered my pap

  youre gettin to be too much of
a prophet mumbled whilks he
reached behind him and picked up a
gun on the table sling quickly warned
 boss still in the back room    all
that money stolen-but orders is or-
ders

  the door of the adjoining room
opened and the leader appeared he
was carrying seven packages of the
bogus money he thrust one in his
duster pocket and gave one to each of
the men then he held up an open
hand to whilks and departed

   doesnt want to be close when i
pull trigger-scared somebody  hear
it and cut him off grumbled whilks
 got to wait five minutes

  he fished out his watch and noted
the time  if theres any lovin mes-
sages to a pretty gal ill be glad to
deliver em he offered sardonically

  texas gave up all hope and he
turned on his side to face his execu-
tioner his new line of vision included
the door to the back room at least he
was glad that the herd had gone
through his heart ached as he thought

of ellis jones waiting she might
never know what had happened

  even while his misery was clogging
his brain he blinked his eyes he knew
it must be imagination and yet the
door of the back room seemed to be
slowly opening none of his captors
noticed what he was seeing whilks
was leaning against the wall close by
the side of the big chimney sling with
two pails was unbarring the door to
go for wrater the other four men were
watching the prisoner

texas switched his gaze when he
heard whilks close his watch
the five minutes had ended
sling with the door ajar turned to
watch the execution then the miracu-
lous happened the door of the ad-
joining room was violently flung wide
open and streaks of fire and a hail of
lead threw the outlaws into dire con-
fusion

  sling dived through the doorway
the four men in a row pitched for-
ward or slid to the floor texas swept
his startled gaze back to the chimney
he was in time to see a section of the
wall closing to catch the glint of
whilkss gun barrel as the man sud-
denly disappeared through a secret
exit

  through the smoke came laughin
diggs but laughing no more behind
him were bill and two other texans
it was bill who set texas free and
stuffed a dead mans guns into his
hands diggs was frantically striving
to open the secret door by the chim-
ney without pausing to wonder why
a crazy man should suddenly develop
into a gunman in quest of criminals
texas came to his benumbed feet bill
was at his shoulder yelling  grab a
hoss grab a hoss

  he threw himself into his own sad-

dle and with the reins between his
teeth and guiding the mustang with his
knees he rounded the end of the build-
ing in time to discover two horsemen
mounting the ridge ahead the leader
was the man in the linen duster who
must have turned back to see the
meaning and outcome of this unex-
pected gun battle the other was un-
doubtedly whilks who was quickly
closing up the gap

  texas lifted the mustang to a faster
clip and bill fell in behind him a rod
or so back off at one side there was
an interchange of shots but texas did
not look around till he reached the
slope at the other side of the valley
over which the two fleeing horsemen
had disappeared when he glanced
back it was in time to see jo sling
pitch headforemost from his horse
diggs blowing smoke from the gun
that had ended jo slings mortal ca-
reer yelled for them to wait as he
came after them with the two punchers
but there was no holding texas and
bill with the last of their vicious
quarry just vanished over the crest of
the ridge

  when texas topped the slope two
shadowy figures were plunging into the
gloom of the bottom lands he thun-
dered after them the mustang running
like a rabbit on gaining the valley he
gazed sharply toward the east toward
the briars and the mine but he saw
no signs of the enemy bill distanced
was clamorously profane in demand-
ing that texas wait for him

  a vain shot from the south revealed
the route taken by the enemy texas
scarcely could believe they would take
the regular road to danby but they
seemed to be doing just that then
he decided they were banking on their
mounts to carry them to town where
they might lose themselves among the
bad hombres



four thousand townspeople texas
realized that did they gain the town
they could turn a mob of desperate
men against him he spoke to the mus-
tang and the wiry animal seemed to
find fresh speed

  as texas passed mam lizes cabin
he caught a fleeting glimpse of her
standing in her doorway a tallowr-dip
held high above her head although the
twilight was yet sufficient for one to
make out moving objects at ordinary
pistol range

  now on a level he bent low and dis-
covered that the two men had sepa-
rated he could see but one horseman
he thought he detected motion by the
side of the road and with the adept-
ness of a comanche he went over the
mustang and fired under his neck at
the vague figure without pausing to
investigate he pressed on it was two
miles to town and the men ahead
seemed to be closer the light was
fading but the waddie was used to
night-riding he decided the mans
horse had gone lame he was sure of
it when the rider left the road and
whirled about to meet him

the man in the duster opened fire
as he sat erect in the saddle
texas sat upright the reins be-
tween his teeth and fired rapidly as he
galloped to close quarters the man
rose in his stirrups and brought down
his gun with much deliberation one
of texass shots creased the town
horses head and caused it to rear and
plunge

  the masked mans lead went wild
then he drove the spurs homeonly now
he was coming to meet his pursuer his
purpose was to run down the slighter-
built mustang but texass intelligent
animal had dodged too many charging
steers to be so easily caught he

swerved aside and as texas fired he
whirled to bring his master up behind
the town horse

  bill was very close but did not dare
to fire for fear of hitting his friend
texass predicament was much the
same then bill swung low over the
side of his horse and as the masked
figure turned to shoot texas fairly
riddled him with his two guns bill
spurred forward and seized the crazed
mount by the nose texas dropped
from the saddle and to the side of the
still figure

  he tore off the mask and screamed
in amazement to find himself gaping
down into the face of judge byenck
the man was dead texas seized the
right hand and closed the fingers and
thumb tightly with his free hand he
lighted a storm-match there was the
tell-tale thread of white over the sec-
ond joint of the thumb even as hoss
face had seen it texas would have
collapsed had bill not caught him
under the arms and lifted him to his
feet all the time begging him to say
where he wras hurt

   im not hurt texas faintly re-
plied

  you be you little liar you tell
me

   just stunned by what ive found
under that mask its the jedge he
killed poor pap to git his lead-mine i
come back here an trusted him just
as pap trusted him think what hes
always been

   gorrymighty gasped bill  id a
heap rather think of him as dead   
hi hear that laughin diggs let the
hoots out of him the crazy woman
mim lize fetched diggs into the
game

   trail boss sent me an two hom-
bres up here to look after you and he
told us what to do


argosy

  diggs came up at a gallop cursing
roundly he had already found whilks
dead at the roadside where texas had
shot him and when he found the man
in the duster was also dead he relaxed
a bit yet he complained

   whats the use being sent here by
the federal government to round up
counterfeiters and then have you folks
spoil my game and stop me from being
in at the finish 

   bill here come your two texan
friends reckon they must a heard
the gun-firing said texas

   probly stopped to pick some purty
flowers growled the disgusted wad-
die

   ive had my eyes on byenck for
six months diggs went on  but i
never could quite close a case against
him he was the only one in town to
deal with crooks and the only man with
brains enough to handle them fve
trailed him repeatedly but he always-
got wise he was bein followed mam
lize gave me my first tip about that
shebang where they had you tied up
texas she came across it in some of

the

her wanderings    hear that worn
en-folks beginning to take a hand

  the last was prompted by a shrill
voice of a woman bill grinned and
wiped away some blood that trickled
down his freckled face and added
 shes cheerin for texas stead of
missouri

   callin my name ellis mustnt see
this

  and texas leaped into the saddle
and raced to meet and turn back ellis
jones

  bill was quite broken-hearted when
he learned that texass cow-days were
ended and that he was to remain on
the run to take a wife and work his
lead mine

  as the years passed washington
calms children would look ahead for
the coming of the dyed-in-the-wool
waddie who always visited the calm
family and called their daddy  tex-
as whenever he was heading home
after the long drive north the rail-
roads crawled farther west and never
again was there the need of driving a

 tense passions threaten an explosion aboard the dukes piratical
 schooner as it heads toward a south seas pearl treasure

by j allan dunn

 author of  glamour of gold  beyond the law etc

leading up to this installment

the  duke -monty allerton
an english gentleman gone
wrong-and his partner and first
mate  ginger  harris a bully of the
sydney docks are stranded in tahiti
with their schooner tied up by debts
but the duke hanging about the hotel
looking for a tourist sucker hears a
girl identify herself as thelma far-
leigh

  the duke knowing she must be
coming to visit the hidden pearl lagoon
of her father goes to the wealthy pearl

this story began in the argosy for march 



buyer wing lee to make a deal wing
clears the dukes ship which is the
only decent craft for charter in pa-
peete in exchange for a promise of a
third of the loot and he safeguards
himself by putting his own chinese
crew aboard the dukes schooner the
hihimanu

  the girl charters the hihimanu and
comes aboard with her fiance young
fred barrett barrett overhears
enough of a quarrel between the duke
and ginger to guess their plan-to bar-


argosy

ter the girl for farleighs pearls one
day as they near the isle ginger
drunk grabs the girl the duke fights
him barrett comes to rescue the girl
and ginger gets his automatic and
tosses it overboard the duke man-
ages to best barrett and locks the un-
conscious man in his cabin telling miss
farleigh she will be safe in hers

  the duke and ginger are close to an
open break over the girl-with the
cook ah fat and the other chinese
watching them with bland menace

chapter v

farleighs pearls

they sighted the island the next
day toward noon the position
as given by the girl was exact
and so was the dukes navigation

  it showed first as a dark blue stain
against the sky a low turtle-shaped
hump

  the duke and ginger were both on
deck gazing at it with greedy eyes
their differences apparently forgotten
the girl ignored for the time there
lay fortune ease idleness and indul-
gence as long as the money lasted for
ginger it might not be long but the
duke did not mean to scatter his too
lavishly he saw himself back again
not in england but on the continent
where a man could live well and com-
paratively cheaply

  money bred money with his luck
changed he could enjoy himself as a
gentleman especially if he had a
double share he looked furtively at
ginger whose face was flushed through
the tan with liquor and excitement a
plan began to formulate it was just
the sort of scheme that would hatch in
the dukes brain it had elements of
humor in it that appealed to him

  if ginger tried to hold the girl the
duke would frustrate him with the
trove practically in sight the duke
came to a decision that the pearls were
the thing cynically now he regarded
his feelings toward thelma farleigh
they had sprung largely from the fact
that ginger wanted her the duke had
been guilty of being jealous of ginger

  a man would be a fool to entangle
himself in such fashion she was de-
sirable true but there were others who
would be far more complacent far
more to his taste than this girl who
would give nothing any victory of
possession would be brief and igno-
minious and she would ultimately have
to be got rid of the duke surveyed
matters calmly he had no personal
desire to play the hero and it would
be a false role inasmuch as he was
robbing farleigh he did not expect
or desire gratitude from the girl or
from farleigh but it would be a de-
lightfully dramatic touch

  he would defend the girl and kill
ginger in her defense the crew-
wings crew-would see it testify to
it it left the duke with no need for
explanations as to why ginger was
missing or why the duke had fallen
heir to a double share

  wing would keep to the letter of his
word that was a curious trait about
the chinaman in the eyes of the world
he might be a rascal clever and un-
scrupulous but he would keep face
with himself his word was his bond

  the more the duke thought about it
the better he liked it there had been
many times when he had measured
ginger had looked forward to match-
ing his skill and strength against gin-
gers force he believed he could win
but there was always the doubt that
made it interesting he wondered
whether ginger had any counter plan

                      	a
looters luck



  they had been partners sharing
equally in profitable and unprofitable
ventures but never with a fortune like
this at stake ginger would make
ducks and drakes of his in short order
and the abduction of the girl would
bring more complications ginger
should not have her nor any of the
money that was settled

the wind was faulty beginning to
die down in flaws of breeze gin-
ger cursed at it a current set-
ting round the distant land seemed to
hold them back the sky was cloud-
less the duke knew what it was in
these fickle seas to sight land and stay
in sight of it for days

   lets start the engine said ginger

   were saving our gas to get back
said the duke  we wont want to
waste any time i expect to make
things a little difficult for farleigh to
get clear once he does hell get busy
we want to be well way from tahiti
by then

  ginger though muddled to some ex-
tent by gin saw the wisdom of that
he looked moodily at the crew wing
had provided for them and shifted his
curses to that astute chinaman

  the duke smiled to himself wing
was clever but he could be clever also
too clever to try to circumvent wing
in any obvious way after all wing
was going to buy the pearls for cash
he might sell him only half gingers
half and keep his own for better
markets abroad

   were in no hurry at this end the
duke said  i know you want to get
your fingers on the pearls so do i
but im looking ahead there may be
wind at sunset the barometer stands
for change were not far from the
monsoons this time of year you should
learn to cultivate patience ginger

    	a

  to hell with patience gingers
eyes were bloodshot he wanted to
finger the pearls and he wanted the
girl he meant to have her if the
duke interfered so much the worse
for him there would be a show-down
and he ginger would win the duke
thought he was superior with his
 looking ahead but ginger saw a
vision of the duke past using his
brains two shares were better than
one if the girl was the issue of the
final quarrel it would serve as well as
anything

  with each calculating the others
murder they watched the stain on the
horizon the quartermaster at the
wheel watched them with a sphinxlike
face as they came aft ah fat watched
them from his galley those two
chinese had their orders not only for

        	w

things as programmed but for con-
tingencies

  they were on the starboard tack
barely moving the hihimanu heeling
lightly from her cabin port thelma
farleigh saw her fathers island and
built her hopes on him her lover had
done what he could against hopeless
odds she cherished his efforts but he
could not help her she recalled her
fathers letters of late they had
grown more and more affectionate in
response to hers

   the grief that had sent him a recluse
to the south seas had dulled writh time
and with the growth of his daughter to
womanhood she did not mean to leave
him she had not expected to fall in
love aboard the steamer when she
had started to come to visit the island
home he had pictured so vividly and
then to go on round the world but
she knew her father would approve of
her choice the three of them would
be together she would not let him be
lonely again


argosy

  she had his letters with her and in
her imprisonment in her cabin she took
them out

   i am a rich man my dear far-
leigh wrote  fortune which robbed
me of your mother has tried to recom-
pense me by flinging wealth into my
lap it is wealth that will help to make
you happy i have been too selfish in
my grief you will soon be finding
some one you love let that not part
us even if this seems selfish also

   it is lonely here i have only na-
tives stanch and stalwart they have
worked for me and they will be re-
warded they wtould protect me but i
have other plans for that in case some
one envies me my pearls of course
they know in tahiti that i have
found a rich lagoon some have tried
to discover where it is but i have taken
my precautions what i have i hold
that is the motto of my family wealth
is not everything it cannot cure heart-
ache but you can and i will try to
make up to you for my neglect

  what were the precautions he had
taken could they stand up against
these men who held her as hostage
she did not know which man she
feared the most she did not know
that the crew had been recruited by
wing and it would not have comfort-
ed her much if she had some of them
might be friendly to her but wthat
could they do

she could not communicate with
barrett because of the alleyway be-
tween their cabins but ah fat
told her that he had been given food
now ah fat had failed her she had
tried to bribe him and through him
the crew

   my father is a rich man she told
him  these two men your captain
and your mate want to take his pearls

from him or hold me they may try
to hold me anyway ah fat if you
will talk to the rest warn my father
and see he is not robbed he will give
all of you plenty

  you wantee us kill them asked
ah fat as if he had been asking her if
she wanted sugar in her coffee for a
moment the girls eyes flashed passion-
ately dimmed as ah fat frowned

   no can do that he said  i lookee
out along of you do all can do but
no can do what you wantee

  the chinese were beyond compre-
hension she told herself sadly as ah
fat smilingly set down the tray he had
brought her he meant well to her
yet he would not help her father and
she feared that his  lookee out 
meant only to see that she was well
treated up to the time of their arrival

  the wind had died and they rose
and fell on long heaves of the sea
panic came over her and she sought
for a weapon nothing better than
small scissors a file again gingers
touch seemed defiling her she saw
again his evil face the duke had pro-
tected her for the time but it was be-
cause he wanted to show her to her
father unhurt she had wit enough
to see that but-if they got the
pearls

  there were six men with her father
against ten on the schooner aside from
herself and barrett they would take
her father by surprise they would
hold her as hostage she fought against
her terror finally before the portrait
of her dead mother and the only one
she had of her father she prayed

  the schooner wallowed on the
breathless sea fish broke the surface
pursued by enemies birds swooped
through the air to capture them na-
ture was cruel the strong preyed on
the weak
looters luck



  barrett bruised and aching had not
seen the land his uselessness stung
deep he knew they were close in and
he cudgeled his brains for some way
to circumvent the pair of scoundrels
if farleigh could be warned

  even if he could get ashore it
meant he would have to leave thelma
but he could not aid hen he was help-
less a failure at taking care of the
girl he loved he would cut a sorry
figure before farleigh in her eyes her
father robbed-that did not so much
matter barrett had means but he
had shown himself a weakling he re-
garded himself with infinite unjust
contempt

  he too had tried to bribe ah fat
though he could only promise money to
be obtained in tahiti he had not much
with him beyond a letter of credit he
had fancied that ah fat might be
skeptical of any order on a papeete
bank but he could make nothing of
the cooks smile as he gave his
formula

   solly no can do

  his only chance was to get to land
and warn farleigh but the port was
far too small to let barrett through

his only hope was the door hinged
on the inside they had his gun
but they had taken nothing else
-it stung to see how they disregard-
ed him

  he had a knife in his kitbag that
held a combination of several useful
tools among them a screwdriver but
there were difficulties that seemed to
be insuperable he could swim few
white men better many natives not his
equal but they would have to be fair-
ly well in for him to get his bearings
he knew little of the south seas by
experience but he had listened to tales
on the ship and in the club at papeete

  coral reels were often half a mile
wide the seas rolled and broke over
them foaming above jagged live coral
that cut and poisoned a man could
barely hope to get across alive there
would be entrances one main one
which he must locate and there would
be sharks it all seemed pretty hope-
less but he had to do something

  he hid the knife beneath his mat-
tress

  ah fat brought his noonday meal
smiling as if there had been no ques-
tion between them of bribery some-
thing perhaps that ah fats oriental
mind would not resent after the
chinese left barrett took the half-
melted canned butter and greased the
screws with part of it saving the rest
the screws might be rusty and they
must not squeak

  he could do nothing until nightfall
then all lay in the laps of the gods
the hihimanu rocked on the ground-
swrell swinging writh the current he
saw the island a long way off and
wondered why they did not start the
engine that was a stroke of luck
whatever the reason it meant they
could not fetch land before nightfall

  barrett had yachted handled sheet
and wrheel he knew something of
navigation and hoped rather than fig-
ured that a breeze might come with
sunset he did not think they would
go in after dark

  ah fat came in with his supper to
find him lying in apparent despondency
in his bunk barrett had wiped the
grease from the heads of the screws
hoping it had sunk in through the
wood

  he asked about thelma ah fat
beamed

   missy all lightee you not wolly
about missy

  he and thelma had discussed the


argosy

cooks friendship barrett was skepti-
cal as to the depth of it ah fat was
only one of a crew gathered for the
purposes of loot yet he might help
in a pinch

  the breeze had come they began
to slip in toward the land now they
were on the port tack he saw the
island looming larger before the swift
night came down after the blaze of
sunset luminous ripples laved the
schooners sides and the wake glowed
with seafire

  he worked at the screws they re-
sponded  and with his pulses beginning
to hammer barrett waited if they did
not go in they would hold off and on
as long as the wind was favoring so
as to be close up at dawn

  there would be some of the crew on
deck he would have to wait until the
duke and ginger turned in it was
probable the quartermaster would have
the wheel which faced the head of
the companion way if barrett tried
that exit he would inevitably be seen

  he had a first-aid kit supplemented
by drugs he had thought would be use-
ful in the islands permanganate of
potash among them there was
plenty of water in his cabin in the lav-
atory hold-all he was dark of eyes
and hair

  there was slight risk of any ones
coming in barrett was ignored an
unconsidered failure he supposed
they had made up their minds what to
do with him set him ashore if they
delivered the girl if they meant to
hold her-and he trusted neither of
them-his warning to farleigh might
prevent it it was the pearls they were
after first and last

  he stripped to the buff mixed his
permanganate and soon he was a deep
purple the color of an indelible pencil
he dyed himself from scalp to waist

and from the soles of his feet to his
calves

  these warm nights the crew usually
padded about the deck clad only in their
white pantaloons he had plenty of
those he dampened a pair and put
them under the mattress to eliminate
the creases the too well tailored ap-
pearance it would be only a momen-
tary camouflage he might need if he
needed it at all a disguise sufficient to
pass muster by starlight two or three
of the crew were tall as tall as he was

  the sea ran dark now save for the
gleam of phosphor from the swarming
noctilucidae that gleamed in the crests
the island could only be made out as a
mass that shut out a segment of the
starry splendor of the sky barrett
walked up and down his room while
the stain dyed changed to dark
brown

the duke and ginger held the deck
after their supper

        im not going to try and go
in till morning said the duke  i
dont know where the reef-gate is and
i wouldnt risk it the tides wrong
anyway

   theyll ave sighted us protested
ginger  e knows shes cornin
ell agger any ship eadin up for is
place is bringin er mabbe ell send
out a pilot in a small boat

   not till the flood starts if one
did come wed send him back with
word wed come in after sunrise im
not going to play this game after
dark

   ave it your own way said gin-
ger  it  old over you goin to
talk with the girl tell er ow to act
 that wont take long shell stay
in her cabin to-night im playing this
hand ginger and youll jolly well stay
out of it till weve got the pearls
looters luck



  the duke had his gun in its shoul-
der holster he was making sure of
ginger he watched him through the
skylight and saw him start drinking
disdaining a glass swigging from the
neck of the squareface bottle it suit-
ed the duke even gingers great body
could not hold up for ever against so
much raw hollands his brain was
already fuddled the liquor might
foment his lechery but the duke was
ready to offset that

  the sound of breakers came faintly
against the wind through his night
glasses he could make out a vague line
of surf against the dark bulk of the
land

  suddenly a spark of light showed
motionless that should be farleighs
house lit up not only for night but
as a welcome the reef-gate should
be somewhere not far out of line

  the duke held on he did not mean
to get too close there might be mush-
room coral outside reefs though he
doubted it from the steep lift of the
land the island was a volcanic atoll
possibly a long dead crater with its
scars vanquished by tropical growth
the pearl lagoon covering the bottom
of the pit that had once belched forth
fire

  these were only speculations the
duke was dealing in realities in sea-
gems shimmering with soft iridescence
gems that women coveted and men
paid big prices for

  it was a harvest that farleigh had
reaped but which the duke would mar-
ket-two-thirds of it his own ginger
was already fated for the discard

  he made out a gap in the long line
of foam plainest now at ebb tide sat-
isfied he gave the order to come alout
they swung out to sea ginger was
asleep with his head on his hairy arms
down on the table sodden the duke

looked down at him with a grin he
could do him in easily enough now if
it was not for the crew the other way
a fair fight that would be the climax
of the dukes fighting days was also
far the wiser he held a shrewd no-
tion that wing might not stand for
cold-blooded murder might use it as
a pretext to claim gingers share or
part of it he could not in honor if
the killing appeared perfectly
legitimate

  also wing would be very apt to
applaud the dukes defense of the girl
her abduction would inevitably cause
a row sooner or later wing would
steer clear of any entanglements he
was a partner who might object if the
program was not carried out as
planned and-the duke gloomily ac-
knowledged it-wing had the whip-
hand for the time being they had
nothing on him

  wing did not appear would not ap-
pear in the transaction but if it went
awry he might take a hand still hid-
den that would spoil their coup he
was a man it paid to play square with
until he had bought the pearls and the
duke was gone

  the duke meant to sell the schooner
and to take steamer to the mainland as
soon as possible lose himself in the
shuffle of americas millions he
would breathe freer then no one in
papeete would bother about ginger
he could tell a dozen stories to account
for his not coming back wing would
say nothing nor the crew

  the dukes face was sinister as he
turned from the skylight a few more
hours and he would be sitting pretty
he gave instructions to the quarter-
master short hitches off shore and on

   im going to turn in he said

  he shook ginger by the shoulder
and roused him enough for the matq


argosy

to curse him for his interference and
fall again into his drunken slumber

  stay there you damned fool
said the duke  im going to get some
sleep

it was gratuitous information to
ginger but barrett close to his
door welcomed it he too had seen
the light vanished now on the newr
tack as they went out to sea all hung
on the next tack they wrere reaching
with the wind just abaft the beam it
would be slightly forward on the re-
turn they wrould not be close-hauled
the sheets might not be shifted they
would pick up their leeway undoubted-
ly steer for the light barrett wtould
wait till then he wrote a note to slide
under the girls door if he got a
chance

    im swimming ashore to warn your
  father wish me luck  love you al-
  ways	fred

  she might not be awake but she
would see it without fail before any
one else she would sleep lightly this
night if she slept at all

  at last they heeled came about he
saw the light again steady ahead on
the port bow well off it the schooner
slogged through the seas barrett had
to time things closely but it was hard
waiting

  the hinges came off he slid the door
back slightly saw ginger sprawled
over the table snoring the dukes
door was closed

  barrett saw gingers gun holstered
in a belt about the pyjamas the mate
wore day and night of late careless of
how he looked or how he might appear
to the girl for ginger women were
provided for his pleasure not he for
theirs a frowzy disgusting object he
was

  for a moment barrett thought of

taking the gun clubbing ginger hold-
ing up the duke running the schooner
he had sense enough to know it was
quixotic impossible he could not sub-
jugate the crew he dared not bank on
ah fats friendliness-he had already
tested it and had encountered its
limits

  it wras no good to take the gun
along the sea would rust it if not
greased and he had no time for that
his butter was all gone he had little
time at all if he was to swim ashore
and he would need all his skill and
strength to make it he did not know
as the duke did that the tide was still
ebbing though it would change before
dawn

  that was not so far off nearly one
oclock by his watch he had left it in
the cabin where he had closed the door
as well as he could that closed door
might pass muster until some one
called him or ah fat brought him
breakfast before then the crisis
would be over farleigh would be
warned or else barrett wrould be turn
bling in the surf or would have become
a sharks meal

  he thrust that last thought aside
with his stained skin he would have
a better chance he thought from what
they said about sharks but even if he
discarded his pants his middle would
show white no time to change that
now

  farleigh would surely have arms
he could not tote that gun the loss
of it might give him awray too soon
ginger might come out of that ster-
torous slumber

  he slipped the note under thelmas
door no light showed then he got on
the transom cushions beneath the part-
ly open skylight pulled himself up
wriggled through and lay close against
the coaming he had not been seen
looters luck



the watch was forward crooning
chants

he rolled to the rail crept for-
ward the mainsail hiding him
from the wheel they were close
in he climbed up by the forward davit
that held the port whaleboat hung to
it overside and with a little shiver
that was quite explicable dropped into
the sea he went down deep to come
up in the schooners wake praying that
no one would look that way

  almost instantly he heard the
quartermaster cry out they were only
tacking but he had dived swimming
under wrater when he came up he saw
the hihimanu had gone about they
held on seaward and he struck out for
the reef-gate and the light still burning
ashore

  he swam in a strong crawl his legs
churning and found he was making
slight progress tide or current or
both must be against him he changed
to a slow strong breast stroke his eyes
fixed on the light here and there he
saw gleams of breaking phosphor and
he goosefleshed with the normal mans
dread of ranging sharks nothing came
near him the gleams were made by
night-hunting porpoises or dolphin he
told himself bucking the water that
held him back

  he began to tire but could not risk
turning on his back for rest lest he lose
too much ground the schooner would
be coming back if they sighted hifn
they would rouse the duke he held no
illusions of mercy they would riddle
him his arms were getting heavy

  he changed to a side stroke and
found himself forging ahead the sea
 longer bore against him the tide
had weakened it was the slack be-
tween ebb and flood heartened he
kept on scissoring steadily his legs

still strong he fancied the rollers were
helping him the surf was close he
could hear the furious roar of it and he
trod water waist high

  there was the light like a beacon
now he saw the gap in the white
water

   sharks come in with the flood to
the lagoons behind the barrier reef
some one had told him that the
thought of the grisly sea brutes with
their cold rasping hide and their tri-
angular teeth in bristling rows within
enormous maws persisted he was
opposite the opening when he saw the
first sickle fin cleaving the waves he
had long since kicked off his soggy
pants and was swimming stark-naked

  a fin swerved toward him and van-
ished he goosefleshed as he thought
of the snap of jaws the drag down
he put all that he had left into a spurt
that carried him between spouting
fountains of foam livid here and there
with the seafire he was in the passage
once his feet struck bottom between
two rollers and he thought he was
seized

  but the tale he had been told was
true the reef-gate was still too shal-
low for the liking of the sharks they
might not have seen him and he was
inside in smooth water striking out
with a trail of greenish light at every
movement

  he put down his feet twice the
second time he felt sand and waded
out tired but victorious he had
fought a good fight he made out
a wharf with a schooner moored be-
side it the light was still shining as
he came out of the water his knees
more than a little weak

  the beach curved in a long crescent
the house with a light was on a low
bluff at the foot of this grew dense
hala and shore-scrub there were trail-


argosy

ing vines in the sand he made for the
head of the wharf and found a trail
it became a pebbled path between or-
derly shrubbery the heavy scent of
flowers was in the air

   what you do along this place

  a man naked save for a loin cloth
had stepped out of the shrubs rifle in
hand its muzzle presented to barretts
unstained middle he must have looked
like a piebald puzzle to the native but
he had won through his voice was
confident as he answered

   i want to see farleigh

  an idiot could see he was unarmed
defenseless but the man hesitated

   what for you want to see farali
dont be an ass barretts tem-
per flared  ive swum off from the
schooner to see him take me to him
his decisive voice held mastery aft-
er all this was a white man back and
belly a white mans voice authori-
tative

   you go ahead along path said
the native  i come along too

there was no doubt of that bar-
rett knew the rifle was pointing
at his spine only a few inches
from it in this fashion nude as the
day he was born he was ushered on to
a veranda where another kilted native
stopped on sentry-go to confront them

  the door opened with a flood of
light that revealed barrett a white
man in pyjamas and dressing gown
stood there erect though white-haired
barrett saw his profile for a moment-
hawk-nosed firm of chin high of
brow

   im barrett he said conscious of
the fact that his name meant nothing
 fm your daughters fiance shes
aboard that schooner theyre after
your pearls mean to hold her until
they get them locked us both up after

a fight i had with one of them they call
the duke

   that will be enough to start with
said farleigh  come inside barrett
my girls fiance the duke i want
to know all about this and vou need

                                             j

some clothes and a drink youre a
bit fantastic as you are come in

  it was a big room the floor covered
with matting the furniture of bamboo
chinese make native tapa on the walls
trophies of native weapons now bar-
rett saw farleigh plainly felt the cool
assurance of him the news had not
staggered him there was even a hu-
morous glint in his eyes

   i thought she was aboard the
father said  it was too close to dark
to be sure of the schooner so it was
the hihimanu take a slug of scotch
barrett youll need a shower my
clothes will fit you pretty well then
well talk about the reception of our
distinguished visitors thelma has ac-
cepted you youve got pluck to swim
ashore and you must have used
brains

  barrett took the drink it warmed
him

   there are eight of them in the
crew besides the duke and ginger

   ah theyll come in on the flood
with the sunrise i have only four
men here i sent the rest away last
month  dont think i fail to appreci-
ate what you have done but i am not
unprepared for unwelcome visitors
they want to trade thelma for the
pearls well she is worth them
barrett hardly knew what to make
of him but he took the shower
stinging cold water from mountain
sources piped to the house dressed and
returned farleigh was seated smok-
ing a cheroot

   try one he said  we cant do
much before morning i was not
looters luck



sleepy waiting for my girl the duke
and ginger a precious pair

  barrett told him all that had hap-
pened farleigh smoked through the
recital

   six of us all told he said at last
 and ginger if not the duke has
ideas that are not surprising from that
source well thanks to you that part
of their program will not be put on
 not if youll give me a gun
from what i remember of the
duke and ginger they are pretty
handy with guns themselves the duke
plays a good game of cards hell not
throw away a trick

  they deserve killing sir they
are just a pair of pirates said barrett
hotly

   no doubt take another drink
well have something to eat before
they come but there are better things
than killing even for pirates i think
they will have to be satisfied writh the

     r

pearls

   youre not going to let them have
them 

   i might farleigh tapped off a
long length of ash  thelma comes
first

   of course but youre not going
to let those twto unspeakable rascals
get away with your pearls i-ive
got plenty of money mr farleigh
enough for all of us but-

   ten to six said farleigh  the
odds are against us i have what they
want they hold thelma do you
know anything about jujutsu
japanese wrestling tricks

   more than that it is the principle
of allowing your adversarys strength
to become his weakness do you want
to lie down

   no sir

  farleigh smiled

	 then well sit up together i do

my own cooking how about some
scrambled eggs fresh ones a strip or
two of bacon and some coffee

   arent you going to make some
preparations

   i have already made them barrett
they are not visible howrever i think
they will suffice but well play the
game when the cards are on the table-
or the pearls lets go into the kitchen
you must be hungry after your swim
barrett followed his host he still
felt the magnetism of the others con-
fidence but he could not understand
his methods true there had been
sentries but the duke would hold
thelma aboard he would land
armed

  barrett in a daze watched farleigh
breaking eggs precisely if farleigh
loved his daughter as he loved thelma
as his sweetheart how could he be- so
calm

  ever play bridge barrett

	yes

   cardinal rule to lead through
strength-and dont overlook your fi-
nesses there the eggs are done
toast and coffee warmed over but
the grounds are out lets eat

  still puzzled worried barrett sat
down to the meal he had retrieved
himself in a measure he felt but
farleigh was beyond his comprehen-
sion

chapter vi

the luck holds

farleigh and barrett saw the
boat putting off from the schoon-
er the hihimanu had come in
on the flood and anchored wrell out in
the lagoon there were six men in
the boat-four of the crew and both
the duke and ginger


argosy

  that had been settled automatically
the duke did not want to leave gin-
ger aboard with the girl and ginger
did not mean to take any chances of
the duke handling the pearls alone
barretts absence had not been discov-
ered the chinese quartermaster was
one of the boats crew all of whom
were armed with rifles from the rack
the duke steered he was in high
fettle his monocle shone brightly
he meant to put through the thing
handsomely

  farleigh advised barrett to keep out
of sight  here is a gun but dont
use it except in extremity i am trust-
ing to finesse in the main if they
havent missed you your absence from
the preliminaries may make matters go
more smoothly they have left thelma
on board but they are both coming
there may be honor among thieves
there may also be white blackbirds
but i never saw one

  the whaleboat made for the wharf
farleigh strolled down to meet it
none of his men was in sight bar-
rett like a hound on leash when the
hunt starts remained in farleighs bed-
room off the main living room

  one chinese stayed with the boat
the others including the quartermas-
ter came up with farleigh to the porch
the duke told the three to stay outside
but they followed in quietly

  i think mo betteh said the quar-
termaster as the duke whirled on them
he showed a square of paper in his
hand with the seal of wing lee upon
it the duke scowled there was a
faint suggestion of the snail track on
his spine the chinese meant to see
the pearls delivered but he would fool
them as to the number he wasnt
going to stand much more of this he
told himself but he realized that wing
was very much in the game

  for a moment he seemed to see the
wise unblinking eyes behind the big
lenses the hooked nose and thin down-
curving lips

  u there are chinese everywhere  he
seemed to hear wings warning

  ginger with bloodshot eyes and
splitting head that his last drinks that
morning had not allayed stood with
legs wide apart looking round the
room

   i had hoped you were bringing me
my daughter said farleigh pleasant-
ly  i think i have seen you both be-
fore or heard of you to what am i
indebted for this visit

   that is easily said replied the
duke  perhaps we came too early
i do not see any of your men about
 the lagoon is cleared said far-
leigh  i had the best of the shell put
on board my schooner on the trip that
took my divers back i have enough
for a crew for present purposes four
of them

  he was giving the show away bar-
rett thought in his seclusion was he
tamely going to give up the pearls be-
cause of his fear for his daughters
welfare if so the swim had been for
nothing

   your daughter is very charming
said the duke and for a moment far-
leighs gray eyes flashed  you must
long to see her

  i do farleigh offered no chairs
the three of the crew ranged them-
selves by the door missing nothing
silent but watchful

   as a matter of fact said the duke
easily  she came with us she will
come ashore presently-i hope-after
ave have talked business he kept his
eyes on ginger growling in his beard
what do you mean

   a beautiful girl is a pearl beyond
price worth many pearls you have
looters luck



them we have your daughter i did
not bring all my crew ashore they
are extremely efficient in many ways
there you jolly well have it in a nut-
shell farleigh an even trade
farleigh groaned and seemed to sag
into the chair beside him

   do you realize that these pearls
represent my fortune that i have been
gathering them for ten years they
belong to my daughter are you hu-
man  men you cant mean to do this
to skim the cream precisely
said the duke

   why-what assurance have i that
my daughter is even aboard  or that
you will bring her ashore safely

the duke handed over a note
which farleigh fumbled as he
read

   this is her writing she says she
is unharmed send for her

  ginger broke in he felt that he
had made a mistake in coming that the
duke had outwitted him he had been
a damned fool to drink so much last
night he told himself

   show us the pearls all of em
they may not be enough

    they are all i have said farleigh
 i call no names but this is piracy
the duke smiled and polished his
eyeglass on a silk handkerchief he
held his hand close to where the gun
nestled a hook of his immaculate tunic
open first the pearls then if gin-
ger got nasty-

    call it what you jolly well like he
said  lets see the pearls farleigh
once the pearls were in their pos-
session-and the duke did not see what
was to prevent that-ginger would
make his move the duke knew his
partner he could see signs of his
breaking loose it was a funny situa-
tion the duke would appear to be

playing fair aside from the piratical
deal itself an interesting role and
good-by ginger

  farleigh rose and went to a cabinet
of hardwood he opened its doors
and disclosed steel ones there was a
safe back of the wrooden lining

    there are enough here for all he
said if you will take half-even two-
thirds

   chuck it blurted ginger  its
the whole og or nothin

  he looked like a hog himself with
his piggish eyes his snout of a nose
and his mouth working greedily bar-
rett had his door slightly open he
stood beyond the angle of its casing
his gun trained on the mate

  farleigh spun the combination
opened inner doors again took out
shallow drawers that were lined with
velvet their contents hidden by sheets
of jewelers cotton he set them on the
table ginger and the duke stepped
forward eagerly the three chinese
stayed where they were vigilant

  ginger grunted and the duke caught
his breath as the first sheet of soft wad-
ding was lifted the drawer was filled
with pearls they ranged in size but
they were selected perfect the big-
gest was close to eight grains and it
had its twin

   the color varied most were silvers
some roseate two pear-shaped ones
steely black the sunlight caught their
radiance heightened it a fortune in
one drawer

  there were six drawers in all the
duke did not offer to displace the
pearls

   seems a shame to disturb them
he said  suppose you have these
wrapped up

  whats in the sack asked gin-
ger looking at the lower compartment
of the safe


argosy

   baroques you dont want them
they have little value

   we take the blarsted lot said the
mate roughly  trot em out

  farleigh set the bag on the table he
straightened up his shoulders were
squared his voice icy

  you have emptied the safe he
said  now send for thelma and take
the pearls

   well take the pearls all right-
said ginger with an ugly grin  an
we may-

  barretts finger began to squeeze
the trigger the dukes hand slid in-
side his tunic gingers big paw was
on the butt of his gun farleigh
seemed the least concerned but he was
alert

  it was the quartermaster who spoke
and broke the tension

   i think she come along now the
chinese said

  ginger swung to the window with
an oath the duke lost his poise a
boat was coming from the schooner
with the rest of the crew rowing the
girl sat in the stern

   damn you snarled ginger
u you double crossed me his gun
swung out and up but the dukes
weapon covered him

   youre making a blithering ass of
yourself he said coldly and again
the quartermaster spoke mouthpiece of

wing lee

   no double cross i think he said
 maybe ah fat speak along of you
lit while

  ill cut his heart out ginger
mouthed like a maddened dog sud-
denly his face scarlet he cried  bar-
rett aint with em e loves your girl
farleigh an she loves im this aint
played out-

   youre half crazy with gin and
your own heat snapped the duke

 the girl stays here there may be
some disagreement about your daugh-
ter farleigh but youll find no dissen-
sion among us when it comes to thes
pearls were all out for them drop
that gun ginger or ill drop you

there was that in his tone that
got through to gingers senses-
an exultation and an eagerness
he knew that the duke would do what
he said ginger was not too muddled
to guess at the reason his share of
the pearls-and a good excuse he still
held his weapon though the muzzle
was lowered the quartermaster took
a step forward the back of one hand
chopped at the side of gingers wrist
the fingers of the other snatched away
the gun

   mo betteh i think said the
chinese

   youre mistaken about barrett
said farleigh  hes not aboard i ad-
mit i deceived you slightly i was not
unprepared for your arrival or your
news come in barrett

  the duke dropped his monocle as
he stared at barretts darkened face
gingers jaw sagged

   ill be damned said the duke
softly  i underestimated you my lad
though you put up a good fight at
that how about the pearls farleigh
there are ten of us

   nine since you disarmed your
friend ginger but youd give him his
gun again i suppose the first chance

   i dont want bloodshed i appre-
ciate your odds all i want is my girl
the boat had landed the cook ah
fat and the others formed a sort of
escort about her the man left at the
first boat left it and joined them the
duke cursed softly he had lost his
coup with ginger for the time lost
that trick anyway it was the attitude
looters luck



of the crew that bothered him they
would unite with him and ginger for
the pearls but wing had spoken about
the girl and they were all armed with
his own weapons still the quarter-
master would testify that the duke had
been on the side of the girl it might
help later

  she came in through the door bar-
rett came swiftly to her put one arm
about her he still held his gun he
could not believe that farleigh would
give up the pearls he must have sta-
tioned his four men somewhere of
course the odds wrere against them but
he held thelma until she ran into her
fathers arms

   quite safe my dear farleigh
asked quicklv

    quite 

   then you men take your loot and
get back to your schooner ive got my
daughter you can take the pearls

   try and stop us jeered ginger
he tore a tap a cloth from the wall and
wrapped up the drawers the quarter-
master picked up the sack of baroques
they filed out down to their boats
ginger leading he was still fuming
but those precious drawers soothed
him a little once he turned on ah fat

   ill settle with you when we get
aboard you yeller sneak he said

   i follow instluction said ah fat
quite placidly  wing lee say no
makee bobbely about gal too much
tlouble bimeby vely like

   hes dead right said the duke
 i saw that long ago

  youre a bloomin liar retorted
ginger  you wanted her

   well take that up later when
youre sober-if you ever are replied
the duke serenely  im right about
the girl youll see that weve got the
pearls theres one more job two ill
tackle one you can do the other

   what do you mean 

   were not quite in the clear
were faster than that schooner of
farleighs rut im going to take the
rudder off the pintles and smash it
while you fix his engine i see theres
a propeller

  in spite of his mood ginger grinned
the duke overlooked little

    ill fix it proper he said

  it did not take them long farleigh
watched from the porch the girl and
barrett had gone inside ginger tossed
some metal objects into the deep water
of the lagoon far apart beyond diving
for then the two boats rowed for
the schooner it was still flooding and
they did not hoist anchor

arleigh went inside

   theyve cleaned you out
said barrett

  you never can tell when a finesse
goes over said farleigh  nor how
a game will end i said i did not ap-
prove of shedding blood but if
thelma had not come ashore or if
they had refused to send for her i
would have picked off every one of
them before they were fifty yards from
shore or could get to land again i have
a sporting rifle and i have practiced a
good deal    my men had four of
them covered all the time he added
he showed round holes bored in the
wall amid the trophies of weapons un-
noticeable until pointed out

   as for the pearls they were cast
before swine my boy i trust the swine
appreciate their value properly but i
doubt it i see your things came ashore
thelma not yours barrett

   they dont amount to much sir
the sooner they leave the better im
thankful ive got money of my owrn
the one thing after all is thelma
but i hate to see them get away with

it and theyve broken up your
schooner

   it wont take long to make another
rudder and ship it ive got extra parts
for the engine i doubt if theyve
smashed it you know i rather ex-
pected something of this sort though
i didnt figure on the duke and his lout
of a partner theres bad blood be-
tween them i shouldnt wonder but
that they fell out over those pearls
now thelma tell me all about it
at noon the lagoon was empty the
hihimanu was under power and sail
soon she was hull down making north-
east then she was gone

   ive got a few things to show you
said farleigh  but first well see what
damage they did to the schooner

on board the hihimanu ginger
began to listen to reason as the
duke expounded the wisdom of
wing lee

   the disappearance of a girl would
kick up a row that wouldnt end eas-
ily lie pointed out  too much  bob-
bely as ah fat said

   id like to slit his throat

   the rest might have something to
say about it youll notice they havent
turned in their rifles im not going to
ask them either well trail with the
hounds for a bit but wing was right
about the girl youd have tired of her
and then what better to sell pearls to
make a string for a vvomairs neck than
put a rope around your own you can
get plenty of women show them a
pearl or the price of one and theyll
come running lets have a drink
the pantry boy brought a bottle and
glasses the duke held up his tot

   heres to our luck he said  its
changed ginger

   youd ave shot me back there
said ginger  i aint forgot that

   you drew on me ginger you
said id double crossed you

  half mollified the big mate clinked
glasses but he was fairly sober he
mulled over the situation and seemed
reconciled

  fifteen minutes later they were
gloating over the gems

   ow much do vou think is there
asked ginger

   its hard to tell a quarter of a
million anyway

   a quarter of a million you want
to take your alf

   theres no sense m that wing
will want to handle the split

   blarst is yeller ide wot about
oldin out a few 

   ive thought of that said the
duke  they saw the drawers were
fairly full though

   the crew the three of em who
crowded in they didnt count em
lets take a few from each drawer
well old them ourselves an well
put the big lot in the safe weve each
got a key to the inside lock theres a
third one at steve benoits joint well
put the drawers in the ships safe an
chuck both our keys overboard

  the duke considered the proposi-
tion

   not trusting me wrhat

i wouldnt trust myself with that

lot

   youre a foxy lad ginger but
well do that get out of here and stay
out he said to the hovering pantry
boy he pulled the curtains over the
skylight after he closed it soon a
small gleaming heap was in front of
each of them

  they put these in small sacks of
chamois with long strings slung them
about their necks the rest they put
in the safe the duke tied both their
keys together after the doors were
looters luck



closed then he summoned ah fat
gave him the keys

   throw these overboard right
away he said ah fat showed no
surprise but vanished with a  can do

  the duke changed the combination
ginger watching him then they
shook hands not in friendship but with
a measure of mutual respect that was
rare between them more perhaps on
the dukes side than on gingers he
had to accept the situation he could
devise other means of getting most of
gingers share later on then he would
get rid of him he knew ginger would
be on his guard for the time until he
began to handle his money

  for his part ginger had not forgot-
ten the eager gleam in the dukes eyes
when he held the gun

                                       

they slept well and easily that
night the gems they had held
out from wing lee might ap-
proximate fifty thousand dollars but
there was at least four times that sum
in the safe only to be got at with the
third key that was held by steve benoit
in case of emergency this was a
gage of safety between them even
then each slept with gun handy

  ginger had seen the dukes naked
murderous soul shine in his eyes the
duke knew it for the time the locked-
up gems protected them from each
other they might smile and jest and
drink with each other until wing paid
the money but even now their partner-
ship was dissolved

  but when ginger in the morning-
light drewt out his bag to look once
more at the gems that wing lee was
not to know of he found a square of
heavy rice-paper in the sack on it
was the seal of wing at the same
moment the duke with a frown was
regarding a similar totem

  the pearls could not be replaced in
the drawers wing would know they
had tried to cheat he might have ex-
pected them to his word was his
bond he would probably not consid-
er theirs in that light he might be tol-
erant-but this had been a misplay it
meant complications

   the duke set his wits to work to off-
set the slip by the time he went on
deck he fancied he had reached a solu-
tion it was not too sound but it
might pass muster

  they made good time the trade
wind sped them on before it if it
lessened the engine drove them along
ginger seemed to forget the girl he
still drank and the duke encouraged
him on the surface they were com-
rades they had the loot their luck 
had changed and it still held on the
fourth day they had sighted a mass of
something floating on the waves it
was not the dead carcass of a fish for
no birds were near it nor was it an
overturned boat they headed for it

   when the lucks in cried the
duke exultantly  ambergris gin-
ger and wings not in on this

  they hauled the waxy mass aboard
mottled like marble in yellow and
black greasy with the beaks of giant
squid embedded in it it weighed close
to two hundred pounds it was not
much valuable as it was as a base for
perfumes compared to the pearls but
it was unexpected trove

 chapter vii

 the word of wing lee

the duke and ginger stood once
more in wings big room this
time there were four attendants
the drawers of pearls were on the teak-
wood table so was the bag of baroques


argosy

irregular pearls lumpish variant in
color useful only as sets in pins or
brooches

   this is all asked wing

   not quite said the duke as gin-
ger slower-witted stared  we sepa-
rated some of the best and kept them
in leather bags next to our skins to
be sure of their luster naturally we
could not do it with all of them

  it was the process often used to re-
store dull pearls or to maintain the
gentle fire of others ginger remem-
bering the sealed square of paper gave
a little grunt the duke was clever

  wing lifted the sheets of wadding
from each drawer he used a pair
of pliable forceps their ends padded
picked up two or three gems from each
drawer scrutinizing them through his
glasses returned them he poured the
baroques into the pan of a pair of
scales and weighed them then he
sat back clapped his hands and sat with
the tips of his nail cases touching im-
passive

  the secretary came in left and re-
turned with a tray stacked with double-
eagles gold was wings touchstone

  ginger licked his lips the dukes
eyes gleamed

   the baroques are worth twro hun-
dred dollars said wing lee and piled
up ten of the coins  as for the amber-

    a

gns-

   thats got nothing to do with our
bargain said the duke  you can
leave that out of the reckoning

  f i think not i may suffer a slight
loss but the ambergris will about rec-
ompense me for what i advanced you

  his voice was cold as dripping water
from a glacier while they gazed
puzzled he put out another stack of
ten twenties beside the first then a
single coin leside them

   you may have heard the story of a

fanner who left twenty sheep between
three sons lie said  they did not
want to kill a sheep they bought one
from a neighbor and divided the cost
between them each then taking seven
sheep i am more generous i donate
the odd coin so

  he split the coins into three parts
seven in each replaced one stack in the
tray and motioned to his secretary who
carried it out

   my word is my bond said wing
complacently  take your money
they both spoke together angrily
wing regarded them with his wise eyes
set between the hooded lids

   i credited farleigh with wisdom
he said  he also possesses imagina-
tion i thought he would have been
ready at any time for a raid on his
island there are always leaks but
the two of you are fools blinded by
greed no doubt he cozened you nice-
ly with the proper talk and play if
you are not satisfied you may give me
back the gold and take the drawers and
their contents and thebaroques i pay
only their value because i said i would
do so strictly within the wording of
that bond i am absolved from even do-
ing this

  the dukes monocle dropped he
had a glimmering of the truth gin-
gers slow brain responded only to
wrath

   tryin to chisel us are you you
veller snake vou dont get awav with

it

 if you try to draw that gun you are
a dead man said wing  i see
your partner has more restraint
the four attendants had closed in
their hands were withdrawn from their
sleeves holding automatics others
appeared as if by magic through the
paneled walls

                       a
looters luck



   blind fools who have poached real
pearls a score of times farleigh knew
the psychology of your type your
eyes were sealed it did not occur to
you that farleigh had prepared these
drawers and set them in the safe bait
that you swallowed they are imita-
tions good ones glass containers
skillfully lined with the iridescent scales
of small fish in your country aller-
ton they call them  bleak i mean no
play on the word they are of little
value to me still i might use them
and the baroques for what i have paid
you

  the secretary glided in placed a
paper with two rows of ideographs up-
on it before wing they glimpsed the
radio operator at his set wing read
the paper impassively

   take the imitations or the money
he said  it is immaterial to me the
audience is at an end i have received
important news

  he spoke like a high mandarin dis-
missing pleaders

   you mean to say these are all
fakes asked the duke

   no doubt of it said wing wear-
ily he took up a slightly curving
blade with a carved ivory handle it
might have been a dagger or paper-
cutter with it taking one of the
larger pearls he bore down and the
imitation gem broke flattened to pow-
dered glass lined with the tiny scales
of  bleak

   those you still have in the bags
about your necks you may hold he
said u as mementos go

  they looked at each other filled
with rage and hate they hesitated
reached for the little stacks of gold
the door was opened for them and
they went out into the bright morning
before they reached the gate they were
quarreling

   	a

  inside wing s room cleared and he
was left alone with the imitations far-
leigh had bought for fools to steal and
the bag of baroques the mass of am-
bergris had already been brought to
him

  he sat there reading the message his
secretary had brought no radiograms
came to tahiti that wing did not inter-
cept

   there is some merit in the prov-
erbs of these foreign devils he said
aloud in his own tongue  there is
one  when rogues fall out the devil
laughs it takes a wise man and one
of even mind and temper to be success-
ful in affairs of any kind

  they were reading the same message
in the headquarters of the french co-
lonial authorities

   arrest a  e r t o n and harris
known as the duke and ginger for at-
tempted robbery and abduction
thought to be bound for papeete also
crew of schooner hihimanu

  a squad of gendarmes issued out to
once more take possession of the
schooner and this time of its masters

the duke and ginger found their
vessel deserted ah fat and the
others were already on their way
through the bush to a distant landing
where by orders of wing lee
they would be picked up at nightfall
taken to another scene of his numerous
activities

  ginger snatched the bag of mock
pearls from his neck breaking the
string he flung them overboard with
lurid curses the duke did not follow
his example such imitations might be
palmed off some time there were
always suckers

  ginger went below found a bottle of
square face his face lurid he did not
look at the duke until the latter spoke


argosy

   wed better sell the schooner said
the latter  i have a distinct hunch
that it is better for us to be moving on
he could not guess what had hap-
pened farleighs schooner falling in
with an american oil tanker the dis-
patching of the radio message not only
to papeete but to all ports within the
compass of the tankers sending power
and to be relayed from those to still
others

   why didnt you offer it to wing
jeered ginger taking another gulp of
liquor  a fine mess you made of this
lay you and your blarsted brains a
lousy hundred and forty dollars apiece
twenty-eight quid a fine partner
you are do you want to know what i
think of you you blighter

   i could match it ginger and ex-
press it better

  yah you fake toff you imita-
tion dude

  he took the bottle up again he saw
a gleam in the dukes eyes a slight
motion of his hand pie flung the half-
full bottle and it fell from the dukes
ready guard to the table smashing at
the neck filling the cabin with its reek
the next moment they were at each
other chagrin and mutual hatred
broke loose the rogues had fallen
out the devil laughed as they closed
in the dukes gun was under the
spotless tunic he had donned to visit
wing gingers was in his belt holster
but before he could draw it the duke
smashed him on the jaw

  hard bone beneath the pad of beard
saved ginger from a knock-out but his
sight dimmed as he clutched at the
duke and ripped apart his tunic the
duke had snatched the mates weapon
as he dazed him flung it away it fell
softly on the transom cushions gin-
ger held him in the hug of a bear while
the duke strove to get at his own gun

he was no match for ginger at close
quarters in that brief short rally

  gingers tug broke the holster strap
tore all away he hurled the gun and
it went out through the skylight to the
deck showering broken glass the
duke struck twice hard drives to gin -
gers belly he did not see where the
mates gun had fallen he had no time
to look

  panting but with breath enough to
bellow ginger rushed him with flail-
ing fists

   man to man damn your soul ill
show you whos best

  it was close quarters to the dukes
disadvantage he began to cut the
mates face to ribbons with his left
but again and again ginger closed
once he had the duke back to the table
bending him until his spine almost-
cracked the duke got an arm free
abruptly he sloughed off his ideals of
fair fighting it was suicide here he
slogged at gingers bloody face thumb
out from his clenched fingers gouging
the mates eye thrusting it on his
cheek he broke away and sought to
find the gun a cushion hid it and
ginger was on him again

the dukes better condition would
tell if he could keep that human
gorilla off their clothes were
torn apart sleeves ripped rags trailing
from their waists blood smeared both
of them gingers blows were like the
fall of sledge hammers the duke
was hurt a rib broken if not two once
ginger chopped him over his collar-
bone and the dukes arm hung numb
his left pistoned to gingers heart
saved him the mate fell back gasp-
ing again the duke sought vainly for
the gun in the respite

  ginger his eye forced back into the
socket but half blind howled raven-
looters luck



in g

in the next clinch his teeth sank
into the dukes shoulder tearing away
flesh the duke kneed him ginger
doubled up in mortal anguish and the
duke wavering on his feet put all he
had left into a tremendous uppercut
the mate swayed toppled forward

  the duke steadied himself by the
edge of the table he was almost done
but he had won ginger groaned
stirred slightly even the last fearful
punishment had not annihilated him

  then the duke saw the butt of the
pistol it would not be murder his
own battered bloody body testified to
that

  he did not hear feet overhead or
see the faces peering through the shat-
tered skylight

  la bove wthispered one gen-
darme  regarded cest fini 

  but it was not yet finished the of-
ficers stared reflecting that the arrest
would be easy looking at the fallen
one the other barely upright the con-
fusion of the cabin the ruin of the
table-setting that the pantry-boy with

the

an unconsciously sardonic touch had
placed before leaving

  gingers arm shot out grasped the
duke by the ankle jerked him from his
uncertain footing the duke fell
sprawling just missing the table one
arm on the transom cushions reaching
for the gun found it

  it roared as the gendarmes rushed
to the companion way roared again
ginger lifted himself on feet and head
bent like a bow he collapsed rolled
over his groping hand found the
sharp knife that thelma farleigh had
sought to use after her first futile stab
the duke was on one knee his
strength was gone but-

  he saw the gleam of steel gingers
spasmodic convulsive thrust he fired
again and the bullet went through the
top of the mates skull some element
of life or twist of muscle hurled gin-
gers dead bulk forward the knife
driven by his weight entered the duke
where his belt was torn open it ripped
down deep

  the game was ended

singing bottles

w

hen glass-blowing in new england was an art as well as an industry
many beautiful bottles of sapphire emerald topaz ruby and clouded
iridescent glass were made some of pale-green with undertones of blue
square-shaped with long slender necks were so constructed as to emit musical
sounds when placed in an open window against the wind the sounds varied
from diminuendo to crescendo according to the gale and took the place of
the once popular teolian harp

     one of these kt singing bottles  left in a loft with the open neck lying
to a knot-hole in the clapboard caused an old farmhouse near the franconia
notch in the white mountains to remain untenanted for many years at
last a strong-minded family from boston moved in and hearing the weird
wails traced them to their source in the attic and found the bottle it was
exhibited as the  ghost  which had so long haunted the house and was
bought by a collector for a sum far in excess of any price ever paid for an
ordinary unhistorical glass bottle	minna irving
a dozen men against six thousand-yet it was up to inspector allen and the
mounted to manage sitting bull and his untamed braves

by richard a martin sen

inspector beverly allen

sat outside his orderly room at a
plank table littered with office-forms
and correspondence mosquitoes fair-
ly swarmed in the air for it was june
now and again the inspectors hand
raised mechanically and slapped off one
of the pests otherwise he did not
notice them in his abstraction

  a vista of frowning wilderness
showed through the open gateway of
the detachment stockade there were
twenty thousand square miles of it in
that vast area this trim dapper little
man at the table was a benevolent em-
peror at least headquarters having
big-heartedly detailed twenty men for
the purpose expected him to be but
the inspector was not thinking of that
just now

  a letter lay open on the table before

him written in a tumbled hasty pas-
sionate womans hand

       oh bev bev i didnt think
  i could endure it with you buried in
  that horrid awful wilderness shes a
  darling bev-a golden dream child-
  but we both need you so each night i
  pray the furlough you applied for wrill
  be granted

 for a long moment allens clear
black eyes clouded clouded with the
vision of a gallant woman clutching
their little first-born pleadingly to her
breast-the child he had not seen

 a twinge of bitterness passed
through him he couldnt accept the
furlough even if it was granted now
-with that mist of hushed suspense
that ominous portent hanging spectral-
ly over the breadth of empire intrusted
to his care
beans for backbone



  there was tragedy brewing the
indian nations felt it the breed out-
laws the even more sinister whisky-
runners and fur-thieves so too and
long since had the keen-witted man at
the table yes grim and grievous was
the weight which rested on his trim
shoulders

  with a sigh the inspector pushed
aside the letter from home and at last
turned to an official communication
which swiftly caused his cool eyes to
glint and sparkle his square jaw to
thrust out with repressed anger

  the tall broad frame of sergeant-
major pierce blotted out the threshold
of the orderly room inspector allen
looked up

   i trust sergeant that the appetite
of the detachment for beans is in-
satiable 

  the sergeant grimaced then grinned
u if tisnt sir it ought to be weve
had an almighty lot of practice

   ah yes well it appears the prac-
tice will continue indefinitely inspec-
tor allen tapped the paper in his hand
 supplies for the mounted are as usual
lost strayed or stolen so commis-
sioner macleod informs me and all
the queens horses and all the queens
men-at ottawa-can not locate them
again straight pork and beans this
summer sergeant and probably next
winter too augmented by fresh meat
in season only in season sergeant you
understand

  pierce nodded the police had to
serve as exemplary models for their
children

   under the circumstances he ven-
tured  i suppose it would be foolish
to inquire about our pay

   not merely foolish infernally un-
tactful agreed his officer pay
pay where have i heard that word
officially and theres something else

a damned sight more serious our
clothing was included in the missing
supplies

   good lord exclaimed pierce in
dismay he looked down at the trou-
sers tucked into his riding boots they
were a crazy-quilt of patches and for
all that in places still gaped raggedly

   the cruelest blow of all mur-
mured the inspector quizzically  we
can keep plugging on an undiluted diet
of beans we might even get along
without our sniders-for against the
winchesters our outlaw friends are im-
porting from the states theyre more
ornamental than useful anyway but
when will the great political brain ap-
preciate the difficulty of controlling the
whole northwest in a state of-ah-
seminakedness

 an incident illustrating the import
tance of uniformed authority
was at that moment taking place
in a wolf den scarce two hundred miles
from where inspector allen sat this
wolf den was a temporary encampment
of the head magician of the uncapapa
sioux sitting bull the prime factor
of the incident was a thin line of red-
coated men

  after annihilating custer the terror
of the dakotas had decided he was
bucking impossible odds

   we can go nowhere without seeing
the head of an american he declared
in council  our land has become
small it is like an island we have
two ways to go-to the land of the
great mother or to the land of the
spaniards since spring we have killed
one thousand americans we have
done counting let us strike north
and so the sioux began to pour
across the border until six thousand
of them were camped on canadian soil
depending on canadian buffalo or


argosy

bounty for existence six thousand
warriors who had never been con-
quered who had crushed or evaded the
snares set by almost twice their num-
ber of american troops flung them-
selves into a wilderness where white
authority was represented by a paltry
handful of red-coated men

  eight thousand other savages-
blackfeet assiniboine sarcee piegan
bloods-already inhabited that wilder-
ness there were also hundreds of
half-breeds-metis and outlaws of a
score of different types and nationali-
ties against this tremendous force
this potentially hostile might there
were available perhaps a hundred or so
mounted police and these scattered
over thirty thousand square miles

  but the police wtore uniforms whose
brightness awed the savage breast and
had been taught to look jauntily fear-
less no matter what they felt thus
the knowledge that sitting bull had
never tolerated the presence of a white
man near his person did not deter as-
sistant commissioner irvine in the
least on the morning inspector allen
was bewailing the dearth of clothing
irvine trotted casually into the teem-
ing wolf den with an army of ten sub-
constables

  perhaps sheer mounted effrontery
swung the scales at any rate irvine
pushed through a towering retinue of
fierce warriors to face a proud-fea-
tured sturdy indian of middle age
long black hair fell over his cheeks
and in front of his shoulders his
eyes gleamed his face was devoid of
paint with high cheek bones prominent
nose heavy jaw and broad forehead
the mouth was implacable

   i seek the famous warrior sitting
bull irvine announced through his in-
terpreter

   then your search is over was the

reply and surprisingly sitting bull
extended a hand soft as a womans
softer than a squaws

  what followed was more surprising
still irvines escort withdrew on one
side the cloud of indian fighting men
on the other sitting bull presented
an elaborate peace-pipe to the commis-
sioner irvine puffed away at it then
sitting bull who thereafter shook out
the ashes and solemnly buried them
the pipe was broken to pieces and
strewn over the spot

this ceremony completed the time
was ripe for the commissioner to
speak after some moments of
flowery generalities he came tactfully
to the point of his errand

   the great mother welcomes the
sioux people to her land that wel-
come will continue kind and warm so
long as the sioux maintain the spirit
befitting guests

   good that means forever said
sitting bull  we come with hands
raised and open seeking only peace
it is not we who desired battle in the
land that was our home battle was
forced upon us by the greed and
treachery of the long knives-the
long knives with forked tongues

   the tongue of the great mother is
not forked averred irvine with em-
phasis

   she will not render us back into
the hands of our enemies

   no not so long as the sioux obey
the rules of hospitality and remember
the courtesy properly due from guests
to host

   good the great mother warms
my heart she has a womans eye for
color said sitting bull dryly his
glance fixing upon irvines scarlet tu-
nic  i approve tell the great queen
that the sioux already swell with love
beans for backbone



and admiration for their white grand-
mother

  assistant commissioner irvine
pitched tent near the scene of the in-
terview in a pardonable glow of duty
well performed this glow was not
diminished by the report of his inter-
preter that the indians were happier
than they had been for many a weary
month

  to cap the climax came another
proof that the lion was indeed meta-
morphosed into the gentle lamb to-
ward midnight the commissioner re-
ceived a surprise visit in his tent from
sitting bull the warlock sat on the
edge of his bed and with an almost
childlike simplicity and confidence
poured forth his myriad grievances
against the long knives

  the heart-to-heart confessional
lasted well into the small hours it
prompted irvine to state enthusiastical-
ly of sitting bull in his report

   i have but little doubt of his future
conduct if he remains here which he
assuredly will

  beneath his soldierly exterior colo-
nel irvine himself was a gentleman to
the bone moreover his acquaintance
with the moody fickle wizard of the

uncapapas was extremely limited

j

another spring had come and
 blended into summer inspector
beverly allens  d  troop de-
tachment at woods end was still sub-
sisting on beans and had managed to
keep its wilderness empire in order as
it tried to subsist on that monotonous
diet

  during the twelvemonth however
the mist of hushed suspense and
brooding evil which clutched the re-
gion had thickened appreciably the
sioux hordes had pushed east into it
headquarters reflecting irvines confi-

dence remained imbued with cheerful
hope but in closer contact with the
threat inspector allen secretly was not
so comfortable twenty men what-
ever their traditions and however
brave form none too stout a bulwark
against five thousand lusty war-bred
primitives	

  there had been  more mail from
home and at times the picture of his
wife and daughter stabbed like a lance
of fire to the inspectors heart al-
though he never by look or gesture
revealed his own suffering to the force
under him

  allens scouts made unencouraging
reports the strain of diplomacy and
good behavior was telling on the sioux
restless by nature the reminders of
other peoples affluence constantly dan-
gling before their eyes made them
doubly so there were the horses for
instance whole herds of them-some-
times grazing with a sub-constable for
sole protector

  straight-y oung-man one of the
sioux sub-chiefs reached a pass where
the mere sight of a loose horse belong-
ing to the mounted sent him into a
convulsion of mingled rage and eager-
ness he was a gifted horse-thief but
nowadays his gifts were useless two
score similarly talented young bucks
comprised his band

  it was inevitable that sooner or later
trouble would come

  corporal bryce in charge of the de-
tachments saddle-stock was hard put
to it to find adequate grazing land as
june slipped into sun-scorched july
he wrangled the herd farther and
farther into the wilderness away from
allens stockade and the eyes of
straight-y oung-mans companions
watched proceedings greedily

  toward late afternoon one day the
corporal was in his shelter tent indus-


argosy

triously scribbling a letter that might
reach the folks in montreal for christ-
mas the two sub-constables on auty
were stretched out under a tree whence
they could watch the herd of fifty
horses grazing in a little clearing below
them and at the same time take life
easy

  the herd drifted slowly and peace-
fully toward the far end of the clear-
ing suddenly constable white raised
up on an elbow and nudged his com-
panion

  look jim

  constable travis looked  whats
the excitement 

   i thought i saw a couple of injuns
slinking in the underbrush by jupi-
ter-

  he bounded erect the bushes at
the far end of the clearing had erupted
not two but a dozen lithe brown forms
straight-young-man and his bucks
had waited until the leading horses
were almost within arms reach before
they dashed into the open the gentled
horses pulled up snorting but the in-
dians werealready upon them twist-
ing buckskin thongs about their lower
jaws as makeshift bridles and leaping
on their backs

  white bolted down the incline with
travis at his heels and vaulted aboard
his pony traviss mount unfortunate-
ly had wandered farther off it took
the constable an extra precious minute
to round him up and start in pursuit of
the horse-thieves

  white flung full-tilt at the receding
savages shouting anathema the horse
straight-young-man had selected was
proving intractable it delayed his
flight sufficiently for the constable to
draw alongside white leaned from
the saddle and closed his muscular arms
about the indian straight-young-
man jerked loose snatched out a re-

volver and brought it smashing down
upon the mounties skull with a force
not to be denied

white reeled for an instant
managed to recover and pulled
out his own gun at this junc-
ture constable travis arrived flvinsr

                         o

instead of continuing the pursuit he
swerved toward white and savagely
clutched the latters extended arm

   chop it you damned fool he
shouted  remember orders we
dont shoot first dyou want to start
a wholesale massacre

  white flushed as he fought to con-
trol his excited horse in that brief
interval self-control returned

   youre right bob sorry i de-
layed you the devils have made their
get-away

 corporal bryce warned by the
shouting that something was amiss
now came up at a gallop his jaw
thrust grimly forward at traviss brief
report

   right bob you and jim stick
with the horses ill hit the trail

  he started in the wake of the horse-
thieves there was no doubt in cor-
poral bryces mind as to what he in-
tended to do twelve or twelve thou-
sand indians notwithstanding he was
going to bring those horses back again

  sitting bulls camp lay twenty miles
distant obviously the sioux horse-
thieves would head for it corporal
bryce also took the most direct trail for
this objective

  by the time he had covered ten miles
anger gave way to the acumen which
had merited his corporals stripes here
was a matter of the most profound sig-
nificance it was not his place to in-
dulge blind instinct force an issue and
make the caldron boil discretion was
the thing
beans for backbone



  he diverted to the cabin of a friend-
ly english-speaking breed

   sioux bucks have run off some of
our horses he explained  i want
you jules to go at once to sitting bull
tell him for me that if he returns the
horses we will forget the incident but
his young men must return our animals
at once

  the corporal awaited the return of
his messenger impatiently dusk was
gathering when at last the half-breed
appeared apprehension plainly depicted
upon his face

   sitting bull was very angry he
muttered  he says the red-coats are
to keep their distance his young men
are not to be disturbed

  bryce smiled grimly  so thats the
tune hes singing eh

   oui msieur the breed shivered
as though he had passed through a
terrific ordeal  and i myself think
it would be wise if those horses were
forgotten

   you dont say why

   as i passed through the camp i
saw- again the breed shivered and
crossed himself- hundreds of sitting
bulls young men painting their faces
for war

  corporal bryce grew exceedingly
thoughtful the waste was indeed rub-
bing a corner of the tinder-box the
plunder of police horses could not go
unrequited without a complete de-
moralization of police control and
yet-

  he realized with substantial force
that the situation was far above and
beyond the scope of a mere corporal
hence two hours later he was standing
before his officer quietly describing
wrhat had occurred

  inspector allen heard him through
inscrutably then

   your line of action corporal was

proper and commendable however
we cannot permit even sitting bull to
get away with this he spoke as
gravely as authoritatively as though he
were a general with a division of sol-
diers at call instead of twenty men
pitted against a far-flung wilderness
and full five thousand savages with
passions at the boiling-point sergeant
pierce i want a detail of twelve men
full equipment and dress uniform they
are to be prepared to ride with me at
dawn

   ll night long commotion swirled
in the vast camp of sitting bull
in eerie chorus groups of braves
lifted their voices to descant their bat-
tle prowress to the night drum-beats
rolled in waves of shuddering sound
along the lines of serried tepees to the
great central war-lodge where the
chief magician himself was said to be
brewing powerful medicine

  there was no reason why sitting
bull should not be gratified with his
position he was master of a wilder-
ness which though differing in nature
was no whit less in broad majestic
expanse than his lamented plains in
this realm was no one to dispute his
sway excepting a bare handful of red-
coated men the merest quirk of a fin-
ger and his hordes would swallow
them

  an hour after first light a runner
sprinted up to the war-lodge and flung
inside rumors of the tidings he
brought spread rapidly from all sides
warriors mounted and in full regalia
began to converge toward the war-
lodge

  the flap opened and sitting bull
crawled forth his face was sullen
his eyes glittered with a malign light
in silence he mounted and in the cen-
ter of a wild impressive cavalcade


argosy

rode slowly across the open level be-
neath his camp

  a wooded knoll formed the far side
of the level among the trees of this
knoll sharply silhouetted against the
brightening sky a thin line of horse-
men suddenlv was visible ahead of
the line trotted two other riders-in-
spector allen and his interpreter

  the rising sun shone bravely on the
red coats of the approaching men on
their white crossed belts white helmets
and gloves scrub-brush and pipe-
clay had served to gloss over merci-
fully the general dilapidation of their
sartorial splendor particularly the
scarecrow pants each trooper carried
a snider carbine across his saddle-bow
and the adams revolver at his side

  for all its martial pomp and color
though the group was but a straw
against the teeming horde of the in-
dians yet it advanced steadily and
with crisp dapper purpose

  inspector allen glimpsed sitting
bull back in the thickest ruck of war-
riors and snapped an order the men
behind him bunched into a wedge

  straight through a mass of milling
glaring savages the wedge thrust halt-
ing at allens command within a few
feet of the warlock if a thrilling ten-
sion or numbing anxiety clutched the
heartstrings of these red-coated men
there was no indication upon their
countenances these were no more nor
less impassive than on parade

  allen spurred up to the side of sit-
ting bull if there swam before the
minds eve of the mounted officer the
image of the woman he loved whom
lie well might never clasp in his hungry
arms again it was not evident in his
cool fearless glance

  for an instant the two warriors re-
garded each other the indians gaze
flashing sinister allens continuing

calm and level-eyed neither made a
motion of greeting

 we come as friends said the
inspector then through the
half-breed provost his inter-
preter  but sitting bull knows why
we are here

   why should i know the warlock
demanded  i did not seek a meeting
nor wish it the redcoat can see that
my young men are restless he was
unwise to come

   yesterday said allen calmly
without removing his eyes from that
sullen visage  sitting bulls young
men took horses belonging to the great
queen a message was sent him that
if the animals were returned at once
the incident would be forgotten in-
stead he sent back word defending his
young men-and did not send the
horses

  to this there was no reply sitting
bull shrewdly desired allen to do the
forcing he got his wish

   silence means that sitting bull
cannot dispute these facts it is well
let sitting bull remember that he re-
mains here solely at the pleasure of the
great queen her laws have not been
changed to meet the whims of sitting
bull it is her will that he return the
horses here and now

  the indian grunted it was obvious
that he felt in an ugly mood two
thousand fiercely expectant warriors
abetted it

   sitting bull knows nothing of the
great queens horses he replied and
added with a flash of viciousness
 and if he did know and did not de-
sire to return them does the redcoat
think perhaps that he could take them
from sitting bull

the spark had struck police au-
thority throughout all canada balanced
beans for backbone



delicately on allens trim back the
inspector could not hesitate

   i would take sitting bulls own
horse if i knew that it was stolen he
retorted in a firm strong voice

  the indians stained teeth bared in
a contemptuous yet calculating grin

   it is he said succinctly

  the spark had leaped to flame in-
spector allen had expected it he had
also decided that the charge of tarnish-
ing the honor of the mounted should
never lie with him

  gradually during the last few in-
stants he had been edging his horse
closer and closer to the indian now
the taunters challenge was accepted
with a blazing suddenness

  allen leaned sidewise his arms
closed with a clamp of iron around the
body of sitting bull in the same
breath the warlock was swung clear of
his saddle and dumped roughly on the
ground inspector allen whirled and
trotted back to his escort leading
the riderless horse

  a paralyzed hush far more dramatic
than the deafening uproar so shortly to
ensue gripped the scene sitting bulls
person was sacred for a moment
dumb stupefaction clogged the senses
of his tribesmen they were unable to
credit the testimony of their eyes

  not so the mounted like trained
veterans they made the most of a
breathless opportunity when the hush
ended they had wedged their horses in
a ring about their officer the group
was trotting for the wooded knoll

  the whoops and yowls of the in-
furiated warriors in their thousands
welled to the upper skies a press of
bodies flung at the mounted compress-
ing it like a kernel in the shell fists
flailed into the faces of the redcoats
quirts slashed them nails clawed at
their eyes

  no shooting the voice of in-
spector xallen clearly topped the din

  the mounties reversed their car-
bines and battered stubbornly through
an unending nightmare of plunging
writhing bodies with the gun butts

  it was a miracle that thev had ever

                                              j

managed to penetrate to the vicinity
of sitting bull that they could fight
their way out again through his shriek-
ing horde to temporary safety with-
out the loss of a man was thrice
miraculous but shouting striking
disentangling retreating ultimately
they did cleave through the wild
melee won to the flimsy shelter of their
little woods stockade and rammed the
gate shut behind them

  now at last a sigh of relief issued
simultaneously from several police
throats one or two constables even
grinned happily

  but allen did not grin he saw too
keenly into the immediate future he
tossed the reins of sitting bulls pony
-emblem of dangerous victory-to
the trooper nearest him

    slide this into the stable the rest
of you snap into getting the post in
shape for defense if you think weve
seen the last of sitting bulls young
men youre in for damned rough dis-
illusionment 

the sun set for the last time ac-
cording to the laws of logic as
far as allens detachment was
concerned and promptly with twilight
the wheel of fate began to turn vast
pools of shadow far deeper than the
evenings gloom formed on the bench
above the fort

  a piercing whoop rang out the
shadows spread and whirled in a dance
macabre-became waves of mounted
indians pounding back and forth
guns cracked the dusk filled with an


argosy

insensate shuddering clamor as the
braves worked themselves into the
frenzy for an overwhelming assault

  under allens unflurried supervision
the police long since had prepared for
the finale as thoroughly as possible
every spare vessel had been filled with
water extra ammunition cases had
been buried letters to families and
friends written and cached in an iron
box allen had bravely written his own
farewell to his wife and the child he
would never see now

  the troopers crouched at points of
vantage in their barrack room if the
protracted strain tanged at the nerves
of the younger recruits no indication
was manifest outwardly

  and so a quiet riffle in the center of
a raging whirlpool the mounties
played a waiting game until lead from
the weapons of sitting bulls young
bucks began to rip the colors on the
flagpole above the little stockade
then indeed allen sensed an ominous
wave of motion in the sea of gloom

 steady men he bade no
shooting unless we are convinced there
is no other way

  note that unless-the casual
dauntless voice of scarlet nonchalance

   how about a light inquired
some one presently  lets show em
were not worrying

  inspector allen laughed composedly
well demonstrate that better with-
out a light the inference is that we
have gone to bed you can light
matches all you please though smoke
chat relax enjoy this touch of genuine
atmosphere its rare enough nowa-
days

  outside the bedlam increased
chants yowls snarls the rattle of
rifle volleys provost the breed inter-
preter explained phlegmatically

   the brave young men of sitting

bull tell what they intend to do to you
it is not nice first they will scalp you
at the stake then cut out your hearts
then give vour red coats to the

    o	

squaws

   how intrestin breathed ser-
geant pierce ironically

  two hours dragged past two aching
eternities inaction under the lash of
torment is a real test of discipline no
wisp of sound trickled from the unlit
barracks but when at last a concerted
war-whoop welled from the engulfing
blackness like a surging wave the
mounties filled with hope-hope that
for better or for worse the end had
come a score of hands gripped the
snider carbine stocks so tightly the
finger knuckles drained white

  an all-pervading complete and sin-
ister hush succeeded the whoop

   what now  inspector allen
queried of provost

  i do not know replied the half-
breed then as the lull continued
 but i go see

  the barracks formed one side of the
stockade provost rose slid to an open
window and vanished

  five throbbing minutes ten again
the window wras blotted out by a clam-
bering form provost had made it back
successfully

   i find chief broad tail calmly
reported the interpreter  the squaws
are running all around him screaming
to his young men  lend us your
breech-clouts and we will choke the
cousins of the long knives but
broad tail wishes speech with you

inspector allen suppressed an
exclamation young chief broad

  tail he knew had for some time
been a thorn in the side of sitting bull
he was one of those who had grown
tired of the great warlocks medicine
beans for backbone



   where is he

  provost vaguely indicated the night
beyond the window

  promptly the keen-witted inspector
came to a decision

   into your bunks lads he called
every man-jack of you stay there
until further orders right provost
invite the chief inside when you get
him through the window light a candle
and escort him through the barracks to
the orderly room you boys turn loose
a few artistic snores to help the game
along

  allen chuckled audibly and vanished
there was a general scurry as the
mounted wonderingly pulled off boots
and tunics and drew the blankets
around their necks

  chief broad tail found the in-
spector writing leisurely and imper-
turbably in the orderly room the
indians face was inexpressive but his
eyes showed a perplexity mingled with
subtle respect

  well inquired allen calmly
what can we do for you

  broad tails wonderment increased
it took him some time to frame a suit-
able reply

   sitting bull is very angry he
averred at length  he wishes to scalp
the redcoats

  inspector allen looked at him a mo-
ment then grinned  yes

  the indians perplexity vanished
together with any lingering trace of
malice the grin had been too much
for him he also smiled

the

   but broad tail is not so anxious
he declared  no he is weary of
sitting bulls perpetual war medicine
it pleases him that you plucked a few
feathers so neatly from the bonnet of
sitting bull so he has instructed his
young men not to molest the redcoats
any more

   broad tail is wise observed the
inspector easily

  and without my young men i do
not think that sitting bull will press
his anger farther concluded the
indian

  with elaborate difficulty allen
smothered a yawn

   ah yes the great queen doubt-
less will be pleased to hear that broad
tail is not as childish as sitting bull

  there was a moment of silence
then

   i told him i was coming to talk to
you gravely remarked the indian
 what message shall i take back to
him 

  allen turned to a shelf behind the
desk and took down a pound tin of to-
bacco which he graciously tendered the
indian-his expression that of a father
giving a lollipop to a good little boy

  sitting bull murmured the in-
spector carelessly  oh tell him we
dont mind his playfulness but i do
wish hed cut down a little on the noise
the sons of the great mother work
hard and they need their sleep

  thus broad tail withdrew humbled
and marveling allens magnificent
bluff had worked

    author of  the radio flyers  the radio planetetc

  leading up to this installment

jimmy lefavour best known
as scar face boston jimmy and his
crew of gun-runners hijack the
yacht miami off newfoundland and
transfer the guns from their sinking
boat the miami is caught in the polar
ice and an opening to the northward
leads them over the edge of the world
they find that the story of the radio
flyers who claimed there is no north
pole was true instead there is a huge
opening over whose rim the sea flows
into the inside of the earth which is
a hollow shell with a small central sun

  here they find the continent inhab-

ited bv prehistoric beasts and fought
over by vikings and the eskimo-like
natives  the skr a clings the vikings
are ruled by their boy bishop nils
uppri and their yarlsf or earls among
whom are the radio flyers eric red-
mond and angus selkirk

  nick fratelli mutinies and gets
away with the miami scarface with
the harvard yachtsman tom jones
the cambridge cop mike murphy and
scarfaces fellow-gangster little arty
ex-jockey and radio bug joins the
vikings of angus selkirks plateau
city

this story began in the argosy for february 



its forked tongue large as an outer-zvorld
snake quivered in and out
the radio gun-runners



  theresa ferreira daughter of the
late navigator of the miami is with
them and seems attracted to the young
bishop uppri much to tom joness
discomfort but she learns his title and
is horrified despite nilss attempts to
convince her that viking bishops are
not celibates being more kings than
religious dignitaries

  scarface goes scouting with a vik-
ing aviator in one of their motorless
gliders which fly great distances on
the air currents after the fashion of
the native pterodactyls or skzvaas
they find nick fratelli has joined
altoonah the skraeling chief in a plot
to kidnap erics wife helga who is
en route to the northern plateau city
as they attempt to bomb the miami
the aviator is killed and scarface
crashes with the glider into the sea

chapter xiv

piracy

on the miami swede was saying
to nick and cicero  i tank it
vos yimmy

   then why the hell didnt you and
cicero pot him instead of the vik-
ing ejaculated fratelli disgustedly
 but it couldnt possibly have been
jimmy-he dont know how to fly

   beginners luck explained cicero
tony sagely adding  but we got the
viking anyhow

   yah ve got him assented swede
but he didnt seem particularly elated
about it he seemed to have a growing
fellow-feeling for these tall blond
norsemen

  look there he crashes shouted
nick  quick cicero the engines ill
take the wheel

  but though they searched the water
and even the near-by shore with great

  care they found no trace of their
former leader finally they gave up
the search and returned to their an-
chorage nick fratelli was elated his
usually sour features glowed

    dead thats a cinch he chortled
 this gets rid of the only man in this
country with more brains than i got
ill be the vikings king-ill be their
emperor-why i may even be their
mussolini

  following the attack by the glider
nick altoonah and the impromptu in-
terpreter friday conferred again while
charley loy assisted by several of the
skraelings prepared a delectable veni-
son stew of a colossal prehistoric irish
elk with chopped breadfruit to take
the place of both potatoes and chest-
nuts and with bits of orange-peel to
give it an acid tang

   the result was really a work of culi-
nary art and was hailed as a great suc-
cess by the members of both races try
it the next time you kill an irish elk
where there are breadfruit in abun-
dance

  finally the terms of the alliance
were concluded and the bargain was
sealed by the two chiefs solemnly
clasping hands over a ring a viking
custom one of the many copied by the
skraeling chief they had to use a
deck-ring for the purpose no other sort
of large ring being available

  then all the remaining rifles about
a hundred in number wrere unloaded
from the hold and the pick of altoo-
nahs warriors who had by this time
arrived were selected as a rifle com-
pany to be trained under the personal
instruction of the three gangsters
this rifle company consisted of one
hundred and fifty savages so as to
allow for casualties and still keep the
strength up to the available number of
springfields


argosy

  the picked skraeling warriors were
very proud of having been chosen and
were anxious to try out the rifles at
once but nick fratelli knew from
world war experience that recruits
should not be given firearms until they
had mastered at least the rudiments of
discipline and squad-movements

  nick was not worrying about any at-
tack from the vikings just yet the
vikings would probably wait for two
or three days before sending out a
searching party or another glider and
he could count on about three days ad-
ditional thereafter before the enemy
would arrive on the scene for he cal-
culated that his present position was
three days march from the plateau

  given thus the five or six days lee-
way that he expected he could whip
his new troops into such shape so that
if thev did not break and run at the
first attack their hundred rifles shoot-
ing however wild would be more than
a match for the four to six which the
vikings could muster

  the gangster issued rifles and a lit-
tle ammunition to altoonah and his
bodyguard more as an evidence of
good faith than because they could be
expected to know how to use them

in the morning-which of course was
marked by no sunrise but merely by
enough of them waking up to dis-
turb and rouse the others-the squads
were formed again and nick in the
august presence of king altoonah and
his staff began the superhuman task of
making modern soldiers out of a rab-
ble of naked savages yet superhuman
as it was it was absolutely essential to
his plans of conquest

  according to nicks calculations
the enemy against whom he was train-
ing these men were still in their rocky
fortress many miles to the northward

whereas in actuality the enemy were
almost upon him	

  a fairly level bowlder-dotted field
bordered the beach wthere the skrael-
ing horde stood or reclined or squat-
ted in the center of the field were
drawn up the two ranks of the incipient
rifle company in front of them in a
group stood nick the rat with cicero
swede and friday also altoonah the
skraeling chieftain with his body-
guard charley loy leaned over the
ships rail an interested spectator

  nick issued the commands with ex-
planations assisted by friday altoo-
nah reenforced his authority

  that edge of the field furthest from
the sea wras backed by a ledge of rocks
topped by a thicket of small trees and
from this thicket a score or more of
hostile eyes took in every detail of the
scene below

  tom jones mike murphy and lit-
tle arty-for they were among these
spies in the thicket-withdrew stealth-
ily out of earshot and discussed the
situation the viking commander of
the expedition withdrew with them
although of course he could not con-
tribute very much to the discussion

  altoonah they asked him

   yahhe replied for he had rec-
ognized the crutches

  then said tom nick has made
an alliance with the skraeling king
just as we feared nick carries his
right arm in a sling swedes left hand
and ciceros right shoulder are band-
aged and we found scutari dead back
there so i guess our five vikings did
some very creditable fighting before
they were finally slaughtered by mod-
ern firearms but what is more to the
point these wounds mean that none
of the three white men is very for-
midable with a rifle right now and
none of the three has his rifle with

                     	a

him at the moment altoonah and the
savages grouped around him have ri-
fles but as they must have got them
off the miami i doubt if any of them
has the slightest idea how to use them
except possibly altoonah himself and
hed have difficulty handling one on
crutches we four have rifles know
how to use them and are uninjured
shall we wait for reenforcements
while nick arms and trains these sav-
ages or shall we sneak back to the
edge of the ridge and shoot up the
party

   the skraelings will probably at-
tack us the moment we open fire
answered murphy  there are enough
of them to overpower us in spite of our
guns

  yeah sneered little arty

                                                                                                                    wt

scared of getting nudged by a hunk
of lead are you well if we bump off
the wop and the squarehead and
cicero what difference will it make
what happens to us after that where
is your nerve flat-foot

   lets go said tom

   its okeh with me the ex-cop
stung hastened to agree

   that makes it anonymous said
the little jockey  come on

  turning to the viking tom patted
his own rifle pointed in the direction
of the enemy crooked his finger a
number of times and said brilliantly
 bang bang bang

  the viking smiled and nodded

   yah said he

the four of them crawled back to
the top of the ledge the posi-
tions of the enemy were practi-
cally unchanged tom pointed out to
the viking the group on which they
were to fire first then all four drew
a careful bead on nick fratelli it
seemed inevitable that at least one of
 a

them would be sure to bring down their
victim

  but at just that moment they or
some of their followers were glimpsed
by one of the skraelings

   vikings rang out the cry

  instantly the scene on the plain be-
low shifted like a kaleidoscope

  altoonah might not be versed in
modern squad-formations but in spite
of his inheriting the rank from his fa-
ther goovah he could not have held
his kingship over the wild hordes if he
had not developed an uncanny ability
to direct large bodies of men on the
field of battle

  a few words of command shouted
by him and his warriors were charg-
ing in a body up the slope instinctively
tom mike arty and their ally de-
pressed their muzzles to aim at the
coming attack and only too late
realized that they ought to have pulled
their triggers at nick fratelli before
doing so back up swung their muz-
zles but nick and his two henchmen
and even altoonah had taken advan-
tage of the respite to drop behind pro-
tecting bowlders friday had joined
the rush of the skraelings

  the four on the ledge now fired re-
peatedly into the oncoming mob but
their shots stopped only individuals
rather than be engulfed they slowly
fell back inland their plan having
failed there was no point in their re-
maining to be massacred

  as the first impetuousness of the
skraeling charge wore off the savages
advanced more cautiously and this en-
abled the vikings to collect their forces
and beat an orderly retreat they
knew which their assailants did not
that they were falling back upon reen-
forcements

  altoonahs bodyguard had instinc-
tively dropped their rifles and reverted


argosy

to their native spears when the fight-
ing started their king alone kept hold
of his firearm and had hobbled after
his men as soon as the vikings had
been driven from their position

  crawling cautiously from behind
their protective rocks the three gang-
sters recovered the fallen guns took
them back to the ship and passed them
up to charley loy

   we really ought to get into this
fight stated nick standing on the
beach and looking back toward the
battle

   vy asked swede

   well its our fight explained
nick  if it werent for these damn
wounds we could make those crooks
eat lead

   lets get out of here while the
getting is good suggested cicero
shamelessly

   i suppose altoonah really doesnt
need any help ruminated nick
 hes got enough men to do them
vikings up in spite of their guns we
ought to be off after helga redmond
anyhow you two go on board and
get the miami ready to start while i
have a word with altoonah

  and he lumbered off in the direction
of the fighting

  altoonah was too canny to lead a
charge against modern firearms
especially in his crippled condition so
fratelli found him in the rear directing
the attack in a few hurried words their
plans were made

  altoonah was to turn over the com-
mand to a lieutenant and with nine
picked men was to return to the miami
which was then to start south to inter-
cept the ship bearing helga redmond
when the skraelings had annihilated
tom joness party of vikings the
prospective rifle company were to
march south along the shore keeping

an eye out for the miami the rest
of the skraelings were to go into camp
and hold off as long as possible any
counter-attacking parties of vikings

  these plans decided on altoonah
turned over the command and gave the
necessary instructions to his lieutenant
fridav was located in the melee and
the group went back to the boat which
they found with engines purring all
ready to depart

so they set out to the southward
and it was not long before they
sighted the painted sail and high
prow of the viking freighter bound
north she was making good headway
under the influence of her oars and a
following wind

  as the motor yacht approached all
those on the viking ship who were
neither rowing nor steering crowded
forward to see the strange sight-a
boat moving at an unbelievable speed
without either sails or oars among
the vikings could be seen a regal
young woman richly dressed with
rich yellow hair

  the miami sped by then circled and
slowing down her speed to that of the
viking craft drew up alongside nick
fratelli was at the wheel cicero at the
engines swede and friday at the bow
machine gun and altoonah with only
his shield and crutches beside them in
the bow the rest of the skraelings and
charley loy were ranged along the
deck aft

  nick had never felt so short-handed
he needed cicero both at the engines
and to assist swede with the bow ma-
chine gun where friday was but a
poor substitute he would have liked
to have manned the stern gun too but
that was out of the question

  some of the vikings were nervously
fitting arrows to their bows as altoo-
the radio gun-runners



nah began the conversation it was
dangerous coming thus within range
of the enemy but the swish of the oars

                                     

and the chug of the motor made inter-
course impossible out of bowshot so
the chance had to be taken

   who is in command  shouted
altoonah in norse

  helga redmond stepped to the rail
and replied  i the princess helga
what sort of a godless ship is yours
that sails without sails and rows with-
out oars  who are you  and come you
for peace or for war

   we come for peace most beauti-
ful helga answered the skraeling
chieftain  this boat is the magic ship
of the innuits which we have built to
prove our superiority over your people
who still rely on clumsy sails and oars
do you not recognize your former
lover the great altoonah king of the
innuits i have come for you helga
uppri as i promised when you married
eric redmond

   you are vile shouted the prin-
cess if you do not at once withdraw
the insult i shall have you shot un-
armed and a cripple though you be
the wife of eric redmond and the
daughter of thorvald uppri is not for
any skraeling scum

  now it never does to call a skraeling
a  skraeling for their word for
themselves is  innuits  skraeling 
is like the french word for the ger-
mans namely  bodies

  yet altoonah smiled as he answered
u and altoonah is not unarmed you
know the magic slingshots which eric
and angus brought from the mythical
land beyond the northern ice well we
innuits have an even greater weapon
which can devastate your entire ships
company at one blast if you will come
peaceably aboard us we shall spare
their lives otherwise they die

  helgas reply was a sharp command
and the twang of many bowstrings and
the hum of many arrows

chapter xv

war to the hilt

as the strings of helgas bowmen
 twanged altoonah with the
speed of light swung his pro-
tecting shield in front of himself and
his two companions the arrows clat-
tered harmlessly off it

   spare the girl fire he shouted

  swede heard and understood be-
fore the archers could reload the ma-
chine gun was belching flame to a
staccato accompaniment

  as friday fed in the belts of ammu-
nition swede swept the stream of bul-
lets along the deck of the viking ship
like the stream of water from a garden
hose one traverse of the deck and
not a person stood alive on it except
helga then a sweep back at a slight-
ly lower level and every rower on the
near side slumped in his seat

  right through the shields hung
along the gunwales cut the singing
bullets and many of them reached even
the rowers on the farther side the
rowing stopped quick as a flash the
miami was steered alongside the vik-
ing ship crunching the oars between
the two boats and then swede and
friday clambered aboard followed by
altoonah agile of arm despite his pal-
sied legs

  but as they came helga snatched a
jeweled dagger from the gold chain
which encircled her waist and held it
aloft its tip pointed not at the enemy
but at her own breast suddenly left
alone amid the shambles that had a mo-
ment before been her brave and lusty
countrymen what did there remain for


argosy

her but death  even death were pref-
erable to captivity with a member of
the despised race of skraelings king
though he was

  but just as the dagger fell there
stepped to her side four oarsmen the
only ones who still remained alive out
of all the carnage with drawn swords
they sprang to defend their princess to
the death and one of them snatched the
knife from her hand

  then the automatics of swede and
friday barked several times and al-
toonah hobbled to the side of the faint-
ing helga every other viking lay
dead or dying

  altoonahs skraelings now surged
over the side slit the throats of the
wounded and pillaged the boat finding
amid the loot enough provisions to
stock the miami for a month

  helgas inert form was carried into
the cabin by swede and friday and
her hands were shackled with the de-
cidedly convenient handcuffs which
formerly had belonged to policeman
murphy swede brought water and
threw it in the girls face

  when her senses had thoroughly
been restored she sat up on the couch
where they had laid her and fearlessly
faced altoonah swede and friday
fratelli who had left the boat drifting
had also come to look at the captive

  as fratelli gazed at her his eyes
narrowed and the face of helga red-
mond eclipsed that of theresa ferreira
from his mind not that he altogether
abandoned his lust for little terry but
rather he formulated the idea of estab-
lishing a harem as king of this coun-
try and of having helga as his prin-
cipal and favorite wife this of
course would necessitate getting rid of
altoonah instead of using him as an
ally but doubtless that slight matter
could be arranged all in due time

  luckily altoonah did not catch

                            

nicks look but swede did and it in-
tensified his growing dislike for his
boss ever since swede had come in
contact with the norsemen of the in-
terior of the earths shell he had felt
an ancestral urge calling across the cen-
turies to draw him closer to these
people of his own race and blood this
girl was a viking and a lady swede
was a descendant of vikings although
not exactly a gentleman nick the rat
was only scum according to swedes
views

  it was all right for altoonah to
aspire to the ladys hand for altoonah
was a king even though he was a
skraeling and a cripple but nick
fratelli was a different matter swede
began to wish that he had stuck with
scarface boston jimmy then in a
moment he was glad he had not for
here he might be of service to one of
his own kind swede was rapidly turn-
ing the clock back eight hundred years

soltnds of confusion were heard
on deck outside

       you guard the skirt swede
commanded fratelli  while the king
and i go out and quiet his innuits who
seem to be staging a roughhouse you
can understand her lingo perhaps you
can pump some ideas out of her that
may be of use to us

  when the two allies had left swede
with as gentlemanly an air as he could
muster began in his native tongue
 gracious lady-

  helga jumped and interjected  so
you are what my eric calls a svenska
one of the vikings of the outside world
like my eric that horrid man who
leered at me looks like a skraeling al-
though he wears the clothes of the out-
er world so does the man who board-
ed my ship with you and altoonah so
the radio gun-runners



does one other whom i saw standing
with the native warriors in the stern
of your ship during the battle

  she smiled wryly at the word
 battle and went on  rather mas-
sacre but you look like a viking and
vour voice sounds like one tell me
 
what are you doing in such evil com-
pany are you a renegade to your
own people 

  vswede listened enthralled and con-
cerned

   gracious lady he replied in the
nearest approach he could make to
norse  i was not always one of these
men i was born in sweden

   your language is so like that of
my eric when he first came to these
lands said she  that i am sure you
must be a brave and good man like
him what is your name viking

   yon yonson gracious lady he
replied  and my life is at your serv-

          

ice

   then you must get me out of
here she pleaded away from those
awful men

  by this time the noise outside had
subsided and nick and altoonah re-
entered as they came in nick was
making some bombastic remark to his
ally and translated it for swedes ben-
efit -

  said nick  i was telling him that
one italian was a match for a hundred
vikings

  it was the wrong time to make a re-
mark like that to johnson

   it vos a swede and a eskimo did
it though remonstrated the latter

  yeah replied fratelli well
get this it was an italians brains that
directed the whole show

   i tank- began swede

   shut up exclaimed nick  none
of that line now how are you get-
ting along with the moll

    i tank she tell me a lot

   all right pump her dry then
guard the door when you get too
tired come and wake cicero to take
your place

  the other two withdrew and soon
the engines could be heard throbbing
again at last the boat slowed orders
were given outside with much running
to and fro and the anchor dropped
footsteps retired aft and then silence
the victors were resting

   swede turned to the captive princess
and said  i tank ve go ashore then
in swedish  oh excuse me i talked
the wrong language every one will
be asleep soon they plan to go north
in the morning to join altoonahs
army

   then we must flee north inter-
jected helga

   no south asserted swede sur-
prised at her suggestion

  dont you see explained helga
 they know that you know that they
are going north so they will expect
us to flee in the other direction ac-
cordingly they will pursue us south
and if we have gone north we shall
escape

  it was too subtle for yon yonson
 maybe so

it seemed absurd to be sneaking away
from the ship in broad daylight but
after an interval the two tiptoed
out of the cabin into the mess-room
there swede paused and scratched his
head for a moment then whispered
 weve got to take a chance on wak-
ing them for we cant go without food
and weapons

so he tiptoed into the bunk room
presently emerging with two rifles two
ammunition belts two automatic pis-
tols two packs and a broad grin
leading helga onto the deck and


argosy

handing her all the equipment except
one pistol and belt and the two packs
he signed to her to stand still and
then he sneaked aft to the door of the
galley there he paused and shook his
head sadly for a moment but finally
pulling himself together he entered
the cause of his hesitation had been
that the chinaman was sitting asleep in
a chair tilted back against the wall di-
rectly across the galley from the door

  but helga and he must have food
for their journey if the chink made
a move swede was prepared to ship
out his gun and bind and gag charley
under threat of death

  the intruder knew exactly where the
compressed rations were kept having
often helped charley in the kitchen so
he quickly filled both knapsacks but
to do so it was necessary for him to
turn his back on the chinaman

  the moment his back was turned
the slit-eyes of the oriental opened
slightly and took in the scene without
the slightest change in expression or
any bodily movement

  some sixth sense must have warned
swede that he was observed for sud-
denly he wheeled around from his
work snatching out his automatic as
he turned but some sixth sense must
have warned charley loy too for
swede saw merely the placid benign
face of a sleeping chinaman

  charley made no further move and
swede at last departed with both his
packs well-filled with provisions and
rejoined helga on deck not a soul
stirred as swede helping helga be-
cause of the manacled condition of her
hands they made their way ashore and
to a protecting fringe of trees as the
fugitives disappeared two slant eyes
in a yellow face watched them from
one of the portholes of the miami and
then if any one could have looked at

that moment into the ships kitchen
they would have seen a surprising
sight they would have seen charley
loy doing a double shuffle dance with
glee writ large on his usually inscrut-
able face but luckily for his reputa-
tion as an imperturbable oriental no
one saw him for all others on the
miami were sound asleep then
charley returned to his chair refolded
his hands across his chest and resumed
his interrupted nap

swede and helga having gained
the cover of the trees were pro-
ceeding northward along the shore
at a rapid pace

  as soon as they had gone about a
mile and thus were presumably out of
hearing of the miami swede got two
large stones from the beach and
bashed the handcuffs between them
until he had freed his companion thus
ended the eventful career of mike
murphys police manacles

  although the two fugitives were due
to have slept at the very time they
started forth yet tired as they were
they did not dare stop until they had
struggled on for about eight hours un-
der the beating central sun then they
slept but whether for a few minutes
or a few hours or a few days there
was no way of telling the scene and
the time of day on which they reopened
their eyes were exactly the same as
those on which they had closed them

  they had camped beside a little
stream which flowed tinkling to the
sea now they roused themselves
washed ate and hurried on

  a hundred yards or so beyond the
brook the shore made a decided bend
inland so swede parted the fringe of
bushes to get the lay of the land he
found that they were at the tip of the
first of two capes which bounded a har-
the radio gun-runners



bor about a mile long and half a mile
across at the mouth

  the opposite shore was devoid of
trees and there he saw what startled
but did not surprise him-a body of
about a hundred and fifty skraelings
on the march south hastily with-
drawing his head he informed helga
that altoonahs newly-formed rifle
corps were about to arrive on the scene
on their way to rejoin the miami

  being a city man he had no plans
there were here no alleys dowrn which
to duck no vacant lots to cross  cel-
lars in which to hide

  finally helga suggested  lets
hurry back to the little brook and then
go inland in the shelter of the trees and
bushes of its ravine

  the idea seemed a good one so they
hastened to put it into execution for-
tunately their progress was assisted by
a well-marked animal-trail which par-
alleled the stream

  as the path ascended they more and
more often caught glimpses of the en-
emy until it became evident that if
they went much farther they would by
the same token be in more and more
frequent danger of being seen them-
selves besides they were breathless
from the speed with which they had
made the ascent so they sat down in
the concealment of some bushes to
watch until the enemy should have
passed by

  now the two fugitives saw the
miami steam into sight from the south-
ward it anchored at the mouth of the
little brook at whose headwaters helga
and her swedish protector were hid-
ing and fratelli made contact with his
skraeling rifle company nick had rea-
soned as helga had expected that the
fugitives had headed south but she
had not foreseen that he wtould do what
he did-steam south land a search

party to work northward and thus head
them off while he sailed the yacht back
to meet his rifle corps

chapter xvi

the ship of death

swede and helga from their
hiding-place twro miles inland saw
the miami meet the skraelings
and presently they saw the natives ad-
vancing single file up the path by which
they themselves had ascended

   i forgot to ask you remarked
swede can you shoot a- he
fumbled for the norse word

   rifle she added in english

   how do you knowr  he asked
surprised

   why thats what my eric calls
them said she in norse  yes i can
he has had me practice with it empty
many times but only twice or thrice
with  bullets  in it for we are very
short of  ammunition

   well nows your chance for some
real practice he announced  for we
have plenty of ammunition and here
come the skraelings

   lets lie low and keep very quiet
until they get close she cautioned

  so they waited on came the leader
of the single-file line of savages on
he came until within about fifty yards
of them he suddenly stopped uttered
some sort of guttural remark of sur-
prise and pointed in their direction

  pie says look translated
helga in a whisper  he must see us
no dont fire for he is pointing above
us at something else

  swede and helga turned their heads
and followed the direction of the point-
ing finger of the skraeling to their
horror they saw a gigantic gray snake
with curious markings as big around


argosy

as a barrel and fully fifty feet long
wriggling down the mountainside
above them his forked red tongue
large as an average snake of the outer
world quivered in and out of his half-
open mouth and his expressionless
eyes were deadly cold

  to stay wrhere they were would
mean to be devoured by this serpent
whereas either to fire at the beast or
to flee from it would mean to be im-
mediately attacked by the skraelings

  but the enemy were evidently as
frightened of the snake as they a
hurried command was passed down the
advancing line and the savages pre-
cipitately left the bed of the stream
and started southward deployed like a
line of skirmishers

  the two fugitives for their part
lost no time in scrambling to the top
of the north bank of the stream under
cover of the bushes which lined it
there they paused not daring to pro-
ceed further butready to-flee into the
open if the serpent should force
them to

  but the snake disregarding both
them and the skraelings crawled
leisurely down the ravine toward the
sea

   looks as though they were plan-
ning to attack some one said swede
glancing back towtard the skirmish-line
of skraelings and avoiding all further
mention of the big snake

   i think they are searching for us
replied helga

  the two watched and waited until
the thin strung-out line disappeared in
the distance they sawr the miami also
go south again then they started
sneaking diagonally across country in
the opposite direction until they struck
the head of the bay from which point
they followed the shore northward as
before

   nothing ahead of us now exulted
swede  until we strike altoonahs
main army falling back this way before
the advance of your vikings

   halt a voice hailed them in eng-
lish  stick up your hands

although swede could see no
one it was evident that the
speaker had him covered it would
be foolhardy to reach for his gat now
if the newcomer proved to be un-
armed or insufficiently armed there
would be plenty of time later to at-
tempt gunplay so up went swedes
hands

   put your hands up he translated
to the girl  or some one is going to
shoot you

   capture is worse than death she
replied contemptuously and drew her
automatic

  a figure in the much-bedraggled re-
mains of a yachting costume stepped
from behind a bush in front of them
an automatic in his hand

   y immys ghost exclaimed
swede in a horror-stricken voice

 shall i shoot him asked helga
 it wouldnt do any good replied
her escort through chattering teeth
 for hes dead already i killed him
myself two or three days ago

   cut out the svenska interjected
scarface peremptorily  talk united
states or ill drill you im not afraid
of the lady for i can tell by the way
she holds her gat that she hasnt thrown
the safety catch see

  and still keeping swede covered he
stepped quickly over to helga and re-
lieved her of the firearm which she was
frantically trying to discharge at him

  she promptly sank to the ground
and began to sob

  scarface then helped himself to
swedes gun and both rifles
the radio gun-runners



   now you can lower your hands
announced he  for you look tired
sit down and tell me who the lady is
and what you are doing here and
where is the rest of your gang

  you sure you aint ban dead
asked swede incredulously

                                                               w

   listen swede-i ought to know
oughtnt i

   but ve shot you down in your
glider and couldnt find you swede
objected still unwilling to trust the
evidence of his senses

  one fundamental principle with
scarface boston jimmy was that he al-
ways retained control and direction of
any dialogue in which he was engaged
so he ignored the question implied in
the others remark

   never mind how i got here said
he  the fact is that here i am and i
have you covered so its you thats go-
ing to answer the questions not i who
is the lady  what are you doing here 
and what has become of the rest of
your gang

  veil replied swede still discon-
certed  her name ban helga

   not helga uppri exclaimed
scarface

  startled by the exclamation the girl
looked up

   yah helga uppri said she
 helga redmond

  ve ban run avay from nick
added swede  ve ban hunting for
her vikings

   and where is nick fratelli now
   yoost gone sout

   and the miami

   yoost gone sout too nick ban
in her

  fair enough ejaculated jimmy
so youve turned viking well so
have i shake on it

  they shook but with scandinavian
persistency swede returned to his

earlier doubt  you ban dead
yimmv

i dont blame you for thinking
i so replied scarface tolerantly

      you shot me down all right
but i wasnt hit except one bullet
which just barely nipped my side bled
quite badly but no real harm done
the other fellow was killed and i
couldnt control the plane so it crashed
the plane caught me and carried me
under and stuck on the bottom i
guess i must have been stunned for a
few moments

   when i came to i found that my
head was inside the cockpit which was
upside down and full of air so i
stayed there just as long as i could
stand it and then ducked out and came
to the surface the miami was chug-
ging away i lay on my back with my
nose just barely out of water until you
were at a safe distance then swam
ashore and cut straight inland mean-
ing to turn northward after awhile
and circle the skraeling army

   but this land must be narrower
than i thought for i soon struck the
sea on the other side and have been
following the coast northward ever
since i hid while a body of skraelings
passed me just a little while ago bound
north

   nort  exclaimed swede inter-
rupting no soutt

  what do you mean south de-
manded scarface  if this is the
opposite coast from the one we landed
on then that direction must be north
 but it ban same coast replied
swede grinning  you ban all
twisted yimmy

   well i must be ejaculated scar-
face  ill bet i wandered around in a
circle and came back to the same sea i
started from so that direction is

south and the rest of altoonahs
army is- fighting the vikings some-
where north 

   yah

   what became of helgas boat and
the vikings who were with her
vikings all shot up vit machine
gun ve took everyting out of the boat
and left it explained swede

  during all this conversation helga
had been studying the handsome
though scarred face of the young
gangster now she held out one hand
to him with a gracious gesture

  jimmy not knowing just what was
expected of him dropped on one knee
took the hand in one of his and kissed
it whether or not it was what was ex-
pected the action seemed to please the
girl for she smiled

   here are your guns said scar-
face  come on lets trek north and
try to get through the skraeling lines
and join the vikings

  boat exclaimed helga pointing
out to sea

  both men followed the direction of
her finger far out at sea was a
dragon-prowed ship with sail furled
being propelled southward by lusty
rowers against a light head wind

  the fools exclaimed scarface
jimmy  they cant stand up for a
minute against a machine gun we
must head them off come on

when jimmy had failed to re-
turn to the plateau city angus
s e  k i r k dispatched another
glider and not waiting for its report
at once set out down the skraeling
trail with all the remaining available
warriors of the plateau leaving nils
uppri much against his will in charge
nils might be bishop arid hence the
nominal ruler of all this realm but his
extreme youthfulness compelled him to

defer to the judgment of his elders
even though he outranked them

  however as soon as angus had left
nils asserted himself and evolved what
seemed to him deprived of the advice
of the one local man who understood
chicago gangsters and american fire-
arms to be a first-rate plan namely
to sail south in a trading ship which
had just arrived and engage single-
handed in a naval battle with the
miami

  he could not conceive how a hand-
ful of these outlandish americans on 
whatever kind of a boat with what-
ever kind of weapons could be any
match at all for one of the superb
dragon ships of the norsemen

  the norse ship was fully manned
so the shortage of warriors on the
plateau would not hamper him in his
undertaking there were plenty of old
gravbeards to assume the duties of
government in the city which he was
leaving so he donned his armor
turned over the reins of government
and made for the beach several of
the women and old men came down
with him to see him off

  thus it was that his sister astrid
his beautiful cousin borghild and the
little portuguese minx theresa were
all on the beach when the final prepa-
rations were being made for sailing

  not a word of norse did little terry
understand but when borghild point-
ed south and said  yimmy bout
komm she caught the idea and nod-
ded

  the group on the beach watched the
stalwart craft row out to sea and turn
southward bishop nils uppri from
the stern beside the helmsman waved
a proud farewell his people waved
back and cheered for they loved the
brave bov

  then astrid turned to look for bor-
the radio gun-runners



ghild and theresa but they were no-
where to be seen inquiry of all those
who had been on the beach produced
no information nor even any clews

  meanwhile the viking ship rowed
south with furled sail the crew taking
turns at rowing and sleeping

  it was not until eight or ten hours
later that one of the men in disturb-
ing one of the sleeping-mats disturbed
also theresa and borghild whom the
mat had served to conceal the two
were at once haled before the bishop
who gave them a quite unecclesiastical
dressing-down

  but he was not as effective as he
might have been in the first place he
was too young in the second place
borghild was his cousin who had
grown up with him from childhood
and in the third place little terry
couldnt understand a word of his ti-
rade

   gee your reverence said she
grinning  that dont mean nothing in
my young life youll have to speak
united states to get by with me yee
forstaar ikka

  which was all the norse she knew

nils didnt dare turn back for fear
that angus might have returned
to the plateau and might put a
stop to his venture nils as boy bishop
presented somewhat the same pitiable
figure as king george of england
begging his prime minister for permis-
sion to pardon lord mayor mcswiney
and being refused-perhaps the most
pathetic occurrence in all the history of
the outer world

  accordingly there was nothing for
nils to do but put up with the pres-
ence of the two girls terrys presence
at least did not particularly irk him
but he couldnt discriminate before all
these men between her and his cousin

  in due course of time the dragon
ship of nils uppri passed the spot
where the viking army was slowly
driving south the main body of the
skraelings but nils did not stop or
even draw near to the shore for fear
that older and wiser heads among the
norse warriors might attempt to dis-
suade him from his undertaking and
thus it was that eventually his barge
hove in sight of scarface swede and
helga as already related

  the attempt of these three to head
him off proved unavailing they stood
on the promontory and waved and
waved and shouted but the viking
barge swept on to the southward the
lusty song of the rowers drowning the
warning voices

  the miami was still in sight not far
away as it had slowed its engines to
keep pace with the searching skirmish-
line of savages presently the watch-
ers on shore saw the miami sight the
norse ship turn around and advance
to meet it they held their breaths with
horror at the impending calamity

  bravely the dragon ship steered
straight at the miami to ram and sink
it the rowers speedingup to their fast-
est stroke but expert as were these
navigators out of the past they were
no match in maneuvering for a motor
yacht undermanned though it was

  so the miami blithely side-stepped
the charge and almost before the
vikings realized what was up circled
their ship with the deadly machine gun
turned loose in less than one ammu-
nition-belt it was all over the once-
proud norse craft was drifting leader-
less upon the sea nils uppri had been
one of the first to fall and not another
viking stood alive on the dragon ship

  the watchers on the shore saw the
miami tie up alongside the barge for
a few minutes and then cut loose and

chug south again to rejoin the skrael-
ings for nick had made but a cursory
search of the conquered boat merely
long enough to slit the throats of any
wounded who showed signs of life and
to rob the dead of their jewelry and
more ornate weapons and clothing of
provisions he had no need as he was
fully stocked from the loot of helgas
ship and he was not to be diverted
except temporarily from his vengeful
search for swede and helga

  swedes defection had hampered
him considerably but he had stationed
cicero and friday at the machine gun
and charley loy at the engines the
chink might not know anything about
machinery but he could shift gears in
response to bell-signals from the pilot-
house and could realize full well that
any monkeying with the engines would
mean his instant demise

  as the miami proceeded south once
more the spoils of war were divided
and soon every one on board even in-
cluding charley loy was busy ac-
coutering himself in norse clothing
and armament this preoccupation
accounted for their not being quite as
alert as they should have been during
the important events which immediate-
ly followed

a slight shift in the wind slowly
drifted the dragon ship shore-
ward

   lets meet her when she beaches
suggested helga through swede as an
interpreter  there may still be some
alive on board who may need our aid

  jimmy assented and so the three
walked slowly along still keeping un-
der cover of the bushes until they came
to the spot toward which the boat was
being borne by the rapidly freshening
wind

  when it finally bumped upon the

shallows the three waded furtively out
and climbed on board

  the mutilated and stripped -bodies
were a sad sight even to the two hard-
ened chicago gangsters but to helga
they were more many of them were
old friends and acquaintances all
were quite quite dead thanks either to
american machine gun bullets or to
the frightful efficiency of the throat-
slashing savages

  under directions from the saddened
princess the two men carried the
bodies one by one to the stern and cov-
ered each with a sleeping-mat

  the sight sobered scarface boston
jimmy as the realization swept over
him that this was exactly what he him-
self had planned to do if it had not
been for the defection of his chief lieu-
tenant nick the rat this crime might
now be on his own head the real
change in scarface boston jimmy and
the definite abandonment of his dreams
of empire dated from that moment-
and was strengthened by his relief and
joy when theresa and borghild un-
scathed were found cowrering beneath
the pile of sleeping-mats it was a
heart-warming sight that reunion of
old friends

  borghild flung herself upon scar-
face and clung to him sobbing  yim-
my yimmy

  helga raised her eyebrows for a mo-
ment and then smiled tolerantly
then because of borghilds preoccupa-
tion swede introduced terry to helga

  but suddenly borghild broke away
with a cry  nils nils my cousin nils
where is he 

 nils was he on board ex
claimed helga and scarface simultane-
ously though in different languages

   sure and  yah replied terry
and borghild

  and immediately there began a fran
the radio gun-runners



tic search among such corpses as had
not yet been moved the body of the
boy bishop was soon discovered lying
in the bow where he had stood with
a party of boarders directing the at-
tack the three women flung them-
selves upon it in tears

  but scarface shouted  lay off it
he may still be alive

elbowing the frantic women one
side he examined the body the
throat had not been slit no
wounds noticeable anywhere except one
in the temple which smeared the face
with blood

  lifting the shirt of chain-mail the
gangster applied his ear to the chest

  hes not dead he shouted
 water quick

  theresa brought some at once in one
of the cooking utensils and dashed it
in nilss face and soon the blue eyes
of the young viking opened stared
v-aguely around rested on the girl
bending over him and paused there

   where am i  nils groaned

   we must get him ashore at once to
safety asserted scarface

  but while they had been at work
the wind had made a complete about-
turn and they were now a hundred
rards or more at sea and being rapidly
blown further

   lets get up the sail and tack
back suggested jimmy  hey
swede ask mrs redmond and miss
hoglund if they know how to hoist it

and then you help them miss fer-
reira you stay with the bishop ill
clear away the broken oars and then
steer hurry

  it was a rash and mistaken move
the viking ship in its apparently un-
manned condition might have drifted
out to sea unnoticed but the moment
the gaudily striped sail began to rise
their maneuver was instantly sighted
by the distant miami which at once
put about and came after them full
speed

  no time now to tack

   weve got to run for it before the
wind announced scarface grabbing
the steering oar

  soon the sail was fully flung to the
offshore breeze and swede and the
two viking girls finished clearing away
the oars while scarface steered and
theresa soothed and tended nils

  the wind grew steadily stronger and
swung to the northward its strength-
ening brought the speed of the dragon
ship almost up to that of the craft
which was seeking to overhaul it but
the shift of wind to the northward
enabled the miami to follow in a small-
er circle and thus to overtake it with
great rapidity

  as the miami came within rifle
range those aboard the viking barge
could see cicero and friday busily get-
ting the bow machine gun ready for ac-
tion in a few minutes its deadly spray
would be spattering upon the fleeing
vessel

 tin can  mccann was only one man against the relentless march
 of progress but as he warned the puget sound surveyors
 and road-builders he was versatile

by lawrence william pedrose

hpin can  mccann drove his
i skiff in to the shore with long
quick sweeps of the oars that
revealed great agitation the tide was
high he beached the light craft
dragged it up into the bushes and
after stowing away in the stern sheets
a neatly w r a p p e d package for his
neighbor timothy bowers took his
own sack of groceries and struck off up
the wooded trail toward home

  mccann and bowers lived on ad-
joining homesteads half a mile back
from tidewater on puget sound for
twenty-nine years the old fellows had

been friends now they were enemies
and the trouble had developed from a
trivial bit of innocent raillery tim-
othy was proud of his ability as a
gardener and raised his own vegeta-
bles mccann preferred to buy what
he needed mccann had announced he
was thinking of enlarging his cabin

   gwan timothy had scoffed  all
you need is room for a bunk and a
can opener they ought to call you

	tin can  mccann

  it was so true that the name had
stuck to mccanns discomfort for
twelve months now the old men had
canny



not spoken to each other except on rare
occasions and they avoided meeting
only one bond appeared to remain of
their once beautiful friendship that
was the skiff mccann went to the
hamlet of kingston five miles distant
every saturday morning if timothy
needed anything from the store he
left a note in the boat and his neigh-
bor would bring the articles from town
and stow them in the skiff where tim-
othy could get them at his convenience
-and without conversation

so mccann reached home a cabin
set at the edge of a small clearing
in the timber after putting away
his groceries he sat down on the front
step of the dwelling and stared- with
conflicting emotions in the direction of
timothys place

  at the store he had been advised of
a matter of great importance a state
highway was projected connecting the
town with the county seat the route
followed that of an old state road
which had been built to the edge of
mccanns homestead on the south and
to the township line on the north edge
of bowerss land the two mens
quarter-sections constituted a mile gap
in the old state road and had to be
crossed to connect the highways a
legislative appropriation having been
made a strip of their lands was to be
taken

  mccann carried an unopened letter
in his pocket and its arrival just when
the road was projected made him sure
it had a bearing on the matter in the
package which he had left at the skiff
was a similar missive which the post-
man had given him for bowers he
wanted to go over to tims and dis-
cuss the thing which menaced the vir-
gin wilderness in which they dwelled
but pride forbade

  true he might go halfway and at-
tract bowers with a yell so they could
meet on the line dividing their proper-
ties-but to set foot upon his neigh-
bors place would be compromising

  the problem was solved by a hail
which came from the edge of the
woods in the direction of the beach
trail he turned with a quick frown to
discover bowers perched on the fence
summoning him with a peremptory
gesture mccann got up with a shrug
and strode leisurely toward his neigh-
bor

   what you doin on my place
tim he demanded i told you to
keep your blattin sheep off my land
and i dont make no distinction be-
tween sheep and sheepmen any one
whod bring bangtail muttons into a
grazin country and spoil the pasture
for cattle is my idea of a hooman gnat
mentally and morally and further-
more-

  oh dry up interjected bowers
 your cow broke down my fences
your horses trampled my berries but
i didnt come packin a fight though
i aint totin a branch either i got a
letter from the board of county com-
missioners saying they want to put a
connecting link to their roads across
my place thats a fifty-foot strip for
half a mile they want to take three
acres more or less and offer three
hundred dollars otherwise thevll con-
demn the land and ill probably get
around a hundred dollars

   well glared mccann  i got one
of them letters too what you goin to
do about it

   what you going to do countered
bowers  the lands worth moren
that and if improvements come in
the taxes will go sky-high

   im agin it declared mccann
emphatically  you know how those


argosy

things work out soon as the high-
way goes through along will come
loorists then jints sellin sody pop gas
stations chicken dinner inns and road
houses next year well have picnick-
ers scattering trash all over the place
and carryin on like hellions in the


woods

   but it would provide us with a
good market for poultry and garden
truck argued bowers  and we cant
expect to live in seclusion here all our
lives the world is growing they say
autymobiles have become thicker n
horses and the people have to have
room to exercise them they cant find
space for em all in the city so theyre
opening up the country maybe this
district will settle tap and we can es-
tablish a town site or something that
d bring us in lots of money

   hrrumph g r o w  e d mccann 
 im no miser im not lookin for to
make money i got comfort and a good
livin my neighbors -this was a
barbed dig- leave me alone mostly
let them road builders cut your land
into forty slices if you want to but
theyre not goin to devastate mine

 i think ill take them up con-
cluded bowers  but i thought
id let you know if we dont
give them the right of way theyll
condemn it and take it anyway
they wont take mine flared
mccann  i settled on this land and
its mine by thirty years right this
is my home and my home is my castle
ill defend it with every ounce of my
strength and every drop of my blood
bowers eyed the other anxiously

   you-you wouldnt get vilent
he protested you know theyll go
about it legally the engineers will
survey it then the court will condemn
it and serve notice on you the road

builders will come right along and if
you oppose them with vilence theyll
have you arrested and taken to the
county jail by the time you get out
the road  be built

   a crafty grin appeared on tin can
mccanns face

    im versatile he said slyly  i
aint been buckin the world for sixty
years for nothin maybe i dont know
law but i do know hooman nature if
theyd make a decent price for the land
-say a thousand dollars for the three
acres-id give it to em and welcome
then i could go away where pestifer-
ous neighbors and smart lawyers
wouldnt bother me

    but you wont use vilence pur-
sued bowers greatly disturbed
mccann shook his head

   no im versatile i tell you but
take my word for it-they wont cut
up my land unless i get my price

    youll never get it sighed bow-
ers you may think youre canny
but them slick city fellers will out-
smart you and remember-if you get
took to jail dont come whinin for me
to bail you out

                        

   he swung to the ground and strode
away

    say mccann called angrily after
him  any time i want advice or
favors from you ill send you a hand-
engraved invitation and when i get
my price for my land dont come
achin around sayin you wish youd
had spunk enough to demand your
rights

it came to pass as bowers had pre-
dicted less than a fortnight after
the county officials made their first
overtures a gang of surveyors was put
to work running a line across bowerss
quarter-section and thence across tin
cans land the engineers met their

                      	a
canny



first obstacle when they reached the
old blaze line separating the two mens
homesteads tin can had m a d e a
special trip to kingston the store-
keeper there had a knack for lettering
and tin can had him make up several
signs they read

danger-bear traps

  but it wasnt bear traps that tin
can bought he didnt have the heart
to do that yet he purchased a dozen
single-spring affairs about the size of
his hand-number ones-and toted
them home with the signs

  he placed the warnings at stra-
tegical points and waited to see the
effect the engineers came to the first
sign and were worried several days
were lost before the deception was re-
vealed they had been going forward
with extreme caution and it was not
until two of the chain men had gotten
their toes pinched in the miniature
traps that they came to understand the
degree of danger they were facing

  mccann was undaunted he had
hardly hoped the surveyors would be
permanently held up by muskrat traps
he went to town again and this time
he bought real bear traps he got six
of them and they were big brutes
the engineers decided he meant busi-
ness when they saw him toting them
through the woods

   hey old man called the head
engineer running after him  you
cant get away with that youre en-
dangering my men when you stick
those things around promiscuously
besides this isnt bear country

   the tarnation it aint retorted
mccann  wait till i catch a few and
show you i didnt give you fellers
permission to trespass on my property
and if you value your hides youll get
out of here

   	a

   but this right of way is to be con-
demned protested the engineer  as
soon as i send in my figures on timber
and so forth the court will give you a
satisfactory price for the land come
on-be a good fellow and dont hold
us up with any more of these ludicrous
stunts

   how much do you think ill get
for the land timber and all parried
mccann

   oh about ten dollars an acre for
the land and about fifty dollars for
the timber smiled the engineer
youre lucky to get anything

  humph snorted tin can  this
lands worth a hundred an acre and
the timbers worth two hundred one
thousand dollars is my price now-
clar out

  the engineers were at their wits
end they decided to match cunning
with cunning and sent forward their
best woodsmen to watch where the old
man put his traps tin can made a
bold set just before dusk then left the
trap circled through the woods and
came back to watch it from the con-
cealment of a patch of huckleberry
bushes he saw the enemy steal out of
the brush uncover the trap and chor-
tling with glee carry it away

  at dawn the following morning he
went to the engineers camp which
was located on bowerss quarter-sec-
tion routing out the head man he
told him he had set out quite a large
number of bear traps the engineer
was exasperated and argued with him

   im just givin you fair warnin
growled tin can  i let you think
you outfoxed me when you lifted that
first trap but ive got lots more and
theyre scattered clar across my place
im after bear and i dont want you
fellers traipsin through the woods
theyre big ones too them traps


argosy

theyd bite off a mans leg as quick as
a buzz saw so stay clar

he trudged back home and went
to bed later in the day he was
disturbed by some one pounding
upon his cabin door he got up and
found timothy bowers puffing from
excitement and exertion standing on
the threshold

  get out mccann shrilled
 youve lined up with the enemy and
youre takin your miserable life in
your hands cornin here i warn you
i got bear traps scattered everywhere
and if you or those blattin bangtail
sheep of yourn get into them i wont
be responsible

   oh look here tin can begged
bowers you didnt set any traps
for me and i know it ive come to
speak for the engineers theyre nice
boys at best you can only hold them
up for a while be reasonable let
that road go through and ill assign
to you what i get out of the condem-
nation

  you renegade scorned mccann
 you go over to the enemy camp and
still expect me to have truck with you
didnt i tell you that when i wranted
your advice id send you a hand-
engraved invitation them city guys
has my proposition and when they
come to me with the cold cash ill dig
up them traps-not before now go

  bowers went defeated and angry

  again there was a period of stale-
mate the engineers went out with
their rods and began exploring with
minute care every inch of the way as
they advanced upon tin cans soil in
three days they had progressed only a
quarter of the way across the forbid-
den land

  they found no traps but there was
no way of determining how many had

been set out or where they might be
others might be scattered about in the
woods to catch the men if they stepped
off the right of way so great was the
danger it began to affect the morale of
the gang the men became furtive
fearful that at any moment they might
plunge into one of the terrible snares

  and there was nothing to prevent
tin can from sneaking in and putting
other traps in the area that had been
explored and declared safe it was
only when some of the men quit flatly
that the engineers put their inventive
genius to work

  one saturday morning tin can
made his customary trip to kingston
and found on the dock there two
strange steel monsters which the
steamer from the city had just un-
loaded while he hung around two of
the men from the surveyors camp ar-
rived and took charge of the contrap-
tions the men climbed aboard them
and they went chug-chugging up the
dock and lumbered off into the woods

  tractors explained the store-
keeper  caterpillar tractors burke
the engineer says hes got you buffa-
loed now tin can you cant trap
one of those things sorry youre beat-
en old boy i didnt want that road
to go through any moren you did-
it d take all my trade to the county
seat

  beaten am i snapped mccann
 why i aint started to fight yet
that road  go through when i get
my price-not before let them run
their lines you wait till they start
gradin and see here dont you go
callin me tin can either

  you-you wont use firearms
questioned the store man nervously
 theyre just laying for you to do
something rash so they can slap you
in jail
canny



  tin can laughed grimly no i
only put up the obstacles i have a right
to on my land but im versatile i
am

   but after that strip is condemned
warned the storekeeper  youll be the
one whos trespassing  it and any-
thing you do then theyll hold you
liable

   when that time comes theyll be
hog-tied grinned mccann  now
ive got an order i want you to put
through monday for me and ill be
over next day to meet the boat from
town

  he gave the store man certain in-
structions took his usual stock of
groceries including a small order for
bowers and went jauntilv back to his
boat and rowed home

mccann watched with more than
a little secret satisfaction the
triumphant invasion of his land
by the surveying gang the alien crew
chugged back and forth  their cater-
pillars in total disregard of any traps
he might have set churning up the soil
and grinding everything in the way
deep into the ground the men taunt-
ed him when they saw him near the
right of way but he took their gibes
good-naturedly

   well see who laughs last he re-
torted when the chief of the gang
called to him and asked him if he had
anything more in his bag of tricks

  tuesday he again rowed to kings-
ton and returned with ten wooden
cases each was stamped

stumping powder
 dynamite
handle with care

  so that the prematurely exulting
surveyors would not learn of his plans

he waited until darkness fell before he
began carrying his cargo home he
had plenty of time and went about the
task leisurely the first night he took
two boxes home the following two
nights he carried home four boxes
each night then he set about perfect-
ing the next step in his program

  behind the cabin lay a pile of tin
cans-the containers which timothy
bowers had pointed to with ridicule
he selected two that were in good
condition then he went out into the
woods and cut several small saplings
which he peeled with his jackknife
with care he removed the stumping
powder from the boxes he handled
them fondlv and there was a reminis-
cent smile on his face once many
years ago he had wtorked in the mining
camps

   when it comes to powder tin can
knows his stuff timothy bowers had
often said

  the waxed brown paper covering
the sticks of powder was dry so he
took about thirty sticks into the house
and set them alongside the stove in
half an hour the waxed paper became
streaked with oil telling that the pow-
der had  thawed  and reached its
most combustible stage

  satisfied he carried the sticks out-
side again and fitted them into one of
the tins next he opened the ends of
several sticks drilled holes with a
sharpened piece of wood and fitted
them with detonation caps and fuse
then he carelessly folded dowrn the
top of the tin the second tin was even
harder to fix

  the day was over by the time the
job was completed but he was in no
haste the surveyors knowing nothing
of his trump card had finished run-
ning their lines for the day and de-
parted the following night he scout-


argosy

ed the length of the survey without
finding a single man on guard re-
lieved he got a shovel and his two in-
fernal machines and went back

  one of the tins he buried in the right
of way the other he placed on a
stump in a conspicuous position not
far from the old blaze dividing his and
bowerss homesteads he stuck the
shovel in the ground with artful care-
lessness then went home and got the
powder boxes these he took apart
separating sides from ends and laid
them in places along the right of way
where they could be instantly seen to
an observer it would appear that doz-
ens of boxes of explosives had been
relieved of their contents in the vicin-
ity of the right of way it required no
stretch of the imagination to guess
where the powder had been hidden

two days passed then a crew of
men came through and put up
condemnation notices mccann
received an official-looking letter
through the mail it was greek to him
he could not read

  he concluded after a brisk stranger
had dashed up and asking if he were
mr mccann handed him a formal-
looking document that ownership of
the right of way had virtually passed
to the hands of the enemy he
chuckled to himself then one morn-
ing a small army of men appeared with
motor-driven machinery coming from
the direction of bowerss place the
woods became filled with noise he
knew that the road builders to speed
up their work were about to attack the
right of way at several different points
but the gang had no more than
brought up their machinery than two
excited young engineers came dashing
up to the house

   hey one of them demanded

 whats the meaning of all those dyna-
mite boxes lying along the right of
way

   nothin drawled mccann
just overlooked em i guess im
careless thatawav

  the man thrust an accusing finger at
him and held up the tin filled with
thawed powder

   what does this bomb mean grit-
ted the engineer

   what would you guess  coun-
tered mccann

   do you know what  happen to
you if youve mined that right of
way threatened the other  thats
a state road now

   wasnt when i was down there last
with that dynamite smiled mccann
unperturbed  i did considerable
work preparing to break up the sub-
soil i just happened to get my shots
placed when that strip was taken away
from me now you fellers can finish
it

   but we dont know wrhere you
placed the mines exclaimed the road
builder angrily

  well go ahead and put your
graders to work-youll know soon
enough invited tin can

  the engineers were horrified

   why exclaimed the one holding
the bomb  this stuff has been thawed
and is in a highly explosive condition
if a shovel or a scraper-point hit it the
whole outfit would be blown to bits

   you never spoke a truer word
son agreed mccann  but you
would condemn my land without play-
ing fair with me now you boys can
run along and play with your fire-
works they know at headquarters
where i stand just to show you i bear
you boys no ill will ill furnish a nice
grassy plot and a headboard for every
one who finds one of those cans
canny



  the men went away distinctly not
comforted or relieved the construc-
tion gang did no work that day the
right of way was minutely-and very
cautiously - examined but tin can
had done his work well an indian
couldnt have solved his woodcraft

  a week sped swiftly there were nu-
merous callers who came to the cabin
but mccann refused to admit them
he would merely make sure that the
visitor was from the road-building
gang then mutter some excuse and
close the door then one afternoon a
portly middle-aged man of really im-
portant bearing paid a call

   im the contractor on this high-
way project said the visitor brusque-
ly  now mccann ive had enough
of your foolishness you either show
me where those mines are-every last
one of them-or til have the sheriff
pick you up

   then-how would you find the-
-er-things thats holdin up your
job grinned mccann

  the visitor fumed he threatened
dire things then he tried cajolery
the landowner was not susceptible

  finally the contractor calmed down
 what  you take to remove those
infernal machines he asked drawing
a thick roll of currency from his pock-
et  ill give you a hundred dollars

   not interested returned mc-
cann shortly  i put a price of a
thousand dollars on that strip of land
im the owner and im the one to put
the price on it

the visitor knew he was beaten
he ground his teeth savagely and
counted out the amount asked

   lucky for you im cleaning up a
chunk on this state job or id see you
in jail first he grumbled  heres

the

your money-now show me where
those mines are

  mccann took the money out to the
barn and concealed it then he led the
way down to the right of way and
along it to the point where the survey
line entered his property he walked
confidently to a small knoll turned
got his bearings by squinting between
the trees and marked the ground with
his heel

   heres one he said  dig

   get a shovel ordered the con-
tractor in a tone of authority to which
he was accustomed  when you old
scissor-bills get on my jobs you have
to work

   i agreed to show you wthere they
were-not to play badger mccann
drawled

  the contractor swore beneath his
breath and called to a laborer mccann
stood by with folded arms while the
mucker dug carefully down until he
had uncovered the tin planted there
mccann gestured to the contractor

   fetch it up he said impatiently

  the contractor glanced at him
sharply almost with suspicion then
knelt and picked up the tin mccann
took it from him and pried up the
cover with his jackknife then with a
wide grin he extended it at arms
length the contractor looked-and
dived into it with his hand

  instead of being packed with high-
test stumping powder the tin proved
to contain row beside row of short
lengths of peeled saplings

  mccann turned away shaking with
mirth

   say he called over his shoulder
 would you mind telling that neigh-
bor of mine on your way out that old
 tin can  is a versatile fellow hes
kind of skeptical on that point

concentration of hashish has the effect

evade or lie to questioners but domi-

the key word of the secret formula

  meanwhile warden has penetrated
dominettis paris headquarters and
obtained a copy of a hidden treaty be-
tween america and great britain
which if published would plunge
europe into turmoil he gives this
document to june with instructions to
deliver it secretly to the american
embassy

  later he is trapped by the treacher-

chapter xiii

an imprisoned envoy

oon approached

  since solomon and his un-
suspecting guide had departed
james warden had been sitting there
with no other companion than the
brutish taxi driver emile-a man who
talked not at all grunted when ad-
dressed and played interminable soli-
taire when he was not reading old
newspapers

  the shock of seeing john solomon
here had at first inspired hope in war-
den but this gradually died away
solomon had looked at him and de-

parted without a word or gesture-
probably no less astonished to see war-
den sitting tied to the chair than was
warden to see him

  so this was the scorpions sucker
tourist then instead of being out
of town solomon was hiding in some
little pension near by why and
why had he engaged the scorpion for
three hours of aimless driving each
morning

  ask me something easy james said
mr warden to himself does john
know that his scorpion taxi driver is
one of dominettis gang probably not
-but he knows it now as north says
theres no earthly use in trying to ac-
count for anything solomon does so
we might as well give it up and since
he saw me here he knows i made a
mistake and that probably settles my
hash so far as hes concerned he could
send a couple of his arabs to set me
free or tip off an agent of the surete
-but will he

  as time drew on it became sadly
evident that solomon had done and
would do nothing of the sort surely
the little cockney could not be actually
in hiding yet so it seemed

  noon arrived the outer room was
filled with men workmen and chauf-
feurs steps sounded and into the
room came a gentleman who swung
his stick indolently and eyed warden
with a fleeting smile it was the man
whom warden had encountered in the
lounge of the savoy in london emile
came to his feet

   good day m glazunoff he said
 here is your friend awaiting you

  glazunoff nodded  so i see m
warden this is scarcely a good place
for quiet conversation i suggest that
you give me your parole to come with
me peaceably and we shall then not
have to use force


argosy

  to the boulogne villa asked
warden

   exactly

  warden gave his assent he had as
a matter of fact no choice in the affair
to refuse would only be to make his
position worse it was not difficult for
him to understand june tullys fear
of this man before him-this pallid
creature of unemotional mien and rep-
tilian eyes the suggestion of in-
humanity about glazunoff was a clear
enough index to the mans cold cruelty

   loose him glazunoff said to
emile and paid the latter his wage
 then while he comes out to the car
with me keep close with your gun
shoot at his first move to get away

warden stood up and stretched
leisurely as the ropes fell off

       except for his sore head he
had suffered no ill effects in body

   parole as far as the villa then
he said cheerfully  i hope you have a
good luncheon awaiting me glazunoff
im hungry

  glazunoffs thin lips twisted

   men dont complain of our hos-
pitality he said with dry significance
 a cigarette

   thanks

  warden walked out of the place at
glazunoffs side behind him came
emile the big mercedes was waiting
in the street

  solomons startling arrival the mes-
sage to north-these things had given
warden more hope than he dared ad-
mit now in the open he sent sharp
glances around if some one were on
watch if they knew he was departing
and could trail him to the villa things
were not after all so desperate yet
his heart sank as he swept the vicinity
the two streets were empty not a
soul was in sight

  fool he told himself as he got
into the car at the bidding of glazunoff
 fool of course nothings in sight
would north be standing out on the
street corner if any ones on the
watch theyd be under cover

  none the less he knew he had made
a mistake-and he knew solomons
calm verdict on those who made mis-
takes from this moment he definitely
abandoned hope so far as any help
from the outside was concerned

  glazunoff sat beside him in silence
as the big car whirled out to the
auteuil gate and along the wide avenue
fringing the old moat emile had not
accompanied them the russian was
taking no chances-lie kept his hand in
his coat pocket and watched warden
narrowly the latter turned to him as
they came to the church and swung into
boulevard jean jaures

   with whom am i dealing in this
affair asked warden casually
 with you with halsey or with
dominetti

   dominetti is in london said
glazunoff  halsey is in bed-as you
probably know so it seems that you
are dealing with me

  good warden smiled as he met
the unwinking cold eyes  so halseys
in bed eh he never knew i had
switched the glasses on him eh he
shouldnt make such mistakes
glazunoff made no response

  two minutes later they turned into
the open gates of the dominetti villa
and the gates were swung shut as the
car halted the russian touched war-
dens arm

   let me warn you he said quietly
 any false motions would be most un-
fortunate for you m warden

   thank you said the former
diplomat  i shall make none i as-
sure you
john solomons biggest game



  he examined his surroundings with
keen interest as he alighted and fol-
lowed glazunoff into the house the
two men who had opened and closed
the gates came close behind him

  the gardens were rather large-
graveled paths a fountain fruit trees
and a vegetable plot in the rear the
blank wall of a large apartment house
closing in the opposite side the house
entrance was upon the gardens-a
small postern gate in the wall gave
access to the street the house itself
was large of three stories

as he passed into the entrance hall
 warden noted the inner doors
the holes in floor and ceiling
whence came steel rods into the doors
when closed-like many such houses
built after the communist troubles the
place was a regular fortress

  the hall went on to a large stairway
on the right was a small salon and a
dining room on the left were the
kitchens and the library-conservatory
into which glazunoff led the way at
a glance warden took in the room and
the glass flower-house beyond-the
fine old furniture and portraits the
large flat desk with its modern appur-
tenances and the massive black oak
wall cupboard with its shelves of
bottles and tobaccos

  glazunoff gestured to the two men
who had followed and they remained
at the door on guard russians war-
den thought going to the desk glazu-
noff seated himself lighted a cigarette
and glanced over some papers before
him

  make yourself at home mr war-
den he said with dry irony  it is a
pleasure to deal with such a man as
you here i assure you there need be
no fear that the drinks or cigarettes
are drugged be comfortable when i

have disposed of a few details we shall
take up your affair until then we
need not be unfriendly

   perhaps not even then said war-
den lightly this shaft at a venture
drew a sharp swift glance from the
russian

  no well we shall see take the
big chair there help yourself to drinks
or smokes and pardon me if i neglect
you for the moment ivan any report
from m halsey

  asleep excellency said one of
the men at the door

   the arab who was brought here
 has refused to talk excellency
the eyes of glazunoff flashed with
a singular light a slight color came
into his face denoting inward passion
then died into a colder more vivid pal-
lor as brown-skinned men turn black
under stress of emotion this man
turned a more terrible white he was
on the point of giving some order when
warden inexpressibly horrified by the
revelations of this inhuman face in-
tervened in his quiet cheerful fashion

  your pardon glazunoff-its no
use to torture the poor chap you know
hell not talk and indeed knows little
let me suggest an alternative on what
point do you wish to interrogate him
for an instant the piercing snaky
eyes bored into warden

  in regard to mr solomon

   very well lets dispense with use-
less cruelty ill tell you what i know
about this solomon if youll pass up
poor ahmed

  glazunoff nodded very well
taking up his desk telephone the
russian put in various calls referring
from time to time to the papers on his
desk nearly all the conversation was
in russian of which warden knew
not a word a brief talk in italian re-
vealed nothing of the slightest interest


argosy

then came a call for glazunoff the
russian listened frowningly and his
eyes went to warden to whom he put
a brief aside question

  do you know anything about a
man an american named red far-
row 

  warden nodded at the surete i
believe at least i handed him over to
two agents last night he carried a
large quantity of snow

  glazunoff flashed white teeth in a
smile spoke into the instrument then
laid it down not on its rack but on
the desk rising he went to the large
oak cupboard poured himself a drink
and took it back to the desk he sipped
the drink and eyed warden apprais-
ingly

 y dear chap you seem to have
yj made yourself most obnox-
ious glazunoff said pleasant-
ly  i for one do not quite under-
stand your connection with our busi-
ness why for example did you send
us word this morning that miss tully
was in safety why did you so violent-
ly take her from the savoy in london
if you are not an agent of the man
solomon who are you

   so far as miss tully is concerned
im my own agent said warden i
sent that message this morning so
youd know she had delivered her in-
formation and so you wouldnt issue
further orders to murder her

  glazunoff set his glass down sud-
denly very well conceived how-
ever your solicitude was needless we
have no further interest in her-unless
we except the personal interest of mr
halsey he is unfortunately a stub-
born gentleman where ladies are con-
cerned so i cannot answer for him
was it on her account that you went to
the abode of bad spirits last night

  warden puffed at his cigarette

   partly yes he responded after a
moment i understand that halsey
was dominettis chief agent here and
wanted to have a talk with him in-
stead i was attacked-therefore i at-
tacked in turn

  and fell into a pit eh

   so it seems warden helped him-
self to a dubonnet and resumed his
seat

  hm i understand said glazunoff
that you are not an agent of solo-
mon yet his men serve and aid you
and you use one of his cars suppose
you make your position a trifle clearer
my friend

   gladly i have been trying to find
miss tully solomon offered his help
that is all

  oh and this solomon-where is
he now

  the american shrugged  how
should i know he said he was going
out of the city as warden spoke it
occurred to him that solomon had
probably expressed the exact truth-
for auteuil was a suburb though in
reality a part of paris his house has
been closed up i cant reach him and
when hell return i cant say

  your interest in things then has
ended-now that miss tully is safe
 so far as shes concerned yes
let us see resumed glazunoff
you obtained entrance to a certain
room last night you read a letter half
written there this morning you took
certain action in regard to what you
had learned how do you justify this
mr warden it was not on miss
tullys behalf that you met leblanc
certainly

  not at all agreed warden cheer-
fully he still had a card a trump
card which might change the whole
course of the game leblanc was
john solomons biggest game



ordered to remove a certain gentleman
who was a friend and supporter of
prince sergei naturally i had to in-
tervene

   eh glazunoff looked astonished
 i fail to see the connection do you
know sergei

  warden laughed  of course how
could i be representing him without
knowing him

  you-representing him there
was no doubt about the russians sur-
prise  this is most amazing i must
say in what way do you represent
him

   in regard to certain events which
will transpire on the twenty-fifth-in
three days returned warden calmly
he felt in his pocket and produced his
letter of authorization  your men did
not take my papers fortunately here
is a letter-my credentials

boris glazunoff was stupe-
fied fora moment evidently he
took the letter read it over
scrutinized the signature then returned
it

  nobody dreamed this he said
slowly his gaze on warden sergei
has refused to discuss affairs with any
of us has refused to consider any
terms why then should he empower
you to do so

w

   ask him that not me said war-
den  perhaps he thought that his
affairs were in such bad shape i could
not do them any harm at all events
im authorized to discuss terms with
you or with dominetti-you under-

w	

stand i can deal only with the head of
affairs-and to report those terms to
sergei

  glazunoff nodded his eyes nar-
rowed reflective

  hm yes hed do it that way he
said a trace of exultation in his voice

 instead of coming here personally
hed send you-and save his face well
this somewhat alters my intentions
toward you mr warden but-ah
he glanced up suddenly startled
you spoke of the twenty-fifth-the
day after to-morrow to what do you
refer

  jimmy warden looked a trifle bored

   come come my dear glazunoff-
are we such children surely we can
lay our cards on the table and play an
open game both of us know exactly
what is to transpire here on the
twenty-fifth prince sergei knows it
john solomon knows it i must say
that your signor dominetti has hit
some ruthless blows-to the best of
my knowledge he has practically wiped
out solomons organization whatever
it was sergei doubtless knows this
also

   eh and is readylo talk terms is
he glazunoffs pallid features lighted
up  come hes showing sense just
how far mr warden are you ac-
quainted with the negotiations now
under way

  warden gave him a curious glance
why was the man taking this tone 

  do you prefer being a child glazu-
noff well then be a child i know all
about your negotiations and your plans
-from your agreement with baron
yamanaka to the treaty between italy
great britain and the ltnited states
which you expect to publish the ques-
tion is whether you-or rather signor
dominetti-think it worth while to
deal with prince sergei through me or
not

  somewhat to wardens amazement
the russian seemed nothing short of
paralyzed by these words warden
himself was playing the game no more
he had no instructions from solomon
and he had no actual right whatever to


argosy

conduct himself as an emissary of
prince sergei-except in so far as it
might save his life in effect he was
acting absolutely in the dark

and now suddenly occurred a
 startling thing there was no
third party to the conversation
but abruptly a third voice spoke in
the room-a voice which warden
recognized at once

   am i to understand mr warden
that sergei is ready to treat with us 
warden started then catching the
peculiar half smile on the face of
glazunoff he repressed his astonish-
ment

   i do not talk with persons i cannot
see he returned coldly

   you are in no- position to dictate
came the response in the voice of
dominetti  i am speaking from lon-
don if it is wcyth while i shall come
over and see you personally is sergei
ready to treat with us

  naturally since i am authorized
to discuss the situation with you

   and where did you learn of the
treaty you just mentioned

  warden smiled to himself pie had
the whip-hand there

   must i repeat that i prefer to see
with whom i speak

   very well boris hold this man
until i arrive to talk with him exert
every effort to locate solomon inform
me when you succeed matsura is
coming over to-night with certain in-
structions  give him every cooperation
that is all

   very good said glazunoff and
put the telephone on its rack he
looked at warden and waved his hand

   i understand that our friend solo-
mon works miracles-well we make
use of science he observed placidly
 hidden microphones a connection

with the london office and it is very
simple dominetti hears all that trans-
pires in this room when necessary
warden wondered what boris would
say did he actually know what sort of
miracles john solomon worked-but
he did not voice his thoughts

   very well then and what about
luncheon  he asked glazunoff
laughed a little and rose

  excellent you consent to be our
guest then

   naturally my business lies with
dominetti

   understood and when sergei
hears about his old friend and backer
being killed being caught as a forger
of notes-what the devil why the
prefecture will probably ask sergei to
leave the country eh  hell be only too
anxious to come to terms with us yes
yes-very lucky thing you walked into
that trap my friend so come ill take
you to your room and well lunch in
half an hour

chapter xiv

the yellow streak

those who were in paris last
summer will recall the enormous
tension which prevailed in polit-
ical circles at the time and the tre-
mendous tide of anti-italian feeling
that swept over france

  the rise of the fascist italy had for
some years been regarded askance for
now italy threatened the dominance of
france in european affairs but with
the various frontier incidents which
had recently taken place the supposed
activity of fascist plotters in paris it-
self swrept the french people into a
frenzy

  a certain portion of the french
press had for long been violently anti-
john solomons biggest game



foreign-openlydistrusting the united
states sneering at american tourists
demanding that russian refugees leave
france and crying for the expulsion
of italian and other foreign workmen
the near-crisis provoked in the sum-
mer of  by the low ebb of tourist
money in consequence of the taxes
and petty annoyances visited upon
tourists had frightened all france into
treating her visitors with more cour-
tesy but the rapid succession of out-
rages made her forget all more prac-
tical matters

  then came the discovery of the
english scientist pearson-the body
found one morning in the bois a
fascist dagger pinning to its ribs the
flaming words  death to all traitors
and enemies of fascism this
aroused not only france but england
downing street and the quai dorsay
sat upon the wires with stern messages
in vain did rome deny all knowledge
of the matter

  the laboratory where pearson had

                           j

been working was destroyed by an ex-
plosion and fire-and later when the
body of pearsons assistant was recov-
ered bullets were found in it and a
pistol bearing the fascist emblem was
found in the ruins the gaulois and
the quotidien burst out next day with
heated denunciations of mussolini and
fascism and half the french press
followed suit

  all sorts of rumors ran riot-the
king of italy had fortified the
quirinal the crown prince had been
assassinated mussolini was concen-
trating an army  the french border
and so forth-all of them unfounded
but highly exciting to the french
mind

  it was amid and because of these
circumstances that the great french-
man poincare issued what was un-

doubtedly the noblest document of
modern history-his now famous
appeal which rang across the world
within a fewr hours who does not re-
member those opening sentences of
steel those clanging words of sheet
inspiration

    fellow citizcns france does not
  fall to the poniards of conspirators the
  sword of our glorious republic is not
  unsheathed against vile rumor twelve
  years ago italy was fighting beside us
  let us remember the brotherhood of
  patriotism  a passionate love of country
  is the heritage of the ages because a
  child makes mistakes shall the entire
  family be punished no let us be pas-
  sionate for the right for justice for
  tolerance-not for hatred and war-
  fare and blind savagery

  this remarkable document fol-
lowed as it was by the astonishing
 open letter  of another leader
briand held france stupefied swaying
in the balance irresolute and in the
days of hesitation of doubt of con-
flicting emotion the unseen drama that
was to determine the fate of half eu-
rope was being played to its finish in
the walled villa of boulogne and in the
rain-wet streets of paris

in the affairs of men the accidental
ever plays a large often a crucial
role and in this drama jimmy
warden was to take an ever-increasing
part to the surprise not only of others
but of himself as well

  he found his status between that of
prisoner and of guest the upper por-
tion of the house once composed of
very large and luxurious bedrooms
had been cut up into a number of
smaller but very comfortable rooms
while his window which overlooked
the garden was not barred his door
was locked when he was in the room


argosy

if the american wished to walk in the
garden it was free to him at all times
he took his meals with glazunoff
catching no sight of halsey until the
following day at luncheon

  during this time warden kept his
eyes open but learned little that was
new  a good many men were in or
about the house-two large placid
russians who served glazunoff the
others apparently all italian then
there was the smiling spectacled little
jap matsura who puzzled warden
walking in the garden after dinner
smoking the american saw matsura
arrive and as he came back into the
house glazunoff called him into the
library and introduced him to the
oriental

   mr matsura this is mr warden
said boris in flawless english  mr
warden is acting for prince sergei
as you may be aware and until re-
cently has been in the united states
diplomatic corps matsura is a sci-
entist warden-a real one

  the jap bowed politely  of that
he said  mr glazunoff should be an
excellent judge i am most happy to
meet you mr warden

  to tell the truth jimmy warden
was a trifle staggered by this situation
he did not see matsura again at once
but here in the house of the enemy in
the midst of a merciless life-and-death
game-to experience such treatment
such formality it left him rather up
in the air but none the less very much
on his guard

  his meeting with halsey however
quite restored him to balance

  it was noon of the next day when
they met warden was walking in the
garden waiting for the mess-call when
he descried the tall figure of halsey
approaching and recognized the aristo-
cratic handsome features they were a

trifle blurred now as warden noted
with some satisfaction-the effect of
the drug had not entirely worn off
undoubtedly halseys normally acute
brain was a trifle blurred also although
he came to a halt in palpable recogni-
tion

   ah - good morning he said
pleasantly  youre warden eh ive
heard a lot about you

  yes warden-could not feign
any liking for the man and did not
try  ive heard a good deal about
you too-from miss tully and oth-
ers

  oh the dark eyes hardened
 yes youre the chap who fancies her
arent you id forgotten that

there was momentary silence
ominous silence matsura ap-
peared doubtless to announce
that luncheon was ready obviously
work had gone well with him that
morning he was humming a queer
japanese air as he came and was look-
ing very happy-this quiet spectacled
little brown man who soon would be
lying there among the flowers

  glazunoff appeared on the half-
round steps of the entrance

   come along gentlemen he
called

  still halsey stood looking at war-
den then lifted one hand slightly and
warden saw that the fingers of this
hand were shaking suddenly he
realized that halsey was in the grip
of a consuming although not entirely
obvious passion a spasm of sheer
fury contracted the mans face for an
instant

  ah he said as though stifled
 you-you-

  his unspoken words failed glazu-
noff seeing something amiss was com-
ing toward them
john solomons biggest game



  matsura had halted staring at the
two men

   be careful you cheap crook said
warden quietly  shes where youll
not lay your filthy hands on her
again 

  sharp and swift halseys hand
swooped a pistol appeared warden
poised flung himself forward before
the irresolute hand could press trigger
he gripped halseys wrist with one
hand while the other swung in a blow
to the stomach

  the two men went down in a lash-
ing heap unleashed halseys fury
was that of a wild animal what hap-
pened in this brief moment warden
could not tell the pistol went off in a
smashing stunning report close to his
head and in blind anger wardens fist
drove in again and again while he
gripped the pistol-wrist

  then suddenly men were upon
them tearing them apart glazunoff
was there screaming harsh inarticu-
late oaths and orders warden found
himself scrambling to his feet two
men hanging to him he stood quietly
mastering his anger staring at the in-
credible scene before him

  glazunoff in frantic rage was
striking halsey whose pistol had been
torn away by one of the russian serv-
ants and at one side matsura lay
upon his back smiling at the sky his
right arm encircling a bunch of flow-
ers as though pressing them to his dead
breast that one wild bullet had gone
through his brain stilling its cleverness
forever

  after an instant glazunoff had him-
self in hand stepped back halsey was
dragged away by two of the men
warden was released and glazunoff
after one glance at the body of mat-
sura turned to him the livid features
the reptilian eyes were tinged with

madness yet the mans voice was
steady and cool

   i saw what happened said
glazunoff  not vour fault warden
oh devil take all such fools domi-
netti will be furious about this but
it cant be helped now ill have to take
on matsuras work damn it come
along to luncheon

so they went into the dining room
the two of them and sat at table
in strained and terrible silence un-
til a beaker of fiery vodka had unloosed
the tongue of glazunoff and restored
him to himself then cold and dead-
ly he accompanied warden to his room
and went on down the corridor to an-
other door his voice came in icy re-
strained anger answered by the sulky
tones of halsev

  so the matter ended when an hour
later warden encountered halsey in
the corridor the confidence man was
white and shaken -but passed him
without a look warden smiled grimly
to himself but he did not smile when
returning to his room he found a sum-
mons to join glazunoff in the large
salon below

  warden entered the room and found
glazunoff at the desk the russian
beckoned and pointed to the telephone
which was off the rack at the same
time he took down the extra extension
receiver and held it to his ear his gaze
intent upon warden

  hello this is warden-ah
prince sergei

  yes sergei romanoff came the
voice in french  i wish to inform
you monsieur warden that there is
no longer any question of my continu-
ing the course of action decided upon
at our meeting with m solomon i
wish that you would represent me and
reach some agreement with grand


argosy

duke basil and with dominetti along
this line

   ask if hell come here murmured
glazunoff

   perhaps you will see dominetti
yourself said warden who was
stunned by this intelligence

  no no said sergei sharply u i
shall leave matters in your hands you
understand the situation i have every
confidence in you i cannot reach m
solomon but i am glad to empower
you to act for me at the meeting which
takes place to-morrow

  wait exclaimed warden you
mean that you withdraw entirely from
your agreement with solomon

   yes came the astonishing re-
sponse in a tone of decision  for rea-
sons which i cannot go into now i
must withdraw that is to say if you
can reach terms which seem fitting and
proper to you that is all

  warden hung up the instrument
sank into a chair and bit the end off a
cigar while glazunoff watched him
with a glint of triumph in the snaky
eyes

  sergei out of it abandoning his
agreement refusing to go on with the
plan outlined by solomon-the plan
which had every chance of making him
master of russia and a great figure in
history why 

  then warden started how did it
happen that sergei had telephoned
him here at this house only one an-
swer was possible north had received
the message solomon had seen him
there in the chauffeurs rendezvous
sergei had telephoned to make certain
for them that warden was here a
ruse - perhaps perhaps yet here
were definite instructions positive or-
ders

   you dont understand it eh said
glazunoff laughing lightly

  warden regarded him frowningly
diplomacy here careful words cau-
tion was needed now if ever

   no i dont he replied with an
affectation of bluntness  i was sup-
posed to make some arrangement with
dominetti and basil if possible by
which sergei would throw all his in-
fluence behind basil and share in the
successful outcome but now hes
withdrawn entirely why why give
up before the fight

glazunoff laughed again

subtly and deeply amused it
     seemed

   well he responded lightly  for
one thing basil doesnt care to share
his throne with sergei for another
he doesnt need sergeis influence in
fact sergei must be out of the way
entirely-while he and basil both live
there can be no agreement perhaps
you can convince dominetti that it
would be better to throw basil over-
board and get rid of him and adopt
sergei

   eh warden flashed the russian
a keen glance  would that be possi-
ble

  glazunoff shrugged

  ask dominetti-i cant say you
know how much sergei would give up
how much he would promise i dont
if he holds to his childish notions
about russia for the russians
what use in talking but i can tell
you why hes withdrawn hes a cow-
ard hes learned about ivan vassil-
ovitch being shot about the forged
notes being found one of the after-
noon papers is carrying a big story
about the russian plot to swamp the
market with forged bank of france
notes and is charging that sergei
romanoff is behind it the story will
be suppressed provided sergei with-

                       a
john solomons biggest game



draws from all further political action
sergei got this news and at once tele-
phoned you understand hes out of
it entirely

  jimmy warden scowled he per-
ceived now that he had known only a
part of the plot-that it went farther
had more ingenuity behind it than he
had supposed no it was no ruse
solomon had hidden himself sergei
was in a panic and had quit

   damn it said warden angrily
  glazunoff chuckled again

   sorry he said ironically u ill
give you a tip warden i fancy domi-
netti would be glad to be able to pre-
sent the meeting to-morrow with a
signed statement on the part of sergei -
-a statement which could be made
public - agreeing to renounce any
rights to the throne and to hold aloof
from all political action in future
warden started  sergei would
never sign such an agreement

   well you heard what he just said
didnt you and consider your own
position im giving you something to
work on-a real tip my friend partly
for your sake partly for my own let
us be frank you are in no position to
dictate to us make yourself useful
and it will mean a lot to you on my
own behalf-

  glazunoff paused blew a thin cloud
of smoke and gestured toward the
garden

   i do not care to face dominetti
when he is angry he said simply

 the death of this matsura who was
in charge of certain scientific work
will infuriate him i should like to bal-
ance that with unexpected good news
this little affair with sergei and ivan
vassilovitch happens to be one of my
own pet schemes it has succeeded if
sergei will sign such an agreement as
i have outlined and it can be laid be-

   	a

fore the meeting to-morrow-well
signor dominetti will be pleased he
will arrive in another hour or so too
 i see murmured warden

  out of the mental confusion which
had seized upon him the american be-
gan to coordinate his thoughts despair-
ing as they were he knew well enough
that glazunoff was trying to use him
as a tool yet he saw no better way out
of the impasse and prince sergei had
given definite orders-had broken his
agreement with solomon was ready
to abandon everything the streak of
weakness in the man had come to the
top

   all right said warden tell
you what you do glazunoff write out
what you want sergei to sign give the
paper to me if i reach some agreement
in the matter with dominetti i can
take it to sergei and get his signa-
ture

  glazunoff nodded

   youll not be allowed to leave here
however he said  until things are
settled still you can always use the
telephone-and we can send him the
paper lres a good plan ill do it

  so it was agreed

chapter xv

dominetti arrives

jimmy warden felt an inde-
scribable reluctance to meet domi-
netti in any battle of wits or to go
ahead with the course upon which he
had entered glazunoff sent him a
typed sheet in french then warden
saw him depart in the mercedes-
probably to meet dominetti but for
a long while warden sat reading over
those words and realizing what they
meant

  the paper was a complete abdication


argosy

under most solemn oath by sergei-
an abdication of his possible rights to
the throne of all the russias further-
more not only was it a pledge to ab-
stain from any political action but it
urged his adherents to give allegiance
to grand duke basil as head of the
family

  no ruse was possible here if sergei
signed this paper it meant that glazu-
noffs clever scheme had succeeded-
he would have completely abandoned
solomons plan and his agreement with
rome

   well see thought warden fold-
ing and pocketing the sheet of paper
if he signs this if he throws up a
great project a daring venture be-
cause of a momentary panic-then let
him rot it isnt signed yet anyhow
the whole thing may be framed up
by solomon to gain time well see

  boris glazunoff meanwhile was
speeding on his way along the outer
circle of boulevards for the porte de
la villette and le bourget

  the big mercedes hummed along
smoothly at a high rate of speed it
might have been mere coincidence that
an enclosed sunbeam whose gb li-
cense showed that it belonged across
the channel and whose curtains were
drawn followed the same identical
course but some little distance in the
rear

  reaching the porte glazunoffs
chauffeur alighted he did not make
the usual pretense of inspecting his
gasoline tank but darted into the little
cubby occupied by the douanerie and
came out again tucking his reentry
ticket into his cap the sunbeam was
drawn up directly behind the merce-
des and its chauffeur a yellow man-
possibly chinese-was at the moment
going in for his ticket

  during the momentary absence of

glazunoffs chauffeur however some-
thing had happened

  two men had alighted from the
sunbeam one of them jerked open the
left-hand door of the mercedes while
the other precipitated himself inside
and shoved a pistol against the body of
the unsuspecting glazunoff the first
man slammed the door and mounted
into the front seat-the car being nat-
urally right-hand drive

  thus when the chauffeur came back
to his place he looked up astonished
to see a yellow man sitting there and
unobtrusively holding a pistol to cover
him

  quickly said the chinese in
french get up drive

  helpless the chauffeur obeyed the
order once in his seat a glance into
his rear-view mirror showed him a sec-
ond man seated beside glazunoff the
mercedes pulled out and went on along
the market-street of la villette

inside the car dr erh lim lee
smiled a little as he held his weapon
against glazunoffs body

   dont take your hands from your
lap please the chinese diplomat
said in his low-voiced way

  the russian looked at lee with a
sort of contempt

  what you think that you can
get away with a thing like this

   i seem to be doing it and dr lee
smiled grimly  i warned you my
friend now i want that letter back
 fool glazunoff said disdainfully
 do you think i keep it in my pocket 
it went long ago to other people was
translated will be given to the press
to-morrow night

  lee rotund and sparkling-eyed
seemed for a moment aghast

   impossible he exclaimed

   nothing is impossible said glaz-
john solomons biggest game



unoff with a slightly bored air  as
you yourself a man of science should
know that letter will be of great in-
terest to french readers

  lee broke into a sudden laugh soft
and exultant

   ah liar he retorted  you dont
know what was in the letter then you
havent had it translated you arent
aware that it contained the contribu-
tion of chinese laboratories to the ul-
tra-sonic work of solomons chemist
pearson-which you certainly would
never make public

  glazunoff turned livid at this mock-
ery lee had pierced his bluff

  well he snapped end this
foolery

   i shall said lee  the letter is
lost you read my papers i can do
nothing but i can save my face-have
you forgotten that we of the older
world believe in saving face i can
kill you and-

  the mercedes over the viaduct was
purring out along the le bourget road
fields on either side the gray gleam
of the hangars out on the left and
ahead the sunbeam followed at a
little distance abruptly with a twist
of his wrist the chauffeur spun the
steering wheel then applied the brakes

  the big car went into the ditch came
to an abrupt halt there

  lee was flung from the seat and
glazunoff fell on top of him striking
on the front seat the chinese there
was hurled against the windshield as
he struck the chauffeur gripped his pis-
tol tore it way struck him across the
head he fell limply

  the sunbeam came up alongside
and the russian chauffeur covered its
driver with the pistol after an instant
the left side door of the mercedes
opened glazunoff stepped out cool
and rather disdainful the road was

empty the two cars were alone the
insistent hum of a machine came from
overhead

  glazunoff gave his chauffeur quiet
swift directions while the driver of
the sunbeam helpless made no pro-
test the russian knew that dr lee
was altogether too big a man to be se-
questered without a large and serious
outcry being raised something which
was by  means to be desired just at
this moment on the other hand glaz-
unoff wanted and knew that his mas-
ter wanted certain information

  the chauffeur dragged out lees un-
conscious tody bleeding from the
mouth and hurriedly loaded it into the
sunbeam then at a command from
glazunoff the sunbeams driver
turned his car and departed

  the chinese whom the chauffeur
had knocked out was now put into the
tonneau of the mercedes and bound se-
curely his mouth wrapped with car-
cleaning cloths boris glazunoff
glanced at his watch and nodded with
a satisfied air

  good work very good work he
told the chauffeur approvingly  go
on to the airdrome and take your time
-were still ahead of the london
plane

the unfortunate yellow man in the
rear of the car was the same who
had come with dr lee to the
abode of bad spirits-beyond doubt
his chief aide glazunoff went through
his pockets and located some papers
and letters and had excellent cause for
feeling that he had accomplished a very
good days work the death of mat-
sura was doubly compensated for he
reflected

  from the window of his room
which overlooked the garden jimmy
warden beheld the return of the mer-


argosy

cedes dominetti and glazunoff alight-
ed then a smaller bound figure was
carried out of the car and brought in-
to the house

  the afternoon was not yet over and
warden conjectured that dominettis
first thought would be to interrogate
him indeed five minutes later one of
the russian servants brought a request
that he come to the salon at once

  there he found halsey glazunoff
and dominetti himself who occupied
the seat at the desk and the bound but
no longer gagged figure of lees aide-
a rather thin little man imperturbable
whose sloe eyes looked out upon the
room blankly enough beside the chair
in which the yellow man sat stood the
two large russian servants

  as warden entered dominetti stood
up and extended his hand smilingly

  ah mr warden our last meet-
ing was one thing-this is another i
am glad to see you here and doubly
glad because of your errand take a
chair make yourself comfortable-
and i warn you do not interfere this
man who is an assassin must be ques-
tioned-and let me remind you that i

                                                                                         

shall not tolerate any intervention

  cold inhuman his glittering gray
eyes alive with savage emotion do mi-
nettis words and air belied his surface
appearance of an impeccable gentle-
man the man fairly radiated energy
and dominating vigor

  again as in london warden felt
that miserable sensation of futility of
helplessness as he sank into a chair

  too he had the feeling that some-
thing terrible was about to happen
something from which at all costs he
must hold himself aloof-and in this
he was right

  dominetti resumed his seat and fas-
tened his gaze on the unfortunate saf-
fron man

   from the papers found in your
pockets he said his voice metallic and
sharp-edged  you are wu hong sze
is this correct

   yes the prisoner responded in
english

   i have heard of you went on
dominetti  you are a graduate of
chicago  when dr lee went into pol-
itics you refused a professorship of
physics at the university of tokyo in
order to take up lees scientific work
in acoustics and geophysics your dis-
coveries in the way of solutions have
been followed by glazunoff here for
some time

  he glanced at the russian who nod-
ded  yes the flocculation of solu-
tions-his apparatus is now in use by
the american department of agricul-
ture i understand

   you flatter me said wu irony
in his voice

   not at all replied dominetti and
took up a paper from the desk  here
is a letter in chinese which dr lee
was bringing to mr solomon from
certain of your associates in nankin
will you kindly translate it for us

   certainly not returned wu
hong calmly

dominetti laid aside the letter
very well it has already
been translated and deals with
the destruction of protoplasm and
blood corpuscles by means of ultra-
sonic waves he said  now i desire
certain information from you i wish
to know where dr lee is living in
paris and when he is going on to the
league conference at geneva these
two things no more then you shall
go free

   i have nothing to say wu hong
answered

  dominetti leaned back made a sign
john solomons biggest game



to the two russians they leaned over
and seized the arms of the chinaman
loosing them from the bonds

  next instant a scream broke from
the unfortunate man as his arms were
twisted around the high back of his
chair warden half started up then
sank back white-faced as a pistol in
halseys hand covered him

  another scream burst from the tor-
tured lips of wu hong-one of his
arms fell dangling horribly

   these two things no more said
dominetti he might have been carved
of stone as he sat there looking into
the distended eyes of the yellow man

   nothing gasped wu hong

  the word trailed away in a gasp and
a low moan as his other arm fell
broken his saffron features darkened
his teeth were clenched on his upper
lip and the blood came from it but
his staring eyes fastened upon domi-
netti were resolute unflinching

   your knives said the italian

  warden closed his eyes as the rus-
sians produced long blades he sat
there quivering at each instant dread-
ing to hear another of those terrible
cries of mans agony-but he caught
only a stifled gasp a groan he dared
not look to see what was happening

   bah take him away came the
voice of dominetti

  sick and faint warden looked up
as a broken crimson-smeared thing
was borne out of the room halsey
looked rather white and brought a
bottle of whisky from the massive cup-
board with glasses glazunoff poured
drinks and smiling brought a glass to
warden

   here you are-look as though you
needed it old chap he observed

  warden gulped down the whisky
thankfully and tried to pull himself
together dominetti was swinging

around his chair to face warden had
the man really hoped to extort his in-
formation from wu hong-or was
the scene of horror merely a prelude
deliberately designed to break down
the american

   come come you must not take
these things so much to heart said
dominetti  now mr warden let
us put our cards on the table here
take a cigarette and make yourself
comfortable

  warden accepted the cigarette and
lighted it at the match dominetti held

   you do not by chance asked the
italian smoothly  know anything
about this dr lee

   no returned warden  i know
nothing about him

  dominetti nodded  probably not
before proceeding to your actual busi-
ness-yesterday you mentioned a cer-
tain treaty may i inquire just how
you learned of this treaty 

warden saw glazunoff watch-
ing him with a half-smile-so
then they knew the treaty
had disappeared knew he must have
taken it here the truth the desperate
truth must serve him and nothing else

   i found it in a room of which you
know said warden calmly  it
seemed to be the only thing worth tak-
ing-so i took it

  yes dominetti smiled and his
voice was very soft  and where is
the document now

   at the american embassy i pre-
sume said warden  i sent it there
by messenger

  there was an instant of startled si-
lence halsey appeared to know noth-
ing about the treaty his manner was
somewhat puzzled curious

  glazunoff at wardens words
caught his breath and sent a half-


argosy

startled glance at dominetti as though
in fear but the italians singular gray
eyes did not swerve from warden and
displayed no hint of emotion

   you are a more dangerous antag-
onist than i had believed possible mr
warden he said well as to the
treaty let it pass now for your own
status are you still an antagonist
are you working for solomon

   no said warden  my only in-
terest in this affair has been to get miss
tully out of the hands of that dog
halsey it was accomplished having
been dragged into the business howr-
ever i undertook to act as representa-
tive for prince sergei

   and it interested you eh domi-
netti laughed lightly you are no
doubt aware of the agreement between
sergei and rome eh you know a
great deal

   certainly warden wras cool
enough now perfectly master of him-
self speaking without hesitation yet
weighing every word before it left his
lips  i was informed of all the de-
tails of your own scheme to back grand
duke basil and im aware of the meet-
ing to-morrow

   proving that voit are a man to be

      o	

trusted said dominetti  good if
others trust you i can trust you also-
particularly as you are in my hands
you came to issue some ultimatum on
the part of sergei no doubt but things
have changed you are now aware
that prince sergei no longer desires
power and glory-all he desires is to
save his own precious skin eh

   yes said warden bitterly

  he knew what this defection would
mean to solomon whose dream had
been a glorious one and practical
enough to boot-that swift march of
fifty thousand men into the heart of
old russia

   yes blast him the american
went on  the fool had onlv to use

                                                                           

what was given him carry out the
plans made for him-and now his yel-
low streak has smashed everything he
deserves all he gets ive no sympathy
for him however ill have to act for
him

  dominetti watched him half-smil-
ing as he spoke the sincerity of
warden was clear enough to all three
other men

   sympathy no said the italian
slowly  his weakness has astonished
even me i must confess i broke down
solomons organization in order that
we might strike at sergei-but we need
not have uncovered him perhaps so
carefully he was not worth the ef-
fort eh well fear not all his life
the man will be haunted by the great
chances he flung away but i do not
think he will live so verv long

               m	o

  glazunoff and halsey exchanged
a glance but warden did not observe
it he was getting out the typed docu-
ment that glazunoff had prepared for
him and now he laid it before domi-
netti

     lance over this he said  i
v i dont know just what precisely
sergei wants in the way of
terms-i presume in regard to finances
and other things since his own brother
is paying you a thousand francs a
month hush money

   eh  eh  at this calm thrust
dominetti started and his eyes wid-
ened on warden  you american
devil-who told you that sergei him-
self did not know it

i learned it and w a r d e n
shrugged carelessly  what matter 
he could perceive at once that this
trifle had raised him appreciably in the
estimation of the enemy irony if
john solomons biggest game



only sergei romanoff had not that
fatal yellow streak what might yet
have been accomplished

  dominetti returned the paper beam-
ing

   excellent he stated in his cold
manner  i want that paper signed
before witnesses to-night suppose you
telephone sergei now read it to him
ask for his consent then we can send
it over at once to his hotel the hotel
de choiseul is it not you can tell him
that in return for his signature i will
obtain a signed document indorsed by
grand duke basil prince seminoff
and baron tondern the chief leaders
of basils party agreeing to the fol-
lowing conditions 

   sergei is to be retained in his titles
and estates upon the recovery of rus-
sia as basil is childless sergei is to
be nominated heir to the throne until
russia is recovered sergei is to be
given a yearly grantof fifty thousand
pounds for life to be paid from the
funds of the late dowager empress
satisfactory

  satisfactory indeed-it was mad-
ness even glazunoff stared at his
chief startled by such terms warden
met the cold eyes which gave no hint
of what was in the mind of dominetti

   you will give a guarantee that can-
not be broken but why asked war-
den cautiously  you offer a large
price for a signature-

   which i need said dominetti
 boris get sergei on the telephone
that there was some trick to it
warden was convinced  yet if such a
document were given sergei and were
made public-

   wait a minute said warden
calmly  it is understood that sergei
will receive this abdication at once for
his signature but he will not return it
signed until i telephone him that the
other document is in my possession
some time to-morrow-

  dominetti laughed  you suspect
me well it shall be as you say no
my friend-our cards are in sight
warden knew better that grand
duke basil should recognize sergei as
his heir was nothing short of absurd
the two men were bitter enemies that
sergei should be given an annuity of
fifty thousand pounds was amazing
dominetti must want that abdication
very badly or else had some trick up
his sleeve

   and perhaps hes doubtful of
sergeis good faith thought warden
 well well soon know about it now
-if sergei is playing some game hell
refuse to sign that paper if hes real-
ly abandoned solomon and thrown up
the whole thing like a yellow cur then
hell be glad enough of the terms
two minutes later warden took up
the telephone and found sergei on the

                      wire

to be concluded next week
the partners stared aghast at the
meaning of her words

expiation

fate had never given too generous a deal to john hepplewhite
and that day in the bank the cards seemed
hopelessly stacked against him

by frederick niven

one of john hepplewhite s earli-
est impressions had been the
sight of his mother bent over
the sewing in her lap and weeping
silently wordlessly into her cupped
hands and another was of hiding-
under the table from his father

  his fathers erratic actions in the
yard incomprehensible to the boy-
then-had sent him scuttling indoors
for a hiding place the father followed
him whooping incoherencies and
began to leap like a jumping-jack in
the middle of the room his nerve con-
trol shattered by the craving for drink
after a protracted bout that had taken
his every cent

  johns boyhood was not all like that
there had been his enjoyment of

music even casual notes drifting in
through open windows the neighbors
were kind too because of his mother
and the policeman on their beat was a
big burly irish angel in the boys eyes

   now see here sonny he said
once  i know how it is your mother
was gently raised and shes fond of
your paw she dont want publicity
over all this listen any time your
father goes off it that way you step
out smartly and tell me ill come into
the house and protect you but i want
you to understand you mustnt tell
nobody we aint supposed to go into
any house unless to make an arrest
its agin orders so mind you
mustnt tell folks if i slip in that way
just to scare your dad get me
expiation



   the boy nodded sadly it was a
 heart-breaking thing to have to listen
 to a policeman in all kindness talking
 of putting a scare into his dad and
 even at eleven years of age he could
 realize it so often the policeman
 stood behind the kitchen door to be
 ready if jack hepplewhites father in-
 stead of chasing-or fleeing from-
  things invisible to others round the
 table should make an assault on wife
 or son

   once when the ravings were over
 the officer whispered well til get
 along youre all right now then
 took from a pocket a mouth-organ and
 presented it to the kid yes people
 were kind

hepplewhite senior must
have been endowed with a re-
markable constitution for he
assuredly played ducks and drakes with
it but when the boy was about
twelve his father disappeared went out
of their lives no one knew where he
had gone but some thought perhaps
back to central america

   the boy john leaving school went
 into a bank as junior clerk he used
 to try to cheer his mother

    never mind mother dont worry
 he would say  im working now
 youll have a lovely home yet

   in a vague boyish way jack came
 to realize that his mother loved his
 father still for the brilliant but weak
 man he had been-long ago in the
 days before jack could remember she
 would smile at her son through the
 tears when he surprised her weeping
 would dry her eyes and force the
 ghost of a laugh for his sake

   she never told him that her husband
 had absconded with a wad of bills
 from the accounting firm that in pity
 for her had kept him in its employ

despite his periodical  bats the
employers in a last stroke of kindness
tried to keep the knowledge of that
embezzlement from her but somehow
it leaked out hence she sewed and
sewed on into the small hours-always
sewing to gather together somehow
the amount which hepplewhite had
taken and to repay it

  but the making of the sum was slow
at last she went with but a portion of
it to his former employers she was
ushered into the room where at a big
desk-table were the two partners of
the accounting firm she was con-
strained before them

   ive come she said  to make a
part payment of the money that-well
you know what i mean ive been
working to gather it together but it is
so slow perhaps-if-installments-
she stammered

  her intention made them stare at
her then thet looked uncomfort-
ably across their table each reading
the eyes of the other and the elder
spoke

   my dear lady you will just dis-
miss that thought from your mind it
is intolerable to me-to us

  his partner nodded blunt with the
embarrassment of a normal man who
has to do a good thing publicly

   cant be done your moneys no
good here now no more please
forget it

  she returned home with a choked
feeling of the kindness in men the
boy never heard anything of all that
mrs hepplewhite realized that for one
of his years there had been enough of
shadow over him but he was glad to
note she tired her eves less over that

                                             

sewing

  the years passed with no word of
hepplewhite the boy grew into a
young man the mouth-organ had been


argosy

replaced by a violin and the shadows
of his early years were almost for-
gotten in the earnest plans for his
business future one day the manager
at the bank called him into his private
room to have a talk with the visiting
inspector

   ive just been hearing about you
the inspector said with a swift shrewd
glance your manager gives you a
good name its time you got pro-
motion we are creating new branches
in territory that is being opened up in
the west id like you to go to
chelacko as accountant it will be not
only a step up but a step toward
another step it will be an entirely
different sort of banking there-
chiefly mining and lumbering

chelacko was not by any means
as wild and woolly as jack had
expected there were stores with
the same sort of goods as at home
behind their plate-glass windows even
if the great mountains did look down
ragged-edged with forests on all sides
even if going home under the arc
lamps from a concert one could hear
on autumn nights coyotes far beyond
the town yelping of the weathers
change he found that these new
little bustling western towns dropped
in the midst of wilderness though they
were offered all up-to-date comforts
when he was finally settled his mother
he decided could be happy in this land
where one could  make friends with-
out half trying she could soon have
the comforts her husbands weakness
had stolen from her

  he put up his card on the counter

john hepplewhite
accountant

  there all could see it from the local
lumber king their star client to the

dilapidated old man who took the place
of scrub-lady the manager had his own
home on the hill but the employees-
accountant teller ledger-keeper junior
clerk-all slept in rooms above the
bank

  the little bank community looked
upon jack as a distinct acquisition
with his violin seeing its case among
his belongings they asked him to pro-
duce it and let them hear they were
not prepared for what he so whole-
heartedly gave them-for whatever
he did he did with all his power he
could truly play prospectors in town
for a night and lumberjacks passing
by would halt a little while in the street
outside and even sit on the edge of the
sidewalk to listen even the shabby
old wreck who cleaned out the office
began to take a long time to get
through with his sweeping and dust-
ing hoping to hear the music and
when he had that luck it was not till
john stopped playing that his quaver-
ing voice would come from below
 im through sir

   oh all right the new accountant
would say tolerantly and go down to
see him out and the door again closed

  there were few people in chelacko
who cared to do any work with a mop
and a pail the bank was glad to get
any one and a poor specimen of hu-
manity it had got truly a doddering
fellow with trembling hands and
rheumy eyes he used to come into
the bank just at the closing hour of
four each day and then begin empty-
ing the waste-paper baskets the staff
would put away ledgers close the safe
pass upstairs to wash and rest before
going along to the restaurant at seven
or so for supper

  this wilted scrub-man commonly
known as  old man smith was a
waterlogged derelict by all appearance
expiation



the bank boys were distantly sorry for
him pottering round at his age with
broom and pail and duster few spoke
to him and seldom did he speak when
not first addressed but it seemed he
had to speak to john hepplewhite one
night

   young man you can certainly play
the violin he quavered  ive been
through with my work an hour and
just sitting down here listening to you
where may you have learned it

   i mostly taught myself

   well well havent been where
you could get music instruction

   oh i was in the east in a town
where i could get lessons but i never
had the price and jack laughed
cheerfully enough

   oh the old man seemed a bit
sobered by that  back east eh

   yes norwich

   oh norwich and your folks
could not afford to give you the train-
ing too bad too bad but youve
trained yourself you can play maybe
youll quit banking some day and go
on the concert platform

  jack made no reply to that

   your father back east asked old
man smith

   er-no

  your-mother she still living
   yes shes well thanks

   well well youll be having her
out i suppose

   some day but im to be moved
from here before long this is just
temporary im only waiting till i see
where they move me to then shell
come

  the son did not recognize his father
but the father had recognized the son

  occasional little talks they used to
have thereafter and the young man
was glad afterward that he had never
showed by look or innuendo any con-

tempt for the hand-me-down aspect of
the cleaner

then came the affair that proved
that this new west which had not
displayed itself as so wild and
woolly to jack hepplewhite could be
wild enough in spots

  old man smith had stepped into the
bank from the street at one minute to
four with a click of pail on mop
handle the manager came from his
room swinging a bunch of keys and
said all right the teller opened
the cage the bookkeeper was ready
with his books at the word of com-
mand

  the accountant snapped a clip like
a herons beak over the gathered
papers on his desk the junior clerk
covertly removed a copy of  jack
harkaway  from under his blotter to
his breast pocket the clock gave that
little warning cough before the strike
everything moved along according to
routine

  the door opened again a man
walked in with a handkerchief across
his face snapped the door shut be-
hind him and said  all hands up
and speedy

  then suddenly

  no reaching for a gun he ex-
claimed and down came his gun hand
the peppy young ledger-keeper whose
hands had wavered as they rose stuck
them up quite rigid

  the bandit moved over to his desk
and his eyes shuttling quickly from
one to another felt on the shelf under
it confiscated the revolver that lay
there and of which the ledger-keepers
so slight uncertainty in the raising of
his hands had apprised him he was
as they say on his toes he was onto
his job

  it all happened with great celerity


argosy

the clock that had clicked its warning
struck four then

   get together some the holdup
man commanded them in a harsh
metallic voice  close up there in the
body of the church-and nobody
holler or ill just pop you all off like
shelling peas ive a bullet for each of
you in this gatling gun

  he gave a quick sidelong look at
old smith quivering over his broom
obviously too frightened to move
then he circled to the safe as in some
slow dance a mocking and sinister
saraband facing his bunch of
prisoners with a backward-thrust
hand he rifled the safe dropping the
little bundles and pouches of cash into
a sack

   no no waver of your hands
lock the fingers together over you it
helps some get busy lock em-
wthat i say goes

  the safe rifled he circled again
backing to the tellers cage there
was a step up into it so that the teller
was raised-like the barkeepers of
old-above the level of the clients on
the other side he stumbled slightly
as he backed in against the edge of
the step

  it was not enough of a stumble for
what jack hepplewhite attempted to
do

  as the man stumbled jack made
a sudden leap forward and his hand
swirled down into a shelf down and
out and there was an automatic in
his hand

  no the robbers stumble was not
bad enough to warrant this life-and-
death gamble for it is not often a
man goes into that outlawed profession
without practice any more than into
the legerdemain or conjuring pro-
fession his hand moved too his

gun roared a heavy thud of a sound
in that closed place

  but the trembling old floor cleaner
had been as quick as his son or the
bandit quicker indeed even as
jack moved old man smith leaped on
the holdup man he knew-knew
only too well what would follow he
leaped at the bandits arm and made a
thrust to knock it aside with a desper-
ate cry of  oh my boy

  he did not deflect the six-gun quite
quickly enough he got the bullet in-
tended for hepplewhite

  as he fell the thiefs hand flicked
back cocking his gun again but in
the fraction of time between that and
the throw-down jack blazed away
his was a self-ejecting automatic he
got in two swtift shots

  the holdup man crumpled down on
top of the huddled form of the broom-
and-pail failure and both were dead

  it was all as swift as that it was
over there lay the two bodies one
atop the other and there was a
moments silence while all the men of
the bank stared aghast the clock
ticked on loud in that hush the acrid
odor of firing stung their nostrils all
over

  the bank authorities later tried to
discover if  old man smith  left any
dependents with a view to proffering
a pension but it seemed his affairs
were utterly unknown in chelacko it
was in fact as the manager in his final
report on that inquiry remarked

    he was very uncommunicative even
  among the staff the only person with
  whom he ever exchanged more than a
  word was mr hepplewhite the ac-
  countant whose life he saved and
  mr hepplewhite tells me that smith
  never spoke to him of any relatives or
  indeed of any intimate or personal
  matter at all

 courtney ryley cooper

author of  caged 

i was born in kansas city missouri oc-
tober   and so no matter how i
twist it im forty-three now when i was
fifteen i ran away from home and joined a
small town repertory company when that
went broke i joined another and another and
another and finally there werent any more
so i hit a black one into lancaster missouri
and joined the cook and barrett circus as a
clown that lasted some time

  finally when i was about twenty-one i
found myself back in kansas city with a yen
to get into the newspaper business the city
editor wasnt looking so i sneaked in being
in constant disgrace as a nice sweet cut-to-
the-rut young man with predictions running
about one hundred to one that id land in
the penitentiary the city editor probably
thought i ought to know a lot about it and
made me a police reporter from that i soon
graduated to a specialist on crime covering all
big criminal assignments in missouri kansas
iowa and nebraska during this time i
covered thirteen hangings and the sheriff
never once got the right man and me stand-
ing right there  the scaffold every time

 i also covered some two hundred murder
trials suicides were a bore they always
happened when i was trying to sneak away
for an afternoon at the old century theater
where billy watsons beef trust was the
knockout of the season

  about this time in a fit of aberration i
wrote a circus story somebody bought it
that gave me an idea so i went out to denver
and got a job as the press agent of the sells
floto circus which had at that time buffalo
bill as its star i was with the show for
five or six years filling in the winter season
by working  the denver post thus combin-
ing the circus and what goes with the news-
paper business

 and all the time i kept writing circus
stories tear and gas bombs had not been
invented then they couldnt stop me the
war came along and again somebody wasnt
looking i got into the united states marines
one day a commission came along and since
nobody else was there i took it for myself

so then they sent lieutenant cooper to
france but they sent me too late i fooled
em and came back so then the war ended

  i guess ive written for twenty-five or
thirty magazines mostly of late years for
colliers saturday evening post country
gentleman and ladies home journal i have
twenty-one books on the shelf four or five
of them have been halfway well known-
lions and tigers and everything under
the big top oklahoma go north
young man and so forth

  and now im still writing circus stories and
crime stories and stories about the west and
the north and so forth i live at lake edith
idaho springs colorado but spend a good
part of my time in new york in the winter
punishing the typewriter lake edith freezes
in october why stay at a lake when there
aint no fishin
the readers viewpoint

an appreciated tribute

hong the finest letters of com-
mendation we ever received is the
following from a bishop of the apos-
tolic orthodox church we felt the
same as the bishop about theodore
roscoes story and are glad to give it
this public acclaim

windsor ontario

  i note that many gentlemen write to you
under the  argonotes  heading giving their
points of view upon the merits of stories con-
tained within your covers i have never
joined the merry gentlemen who form that
very interesting department not because i was
unappreciative but because i am under no
delusions as to my lack of requirements as a
correspondent

  i have been a constant reader of the argosy
from the time twenty-five years ago when
it used to appear in its everlasting orange
covers through the changes of a generation
to the present day and i have found it a
source of relief and mental rest through many
a weary hour and trying time and its material
has always been maintained upon such a good
all-around standard that one accepted it with-
out comment

  but i happened upon a story in the decem-
ber  issue by mr theodore roscoe  hard-
boiled cayhills christmas eve party that
impelled me to pen a few lines of commenda-
tion you have probably had before and will
have again stories of more grand and thun-
dering quality but by no manner of means
will another ever be written that so sounds
the depths of humanity upon the better side
the effect of the true spirit of christmas upon
all kinds and conditions of men

  as i read it again and again the whole
of that scene in the german dugout visualized
itself before me the little cake upon the
plank board-oh how much it meant to those
who sent it the lone bottle of wine the
boy soldiers-but why go on the men the
bread the wine the candles the christmas
tree unconsciously or otherwise and i
doubt the former mr roscoe has in that
little scene drawn a picture of the whole
life of the master the birth and the death-

and the world he saved and the men he re-
deemed

  we in the greek orthodox church espe-
cially in the english branch which is uniting
all the russians roumanians jugo-slavs and
others into canadians or americans have on
a milder scale met many a scene like this
little festivities which have brought together
roumanian or bulgar and made them forget
dobrudja hungarian and jugo-slav and
erased memories bitter of the banat and many
another ancestral hate even as the  silent
night of the german youth erased the bit-
terness from the mind of hard-boiled cayhill

  as i have remarked i am not of the sub-
stance of which authors are made and there-
fore perhaps as a critic am not very convinc-
ing but i did not come to criticize but simply
to express my pleasure and joy in a little
story short but saying something in every
word a story full of manliness but unutterably
sweet and tender mere comment can never
bring out what lies in it but he who reads can-
not fail to be uplifted in spirit by this creation
of mr roscoe so noble yet so kind

  with all good wishes and blessings  am
    your servant in christ

fact is this

id you like  beans for back-
bone by richard a martinsen
in this issue if you found it realistic
there is a reason-as mr martinsen
explains

  it may interest the readers of my story
 beans for backbone to know that the yarn
isnt half so much fiction as fact the gen-
eral run of melodramatic  mountie  fiction
gives me a chuckle since the actual achieve-
ments of the northwest mounted now of-
ficially the royal canadian mounted have
the most ingenious plots imagination could
concoct stopped both ways from the jack

   beans for backbone for instance really
isnt a  story   its pointblank history about
all i personally have contributed are a few
excerpts of dialogue and its only one of
the gallant deeds with which the record of this
splendid force teems

nother natural bridge in flori-
da this reader calls to our at-
tention 

miami fla

  i notice an article in your argosy of march
  entitled floridas natural bridge
florida has more than one it appears
about seven or eight miles north of miami
there is a beautiful natural bridge spanning a
small stream called arch creek this is lo-
cated at a small town also called arch creek
the scenery at this point is beautiful

  this bridge differs from the one in north-
western florida inasmuch as it is very much
visited it is on one of the main highways
leading north from miami

two ingenious defenses this reader
makes for the five nines that got
into robert terry shannons poker
deck in  almost a gentleman 

elmira n y

  have been a contented reader of your maga-
zine for a long time and never have had any
fault to find i am taking this opportunity
to come to the defense of robert terry
shannon in his story  almost a gentleman 

  if the poker game had been played with
the  joker wild  as it is sometimes done
five nines could have shown up during the
play incidentally i sat in a game one night
using a brand new deck of good make and
saw five natural eights appear in the first
showdown the eight of hearts had been
duplicated

he is a convert to the  impos-
sibles incidentally edgar frank-
lin is now on the schedule with a
serial for a few months from now

                               fresno cal
some time ago when i told you i didnt
like the  impossible  type of story i hadnt
seen  planet of peril  the girl in the
atom  and  maza of the moon just started
i surely enjoyed all of these impossible ones
so let them come ahead

  along with the others i was delighted to
see the railroad serial  a road at stake
and i too bid a hearty welcome to the return
of the railroad mans magazine

  there is however one type of story you
havent served us for some time and that is
the comedy serial i still remember the en-
joyment i got reading what was that
by edgar franklin also  anything goes by
the same author

  i am sure that there are many hundreds of
us that would welcome a comedy serial of
six or eight parts with a laugh packed in
every paragraph we get too few laughs
at any rate so i hope you can get the funny
writers to produce something that will raise
the average

of course camels are milder

        theyre fresh

have you noticed how women every-
where are switching to the fresh mild-
ness of camels always a great favorite
with the ladies this famous blend is more
popular now than ever since the intro-
duction of the new humidor pack

  if you need to be convinced make this
simple test yourself between a humidor
fresh camel and any other cigarette

  first inhale the cool fragrant smoke
of a perfectly conditioned camel and
note how easy it is to the throat

next inhale the hot brackish smoke of
a parched dry cigarette and feel that sharp
stinging sensation on the membrane

  the air-sealed humidor pack keeps
all the rare flavor and aroma in and pre-
vents the precious natural tobacco mois-
ture from drying out important too
it protects the cigarette from dust and
germs

  switch to camel freshness and mild-
ness for one whole day then leave them
- if you can

 it is the mark of a considerate hostess
    by means of the humidor pack to
    serveafresh cigarette buy camels
    by the carton - this cigarette will
    remain fresh in your home and office
