perfect-o-lite astonishes expert and layman alike
science at last has conquered the grief of night driving

   doubles roadlight but ends dimming

it is a well-known fact that motor car
manufacturers have solved every
big problem except one as soon as
the sun goes down at night the high-
ways of america break forth into a
constant rushing stream of dimming
and damning speed is cut down one-
third to one-half every monday morn-
ing finds the highways littered with
broken glass wrecks cars in the ditch
overturned shattered against telephone
posts every man who ever groped
dizzily down the highway in traffic at
night knows the horrible sensation of
being half-blinded by cars on his left
unable to see the ditch on his right his
own lights seeming dim and shadowy
and practically worthless now in a
twinkling this curse of night driving is
lifted completely and inexpensively
from the shoulders of the entire motor-
ing world

fits any headlight

  this new lighting discovery is called
perfect-o-lite it is a little invention
that replaces the ordinary bulbs in
your automobile headlights no extra
wiring or installation millions of mo-
torists have invested from  to 

or more in so-called spot lights and
driving lights which at best are only
makeshifts this new lighting method
costs only a tiny fraction as much yet
actually does double road illumina-
tion banishes need for glare shields
cuts through the other fellows light
yet absolutely cannot glare in his eyes
makes ruts animals children detour
signs etc visible at least three times
as far now night driving at  to
 miles an hour is safe and easy

 the corner-stones of chemistry

 by t oconor sloane phd

he discovery that a chemical combination was the
addition of two or more things and that the com-
binations were always in the same ratio of weights
or of multiples thereof were so much the basis
of modern chemistry that it is taken as the foun-
dation stone of all we know simple and obvious
as it seems the centuries of work of the alchemists
and scientists of olden days got them nowhere and it was just
during the breaking out of the french revolution that lavoisier
in paris and priestly who had recently come over from england
to america had made the discovery each independent of the
other priestly did his work in pennsylvania lavoisier did
his in paris so naturally enough america claims the beginning
of chemistry as also does france

  lavoisier was connected with the government of france as a
collector of the revenues and naturally being a distinctively
great man he improved everything he touched one of the
great things wanted in those days was potassium nitrate for
making gunpowder and he improved the collection of this
and did away with the very obnoxious system of visiting the
cellars of private houses in the hope of finding sources for the
salt but when the revolution broke out the work lavoisier
did for the government on the side of its revenues told against
him and he was beheaded he was one of the purest characters
that the french revolution sent to the guillotine there is a
story that he wanted to complete some chemical experiment
before being executed and that he was not permitted to do it
he was told that the republic had no need of chemists a
decade or two later they found out that they had great need of
chemists

  one of the necessities of modern life is soap and to make
hard soap as distinguished from soft soap sodium carbonate is an
essential so when france was cut off from spain in her wars
with england she was cut off from a supply of the seaweed
called kelp  his seaweed used to be collected in enormous
quantities and its ashes yielded sodium carbonate a prize
was offered for anyone who developed a process of making 
sodium carbonate from salt of which sea water alone would
provide an endless quantity france most emphatically needed
a jiemist and found one leblanc a french chemist developed
the wonderful soda-ash process which gave the desired alkali
from salt it was a revolutionary discovery and the date of the
patent for it is  apparently the country did need a chemist

  although the process is largely superseded now at one time
it was probably the greatest chemical industry of the world
and there was an old saying apropos of the development of
this process to the effect that the civilization of a nation could
be judged by the quantity of soap it made this is because

the amount of soap it produced indicated the development of
the leblanc soda ash process

  lavoisier had been guillotined and poor leblanc worn out
with disappointment committed suicide

  these episodes in the historyof chemistry seemed to have
led us a little astray from our subject so we will trv to return
to it

  the establishment of the weight-relation of the constituents
of compounds lead to the development of the table of atomic
weights so we see that chemistry originated as a science of
weights and the chemists balance in a sense became the symbol
of the new science

  water was found o consist of eight parts by weight of
oxygen to one part of hydrogen a slight discrepancy in the
hydrogen was not discovered for many years accordingly it
was said that the water molecule consistedof an atom of oxygen
combined with an atom of hydrogen and with the rapid devel-
opment of chemical formulas this was accepted as the truth
the italian chemist avagadro early in the last century brought
out the theory that equal volumes of all gases at the same tem-
perature and pressure contained the same number of mole-
cules now it is a very simple thing to decompose water by
the electric current and to collect the oxygen and hydrogen
each in its own receptacle for measurement it was found
that there was exactly twice the volume of hydrogen in water
that there was of oxygen avagadros paper was published
in  water had always been called ho and the whole
structure of chemical formulas was built up on this basis in
the middle of the last century the new system as it is called
which gave water for its formula hso modifying a vast num-
ber of chemical formulas was accepted by the more modern
chemists and quite a war was waged between the two schools
as we may call them it is interesting to note that in the
sixties of the last century the authorities of columbia college
in new york for it was not a university then passed a reso-
lution adopting what was called the new system in which
water was h instead of ho

  lavoisier and priestly had made chemistry a science of rela-
tive weights and these weights applied whether the substance
was solid liquid or gaseous after lavoisiers and priestlys
work the relation ol volumes of substances in the gaseous state
was developed by avagadro thus further modifying chemistry

  the relation of weights of the atoms and molecules followed
by the identity of size of molecules in the gaseous state were
the corner-stones for it now had two in chemistry and it had
taken the intellect of man  or more years to find this out
and convert alchemy into chemistry

   lthough marvelous strides have

     been made within the last fifty years in
the field of mechanical invention we must
admit that we are merely at the brink of the
machine age what the future holds for us
nobody can tell definitely or surely but some
of those psychologists and scientists who let
their imaginations roam into the possible
future see things-remarkable things-to
which they react with much misgiving
machinery that standardizes production may
in some way extend itself too far in standard-
izing life it is a problem worth considering
now-whether a muddling government that
still permits initiative and self-reliance is
not preferable to a perfectly standardized
machine government dr breuer sees his
side of the problem clearly and gives a most
vivid picture of such a possible future

chapter i

       uentin smith lakeman the
         government regrets your personal feel-
         ings and sympathizes with your rela-
         tives but finds it necessary to condemn
         you at once to euthanasia

               as the mechanical voice that came
from the orifice of the speaker ceased quentin smith
lakeman turned pale and an icy pang shot through him
through the dazzling lights that danced in his brain he
could see his three companions standing there gasping
as a result of the sudden crushing sentence

  he had expected some kind of a reward for his year
of hard work danger and hardship spent in the service
of the government not that he expected machinery to
have any gratitude but above all the machine is logical
and just and there were rules for rewarding special
effort such as his

  democratia must be promptly and completely de-
stroyed the metallic voice of the speaker continued
from your report of your investigations in that coun-
try it is clear that its people will never consent to stand-
ardize themselves and that they therefore constitute a
menace to our standardized world government

  quentin-to call him by his intimate name for in
the twenty-sixth century everyone had an intimate name
a family name and a public name-was flung down and
crushed again by the announcement of the fate of that
gallant country in which he had just spent a year it
seemed that his heart would stop beating then and there
for democratia held martha who in that one short year
had become more precious than all else in the world he
looked beside him at jack her stalwart eighteen-year-
old brother who had journeyed back with him as a
guest to washington the capital of the world

  the government appreciates the very efficient efforts
of quentin smith lakeman the voice went on quen-
tin knew it for the empty formula that the machine
adopted in order to appeal to the emotions of human
beings with whom it dealt it understands that this
decision is emotionally difficult for living beings to bear
but you have spent months in democratia and acquired
a considerable tinge of individualistic ideas and customs
it would be dangerous to our institutions to turn you
loose among the people now and as democratia will
soon cease to exist prompt euthanasia is the only solu-
tion

  utter silence followed even the faint crackling of
the speaker ceased showing that the connection was off
quentin turned to jack whose burly form towered above
the rest of them and whose countenance showed a be-
wildered inability to grasp what it all meant

  just then the door opened and a police captain came
in followed by a squad of men in blue uniform quen-
tin recognized the captain as guy sherman sentier an
old and close friend sentier stopped short and turned
pale

  you he gasped as he saw quentin my orders
are to take four people out of this office to the euthana-
sia chambers what have you done

  nothing said quentin calm by this time go
ahead its your duty all ive done was to do mine
terribly sorry said sentier faintly he motioned
to his men and turned his head away

  the policemen came up one of them grasping jack
by the arm jack whirled around and knocked the fellow
across the room as easily as shaking off a rat then
he leaped away from the group that lad come in through
an outer door and in a moment had disappeared through
a door leading into the interior of the building the
clatter of his swift footsteps died rapidly away into the
muffled distance

  for a moment the policemen stood aghast they did
not know quite how to behave for never in their ex-
perience had a prisoner made so bold as to try to escape
with the world rigidly standardized and moving as one
unit what hope could there be of escape

  at a shout from the captain they became active and
scattered through doors and windows in pursuit each
with his thin black rod

  the three remaining captives were handcuffed and
a man left in charge

  quentin waited in patient resignation for he knew it
could not last long can one escape the lion in his own
den the very walls of the building would combine
to hunt down the fugitive

  but the boy must have been swift and clever minutes
lengthened into an hour the guard stood stiff me-
chanical embarrassed the huge building was silent
save for vague mechanical sounds then a faint shout
came across a courtyard through a window and quentin
could see jack climbing down a drain pipe from the
roof two figures appeared on the roof above him and
others ran out of a door near by and waited for him 
the ground as jack came down within reach one of
the guards touched him with the end of his slender
three-foot rod jack dropped to the ground limp and
paralyzed in a few moments he was wheeled into the
office on a small cart one of the policemen holding the
rod in contact with jacks arm the boy lay helpless
his eyes gazing mute inquiry into quentins

  no use jack quentin said to him youre among
civilized people now you know youre no good against
police equipment promise them youll go quietly and
theyll let you up

  the policeman lifted the rod an instant giving jack
power to nod his head in promise thereupon the police-
man put his rod away and jack stood up and looked
about abashed as the police led their captives out
sentier called after quentin

  you dont hold this against me personally may
i visit you

  come i shall be glad to see you quentin answered
philosophically why should i blame you youre a
tiny cog in a huge machine




amazing

stories

as the captives were led into a barred and guarded
plane quentin put his arm about jacks big shoul-
ders in sympathy he looked young to die and it
seemed like a betrayal to be brought from that wild coun-
try to see the wonders of the civilized world and find
this as the plane rose and headed for new york
where the euthanasia facilities were located jack seemed
more absorbed in looking down at the government build-
ings which comprised the whole city of washington than
in the thought of impending death he looked at quen-
tin with bewilderment in his face

  that square massive building just below us is the
one we were in and you say that is the center the
brain the key of the whole world government

  that is the government quentin replied just
as your brain is you these other countless acres of
buildings are merely its arms and fingers and eyes and
ears without this building they could not function and
the world would be chaos

  jack stared down fascinatedly

  and yet he breathed in amazement i ran through
miles of corridors passed hundreds of rooms full of
apparatus and instruments and not a soul did i see
quentin nodded in confirmation

  for an hour i ran and by the end of it i was caring
less about being caught than about finding some people
about in these buildings is there no one

  no one quentin replied

  and yet you say its the government the boy
seemed dumfounded

  after all my explaining quentin said havent you
realized that the government is merely a huge machine
made of metal and rubber and glass and run by elec-
tricity and light and heat

  but-but how can machinery govern the world
better than human beings can even your business
men in democratia use machines to help them run their
businesses their offices are full of automatic machines
for managing a business time-clocks adding-machines
bookkeeping machines cash-registers dictaphones-no
end of them the government machine is not essenti-
ally different merely a little more automatic and a
little more complex

  and are all the people willing to be governed by a
machine it was all amazingly strange to jack

  they cannot conceive of anything else quentin ex-
plained for three hundred years they have grown up
in it they are intensely loyal to it because it not merely
governs them as you understand the word govern it
takes care of them as a mother takes care of children
they seem to be happy jack observed

  quentin nodded down toward the beautiful country-
side over which they were flying at a swift rate the
green fields were intersected by broad roads and huge
power lines and the blue bulk of a city loomed on the
horizon

  the world is more prosperous than it has ever been
before he replied life is thoroughly comfortable
absolutely safe and certain but you would call it
monotonous everybody does everything by rule and
schedule all alike the world over standardize you
wouldnt like it

  i couldnt stand it jack exclaimed

  your country democratia continued quentin is
made up of the descendants of people who couldnt stand
it during the development period of machine govern-

ment standardization the democratic-minded people who
could not fit into it were having a hard time they were
persecuted and driven from one place to another

  thats unjust jack was thoroughly democratic

  they were a small minority the rest of the world
was in earnest it was afraid of annihilation by war so
it built cities on a standard plan streets and buildings
all alike from new york to hongkong people live on
the same schedule and think by the same rules that is
easier to manage by machinery safer more comfort-
able

  jack gazed for a while at the swiftly receding land-
scape below

  then why is the government picking on democratia
now he asked

  it had to come for some centuries your country
in central tibet was left in peace because its founders
sought the remotest possible isolation our government
had its own problems but step by step it is striving
constantly to perfect the world apparently the step has
arrived in the process when it is time to remove the only
exception to world rule

  and it sent you over there jack shook his head
puzzled

  remember that the government has no emotions nor
prejudices it works absolutely by logic it is always
perfect in its fairness a decision on democratia needed
all possible informational data as communication chan-
nels do not extend into democratia men had to be sent
in

  and when you do a good job you get killed for it

  logical though is it not quentin could be im-
personal when discussing the government machine
now i see why it warned me so emphatically that i
was risking my life and gave me repeated opportunities
to decline the assignment if i wished to

  risking your life in democratia jack exclaimed

  not at all although that is the way i understood it
at first the government needed a resourceful man for
the job and resourceful men are rare in our civilization
i was the best bet-dont laugh at me i know how help-
less and clumsy you think i am-i took my risk and
lost it for this world cannot permit a resourceful man
to live in it

  jack hardly heard the conclusion he was gazing
in open-mouthed wonder at the huge solid mass of new
york city that loomed ahead the cliffs of buildings the
surging masses of people and machinery the plane
glided swiftly up above the dull drab roofs and landed
on the top of a building guided by a long black streamer
at the top of a tall flagpole surrounded by guards the
four men were led to an elevator descended a score of
floors and entered the euthanasia chambers

  the furnishings and appointments here were the last
word in beauty and luxury the soft carpets the rich
hangings the luxurious furniture the flowers and scents
and colors the foods and wines within reach all had a
tendency to lull the occupants into a sense of peace and
drowsy comfort each of the party was led to a room
where he was to be given twenty-four hours for receiving
last visits from friends and relatives jack and quentin
elected to remain together in one room

  lovely isnt it said quentin ironically a year
ago its beauty would have stirred my emotions but
your rugged land has cured me now i can see the steel
and concrete through the velvet and see it just as an
mechanocracy



undertaking establishment which you enter alive and
leave dead

  sentier arrived presently without his squad of
policemen he was not a very impressive man he almost
wept as he greeted quentin it looked almost as though
he were the one sentenced to death

  ones duty demands cruel things he moaned ar-
rest your best friend

  i wouldnt do it thats all jack exclaimed

  ouentin patted the boys back

  yes you would he reminded if you and a dozen
generations of you had been raised like machines to obey
the government machine and be loyal to it above all

  noting senders depressed looks quentin offered to
relate his adventures in democratia and sentier eagerly
grasped at the opportunity to relieve the tension

  get a permit to broadcast as much as possible of it
quentin suggested it is a beautiful land and a wonder-
ful people that are about to be destroyed but suppose
i tell you what if you sympathize that will be
treason and you will be-eliminated

  sentier smiled

  no danger he said that is why you were sent out
and i am a police captain if i can arrest my best friend
in cold blood how can i sympathize with a distant land
and a strange people

  in other words quentin mused again the govern-
ment picked me out to die when it selected me for the
job

  that of course depended on what you would find
there

  jack clenched his fists a frown gathered on his
forehead he glared at the policeman who was an
embodiment of the government that killed an efficient
man for doing his duty and to whom machines were
more important than men quentin watched the boy
as he talked vague possibilities stirred his imagination
what if he might see martha again he quentin had
the brains for a daring attempt but not the physical
courage jack had boldness enough for anything quen-
tin worded his story quite as much for its effect on jack
as for sentiers benefit

chapter ii

 x ust a year ago quentin began his story to

  i sentier i was called into that same office in
washington and given my instructions i was
offered the chance to refuse without stigma that i
thought ridiculous for it seemed a wonderful oppor-
tunity i am cursed with a love of adventure which
is a terrible affliction in this monotonous age i was to
spend a year in democratia and then come back and give
a full report on the life and customs of the country

  i was so excited that i came within a hair of giving
away a secret and probably with it my life or liberty
this love of adventure had boiled up within me from
youth for years i had planned some sort of a wild
deed bit by bit i had secretly assembled an airplane
in an obscure cellar on long island it lay there at the
moment with fuel and provisions ready to start
equipped for a rough uncertain trip instead of for the
scheduled routes which have been carefully standardized
i had an impulse to take this plane for the trip but a
flash of judgment told me that it would be dangerous
to reveal my secret

  i was ordered to take my official plans which i
owned according to my rank and standing i was not
permitted to take my own mechanic binder and steele
were assigned as mechanics and neatman as secretary
it was all very simple the three men arrived at my
home early one morning we taxied out of my garage
flew across the city and out over the atlantic because
of the rigid standardization of men methods and ma-
chines the mechanics had no need of seeing either me or
the plane before the moment of starting

  we made a quick trip and i paid little attention to
my surroundings during the most of it the cities look
the same and the people act the same everywhere as in
new york only when we reached the himalayas i
began to feel my first thrill those vast stretches with-
out a city for hundreds of miles are romantic we
located the tagnapo river and the ruins of llhasa
once a large and powerful city and struck due north
into a wild desert where no one ever goes after some
hours of searching we located the green valley completely
shut in by vast mountains and saw the cities of demo-
cratia

  there were three large fine ones and a dozen smaller
towns and a sprinkling over the whole land of what
must have been villages think of it sentier they live
in villages little collections of a few tiny buildings
most of the world used to do that a thousand years ago
and even the three great cities of democratia were not
modern as our cities are they were not built in units
each building was of different height and size and they
had open streets in single layers but it was a wonderful
looking land think of it lying hidden away there
and the world knowing nothing about it its bold re-
sourceful men its sturdy and beautiful women when
it is puffed out no one will feel a pang of sympathy for it

  there were no diplomatic relations between the two
governments credentials were of no use to me and i
received none nor did i receive any sign of the usual
string of rules instructions and minutiae the whole
thing was left up to me and during the whole of the
trip over i pondered on some way of approaching the
people of democratia i pondered in vain i knew
nothing about the people and their country and could
form no plan so i first took a good look at the coun-
try from an altitude too great for tjiem to see me then
i decided to land in some uninhabited spot and spend
a night resting and planning i chose a flat place low
down between two tall peaks near the northern rim of
the mountain-surrounded country a hundred miles
away was one of their largest cities

  we alighted on grass and the air was cold but we
had warm clothing and the cabin of the plane was heated
the beauty of the prospect was worth the cold the
vast grassy plain the woods half a mile away the huge
snow-patched mountains in the opposite direction-we
live too much cooped up in cities sentier-it took my
breath the others were also impressed and we had
to expend our emotions in a walk toward the woods

  i ought to have known better city men have no
business in the wilderness oh yes we took our shock-
rods along and i took an old-fashioned projectile pistol
half way to the trees we heard a tramping behind us
and turning beheld a huge goat with winding horns
charging for us at full speed the animal raced swiftly
toward us as we stood paralyzed by fear it seemed to
have picked out steele and tore right at him steele


amazing stories

took it coolly enough and faced the charge with his
shock-rod it paralyzed the goat on contact all right but
it could not stop the momentum of the great charging
body which rolled crashing on crushed steele under
it and nearly got me i got a bullet in the goats head
before it could get up astonishing my companions with
the noise of the shot steele was dead smashed when
we reached him

  the sound of galloping hoofs reached us more
goats were coming we ran for the woods because
they were nearer than our plane later i got used to
the looks of these goats they are not particularly dan-
gerous but to us just then they were huge frightful
monsters were not used to seeing large live free
animals our frantic fear made us act foolishly

  at intervals i turned around and shot bullets at the
goats just now that is laughable i had no skill with
the weapon my shots went wild but it helped a lit-
tle for the noise confused the goats and retarded their
speed somewhat we reached the trees and hurried
far into their depths the goats did not follow because
their horns got tangled in the growth

  then when we had gotten our breath after such
unaccustomed exertion and had waited long enough to
give the goats time to wander off we started back we
walked on through the trees toward the plain but came
to no end of them we were lost

  the terrors of that night will be stamped on my
memory forever-well that wont be long first of all
it was cold we huddled together some of us thought
of a fire none of us had ever seen an open fire but
we had read of ancient savages making fires by rub-
bing sticks we rubbed sticks till we were exhausted
of course it was silly for we didnt even know the dif-
ference between green and dry wood we therefore
crowded together on the ground shivering as much
with terror as with cold there was no sleep for us
the noises of the woods from clicks and crackles to
roars and yells sent grip after grip of fear through our
hearts sentier these tales you read of people dying
from pure terror are not true if such a thing were
possible we would all have died the first quarter of the
night yet these democratians spend night after night
in the woods and enjoy it we are just too much pann
pered by our machines

  a party of them had camped not half a mile from us
that night just too far for us to see their fire they
wrap themselves in blankets and leave one person on
guard and sleep soundly all night they found us in
the morning numb with cold and dumb with fear the
first i knew of them was a musical voice calling

   quick jack with a little oj-like intake of the
breath someone in distress

  i looked up approathing was a girl in corduroy
breeches and high-laced boots-antiquated romantic a
knapsack an old-fashioned rifle for shooting bullets
but there was a glow of health in her cheeks that made
the chemical beauty of our girls seem ridiculous to
me that moment shivering in hungry hopeless despair
she was the most beautiful radiant being i had ever
seen or imagined she was the sister of jack here
he was with her

ouentin looked about the velvet draperies that
concealed their prison walls as though it were
hard to believe that it all hung together somehow he

sank his face in his hands for an instant sentier was
embarrassed sentier could sympathize with the love
affair men of his day were experts in those quentin
did not even look at jack and in a moment had thrown
off the mood and continued

  they had us comfortable in a few minutes jack
and his father came up very soon before our eyes they
made a fire sentier you ought to see a fire before
you die they boiled coffee and eggs did you ever
eat an egg sentier the delicious odors the warmth
of the fire the beauty of the girl who was on an equal
with the men in strength and efficiency and had no
simpering feminine wiles about her-i was sold on
democratia from then on

   who are you and whence are you was their first
question

  just on a pleasure cruise i put in quickly before
any of the rest of our party could speak bound no-
where in particular we liked this spot and wanted
to look at it more closely and got lost we spent all
night in the woods

  unarmed without fire the girl looked worlds
of sympathy at us

   were city folks not used to being out i said

   so are we city folks- jack began but his father
silenced him with a look

  they persuaded us to come to their camp and prom-
ised to find our plane after some sleep and rest i be-
gan to notice things there were a dozen people in a
tiny house of logs on the mountain they were living
there for a month they had no heating system no
lighting system-depended on open fires no kine-
phone service no tube delivery not even properly
prepared food they ate just animals and plants boiled
over a fire no transportation  they walked everywhere
yet they were enjoying it doing it for pleasure can
you imagine it

  and can you imagine me enjoying it i got inter-
ested early i learned to build a fire too bad theres
no place around here to build a fire i learned to shoot
a rifle much more thrilling than a shock-rod at the
end of the month i could walk ten miles and enjoy it
i coud sleep out all night and make my own breakfast
compared with these people though sentier i was
helpless compared with them all of us arc helpless
little helpless larvae such as ants carry around

  we depend for everything on machinery and on our
government the government gives us food and water
and amusement and its machines work for us and take
care of us without its care we would die in a few days

  these people havent much government a ridiculous
meeting of so-called representatives once a year which
spends most of its time arguing and never gets any-
where they have laws which they obey when its
convenient and possible

  but they dont need a government we do they
can take care of themselves with their own individual
hands they can grapple with nature and wrest life and
comfort from her trees and rocks and beasts jack here
is only eighteen but he could probably take you and
break you up in short pieces dont grab your rod he
knows it wont get him anywhere he could probably
go several days without much food or sleep ever tried
that sentier

  we may have a wonderful civilization sentier but
as individuals were feeble sprouts whats the good of
mechanocracy



all these millions of us all alike humanity by mass
production what would be the loss if they all died
today 

  we were taken to the largest of their cities a primi-
tive sort of place with individual buildings and individual
cars running about jacks father was a high govern-
ment official and had been vacationing in the mountains
he was a rugged and kindly man very much concerned
about the welfare of the people over whom his authority
extended he took us to his home and shared its com-
forts with us imagine that sentier taking a total
stranger into your home having him eat with you sleep
in your rooms

  it wasnt long before i found myself in an uncom-
fortable pickle these people were kind to us doing all
they could to make us feel at home friendly couldnt
help loving them and here i was spying preparing
to betray their kindness to me for much as i liked
their country and their ways i knew that the govern-
ment machine would not i spent several weeks of
torture

  furthermore i was supposed to stay there a year
it was not plausible that even idle tourists would tarry
for a year by the wayside they would wonder why
didnt i go on 

  the father of jack and martha noted my worry
and depression he asked me about it with blunt primi-
tive directness

   there is something about your situation here that
worries you he said tell me what it is and i can
help you see none of the roundabout diplomacy
that were used to he got the whole story out of me

  the deep lines in his face with its little fringe of
beard made him look very wise and very kind youve
never seen a man with a beard have you sentier it
adds dignity

   the only thing for you to do he said is to stay
and do your duty well be friends because we like
you and know you cant help it go back when the time
comes if you dont they will send others who may be
more dangerous to us than you are

  then i was more at peace until the time approached
to go i kept my secretary busy writing up notes and
the mechanics keeping the plane in condition i went
around doing my best to study the country i learned
about money and buying and political parties about poor
people and unemployment i learned to drive one of
their little cars i actually held a job and made my own
living for a few weeks though i think my employer
was glad to get rid of me but most of the time i was
a guest an exception to the prevailing conditions in
which everyone had to hammer out his living with his
own hands or starve

  i took long trips through their country in great steel
carriages that run on rails martha accompanied me
almost everywhere she had been charming that first
day in her rough hunting suit when she found us nearly
dead she was charming later in a thousand ways in soft
and long gowns dancing to spirited music in athletic
white vigorously playing a very active game called ten-
nis she knew her people and her country thoroughly
and was my guide and teacher in my studies

  at our first meeting i was weak and helpless and
half dead she was sturdy and resourceful i looked up
to her on dizzy heights above me with a hopeless sorrow-
ful feeling ten months later physically fit to look after

her safety i took her on a glacier-climb paying all the
expenses with money i had earned myself theres a
pride in earning money sentier too bad you cant try it

  we have practically eliminated wild animals from the
rest of the world but these people preserve them and
limit their destruction for the sport of hunting them it
is a dangerous sport martha and i never suspected any
danger when we were climbing up the easy ice-slopes in
a frolicking fashion she was ahead around a point of
ice and out of sight when i heard her screams

  i hurried up two white bears had attacked her
one had her rifle in its mouth and was pawing and
crunching at it the other had her down and was rolling
her back and forth with its front paws and tearing play-
fully at her clothes with its teeth

  then they saw me both snarled the one with the
rifle dropped it and came at me these creatures looked
clumsy but they can move the thing was on me before
i could unsling my rifle and i went down under it as
the beast pummeled me i scrambled for the long hunt-
ing-knife which i had learned to wear at my belt as do
all of these people out in the open i plunged the knife
into his ribs a dozen times before he finally dropped and
slid down the icy slope i was completely soaked in
his blood

  by this time martha was also jabbing with her knife
and was bloody from head to foot but the bear was still
going strong she was cool enough but concerned about
her face she held up her arm to protect it from the
animals long claws and this interfered with her knife
thrusts i finished him with three jabs and he crashed
down on her when i dragged him off she did not get
up but lay there moaning

  she had a broken leg i-a product of this effete
civilization pampered by the government machine
raised like a lily in a hothouse-i splintered her leg with
the scabbards of the long hunting knives and hoisted her
across my shoulders there on the slippery ice i toiled
back with her and it was night before i reached the
car and toward morning before i drove into a village
and secured medical help what would you do sentier
-police are huskier than the average-with two bears
and only a knife and a girl you loved with a broken leg
a hundred miles away from the nearest habitation no
buttons to push no levers to set no machinery to wait
on you

  i spent delightful weeks in marthas company while
she was confined with her fracture before they were
over she was pledged to be my wife why an able and
beautiful girl like that should want to marry a clumsy
and incompetent lubber like myself i could not under-
stand

   i dont want to go back to washington i said let
us settle down right away and forget about civilization

   i should like it of course she smiled

   let the old government machine find someone else
to do its dirty work i exclaimed im happy here
never again could i be happy in those roaring hives back
there

  we planned our home and counted on a teaching
position which had been offered me in one of their uni-
versities and i was happy about my future with her
and with these delightful people i hesitated about in-
forming the secretary and the mechanic they were not
quite as much delighted with the country of democratia
as i was and were eagerly looking forward to the end


amazing stories

of the year when they might go back to the brilliant
lights and the gay entertainment of broadway it was
difficult for me to force myself to tell them

  finally when our preparations began to be outwardly
apparent marthas father took us in to talk to him

   do you think this wise he asked me from what
i gather your government machine does not lose track
of details and does not forgive failures

  how could it find me here i asked but rather
hesitatingly

   another phase of the matter is this you sym-
pathize with us and our country we would much
rather have you make the report suppose they send
another man less friendly what would happen to us
so i started back for washington with a heavy
heart because i must leave behind a girl who in beauty
in force of character in real ability mental and physical
is worth all the women in this feeble and degenerate
civilization

  he had been talking with his head bowed toward his
knees when he ceased there was silence it was a
queer silence lacking things that ought to have been
there he looked up sentier was also bowed over
slumped over in fact jack stood behind him and as
quentin looked up jack straightened up and shook his
hands from the wrists as though to limber them up as
quentin stared amazed jack gave sentier a shove the
latter rolled down on the floor and flopped over on his
back in a loose sickening sort of way his face was
purple his black tongue protruded and there were black
marks on his neck

  neat job jack said if youre really as surprised
as you look you went too far reminding me of sis
and home

chapter iii

uentin looked down at the dead man and up
at jacks stalwart figure

  democracy versus mechanocracy he said
that is the way it goes between individuals between
the organized groups it would come out exactly the
opposite

  the machine wins though its subject people are weak-
lings wouldnt it be better for the race to destroy the
machine 

  but i couldnt do it every fiber of my nature has
been brought up to consider the government machine as
a sacred mother-

  but ill bet jack would have the nerve in a minute-
  come whispered jack shrilly lets get out

  he was already stripping off the dead mans uniform
he held it up and surveyed it ruefully against his own
strapping bulk

  ill put it on quentin said i- can act the part
where you cannot itll be your turn when the rough-
house begins

  quentins clothes were put on the dead man and the
latters keys were used to open the door they walked
past the sentry at the door receiving his salute without
the flutter of an eyelid and marched down the hallway
jack in front with the handcuffs on but not locked
quentin came behind him in the captains uniform bear-
ing the shock-rod they had no plan except that quen-
tin suddenly thought of his secret airplane and de-
termined to get to it

  but how it was out on long island they were in
the middle of a huge city one solid structure honey-
combed with mazes and labyrinths of streets and pas-
sages horizontal and vertical the end of it was three
or four miles away three or four miles of endless buz-
zing swarming whirling machinery and humanity be-
tween them and open country

  our best bet quentin said is to get down to the
lowest level there we ought to find some sort of a
burrow to crawl out of to the elevator

  they reached the elevator and pushed its button its
door opened and they stepped in setting the button on
the eight-below level the lowest of them all the car
started down

  a gong clanged and kept on clanging somewhere in
the depths of the building a loud speaker began to bel-
low hoarsely on the floor they were passing its roar
died down as they left the floor behind but was taken up
by another on the floor below

  the guard has found sentier whispered quentin

  and has turned in the alarm well lets show em
a scrap

  a new voice began in the speaker it was crisp and
gave orders

  -all doors they heard as they shot past a floor

  -shut off the power and search all elevators-

on another

  hra said quentin as the elevator slowed down and
they saw through the bars a group of blue uniforms
approaching jack was tense for a fighc

  not yet quentin warned him remember we
cant fight the organization

  all right he shouted to the approaching policemen
ive got one of them one of you come along and
get the power back on quick and the elevator moving so
that i can hustle him back where he belongs

  the policemen saluted quentin one of them stepped
in and glared at jack the elevator door closed in a
few moments the car shot upward again

  quentin touched the policeman with the shock-rod and
as he lay limp jack put the handcuffs on him tied his
feet with a strap from the policemans own puttees and
gagged him with a handkerchief the policeman un-
accustomed to such rough handling winced and shrank
away groaning the elevator shot upward swiftly
passing floors by dozens and scores the euthanasia
chambers were left far below on each floor were
crowding people clanging gongs and bellowing speakers
eventually they stopped outside was huge machinery
wheels pulleys motors above was the sky wavy glass
somewhere far away below were footsteps pounding
up metal stairs they were just under the roof a
thousand feet above the ground

  up on my shoulders said jack glancing up at the
skylight

  quentin unhooked the skylight climbed out and
helped jack up after him all about them was a sea of
roofs miles and miles of them flat dirty with little
cubicles and penthouses scattered by the hundreds and
ventilators by the thousands above them on its tall
flagpole waved the black streamer which undoubtedly
marked the location of the euthanasia chambers as a
guide for aircraft there were other flagpoles and other
streamers but no more black ones they ran they ran
at random not knowing whither

  they ran till their breath was all gone and then sank
mechanocracy



down and lay flat jack still trembled at the sensation
of having crossed a bridgeway between two buildings
and glimpsed a street a thousand feet below a faint
stream of blended moving masses just now there was
no one in sight the scene was no different than when
they had started only the absence of the black streamer
made him sure that they were in a different place
bad fix quentin said well starve up here
oh no jack replied easily well depend on the
sun for direction and keep going till we find an end or
edge well find some way of getting to the ground and
getting away

  well youve got nerve anyway and its better to
die trying than to sit here

  then they noted airplanes searching round and round
above them they crouched down in the shadows be-
tween the pipes and cubicles the planes came lower
and closer together

  they got the planes out quick jack observed

  it did you mean its all automatic the men are
just tools the whole city is an electrical brain and is
just a subsidiary of the washington brain a sort of in-
ferior ganglion the men could never think nor work
that fast the planes are now coming straight at us
evidently they have located us by some such methods as
the refractograph which by the refraction of light de-
tects the column of carbon dioxide rising from our
lungs the telaud which can hear us whisper or our
hearts beat or the holograph which locates us by the
heat of our bodies

  a plane landed on a level place a hundred yards away
another and another alighted beside it figures poured
out and began to close in on the two fugitives ahead
of them was the edge of the building with a sheer verti-
cal drop of a thousand feet there was no bridgeway

	door

  ha quentin pointed to a flagpole from which
floated a long silver streamer it was some sort of a
commercial signal to aircraft the halliards on which the
flag hung extended down over the edge of the roof
those ropes run into a window below

  figures in blue were running toward them jack slid
down the rope first and disappeared quentin waited for
the rope to loosen as jack got off uncertain as to whether
it would hold their combined weight but he found a
policeman sliding down the rope after him the police-
man hung on tightly and moved gingerly quentin looked
up and saw his face ashy pale as it looked down at him
for the two of them swung out in space over a canyon
a thousand feet deep at the bottom of which moved
slow streams of men and machines a blended murmur
came up to the two tiny men dangling high up there on
a rope

  the policeman was poking downward toward ouentin
with his shock-rod other faces were looking down over
the edge of the roof tense and distorted jack shouted
from below some incoherent encouraging thing the
policeman slid down faster to catch quentin ouentin
jabbed viciously upwards with his shock-rod and felt it
touch the policeman went limp and seemed to float
out into space his blue body sprawled out and turned
over and over as it fell with deadly rapidity it grew
smaller and contracted to a dot far down in the gloom
below ouentin felt himself drawn into the window and
trembled as he sat down for an instant on the floor

  tack was dragging him toward a door he could see

the flag halliards tightening as another man started
down out in the corridor they found gongs ringing
and speakers bellowing but no people on all sides there
was a roar and clatter of machinery behind closed doors
they opened one and dashed into a huge room full of
big machines in rows steam sizzled and white linen
flashed by at the far end from every machine in a
long row came baskets piled high with clean laundry
and scudded along roller conveyors into openings in the
wall people were visible the baskets of laundry dis-
appearing into dark openings gave quentin an idea

  come on shouted quentin

  they ran across the room each seized one of the
baskets dumped the linen on the floor set the basket
back on the roller conveyor and got into it

  the darkness of the pit closed upon them machinery
clattered and steam hissed they bent low not knowing
what was above them they felt themselves sink rapid-
ly and again tipped level there were gears grinding as
they rounded corners there seemed no end of sinking
down and down in the blackness

  finally after a clatter of paper there came a burst of
light they saw clothes dumped out of baskets wrapped
in paper and shot into tubes all by machinery they
leaped out on the floor again there were no people
no bawling speakers no gongs only the open mouths
of pneumatic tubes an endless row of them each marked
with its destination quentin eagerly looked for brook-
lyn it took but a moment to find it

  all aboard for long island he shouted in glee

  as a wrapped package came down the conveyor to-
ward the brooklyn tube he rolled it off and they took its
place the lid popped shut on the tube nearly rupturing
their ear-drums and they were plunged in darkness
after the first rush and swirl and roar all was quiet for
minutes

  again there was a roar and a crash and a burst of day-
light the two fugitives jumped up and ran knocking
over several astonished people who were waiting for
packages their destination was an open door with day-
light beyond out there was a row of trucks with
laundry packages dropping into them from overhead
chutes they were automatic trucks such as are used
for making deliveries beyond the pneumatic-tube zone

  they leaped into the foremost truck quentin set
the switches on impulse for bay shore because that was
not where he wanted to go and they both rolled back
into the closed portion of the vehicle the truck started
slowly gathered momentum and automatically made its
way out of the city

  after fifteen minutes of eternity they looked out the
truck was moving swiftly along a country road twi-
light was gathering rapidly

  wed better jump out and let it go on quentin
suggested its clever and powerful

  what is asked jack the police department

  the machine the government machine in wash-
ington and its subsidiary portion in new york its a
big brain the police are dumb tools

  they waited for the truck to slow up around a curve
and jumped out they alighted on grass jack rolled
over and jumped up quentin found his breath gone
and his head dizzy he crawled unsteadily into the
shelter of some shrubbery in a few minutes a half-
dozen speed-cycles on the road and planes in the air
whizzed by in pursuit of the laundry car


amazing stories

   see how quickly it works quentin said

  its uncanny to hear you talk about it jack ex-
claimed its inhuman

   next it will be flares and spotlights quentin warned
quentin found walking difficult and felt a terrific
headache he must have gotten a crack on the head when
he fell out of the truck jack supported him and they
staggered on ten miles ahead was tl -r destination
his little country bungalow with its secret cellar this
was familiar terrain for quentin but ten miles cross-
country in the darkness was none the less difficult even
crossing a road would be dangerous as they stumbled
across field and through brush and timber quentin felt
himself growing weaker

  it was not long before the lights appeared ahead
of them to the right the country was lighted as bright
as day

  theyre headed wrong quentin chuckled as he
staggered desperately along were going to the left
at right angles to them

   quentin did not recollect the rest of the night very
clearly jacks strong shoulders were a comfort without
which he could not have gone a mile his head cleared
up now and then in flashes to answer jacks questions
and again he would relapse into a half-comatose state
in which he walked the guiding of the way depended
on him

  no rest from the machine went round and round
in his head on all sides of us thousands millions of
tentacles are squirming to close in on us day and night
soon my buzzing brain will give out then the machine
will reach out and pick us up the machine ought to be

destroyed-

   but that is treason leaped through his brain in a
sudden shock how do i dare even think such treason
because my head sings from the bump it got i suppose
but suppose jack thought that that would not be
treason and jack has physical courage to do things
even to destroy the machine it would be easy to do
just that one square building wreck that and the
government machine is dead jack would dare it if i
told him

  but i cant make myself tell him it is treason
even to think it is treason why cant he see it himself 

i keep giving him hints-

  jack kept continuously interrupting him with ques-
tions

  how can they make it so much like daylight over
there 

  quentin hoped in a dazed way that his explanation
of the thousand-foot flare circles that eliminated shadows
was correct then again he trudged on in his sleep till
he was roused by jacks

  how do we get across

  he came wide awake for a moment in front was a
twenty-foot wall

  the long island transformer depot well have
to go around to the left that was a bad crack on my
head ive got to rest

   jack had to lift him and drag him a few feet before
his legs got to swinging again then again came jacks
demand for a key

   got to move jack said the lights are starting
this way

   here we are quentin shouted as he came to again
he unlocked the door to the little bungalow they

found themselves in a small hallway from which steps
led down to the spacious underground shop

  jack gasped in amazement at it

  i understood you to say he exclaimed that you
did this secretly and alone why digging this cave
would take years of time

  quentin was nodding drowsily again

  power is cheap he said see there

  there was a heap of cartridge-like things

  i dug out this place with those screw a red one to a
blue one and drop them it is a slow explosion no
noise but in a few moments everything iron rock
everything is a loose fluffy powder i swept it out and
now ive got to sleep my head hurts

chapter iv

ouentin awoke to the humming of smooth
well-adjusted machinery bright sunlight shone
full upon him he lay and rested and was con-
scious of a headache there was a painful lump on
his occiput he studied the strange place about him

  finally he realized that it was the cabin of his own
secret plane he sat up down below was blue water
and to the left a beautiful acy shore and blue mountains
in front of him was jack peering ahead as jack heard
a stir behind him he sat up his face lighted up to see
quentin awake

  where are we quentin asked

  im no geographer jack said but it must be the
mediterranean

  see continued the boy we got away from em 
or from it as you say he grinned as though on a
schoolboy lark

  quentin shook his head gloomily

  were not out of it yet sooner or later it will get
us- anywhere on this earth my big hope is that i
might see martha first

  he sat sunk in gloomy thoughts jack grinned hap-
pily he seemed to be a creature that responded to the
happy stimuli of the present and forgot that there was
a future

  you need some breakfast sir he said then youll
feel better

  quentin ate and then lay down and slept again after
he awoke he spent many hours searching the sky around
him and the fleeting ground below it was acute tor-
ture to feel that every moment a swarm of planes would
swoop down on them every dot in the blue caused him
to peer intently and with beating heart and clutching
hands v iil it was passed by safely but it began to
look hopeful as they passed over asia minor and into
india without any sign of pursuit or interference he
permitted pleasant thoughts of martha to flow through
his mind

  above northern india he became alert eagerly he
watched the himalayas fall behind the machine needed
only an occasional touch for guidance a shout from
jack called his attention to the green levels of demo-
cratia slowly its woods and mountains separated them-
selves from the blue haze then they crossed its edge
they headed toward the capital

  quentins heart pounded he was now confident that
no matter what happened eventually he would see
martha first up to the present time he had been racked
with uncertainty her image rose up before his eyes
mechanocracy



and his veins tingled and his breath came short with an-
ticipation

  the radio of quentins plane could not tune in with
the inferior ones of democratia none of his messages
got through therefore no one awaited them at the
landing-field but after telephoning and driving in a
car they were eventually at the house of jacks father
and quentin and martha were in each others arms
and after that the four of them were gravely discuss-
ing the future

  there is no hope quentin said the government
considers that it owns the earth it has pronounced
sentence and nothing on earth can prevent its being car-
ried out

  how do you suppose they will do it asked quen-
tins host explosives

  hardly explosives considered quentin gas prob-
ably gas bombs from planes electric charges and
disease bacilli are possible but the one is unnecessarily
expensive and the other unnecessarily brutal the
government machine is inexorable but it will do noth-
ing unnecessary it is hard for you to realize the abso-
lutely perfect impersonal logic of the machine my
guess is gas some swift painless gas

  perhaps jack said they will shout us to death
with those shriekers they had on all their floors
now jack martha protested in tears she clung
to quentin but its just like you being silly even in
the face of death

  what i ought to do jack bantered swelling up his
biceps is to punch the face of death right in the nose
jack loved his sister and was doing his best to cheer her
lip in his clumsy way

  then they discussed whether or not an alarm ought to
be spread among the people of democratia quentins
host was in a responsible government position and had
authority to decide

  what would be the use quentin asked no de-
fense is possible no escape is possible there would
only be panic and riots and needless suffering it is most
merciful to let it come as a complete surprise

  well carry the burden then

  quentin and martha spent most of the day clinging
close together there was no sleep for them nor for her
father that night

  isnt it terrible martha exclaimed to see that
young animal jack sleep soundly in spite of all this
hasnt he any feelings  we may never see the morning
light again

  but morning dawned bright and clear upon the smiling
land it was torture to the three people who anxiously
scanned the sky jack went out to play golf and the
rest of the nation went about its business

  in the middle of the forenoon four planes appeared

	the southern sky shortly afterwards jack came in
much interested in them but showing no fear he was
certainly a primitive creature

  the planes came straight toward the city and the three
watchers prepared to die and bade goodbye to each other

and to jack who by this time had grown serious and
looked worried

  quentin was almost breathless when the planes set-
tled hesitatingly on the landing-field an emergency
car hurried him and his companion out there there
in a circle between the four planes were a dozen people
most of whom quentin recognized as prominent figures
in new york life but they looked pale and crushed
they looked about furtively and helplessly despair
showed in their attitudes and in their silence they
livened up a little when they saw quentin approaching
he looked at them in amazement and waited for them
to speak

 weve come to ask for help one of them said
will you help us

  again quentin could not find words

  the world is in chaos the man said disorder
starvation disease people are dying by millions
trampling exposure suicide-no one knows tvhat to
do

  what in the world has happened  quentin manged
to gasp

  an explosion the man answered the key parts
of the government machine are totally destroyed no
one knows how to repair it the world is disorganized

  quentin stared blankly

  we thought perhaps you hd done it the man con-
tinued we knew of your daring escape-

  quentin silently shook his head then he got a sud-
den idea

  jack he said sharply turning toward that young
man you rascal-

  jack sheepishly came out from behind his sister

  what do you know about this  quentin demanded

  well jack stammered you were so positive that
inhuman thing would catch us sooner or later-i didnt
want to take any chances it wanted to kill all of our
people and you were knocked out with a bump on your
head-

  the red and blue cartridges looked interesting i
tried a pair out on a couple of police cycles that were
snooping around outside the house it wiped them out

  so i rolled you into the plane blew the doors open
shoveled in the cartridges and headed for washington
i spent that trip screwing together as many as i could
then i spilled a couple of hatfuls on the government
building and waited only long enough to see the cor-
ners begin to crumple then i lit out straight up in
the air there were too many planes around-

  the rest was smothered in his sisters hug his father
had an arm about his shoulders quentin slapped him
on the back

  the spokesman again approached quentin

  will you and these people help us

  we will marthas father said

  well reorganize the world said quentin

  as a democracy jack added

  and you jack quentin said will do a whale of a
big share of the job we need guys like you

            chapter i
            a new puzzle

ood afternoon said the pleasant voice
of the telephone girl this is the pryor
merchandising bureau

  is mr pryor there if he is tell him
that detective lieutenant spangler is call-
ing him

  a moment later justin pryor known among his busi-
ness acquaintances as the master of mystery picked
up the receiver

  good afternoon lieutenant this is pryor talking
oh hello mr pryor i think i have a case for you
if you care to take it

  a case pryor questioned what sort of case
another murder case at least it looks like murder
-wholesale murder-five murders to be exact

  but my dear lieutenant you must be laboring under
a misapprehension im not a detective-or at least im
not a detective of crime im a business counsellor
crime is entirely out of my line

  maybe crime is out of your line mr pryor but for
an amateur you certainly did a good job of solving that
steele murder the system you use in your business
seems to work just as well in solving crimes and it hap-
pens that these particular crimes are right down your
alley

  just what do you mean by that if i may ask
these murders-if they are murders-must have
been committed by someone who knew a lot about
science whoever did it is altogether too clever for the
police and detective departments im not worried be-
cause it doesnt happen to come in my territory but if
i had the job of tracking the murderer id have to ad-
mit that i was licked before i even got started

   i see pryor responded sorry i cant help
 goodbye

 just a minute spangler yelled please dont hang
 up on me yet ive been told that youd rather work
 out a hard problem than eat or sleep isnt that right 
 i am rather fond of puzzles pryor admitted
 then youll get a kick out of this one to me it looks
 like the greatest puzzle in the history of crime

   you dont say so there was no mistaking the
 tense eagerness in pryors voice as he uttered these
 words tell me about it

   during the past month five men have died
   nothing unusual about that

    i know the unusual part of it is that they all died
 of sunstroke

   i thought you said they were murdered

   that was just a case of repeating somebody elses
 - opinion i know very little about it myself but there
 is a man in my office right now who seems to know a
 lot about it his name is james strickland the five
 men who were killed were close friends of his all of
 them including strickland got mixed up in a scandal
 some time ago and he thinks that the deaths of his five
 friends were brought about by some revengeful person
 connected with this scandal after what happened to
 his pals strickland doesnt feel so safe himself he has
 plenty of dough and he is willing to pay you a sub-
 stantial fee for handling the case

   from what you say strickland needs a body-guard
 more than he does a business counsellor pryor sug-
 gested

   he has a body-guard but gunmen cant very well
 protect him against sunstroke thats why he needs a
 scientist and i dont know of anyone who could do
 the job like you can strickland came to n e for advice
 i told him about you and he wants to meet you can
 i send him over to your office right now


with an ordinary hypodermic syringe  he
explained i inject a small quantity of the
solution into the blood stream of the mouse
   notice what happens when i place it
in the sunlight




amazing

stories

   oh i suppose so im dreadfully busy today but
 after all really good puzzles are rare you know
 from the instant strickland stepped into his office
 pryor took a violent dislike to him the man was
 coarse and heavy-set his breath reeked of liquor on
 his fat sensual countenance were engraved the hiero-
 glyphics which told to the student of physiognomy a
 story of vice and depravity

   so this is mr pryor the great scientist he said in
 a husky voice as he extended a flabby hand

   it reminded pryor of a jelly fish that hand and he
 dropped it with an ill-concealed shiver of disgust

   im not exactly a scientist pryor corrected him
 my work is in diagnosing and prescribing for sick
 businesses

   thats one thing i dont exactly savvy i see by the
 sign on your door that you call yourself a business coun-
 sellor what does that mean  is your job to tell a firm
 how to run the business

   not exactly usually my work concerns only some
 specific problem of manufacture or marketing

   i still dont get you

   perhaps an illustration will make it clear heres
 a typical case one of my clients manufactures an ant
 exterminator preparations of this sort must contain
 poisons which are deadly to human beings and pets
 most of them are sweet in taste there have been a
 number of cases of valuable dogs and even of children
 who have been killed by eating ant exterminators

   my client the marvel company got around this
 objection by making their exterminator in the form of
 gelatin this is packed in small sealed tin cans the
 user simply punches four holes near the top of the can
 with a nail through which the ants can crawl to get
 the sweetened poisoned gelatin since the cans are
 sealed and the contents cannot be poured or shaken
 through the small holes there is no danger of children
 or animals eating it

   sure i know about that dope strickland assured
 him ive used it myself but where do you come in
 on this racket

   i was called in when they began to have trouble
 repeated tests showed that the preparation retained its
 efficacy indefinitely in some localities while in other
 places the ants refused to go near the cans the marvel
 people were at their wits ends to explain this mystery
 and meanwhile they lost a lot of business dealers who
 had been boosters when the product was first introduced
 refused to restock it and it looked as though the com-
 pany would have to go out of business as a last re-
 course they called me in

   and what did you do about it

   i secured one of the cans which had been shunned
 by the ants opened it with a can opener and made a
 microscopic examination of its contents i discovered
 that a tiny mold had formed over the surface of the
 gelatin it was indiscernible to the naked human eye
 but amply sufficient to make the material unpalatable
 to the ants all i had to do then was to discover a pre-
 servative that would prevent the formation of that mold
 on the gelatin and the problem was solved the marvel
 people were glad to pay me several thousand dollars for
 my services

   that was pretty soft for you mr pryor strick-
  land said and speaking of fees how much will you
 charge me to handle this case of mine

im not so sure i want to handle it pryor told him
is that so strickland snarled well let me tell
you something mr business counsellor if you know
whats good for you youll take my case whether you
feel like it or not get me

  i cant say that i do get you said pryor calmly
and if you will pardon my saying so i dont exactly
like your attitude and now since i happen to be very
busy i trust that you will excuse me

  he stepped to the door opened it and stood there wait-
ing for the other man to depart

             chapter ii
             a sordid story

strickland made no effort to leave his seat but
his face lost its hateful threatening lines and as-
sumed what he meant to be an expression of
friendly good nature pryors eyes saw only a fatuous
egotistical leer

  aw dont get sore mr pryor the visitor whined
i was only fooling i didnt mean no offense this
thing has got my goat cant help being jumpy and
quick on the trigger according to what spangler said
you are about the only man in california that can help
me i need help bad i do wont you please listen to
me 

  as long as you keep that attitude i shall be glad to
listen to you pryor said graciously but i must ask
you to be brief i am extremely busy and i cannot
promise to take your case unless-

  unless what strickland demanded if its
money-

  financial remuneration is the least consideration for
me the business counsellor interrupted him there
is only one thing that might induce me to handle your
work

  and what is that

  if as lieutenant spangler hinted this case is a real
puzzle-one that is supremely difficult to solve-i may
consider handling it

  with eyebrows arching stricklands face assumed a
ludicrous expression of amazement youre a kind of
a puzzle yourself mr pryor he remarked here
you have a chance to make a lot of jack and you want
to spend your time working conundrums and you call
yourself a business man

  but you seem to forget that you are asking me to do
something that is outside my regular business with
me investigating crime is not a vocation but a recre-
ation if i cant enjoy it i intend to keep scrupulously
away from it suppose you tell me your story as con-
cisely as possible it wont take me long to decide
whether i wish to investigate it further

  o k mr pryor i may as well tell you that i am a
saloon keeper

  a saloon keeper pryor doubted i suppose you
mean that you operate a speakeasy

  saloon is the right word for it my business is
strictly legal and legitimate you see it is located in
elsonado just across the border in old mexico

that will give you a line on the whole works of
course you remember the whipple case the news-
papers were full with it about a year and a half ago
i have only a very dim recollection of the story
seven sunstrokes



 you see i very seldom read news articles about crimes
 the headlines are about all i have time for please
 enlighten me

   whipple was a typical tourist came to california
 from iowa brought his daughter along she was
 supposed to be seventeen i think that was a lie myself
 to me she looked old enough to vote

   you saw her then 

   sure i did she was hanging around my saloon for
 nearly an hour didnt drink anything but soda pop
 though funny aint it about these eastern tourists
 back in iowa they wouldnt think of going near a place
 where folks was drinking liquor they wouldnt even
 play penny ante for money but when they come out
 here on a vacation they get a big kick out of going
 into a real saloon putting their feet on the brass rail
 and risking their quarters in the slot machines

   thats understandable pryor interposed and
 what happened to the whipple girl 

 she got separated from her old man some say she
 ditched him on purpose others claim that somebody
 put knock-out drops in her soda pop take your choice
 what is your version of the incident mr strick-
 land

   i dont pretend to know nothing about it im just
 telling you what the papers said whipple hunted his
 daughter ruth all over elsonado he didnt find her
 until two days later you can easily imagine what she
 looked like and the story she told the old man

   yes pryor agreed that i can easily imagine
 and after that

   whipple took ruth to los angeles he was either
 screvvey or else he had a funny twist in his make-up
 you remember what he done dont you he rented an
 apartment next day they found whipple and his
 daughter dead in the room with the gas turned on
 from the position of the bodies it looked like the girl
 knew what was going to happen and lay down on the bed
 of her own free will a note was found signed by
 whipple it said that he couldnt stand the disgrace
 and that he had decided to end it all thats what started
 the big buzz in the newspapers

   i see and by big buzz i suppose you mean that
 there was an investigation

   ill say there was an investigation a couple of guys
 that had it in for me squealed to the reporters they
 claimed that i engineered the whole rotten mess two
 guys that worked for me and three that were connected
 with a joint three blocks away from my place were
 accused of doing all the dirty work the newspapers
 sure made the most of it they tried to get the police
 of elsonado to pinch us but the bulls knew better than
 to do that then the story went out that i had the police
 fixed finally somebody brought pressure to bear
 through washington and the six of us was indicted we
 was tried but the jury acquitted us in short order of
 course

 as i remember it pryor interposed the acquittal
 was due partly to the fact that the leading witness for
 the prosecution failed to appear at the trial a few
 weeks later the reason for his absence was made clear
 his body was found out in the desert riddled with
 bullets how do you account for that

you seem to know something about the whipple
case after all strickland grinned

 about that part of it yes it is incidents like that

 which interest me most no doubt you can explain why
 this witness was killed

 i dont know nothing about it personally if thats
 what you are driving at he just got what often hap-
 pens to a guy that dont know enough to keep his mouth
 shut

 i see and after the trial and acquittal-what hap-
 pened then

 nothing happened for several nionhs then torrez
 was killed

 torrez he was the proprietor of that other estab-
 lishment you referred to was he not

 yep he ran the dive where the whipple girl
 finally landed

 how was he killed

 the coroner said he died by sunstroke but i hap-
 pen to know that he was poisoned

 what makes you think that

 because every one of the guys that was mixed tip in
 the case except me died the same way

 of sunstroke you mean

 of what the coroner called sunstroke

 but isnt it possible that they all did die of sun-
 stroke 

 maybe it is possible but it sure looked phoney to
 me ill leave it to you youve been in california for
 several years havent you

 twelve years to be exact

 all right and during those twelve years how many
 times have you heard about anybody dying in california
 of sunstroke

 now that you mention it i cant remember a single
 case of sunstroke that resulted fatally

 neither could anybody else-until four of these birds
 was killed in a row-one right after the other and the
 funny part of it was that on the days they died the sun
 wasnt especially strong either doesnt that sound
 fishy to you

 it does look like a mystery i understood you to say
 that these five men were all closely associated with each
 other that suggests a contagion of some sort perhaps
 it was some rare disease which was not understood by
 the coroners who officiated at the inquest and which
 was transmitted from one of these men to the others
 i thought of that too but it dont hold water
 you see it happens that excepting for one guy named
 marvido the others wasnt within a hundred miles of
 torres or of each other for at least two months before
 they died on the other hand there was hundreds of
 other people who came in close contact with these men
 every day and none of them died of sunstroke or any-
 thing else how would you explain that

 im not trying to explain anything yet im merely
 seeking information pryor told him

 well i guess you got most of the dope now any-
 thing else you want to know

 i suppose i may as well ask a few conventional
 questions-the kind a professional detective would ask
 under the circumstances

 o k shoot 

 assuming that these five men were poisoned have
 you any reason to suspect any particular individual of
 administering the poison

 i dont quite get you

 let me put it this way do you know of anyone who
 would be impelled to avenge the death of the whipples


amazing stories

  i guess there were thousands of people that were
sore about it

  naturally almost any upright person would be
righteously indignant under the circumstances but it
is hard to believe that such a person would go to the
extent of committing murder unless he happened to be a
relative or close friend of the wronged girl murder
is a pretty risky business do you know of anyone who
would be likely to take that risk 

  damned if i do so far as i know the whipples
didnt have any relatives or close friends in california
i see and about the localities of these five deaths-
did they all happen in the same place

  no they happened in five different places torrez
died on the beach at coronado marvido dropped dead
in elsonado muller was at long beach when he got
his smith went to frisco a few months after the trial
and mendez was killed some place in texas

  how do you know they all died of sunstroke
after what happened to torrez and marvido i
thought things looked kind of fishy so i took the trouble
to keep tabs on the other three

  i see and i presume that -your interest in this
case is due to the fact that these five men were all
friends of yours

  hell no except for torrez they were just a bunch
of bums two of them worked for me smith was a
bartender and mendez cleaned out the spittoons and did
all the other dirty work around the saloon

  nevertheless you are willing to spend money in the
hope of apprehending the person whom you think re-
sponsible for their deaths

  i dont give a damn about them if thats what you
mean all im interested in is myself if this is a
frame-up as i think it is i may be the next one to be
put on the spot what i want to do is beat the killer to
the draw im depending on you to nab this bird before
he has a chance to get me understand

  perfectly

  o k glad thats settled now how much dough
do you want in advance  strickland took out his check
book unscrewed the cap of his fountain pen and waited
for pryor to name a retainer fee

  never mind the money question now mr strick-
land pryor told him i wont be able to start on your
case for several days anyway im right in the midst of
a problem now and i make it a rule never to start on a
new puzzle until i have solved the one on hand

  the hell you say strickland swore dont you
realize that this is a matter of life and death while
were waiting for you to work out your riddles this
guy may croak me

  if you follow my instructions i dont think you need
to fear anything of that sort the history of crime in-
dicates that after a criminal has succeeded in accom-
plishing his purpose once he almost invariably uses
identically the same method in carrying out subsequent
crimes scotland yard has built up a complete sys-
tem of crime detection based on this well-established
principle they call it the m o system which is
an abbreviation for modus operandi from what you
have told me there can be little doubt that if this sup-
posed murderer attempts to do away with you he will
use sunlight as his chief weapon it ought to be pos-
sible for you to protect yourself by avoiding the direct
rays of the sun i suggest that you wear black gloves

on your hands and that you shade your face and neck
with a broad brimmed hat under no circumstances
must you expose any part of your skin to direct sun-

  sure that sounds like good advice i believe ill
do it and when will you be able to start work trailing

  thats hard to say it all depends on the progress
i make on my present task it may be a few hours

that i shall find the solution within the next few days
as soon as that happens i shall get in touch with you
please leave your phone number with my secretary as
you pass out

chapter iii
an ominous warning

on the following morning pryors office saw him
not he was out visiting garages talking to
service station attendants and interviewing car
owners in an endeavor to ascertain the reasons why the
sale of a certain brand of automobile polish had fallen
off at a rate that had seriously alarmed its manufac-
turers

  when at about four-thirty in the afternoon he fi-
nally made his appearance his secretary miss field
greeted him with mr strickland has been trying to
get you all day when i told him i didnt expect you in
until late he became quite frantic he asked me to be
sure and have you phone him the moment you arrived
shall i call him now

  no the master of mystery said bluntly he has
no business to take up my time now i made it clear to
him that i would not start on his case until i have fin-
ished the crystalac investigation

  he said hed call again if he does what shall i
tell him

  oh i suppose i may as well talk to him

  ten minutes later the phone rang and miss field
notified her employer that mr strickland was on the
line

  good afternoon mr strickland pryor greeted him
what can i do for you

  i must see you at once mr pryor can you come
out to my house right away

  im afraid that will be impossible as i told you
yesterday-

  never mind what you told me yesterday something
has happened-something that scared the pants off me
wont you please help me  even over the phone the
note of terror in his voice was plainly noticeable

sorry mr strickland but i am under contract with
one of my regular clients i have definitely promised-
to hell with your promise cant you understand
that my life is in danger dont that mean nothing to
you 

  pryor wanted to tell him that it didnt mean a thing
but he relented and answered why of course but
cant you tell me over the phone what happened 

  i dont like to im scared somebody will hear me
and i dont want my daughter to worry but if you
cant come out let me tell you this much i got a letter
today do you understand-a letter that was mailed
yesterday from mexico the elsonado postmark is on
the envelope
seven sunstrokes



  you opened it of course

  sure i opened it thats why im scared it was a
letter and it proves that there aint no bunk about
those five other guys getting murdered

  were they mentioned in the letter

  not by name cant you come out this evening and
give it the once over

  im afraid not i suggest that you get in touch with
lieutenant spangler or somebody in the police depart-
ment if the letter threatens you it is a matter for the
police i think you understand do you not that i am
neither a police officer nor a detective

but aint you going to do something about it
not until i am ready to see the whole matter through
to the finish why dont you call the lieutenant i
am sure he will be glad to help you in a matter of this
sort he can help you far more than i can

  all right all right i guess youre not worried
over what happens to me

  to be brutally frank i dont see why i should worry
about you mr strickland as i told you before i shall
let you know when i am ready goodbye and he
hung up the phone

  half an hour later when he was just about to leave
his office the telephone rang again this time it was
spangler

  excuse me for calling you mr pryor the detective
began but this strickland case looks mighty serious
i understand that he told you all about the letter he
received

  not all about it i am very busy i have made a
contract with one of my clients which requires me to de-
vote all my attention to his problem until i have solved
it this i tried to explain to strickland but he refused
to listen i advised him to get in touch with you ap-
parently he took my suggestion for my part i am not
interested at present and for that reason i did not ask
for any details concerning this letter

  ive seen it spangler told him it virtually amounts
to a threat against stricklands life

  you dont say

  i sure do want me to read it to you 

  please do

  this is the message which spangler read over the
phone

   my dear mr strickland

   you are number six as you undoubtedly know
  the other five have already been executed for their
  crimes for cogent reasons you have been saved
  until last you are also being accorded privileges
  which none of the others received-you are being
  warned in advance to prepare for death by the
  time you receive this it will be too late for you or
  anyone else to do anything to save you right now
  you are in the death cell awaiting the hour of your
  execution which is not far distant remorse or re-
  pentance could hardly be expected of a man like you
  but if you have anything important to accomplish
  before you die you had better do it at once

                              the avenger

  when he had finished reading spangler remarked
thats what the letter says what do you make of
it

  would you mind reading the third sentence again
  glad to here it is for cogent reasons- 

  thats all i wanted to hear pryor interrupted
that seems to corroborate my theory

   what is your theory 

   that the person behind this plot must be well edu-
cated that would seem to be verified by the use of the
word cogent which is rather unusual in the ordinary
vocabulary

   ill say it is unusual what in the dickens does it
mean anyway

  the meaning of the word doesnt matter the fact
that the word was used at all is the significant consider-
ation

   ill take your word for it and what would you ad-
vise us to do next

   the answer to that is obvious as you of course know
lieutenant find the author of that letter and you will
probably find the murderer that is unless the letter
is only the work of a crank

   doesnt look like that to me spangler assured him
ive seen lots of crank letters but this one is alto-
gether different its too damn serious and the man
who wrote it seems to know more than any crank would
be likely to know

   in that case it will undoubtedly be advisable to find
out who wrote the letter that is a matter which you and
your assistants can take care of as well as anybody i
know

  thanks for the grapefruit mr pryor but in this
case im afraid im running into a lot of grief the
letter was postmarked elsonado it was mailed 
december  there were thousands of visitors in
elsonado that day so it would be like hunting for a
needle in a haystack to try to find out who mailed that
letter it looks like a blind if the man who wrote it
really intends to carry out his threat he must be in los
angeles right now

  how about the paper and envelope pryor asked
any possibility of tracing them

   the envelope is very ordinary-the kind that can be
bought at any stationery store the paper is odd
though so is the way the message is printed on it
in what way is the paper odd

   its like a blue print only the lettering isnt white
its a greenish blue almost as dark as the paper itself i
can just barely read it

   from what you say it looks like it is a blue print-
probably one that hasnt been fixed if thats the case
it will soon fade out have you had a photostat made
of it

   not yet but im going to have that done right away
do you know any way i can stop the letters from fading
out 

   if it is an ordinary blue print all you need to do is
to soak it for half an hour in running water i wouldnt
advise you to do that though it looks as if the man
who sent the letter planned it very carefully so that the
evidence would be destroyed if thats the case the
likelihood is that he has thought of the common methods
of handling paper like that and has provided for all
probable contingencies

   thats what im afraid of myself gosh mr pryor

i wish you would sit in here with me

   id like to very much but im afraid that will be
impossible until after i have finished the task on which
i am now working nevertheless if you wish me to
make a suggestion i can tell you in a few words what i


amazing

stories

would do under the circumstances as i understand them
  i wish you would do that mr pryor

   very well then suppose you cut off a corner of the
paper containing a few letters of the message that do
not affect the meaning of the message as a whole soak
that piece in water and see what happens in the mean-
time i would keep the remainder of the sheet thor-
oughly covered with something that is impervious to
light and id arrange to have it photographed as soon
as possible if you find that the water treatment works
all right with the small fragment you will still be able
to use the same process on the rest of the message
that sounds like good advice ill try it all the
same i wish you could take an active hand in this case
sorry to bother you when youre so busy but as soon
as you are at liberty give me a buzz will you

   ill be glad to goodbye

chapter iv
murder number six

for two more days pryor labored assiduously at
the automobile polish investigation as was the
case with every problem he had ever tackled suc-
cess crowned his efforts with an overwhelming weight
of evidence he proved that the substantial decrease in
the demand for crystalac was due to an unpleasant odor
which the product acquired after it had been exposed
to the air for some time numerous experiments had
shown that the smell had no effect on the polishing
properties of the product but it was sufficient to make it
undesirable to a large number of users who were other-
wise very well satisfied with it

   pryor solved the problem with characteristic speed and
simplicity he recommended adding to the formula an
ingredient having an agreeable odor powerful enough to
cover up the unpleasant smell a hundred samples
of the altered product distributed to men and women
of various types demonstrated that it was entirely
acceptable to the public in its new form this work
he completed on the afternoon of december  the fol-
lowing day being a holiday he waited until the morning
of january  and then true to his promise he in-
structed his girl to call stricklands telephone number
there was a considerable delay before she signaled her
employer to lift his phone

  good morning mr strickland was pryors greet-
ing

   this is not mr strickland the voice at the other
end of the line said this is his butler speaking mr
strickland is not able to come to the telephone

  a strange premonition prompted pryor to say has
anything happened to mr strickland-anything serious
i mean

  yes sir something has happened to him some-
thing serious something egregiously serious

   dont tell me he is- he stopped with his sentence
hanging in midair when he heard as if in the distance
an excited voice say give me that phone

   a moment later this second voice was talking direct-
ly into the transmitter who is this talking

   this is justin pryor

  oh hello mr pryor

  your voice sounds like lieutenant spanglers
  youre a good guesser spangler it is and now see

if you can guess why i happened to be here when you
called up

  i dont need to guess pryor informed him you
are there to investigate the death of james strickland
how the devil did you know that the butler didnt
tell you did he

  no he merely told me that mr strickland was
unable to come to the phone

  then how did you know he was dead

  it was what you would call a hunch-nothing more
i assure you i suppose it is necessary for me to ask you
what was the cause of his death he died of sunstroke
of course

  sunstroke spangler exclaimed say youre not
trying to kid me are you

  certainly not why 

  strickland was found dead in his own bathroom early
this morning now how in the devil could a man die
of sunstroke inside of a house in california on the
second of january when it is cold and foggy outside
theres a puzzle for you to answer mr pryor

  that does sound like a poser doesnt it neverthe-
less i shall be very much surprised if it doesnt trans-
pire that the circumstances attending his death were
identical with those of a person who has had a sunstroke
what do the medical people say about it

  darn little stricklands daughter called in a doctor
magnus who seems to be the family physician strick-
land was dead before he arrived and magnus admitted
that the cause of his death puzzled him when i told
magnus about the threat that had been made against
stricklands life he asked to be excused you under-
stand dont you-he passed the buck to the coroner
and what was the coroners verdict 

  hasnt arrived yet expect him any minute and
say mr pryor wont you please come over here and
give this place the once over how are you fixed for
time now

  stillup to your ears in auto polish

  i finished that assignment the day before yesterday
from now on my time is yours if you need me my
purpose in phoning just now was to inform mr strick-
land that i was ready to start working on his case too
bad i was too late to help him

  youre too late to help strickland all right poor
devil he sure was scared ive seen a lot o fright-
ened people in my day but he was the worst of the
whole bunch whoever did this certainly made a good
job of punishing him

  do you think strickland deserved what he got
pryor asked

  i guess he had it coming to him all right i wasnt
especially interested in stricklands troubles before the
other jobs were all done outside my jurisdiction but
strickland died in los angeles if it wasnt for that
letter it might have passed off as an accident or death
from natural causes but that message makes it look like
murder that means its up to me to get busy frankly
im up against it this scientific stuff gets my goat i
hate to admit it but it looks like im licked even before
i get started that is unless you are willing to help me
what do you say mr pryor

  will you give me a hand will you sit in on this
game with me

  will i pryor answered just try to keep-me out
of it
seven sunstrokes



chapter v
where and how it happened

half an hour later pryors car was crawling up
one of those steep winding roads which carve
fantastic patterns in hills north of hollywood
stricklands home was what a los angeles realtor
would call a hillside estate so near perpendicular was
the lot that even a mountain goat would have found it
difficult to climb from one end of it to the other the
house itself was a charming example of the hillside type
of architecture which is so popular in certain parts of
california it had a number of intriguing wings and ells
and towers with windows on five different levels be-
ing familiar with dwellings of this character pryor
knew that the living room would be on the top floor
level with the street at the upper end of the lot

  in response to pryors ring the door was opened by
a maid almost immediately he was greeted by lieu-
tenant spangler

  come in mr pryor he called over the servants
shoulder im sure glad to see you

  has the coroner arrived yet was pryors first
question

  yes got here just a few minutes ago hes ex-
amining the body now

  good how long do you think it will take him to
bring in an opinion

  thats hard to say maybe a few minutes-maybe
a long time it all depends on how things look to him
he may want to question the servants and the members
of the family in which case it may take several hours
i see and in the meantime suppose you tell me
how it happened

  mrs strickland found the body at about nine-thirty
this morning she and her husband occupy separate
chambers which are connected by a bathroom and are on
a lower floor she told me that strickland has been
drinking a great deal lately i wasnt at all surprised
to hear that of course he has always been a heavy
drinker on account of the extra worry hes been
through lately he has probably been hitting the booze
harder than ever according to mrs stricklands story
she heard him enter the bathroom a few minutes before
nine oclock she spoke to him through the door tell-
ing him she would wait for him in the breakfast room
just before leaving her room she heard him turn on the
water of the shower

  when he failed to show up after a reasonable time
she returned to see what was detaining him on enter-
ing the bathroom she found her husbands body lying
senseless on the floor when she screamed for help
her daughter clara and the butler jackson heard her
and came running down the stairs they carried strick-
land into his room and laid him on the bed clara phoned
for doctor magnus i arrived on the scene just a few
minutes after he did by that time strickland was
dead as i told you over the phone doctor magnus
passed the buck to the coroner

  how did it happen that you arrived at such an oppor-
tune moment 

  i came in answer to a phone call from strickland
from strickland pryor exclaimed you mean
you talked to him just a few minutes before he died 
no i didnt talk to him his butler jackson phoned

me and told me that strickland wanted me to come here
as quickly as i could

  what time was that

  about nine oclock

  you have questioned the butler of course

  not yet

  have you any idea why strickland sent for you
no spangler replied perhaps it had something
to do with that note of warning he received last fri-
day

  that reminds me what happened to the note  did
you follow my suggestion

  ill say i did-for all the good it did me your
hunch was right all right whoever sent that note was
clever-altogether too damned clever

  by that i suppose you mean that the evidence has
been destroyed

  ill say it has i tore off a corner of the sheet as
you suggested and soaked it in water what do you sup-
pose happened to it

  dont tell me that the paper dissolved in the water
not exactly it turned black just as if it had been
burned by a slow fire when i took it out of the water
it fell to pieces how do you account for that

  dont ask me im no chemist what happened to
the rest of the letter

  i kept it covered up like you told me to and hustled
it to a photographer he had to put it under a strong
light to focus his camera on it by the time he was
ready to shoot it the printing had faded and our evi-
dence was gone

  you retained a copy of the wording of course

  no i didnt since i expected to get a photograph
of it i didnt think that was necessary

  it really doesnt matter fortunately you dictated
it to me in case you wish an exact copy of the wording
of it i can give it to you any time

  you mean you can remember the whole thing word -
for word 

  why certainly thats easy i have memorized
passages ten times as long as that by hearing or reading
them only once

  youll have to show me spangler doubted

  very well then here is the message as you read it
to me over the phone and pryor repeated it verbatim

  thats what it said all right was spanglers veri-
fication you sure have a wonderful memory

  nothing wonderful about it any one can train
his memory its like learning to play a musical instru-
ment all it requires is practice and by the way i
dont suppose jou have had a chance to check up the
statements made in that mysterious message

  what do you mean

im referring to the fourth sentence which said you
are being accorded a privilege which none of the others
received-you are being warned in advance to prepare
for death do you know whether or not that is true 
i dont get your drift yet

  then here goes another snow storm have you been
able to ascertain whether or not any of the other five
victims of sunstroke were warned in advance of their
impending fates

  no i havent had time to check on that statement
frankly i dont see the use of doing anything of the
sort thats what the letter itself said why should i
doubt the truth of it


amazing stories

  i see no reason for doubting it myself the sur-
prising thing is that a man as clever as this criminal
seems to be would commit such a serious blunder as to
send a message to any of his victims if it hadnt been
for this letter everybody would have thought that strick-
land died a natural death and there wouldnt have been
any investigation why do you suppose this murderer
of ours supposedly a crafty brainy man of science
made such a stupid error as that

  thats easy enough to understand knowing that
strickland was the ringleader of the bunch he pur-
posely saved him until last to make his vengeance
complete he planned to torture his victim before he
killed him fear was his strongest weapon by men-
tioning the fate of the other live he made strickland be-
lieve every word of that message he probably figured
that because of his success in carrying out his plot he
could afford to take chances especially when he pro-
tected himself by making sure that the evidence would
be destroyed before it could be used to catch him

  your explanation seems plausible pryor agreed
nevertheless that scrap of paper devilishly ingenious
as it is will be the death warrant of the man who
originated it

  that sounds like you feel pretty confident that you
are going to catch the man who did this

  i not only feel confident-i feel almost certain that
the murderer has already betrayed himself ill admit
that it is the wildest kind of a hunch but i am also
ready to name the culprit right now

  the hell you can who do you think did it 
jackson the butler if i were you i would detain
him or at least keep a close watch on him

  nonsense why you dont know a thing about him
what in the world put that idea into your head 
wasnt it jackson who answered the phone when i
called this morning just before i talked to you

  it probably was jackson what of it

  while he was talking to me over the phone he used
an unusual word it was egregiously

  whats that got to do with it

  just this a word like that doesnt belong in a but-
lers vocabulary but it is the sort of word that might
be used casually by a well-educated man-for instance
by a scientist who had decided to commit a series of
murders remember what i said about the other word
cogent

  im afraid that evidence is mighty thin mr pryor
you cant expect me to arrest a man for murder just
because he uses a hifaluting word

  certainly not i didnt mean for you to charge him
with murder-at least not until we can collect some real
evidence against him my only reason for mentioning
the matter now is so that you can prevent him from
making what you call a getaway

  personally i think you are barking up the wrong
tree but even if you are right youre a hell of a de-
tective to spring anything like this before you even get
started dont you know that a detective is supposed
to keep everybody in suspense hes supposed to hold
back the name of the criminal until the very last thing
after everybody else has been suspected

  my dear lieutenant pryor smiled as i have told
you repeatedly i am not a detective i am a business
counsellor as i analyze this case the real problem is
not who committed the crime

 spangler started to dispute this but pryor went on
 please dont misunderstand me i realize of course
 that we must discover the identity of the murderer but
 our first job is to find out why the crime was committed
 and how it was committed unless i am very much
 mistaken the answers to those two questions will also in-
 clude the name of the person who did it do i make
 myself clear

 i suppose so but- he hesitated and pryor con-
 tinued 

 i dont suppose you have any objection to my in-
 terrogating jackson

 certainly not interrogate him all you want to ill
 call him

 he rang the bell a few moments later a stout red-
 uced man in butlers livery entered and greeted him with
 the conventional did you ring sir

 you are jackson i suppose spangler said

 no sir

 then who in the devil are you 

 im hathaway sir-mr stricklands butler if you
 please sir

 stricklands butler how many butlers are there in
 this house anyway

 only one sir

 how about jackson isnt he the butler

 he was sir but only temporarily

 only temporarily what do you mean by that
 he relieved me for two weeks so that i could take a

 vacation you see i havent had a vacation for-

 never mind that what happened to jackson  where
 is he now

 i dont know sir

 you dont know the detective roared

 no sir you see he left shortly after i arrived to
 relieve him he didnt say where he was going

             chapter vi
             the chase

when spangler heard the news of jacksons de-
parture he swore eloquently emphatically and
excitedly it didnt take him long to get over hrs
chagrin however

 looks as if your hunch was good after all mr
 pryor he said in a nervous tone i guess theres noth-
 ing for me to do now but try to catch that baby i
 wonder how in the devil he got out anyway ive had
 my eye on that door ever since i got here

 he left by way of the garage hathaway volun-
 teered theres a spiral stairway leading down to the
 level of the road below this one sir

 did he have a car of his own

 no sir that is i dont think so

 do you suppose he could have helped himself to one
 of stricklands cars

 i dont think so the chauffeur is usually there
 when he is not out with one of the cars

o k now you listen to me hathaway i want
you to stay here until i get back ill be gone just a
minute

 spangler went out on the patio and called to the
 driver of the police car in which he had made the trip
 from his office to the strickland residence

 drive down to the next street below this he com-
seven sunstrokes



 manded ill meet you at the door of the garage be-
 longing to this house

  returning to the living room he said will you be
good enough to stay here until i get back mr pryor
i dont expect to be gone long please see to it that
nobody leaves by this door ill attend to guarding the
other doors then to the butler here hathaway
show me the way to the garage will you

  for several minutes pryor sat there and fidgeted he
was the kind of man who had to be eternally busy at
something and this inactivity irked him for want of
something else to do he sat down at the grand piano and
began to play with his foot on the soft pedal so
absorbed was he in trying to recall an elusive strain
from liebestraum that he did not hear the whirr of
the elevator and the click of the door behind him he
was therefore somewhat startled when a rich contralto
voice said almost in his ear oh i beg your pardon
he turned and found himself looking into a pair of
unusually large clear blue eyes there was a tragic
mistiness about those eyes that inspired sympathy as
well as admiration the wavy blond hair the rose petal
complexion and the well-proportioned figure of the girl
who stood before him seemed to harmonize perfectly
with those eyes

 pryor stammered an apology i hope you dont
think i am intruding here my name is justin pryor
lieutenant spangler asked me to assist him

  i understand thats perfectly all right i am clara
strickland

  james stricklands daughter i presume

  she nodded

  im very sorry this bereavement has come to you
miss strickland i hope my playing has not disturbed
you or your mother

  not at all you play beautifully-so beautifully that
i couldnt resist coming to find out who was doing it
im afraid i dont deserve that but how about your
mother

  she is resting quietly now thank you naturally this
has been a great shock to both of us but fortunately we
have been trained to bear up under sorrow wront you
go on with your playing

  if you dont mind id rather talk with you sud-
denly realizing that this remark might be construed as
undue familiarity he hastened to add i would like to
ask you a few questions

  questions she echoed what sort of questions
i dont suppose you know that your father had a
premonition that he was going to die and that he en-
gaged me to help him

  no mr pryor i did not know that father never
did confide any of his affairs to me he always tried to
shield me from anything that might cause me concern
nevertheless i couldnt help noticing that father seemed
to be worrying a great deal during the past few weeks
he was worried pryor corroborated her he
feared that someone was plotting to kill him

  are you sure of that she asked anxiously
  absolutely

  and did father tell you whom he suspected of plot-
ting against him

  he didnt have the slightest idea thats why he
engaged me im supposed to be a sort of solver of
puzzles you know unfortunately i was not able to
start on the case until this morning-after it was too late

to help him i cannot tell you how sorry i am now
i appreciate your attitude mr pryor but surely

you dont believe that my father was-was-

   please dont say it pryor pleaded the question
is still an open one possibly your fathers fears were
groundless and it was just a coincidence that he hap-
pened to succumb this morning

   i hope so for mothers sake

   i can readily appreciate your feelings pryor said
sympathetically but under the circumstances -im
afraid it is going to be necessary for us to make at least
a superficial investigation it may expedite matters if
you will help me clear up one or two important matters
do you mind

   not at all i shall be glad to help you in any way
i can

   thank you my first questions may sound a bit per-
sonal but they are really of a routine nature-the kind
of questions that are always asked in a case of this
sort from what you have already told me i infer that
your father and mother got along well together

   oh yes indeed mother didnt approve of fathers
-er-business activities of course but she never voiced
any objections to him personally

  i see your father seems to have been well-to-do
i presume all his property will go to you and your
mother

   i suppose so but father really owned very little
this home our cars and most of our other property were
bought with mothers money she inherited a sub-
stantial legacy from her grandfather

  i see is there anyone you know of who would de-
rive any benefit from your fathers death

  absolutely no one that is no one whom i know
about she amended

  did your father have any enemies i mean outside
of the persons who denounced him because of his sup-
posed participation in the whipple episode

  not that i know of

  thank you so much for routine queries now
i am going to ask you a very pertinent question what
do you know about jackson the butler who took hath-
aways place

   i know very little about him except that he seemed
to be extremely anxious to please us

   do you know how he happened to be selected to take
hathaways place

  oh yes it was through hathaway himself he
made a very reasonable request for a leave of absence
so he could spend christmas and the week following
with his relatives he recommended jackson as a com-
petent substitute

  i see i presume that jackson had access to your
fathers bedroom-i mean during times when mr
strickland was either absent or asleep

  why of course father never would have a per-
sonal valet jackson was frequently called upon to help
him to undress when he was-when he wasnt feeling
well

you said a moment ago that your father has been
worried under the circumstances it is perhaps only
natural that he may have used liquor more than usual
yes he drank a great deal possibly that had
something to do with his untimely death

  undoubtedly and was it after he had been drink-
ing that jackson was called upon to help undress him


amazing stories

yes that happened nearly every night during the
past week

 did he do his drinking at home or somewhere else
 at home i dont believe he left the house during
 the past three days

 i see about how old is jackson

 close to fifty i would judge

 will you please describe him to me

 he is of medium build-somewhat stocky i would
 say that he weighs about one hundred and forty pounds
 and is about five feet six inches tall he is quite active
 although he is stoop-shouldered his eyes are pale blue
 for a man of his age his hair is unusually thick it is
 light brown streaked with grey it extends down on his
 face for some distance

 do you mean he has a beard

 i suppose you would call it that his beard is the
 kind that english butlers are supposed to wear-side-
 boards i believe they are called

 i see does jackson wear glasses

 no his eyesight seems to be good without the aid
 of glasses

 did you notice anything peculiar about him

 in what way

 does he seem to be a typical servant i mean in
 his speech and conduct

 his manners are excellent if thats what you mean
 how about his vocabulary i can easily tell that
 you are very well educated yourself hasnt it impressed
 you that jacksons vocabulary is that of a scholar rather
 than a servant

 now that you mention it i believe he does give the
 impression that he is a man of learning but thats not
 at all surprising during times like these there are lots
 of oxford graduates who are glad to take positions as
 servants in order to make both ends meet

 quite true thats about all i need to know for the
 present thank you very much

 you are welcome mr pryor but surely you do
 not suspect jackson of doing anything wrong if you
 do i am certain you have made a mistake he is such
 a sweet kind-hearted man i am sure he could never
 harm anyone

 at that moment the front door opened and spangler
 came rushing in

 oh excuse me he said when he saw the girl
 you have met miss strickland have you not lieu-
 tenant spangler pryor assumed

 sure i have how are you miss strickland sorry
 we have to bother you like this

 thats quite all right she answered graciously
 mr pryor and i had an interesting conversation

 i took the liberty of asking miss strickland a few
 routine questions pryor explained

 will you excuse me now the girl asked i think
 id better see how mother is

 do so by all means pryor urged her as he escorted
 lifer to the elevator

chapter vii
the coroners report

 when the rectangle of light on the translucent
 door had shrunk to a mere thread pryor turned
 and inquired did you catch your man lieu-
 tenant 

  no such luck spangler growled he made
a clean getaway ive got the dragnet out but now that
he is loose its like fishing for one particular sardine in
the whole pacific ocean did you find out anything
from the girl

  nothing very significant but what i did learn
seemed to corroborate my theory and he gave the de-
tective an account of his interview with miss strickland

  in the middle of the narrative the latch of the elevator
clicked and out stepped a stout bald-headed man who
was carrying a small leather case

  oh hello doc spangler greeted him shake
hands with mr pryor to the business counsellor he
announced this is doctor sheldon the coroner

  how do you do doctor sheldon pryor said
have you satisfied yourself as to the cause of mr
stricklands death

  oh yes yes indeed it looks very much like a
case of cerebral hemorrhage

  do you mean that you think mr strickland died a
natural death-that he was not murdered

it doesnt look like murder to me there are no
marks on the body to indicate any act of violence
isnt it possible that his death was caused by poison 
possible but not probable the only way to make
sure of that is by analyzing the viscera and i have made
arrangements for having that done at once but im
willing to gamble on it that the tests will all be negative
no doubt they will pryor agreed but what
about sunstroke wasnt the condition of the body the
same as would have been the case if mr strickland had
died from sunstroke

  sunstroke say are you trying to ridicule me
of course not doctor i realize that it sounds like
nonsense to suggest that a man could die of sunstroke in
his bathroom on a january morning but there is method
in my seeming madness nevertheless perhaps i ought
to explain that mr strickland received a threatening
letter a few days ago and the author of the note hinted
that he had caused the death of five other men all of
whom had died of sunstroke

  im afraid thats too deep for me but i can as-
sure you positively that stricklands death was not
caused by sunstroke heat exhaustion or anything like
it

  and when do you expect to have the chemists re-
port 

  unless he runs into unexpected difficulties it ought
to be ready by tomorrow afternoon

  thank you and by the way doctor i suppose you
took a look at the place where mr stricklands body
was found

  sure i did he was found in the bathroom noth-
ing to arouse suspicion there i can assure you

  how about the light in the bathroom didnt you
notice anything peculiar about that

  nothing except that it was slml turned on i switched
it off myself	

  and are you sure that the lamp bulb was not an un-
usual one for instance isnt it possible that it was a
special kind of lamp-the kind that emits ultra-violet
rays 

  of course not the kind of light you have in mind
would require a special fixture

  why is that

  because it operates on a low voltage-about ten or
seven sunstrokes



twelve volts the lamp has to have a transformer to
cut down the line voltage

 and how about the globe itself ive seen pictures
of those therapeutic light globes to me they looked
just like any ordinary globe

 they may look the same in a picture but they are
altogether different in reality the kind of lamp you
have in mind has both a filament and a carbon arc it
also has some mercury inside the globe when the
juice is turned on the mercury vaporizes and thats
what produces the ultra-violet rays

  i see and you are sure that the globe in mr strick-
lands bathroom contained no mercury

  im not exactly prepared to swear to it the coroner
hedged if there is any doubt about it we can easily
find out right now suppose we have another look at
that bathroom

  entering the elevator the three men descended to the
floor on which stricklands room was located spangler
who was the tallest of the trio stood on the edge of
the bathtub and was just able to reach the globe he un-
screwed it and handed it to doctor sheldon

  you see the coroner cried triumphantly it is an
ordinary light globe-just as i said it was he handed
the lamp to pryor who examined it carefully and had to
admit that there was nothing unusual about it never-
theless while the other two were leaving the bathroom
pryor slipped the bulb into his coat pocket

 are there any other matters you would like to have
cleared up sheldon asked as they reentered the liv-
ing room

 not that i can think of right now thank you
very much for the help you have already given me
when the coroner had left spangler remarked this
electric light business is all greek to me what did
you have in mind when you asked doc about the globe
in the bathroom 

 only this you doubtless know that direct sunlight
contains certain rays that are not included in ordinary
artificial light among these are included the ultra-
violet rays they are supposed to have powerful actinic
effects for instance there is reason to believe that
sunburn of the human skin is caused by the ultra-violet
radiations

 whats that got to do with stricklands death
just one of those hunches of mine thats all it
occurred to me that since the death of the other five
men was associated with exposure to direct sunlight
stricklands death might have been caused by some sub-
stitute for sunlight as for instance one of those ultra-
violet ray lamps that doctor sheldon told us about

t see what youre driving at now but im afraid
a youre barking up the wrong tree this time
maybe so pryor laughed good naturedly some-
times we have to bark up a lot of trees before we find
the one in which our quarry is hiding

 true enough and where do we start barking now
my suggestion is that we find out all we can about
the circumstances surrounding the death of those other
five men

  i should worry about them the detective objected
you understand dont you that im not interested in
any murders that were committed outside my territory
the only one i am concerned about is strickland im
directly and definitely responsible for investigating his

death but i have nothing to do with the other five
that i realize fully lieutenant but dont you un-
derstand that unless we are familiar with what hap-
pened to the others we may overlook some important
point in connection with stricklands murder further-
more if we can prove that the same man was associated
with each of the other five prior to their deaths we will
be able to weave a net of evidence around him from
which even the cleverest of criminals could not escape
now i get you what do you want me to do
suppose you communicate with the authorities in
the places where each of these five men died no doubt
you have connections that will enable you to obtain the
desired information including a full account of the cir-
cumstances surrounding their deaths if it is possible
i think we should also try to obtain descriptions of any
new friends servants or associates whom these men
came in contact with immediately prior to the dates when
they had their fatal attacks of sunstroke perhaps it
might be a good idea to ascertain whether or not the
victims had anything to do with a man answering jack-
sons description and by the way how about a picture
of our suspect do you suppose we could get hold of
a good likeness of him

  im afraid not folks like the stricklands are not in
the habit of exchanging portraits with their butlers
and we dont know a thing about jacksons family
perhaps hathaway knows something about him
pryor suggested

  thats a good hunch lets find out spangler rang
and a few minutes later hathaway made his appear-
ance

  what do you know about this man jackson  the de-
tective demanded

  very little sir you see i met him by accident
you met him by accident spangler roared what
do you mean by that

  it happened about three weeks ago sir-on one of
my evenings off i decided to attend a cinema on hol-
lywood boulevard the play was very interesting sir
it was about a gentleman who masqueraded as a butler

the name of it was-

  never mind the name of the show spangler in-
terrupted him what i want to know is how did you
meet 

  there was a line waiting for the nine oclock show
the man standing next to me made a chance remark
and we started a conversation like myself he was
alone he seemed to be such an agreeable chap that i
suggested that we sit together during the show after
the show he invited me to have a cup of coffee and a
sandwich with him he told me that he was a butler
and seemed greatly surprised when i informed him that
my occupation was the same as his it was then that he
made the proposal to me

  what proposal spangler wanted to know

  the proposal to take my place so that i could go on
a vacation over new years he told me that he had
not been employed for some time but that he had saved
enough money so he had no reason to worry on the
other hand he seemed to be afraid that he would get out
of practice if he didnt keep his hand in for that
reason he was willing to do my work without compen-
sation

  so thats how it happened is it the detective in-
terposed let me get this straight you meet this


amazing

stories

man at a picture show he buys you a sandwich and
proposes to you to let him take your place he agrees
to work for nothing so you can take a vacation with
full pay-is that correct 

  yes sir

  and without knowing anything more about this man
you recommended him to your employers and permitted
him to be brought into their home as a trusted servant 
but mrs strickland was perfectly satisfied with the
arrangement sir jackson came here three days before
i left and worked with me so that he was thoroughly
familiar with my duties

  im not thinking about how he made good on the
job what seems queer to me is that you and mrs
strickland should place so much confidence in a perfect
stranger

  it is true that in one sense he was a stranger to me
hathaway tried to defend himself but he was such a
nice honest-looking man that i had no hesitation about
recommending him i hope he hasnt stolen anything
i guess he didnt steal anything spangler growled
but he may have done something a lot worse

  what do you mean by that if you please sir
never mind what i mean what does this man
jackson look like

  hathaways description of the substitute butler coin-
cided with the one which miss strickland had given
pryor except that the servant estimated jacksons age
to be fifty-five and his weight to be one hundred and
fifty pounds he referred to jacksons hair as sandy
and his eyes as dark blue

  jotting the details down in his notebook spangler
said i dont suppose there is any use of my asking you
if you know where he came from or where his folks
live

  im afraid not sir he never mentioned those mat-
ters to me in fact he very seldom spoke about himself
i can easily understand that spangler said in a
tone intended to be sarcastic that will be all

  when the butler had left the room pryor remarked
by the way theres one more angle of this case that
ought to be worth investigating and that is the ante-
cedents of the whipples assuming that jackson or
someone else shouldered the task not to mention the
serious risk of avenging the death of ruth whipple and
her father it is only reasonable to assume that lie must
have had a closer interest than merely the desire to see
justice done do you suppose you could find out if the
whipples had a relative or close friend who is now liv-
ing in california

  ill see what i can do spangler promised maybe
a letter to the police in whipples home town will sup-
ply the desired information

chapter viii

poisonous light

from the strickland home pryor drove to the
barlow medical library on north broadway in
response to pryors request for information con-
cerning sunstroke the librarian who was a woman
asked are you a doctor

  pryor answered in the negative

  im sorry she said but this library is exclusively
for the use of doctors

  nevertheless thanks to training as an advertising man
pryor finally sold her the idea of permitting him to
use some of the books in the library

  he learned that the medical term for what is com-
monly known as sunstroke is heat exhaustion those
suffering from heat exhaustion are usually found un-
conscious with temperatures well above  degrees one
of the books informed him

  for an hour or so he ploughed through a tangled
wilderness of technical verbiage which seemed to draw
him further and further from his goal then suddenly
he burst into a clearing in the form of this significant
sentence heat exhaustion is sometimes diagnosed as
cerebral hemorrhage or apoplexy

  thanking the librarian profusely he hurried out of
the building and pointed the radiator cap of his car
toward the los angeles public library browsing
around among the books on physics and chemistry did
not yield a single blade of pertinent information then
he tried the readers handbook and was rewarded by
discovering a significant article in the  volume of
the journal of the chemical society

  it was a report presented to the british association
for the advancement of science describing a series of
experiments which had been performed by professor
e c c baly and i m heilbrom by passing a cur-
rent of carbon dioxide through water exposed to ultra-
violet light these two scientists had produced formal-
dehyde the same effect was also obtained with ordinary
light when malachite green was used as a catalyzer

  this would have meant little to an ordinary layman
but pryor knew enough about chemistry to realize that
this experiment represented the first step toward the
fulfilment of the scientists fondest dreams-that of
creating living beings from inorganic materials man
had at last succeeded in performing a creative process
which had previously been regarded as a monopoly of
nature he had constructed an organic substance out of
materials that were exclusively inorganic any green
leaf can accomplish this feat of magic but hitherto it
had baffled human ingenuity

  formaldehyde has the simplest possible formula for
a carbohydrate it is ch plant physiologists be-
lieve that when a growing leaf is exposed to the sunlight
the carbon dioxide gas c in the air is reduced to
carbon monoxide co which uniting with the hydro-
gen of the water h in the cell forms formaldehyde
choo in the leaf of the plant this molecule multi-
plies itself by six and turns into a sweet solid glucose
cho or with the loss of water into starch
qho

  reflecting on the experiments of baly and heilbrom
a scientist would naturally ask if man can artificially
build an organic compound using only inorganic mate-
rials what is to prevent him from creating life itself
in a test-tube

  but that wasnt the question that popped into pryors
mind after all he was not a professional chemist he
was a solver of puzzles to him the most significant
consideration was this using innocuous materials and
energy that abound everywhere namely water carbon
dioxide and light two scientists had produced an
acrid smelling gas called formaldehyde and known to be
a deadly poison

  like a bloodhound that has just caught a fresh scent
pryor searched eagerly for more information concern-
seven sunstrokes



ing the use of light in the artificial production of formal-
dehyde and similar compounds in a book called bio-
chemistry by dr benjamin moore he found this sig-
nificant passage such simple substances as formalde-
hyde formic acid oxalic acid and hydrogen peroxide are
all poisonous to the highly organized and labile colloids
of the bioplasm and probably on account of that prop-
erty which makes them essential in the first stages of
evolution-namely their high reactivity and the ease with
which they take part in additional reactions of organic
substances for this reason they must undergo change
in any living cell while still at high dilution or else they
so interlock into the labile system of organic colloids
within the cell as to clog all metabolic change hence
it is that energy of light which is essential to healthy
growth and the upbuilding of organic material from in-
organic supplied in a wrong fashion may reverse these
delicate processes and cause death and degeneration of
living substances

  though pryor had the feeling that he was getting
warm he knew that he had not yet found the key that
would unlock the door of his puzzle-case so he con-
tinued his search late in the afternoon he stumbled
across a book that was so small and insignificant look-
ing that it might easily have escaped his notice this
gave him exactly what he had been hunting for-the
name of a substance which was not a poison but which
when introduced into the human system in the presence
of sunlight or its equivalent would produce physiological
effects similar to those caused by sunstroke

  this treatise told of experiments made by dr fritz
schanz of germany who had observed some remark-
able transformations effected by haemato-prophyrin an
iron-free disintegration product of the blood pigment
hemoglobin

  in a dilution of one to eighty thousand it is capable
of killing cultures of paramaecia in the light of a cloudy
winter day dr schanz was quoted as saying it is
also capable in the presence of light of dissolving the
red blood corpuscles of the most various kinds of ani-
mals

  in the dark however this substance has no effect
according to the article it is active only in the pres-
ence of light the reason for this is not as might be
supposed that light converts the haemato-porphyrin into
a poison on the contrary solutions of this substance
can be exposed to the light for a long period without be-
coming a bit more poisonous than when kept in the dark

  by making use of this substance the warm blooded
animals can be rendered sensitive to light in the highest
degree if small quantities of it are injected into white
mice the animals show no signs of injury as long as they
are not exposed to the light but hausmann found that
even the diffused daylight of an early spring day in
vienna was sufficient to produce death in mice which
had previously been injected with a solution of this sub-
stance neither the haemato-porphyrin alone nor the
light alone even in great intensity is capable of injuring
the animals the injury is caused by the combined ef-
fects of the two the acutest form of this malady pro-
duces a deep narcosis in the animal within a few min-
utes after which death rapidly ensues hausmann gave
this condition the name of lightstroke and he is of the
opinion that a great many cases of sunstroke are con-
nected with similar processes of sensitivization

  feeling well repaid for his afternoon of study pryor

returned to his home and spent a pleasant evening solving
cross-word puzzles

chapter ix

more light on the subject

at nine oclock the following morning pryor in-
structed his secretary to call up the local plant
of a world-famous manufacturer of electrical
equipment

  i understand that you have an electric lamp that pro-
duces ultra-violet rays he began the telephone conver-
sation

  we have several such devices the man at the other
end of the line told him

  is it true that all lamps of this sort require special
equipment 

  all those intended for human beings do they oper-
ate on low voltage you understand but the equipment
we sell includes a transformer it is built right into
the unit you can plug it into any outlet in your home
i see but how about the globes themselves can
they be screwed into an ordinary light socket 

  hardly you wouldnt get the right voltage if you
did that

  the bulbs used with this equipment look different
from ordinary light globes do they not 

  yes indeed they are altogether different

  i see and isnt there such a thing as a lamp that
can be screwed into an ordinary light socket that will
give off ultra violet rays

  there is such a thing but we dont recommend them
for human beings it is a new product of ours designed
especially for use in poultry raising we call them cx
lamps

  how do they differ from ordinary light bulbs-in ap-
pearance i mean

  except for the glass which is made of quartz the
cx lamps are very much like our regular light globes-
in fact it would be impossible to tell them apart just
by looking at them

  couldnt an expert tell them apart

  not without testing the light

  and how is that done please

  by means of an ultra-violet ray indicator

is there any place where i could see one of these
lamps and also one of those ultra-violet ray indicators 
certainly if you will go to our store on east sec-
ond street a salesman there will be glad to show them to
you

  acting on this suggestion pryor visited the store on
east second street he took with him the light bulb
which he had filched from stricklands bathroom an
accommodating salesman showed him one of the cx
lamps it looked exactly like an incandescent light globe
such as are used for house lighting in response to
pryors query regarding the ultra-violet ray indicator the
salesman showed him a small object which resembled
a jewelers magnifying glass such as a watchmaker
inserts in his eye-socket when he examines the internal
workings of a watch it was about two and one-half
inches long at one end was a glass eyepiece about
three-sixteenths of an inch in diameter the opposite
end was partly covered by a strip of purple colored glass

  following the salesmans instructions pryor held the
indicator up to his eye and pointed it at several different


amazing stories

sources of light including the front window of the store
and a light globe in a ceiling fixture which was turned on
i dont see anything unusual he announced

  youre not supposed to see anything unusual unless
ultra-violet rays come through the indicator

  but daylight includes ultra-violet rays doesnt it
not after it passes through that window ordinary
glass cuts off the ultra-violet rays only quartz glass
will permit them to pass through this globe is made of
quartz glass ill screw it into this socket and turn on
the juice now take a look

  pryor squinted through the indicator and was sur-
prised to see the letters u v r appear as if by magic

  now i see something he declared it looks like
the letters u v r

  thats what you are supposed to see when the light
you are looking at contains ultra-violet rays the sales-
man informed him

  is there any other way of distinguishing between
these cx lamps and ordinary electric bulbs

  not that i know of

  thank you and now i wonder if you will permit
me to test this lamp which i brought with me

  why certainly the man inserted the lamp from
stricklands home in a socket and switched on the cur-
rent

  when pryor directed the violet ray indicator on it
the letters u v r showed up as before

  does that prove positively that this lamp is one of
your cx lamps pryor asked

  not necessarily all it proves is that the light given
by the lamp contains ultra-violet rays however i
think it is reasonably certain that this is one of our
lamps i dont know of any other light globes of this
sort that will give an ultra-violet ray

  you keep a record of all your sales of these lamps
do you not

  oh yes indeed you see this lamp is still in an ex-
perimental stage we ask all those who buy them to let
us know what results they get from using the lamps

  i see is there any way you could trace the pur-
chaser of this particular lamp

  hardly the lamps are not numbered they all
look alike i dont see how we could be expected to
identify any individual one of them

  could a lamp like this be purchased anywhere else
in los angeles except here

  not that i know of

  i wonder if you could tell me whether you have sold
one of these cx lamps to a man named jackson
our records would probably answer that question
but your request is rather an unusual one would you
mind telling me your reason for wanting to know this
why yes of course im a special investigator for
the los angeles homicide squad i have reason to be-
lieve that this light had something to do with the death of
a man do you understand

  oh yes in that case we shall be glad to cooperate
with you

  but the name jackson did not appear in the list -of
persons who had purchased cx lamps neither could
any of the salesmen remember serving a customer an-
swering jacksons description

  have any of these lamps been purchased by the
science departments of universities pryor asked
practically all the universities in southern california

have been supplied with one or more cx lamps apiece
the salesman replied we furnished them free to those
who agreed to experiment with them and give us re-
ports of the results

  they went to the chemistry departments i suppose
in a few cases most of them were sent to the heads
of the physics departments

chapter x
what the autopsy showed

realizing that he was only a few blocks away
from spanglers office pryor left his car in a
parking station and walked to police head-
quarters he was fortunate enough to find the detective
in

  oh hello mr pryor spangler greeted him what
do you know without waiting for an answer to this
trite and banal question he went on hope you havent
wasted any time on that strickland case

  i have been working on it ever since i saw you last
pryor told him but i havent wasted my time by any
means on the contrary i feel that i have made very
satisfactory progress toward the solution of the mys-
tery

  yes but in this case there doesnt happen to be
any mystery

  what do you mean

  i just got the coroners report he still sticks to his
original verdict strickland died of cerebral hemor-
rhage there isnt any doubt about that according to
doctor sheldon not the slightest trace of poison was
found in the viscera

  i didnt expect there would be nevertheless i have
strong reasons for believing that stricklands death was
caused by the action of ultra-violet light on a solution
which had been previously injected into his blood bv a
person with murderous intent

  what in the world put that idea into your head
pryor told him what he had learned about haemato-
porphyrin and about the nature of the lamp which had
been removed from stricklands bathroom

  thats all very interesting spangler condescended
but i dont see that it proves anything about strick-
lands death

  wrhat more proof do you want pryor snapped
how else would you account for the presence of a very
unusual kind of ultra-violet ray lamp in stricklands
home 

  it might have gotten mixed up with the regular lamps
at the factory you said yourself that it looks like an
ordinary light bulb

  thats true but it is hardly conceivable that a con-
cern like the american electric company could permit
a special experimental lamp such as this one to become
mixed with ordinary light globes

  all right suppose we say that the lamp must have
been put there on purpose what of it

  it is logical that whoever put it there intended that
it should produce a lethal effect on strickland after a
solution of haemato-porphyrin had been injected into
his blood

  and you think jackson did that

  i certainly do

  but how could a butler get away with anything like
seven sunstrokes

that strickland certainly would not permit him to in-
ject a drug into his blood

  not if he knew about it of course jackson prob-
ably did it while strickland was heavily intoxicated he
has had plenty of opportunities to do that

  and do you think he used the same system on tor-
res muller and the other three

  with variations all five of them were chronic
drinkers jackson could easily have become acquainted
with them by buying drinks for them it would not have
been difficult for a man of his skill to inject the drug
into their arms while they were drunk and unconscious
in their cases of course it was not necessary to use
ultra-violet ray lamps they all died while they were
bathing out of doors during the summer months
thats right but as i said before stricklands
death is the only one i need to worry about if jack-
son injected a drug into his blood he must have left the
mark of the hypodermic syringe somewhere on his body
it ought to be easy enough to get a check on that let
me see if i can get doctor sheldon on the phone
when the girl at the switchboard had made the de-
sired connection spangler picked up the telephone and
said hello doc about that strickland case did
you notice any marks on his arms or legs that looked like
they might have been made by a hypodermic needle 

  why didnt you tell me about that before

  was there more than one mark

  then that doesnt look like he was using dope regu-
larly does it

  thanks doc so long

  before spangler had time to hang up the receiver
pryor fired an eager question at him what did doctor
sheldon say there was only one needle mark on his
body wasnt there

  yes it was on his upper left arm right in the mid-
dle of his vaccination mark sheldon said he might
easily have overlooked it because of its location

  what did he say when you asked him why he had not
mentioned it to you before

  he said he didnt think it was important since the
chemist had made thorough tests for morphine and other
poisonous drugs and had obtained negative results for
all of them

  naturally haemato-porphyrin itself is not a poison
even if it was it is doubtful if the chemist who made
the tests would know how to detect its presence i
imagine its use is not very well known except by those
who specialize in biochemistry under the circum-
stances doesnt it seem possible that my theory is cor-
rect 

  maybe it is the detective conceded but the whole
idea sounds awful fishy to me to be frank with you
id rather accept the coroners verdict that he died of
cerebral hemorrhage then with a grin he added it
will make things a lot easier for me

  i dont think you really mean that lieutenant
pryor smiled nobody who knows you well would ever
accuse you of shirking your duty

  there are plenty of guys who would like to have a
chance to accuse me of doing that little thing spangler
remarked but in this case i dont feel justified in

spending any more of the taxpayers money on what
looks like a wild goose chase so i guess we may as
well drop the case right now

  but surely lieutenant you are not going to quit
now pryor pleaded it seems to me that in spite of
the short time we have been working on the case we have
already made remarkable progress

  oh you dont need to worry about your money mr
pryor just figure out what your expenses and charges
have been to date and ill see to it that a voucher is sent
to you

  im not thinking of my own remuneration pryor
said in an injured tone unless i succeed in solving
this problem i dont expect to receive a penny and
whatever you decide to do on your own account i intend
to keep everlastingly at it until the solution is com-
pleted

  if you do that im afraid it will have to be at your
own expense

  very well then i will go ahead at my own ex-
pense concerning the work i have already done i
would like to make a bargain with you yesterday
morning i asked you to communicate with the authori-
ties in long beach san diego san francisco texas
and iowa in an endeavor to obtain certain important in-
formation i presume that you with your usual effi-
ciency have taken care of all these matters

  sure i have but i was just about to send out a
flock of wires canceling my previous requests

  you havent sent them yet i hope

  there hasnt been time

  then will you do me this favor let matters rest
until you receive answers to your original wires when
they come in please turn them over to me will you
do that

  sure i will but im afraid they wont help you any
ive already received an answer from san diego here
it is

  he handed a telegram to pryor who read the follow-
ing message

 have questioned several relatives
and friends of torrez and marvido
stop nobody remembers seeing them
with man answering description of
jackson stop coroner sticks to origi-
nal verdict

  as pryor handed back the yellow slip spangler said
triumphantly you see doesnt that prove that you
are on the wrong track

  it doesnt prove anything pryor insisted except
that most people are woefully lacking in powers of ob-
servation

  and do you still want me to hold back those can-
cellation wires

  if you please

  and how about the dragnet i threw out to catch
jackson want me to keep that working

  it can do no harm but to be frank with you
lieutenant i havent much confidence in the efficiency
of what you facetiously call your dragnet

  spangler laughed good naturedly guess you scored
a clean hit on that one mr pryor is there anything
else i can do to help

  no thank you but perhaps i ought to tell you this


amazing stories

now that i am working on my own i shall not feel
obligated to turn the murderer over to the authorities
unless i consider it the right thing to do

  i think i can safely leave that to you spangler con-
sented and incidentally ill have to hand it to you for
guts-even though i think you are a bum business man
what makes you say that

  because you are wasting your time and spending
your own dough without any chance of gaining profit
you mean financial profit of course but you must
remember that there are other kinds of rewards besides
financial ones to me the thrill i derive from working
out a complicated puzzle or solving a problem that looks
insoluble is worth a great deal more than money i
have never yet failed to complete successfully any of the
tasks i have undertaken i rap on wood when i say this
but i dont intend that the strickland case shall mar an
otherwise unblemished record

  i suppose you have planned what you are going to
do next

  oh yes my plans are well formulated fortunate-
ly my list of suspects is bound to be small

  your list of suspects spangler questioned i
thought you had already dccided that there was only
one suspect

  you mean i presume the man who called himself
jackson pryor rejoined i still believe that he is the
man i am seeking but his name isnt jackson now
furthermore i doubt very much if the descriptions miss
strickland and hathaway gave us will help except in
a very general way

  what do you mean by that

  i mean that while he was masquerading he probably
changed his appearance as well as his name if we had
several photographs of him we might be able to recognize
him in spite of these changes but im afraid that the
verbal descriptions will be useful only as a means of
eliminating those who differ from him radically in such
fundamental matters as height weight and color of
eyes

  then how do you expect to identify him when you
run into him

  i will induce him to talk a murderer will always
betray himself when he talks unguardedly about events
connected with his crimes

  but where are you going to look for him 

  among the men who possess the scientific training
requisite for committing those six murders

  then you think it was done by a scientist do you
  there is no doubt of it in my mind

  isnt it possible that an ordinary crook could be a
scientist too-at least enough of a scientist to pull a job
like this and get away with it

  hardly the criminal mind and the scientific mind
are as far apart as the stars to be a real scientist a
man must have a fervent passion for truth-and that
by the way is one of the clearest indications of morality
the true scientist is glad to sacrifice his own material
benefit his pleasures-his very life if need be-for
the sake of adding one page or even a single sentence
to the worlds store of knowledge

  a confirmed criminal on the other hand has no re-
gard for the truth he is selfish and self-seeking he
is unwilling to make sacrifices or to work hard he
follows the path of crime because he thinks it is the
easiest way furthermore the pursuit of science re-

quires more than average intelligence and i cant con-
ceive of a really intelligent person becoming a profes-
sional criminal

  that sounds swell spangler interposed but it
seems to me you are kind of inconsistent a while ago
you said you were sure that six murders were committed
by a scientist and now you as much as say that no scien-
tist could possibly become a criminal

   professional criminal is the term i used pryor
corrected him it is my belief that the murderer in this
case had never before committed a crime and he will
probably never commit another one he must have had
some personal interest in the whipple girl-an interest
that was strong enough to induce him to avenge her
after what he considered a miscarriage of justice
maybe youre right spangler conceded any-
way i wish you the best of luck

  thanks lieutenant said pryor as he reached for
his hat perhaps i shall need all the luck you can wish
me

chapter xi
a significant experiment

pryors next visit was to the chemistry labor-
atories of a well known california university
after a great deal of confused wandering up and
down the halls of the science building he finally located
an instructor and asked him where he could obtain some
information concerning biochemistry he was told that
all the chemistry professors would be busy with their
classes until three oclock and was advised to return then
this pryor decided to do in the interim he went to
the university library and became so absorbed in a book
on cryptograms that it was nearly four before he came
to himsel f and returned to the science building where he
finally located doctor oto bauer professor of organic
chemistry

  i am looking for information concerning the effect
of ultra-violet light on chemical compounds pryor
began

  just what do you desire to know  professor bauer
asked

  im looking for a very unusual substance intro-
duced into the blood stream of an animal this drug makes
it extremely sensitive to light the compound itself is
not poisonous you understand neither does it become
poisonous when exposed to the sunlight but if a dilute
solution of the material is injected into the blood of an
animal the creature will die as soon as it is exposed to
the sunlight or to ultra-violet rays produced artificially
do you know of any such substance

  your question is a very singular one the professor
stalled i wouldnt want to answer it positively with-
out time for reflection offhand however i dont seem
to recollect ever hearing of a chemical compound such as
you describe

  perhaps the name of this substance will help pryor
prompted it is called haemato-porphyrin

  im sorry but even the name is not familiar to me
bauer admitted it must be a very unusual reagent
from the sound of it i would infer that it has something
to do with blood lets see if i can find it in the chem-
ical dictionary

  he picked up a large volume and thumbed through it
seven sunstrokes



  here it is he cried haemato-porphyrin an iron-
free disintegration product of haemoglobin

  is that all the book sayj about it

  that is all there is nothing here about its effect on
animals cr of its relation to ultra-violet rays

  and you say there is nothing that would produce an
effect juch as i have described

nothing that i know of you understand of course
that the chemistry of the blood is a very specialized
study that doesnt happen to be one of my specialties
do you know of anyone who is a specialist in this
branch of chemistry

  why yes i know of at least a score

  are any of them living in california

  several of them let me see there is winthrop and
cummings and-

  just a moment professor pryor interrupted him
would you mind dictating the names to me slowly so
i can take them down id also appreciate it if you will
tell me where i can find these men

when the list was completed it contained eight names
by means of a simple question addressed to professor
bauer pryor eliminated two names thus reducing the
number to six the question was do you know
whether any of these men are unusually tall

  i havent met all of them personally the professor
informed him but i do know that cummings is over
six feet tall and upton must be five feet ten inches
since jackson had been described as short and stocky
pryor felt safe in eliminating cummings and upton
from his tentative list of suspects by phoning to the
various universities with which these men were con-
nected he was able to remove two more from the list
they were names of men who had brown eyes this
left four men all of whom were specialists in biochem-
istry and all of whom were of about the same general
appearance as jackson

  the first of the quartette whom pryor interviewed
was professor william e woodbury he certainly did
not look like a man who could commit murder his jolly
clear-skinned face seemed to say emphatically and con-
vincingly i am honest you can trust me implicitly
in his pale blue eyes pryor a keen student of human
physiognomy could read nothing but uprightness and
wholesome good humor though his weight and build
tallied approximately with those of jackson he was
not nearly so old as the butler was supposed to be those
who had known jackson had placed his age between
fifty and fifty-five but woodbury didnt look any older
than thirty-five and he couldnt possibly have been more
than forty

  nevertheless woodbury proved to be very valuable
to pryor for he furnished him with the name of an addi-
tional suspect-a man who probably knew more about
the action of light on chemical substances than any other
chemist in he west but who for some unknown reason
had been left off the list which professor bauer had
furnished to pryor the name of this man was pro-
fessor hermann wilson

  if you wish to find out about haemato-porphyrin
and the effect which it has when injected into the blood
of animals you have come to the right place woodbury
told pryor last year the head of our department
doctor hermann wilson performed a very interesting
series of experiments on white mice unfortunately he
is not here now

 you mean he is absent for today only

 he has been on leave of absence for several monthjf
 you see this is his sabbatical year

 if thats the case i suppose he went abroad to study
 no in fact he has been spending most of his time in
 southern california every once in a while he pops in
 on us locks himself up in his private laboratory for a
 week or two and then disappears as suddenly as he
 came

 when was the last time you saw him if i may ask
 about a month ago he is iable to bob up almost
 any time now

 what sort of looking man is professor wilson
 pryor asked bluntly

 about my build like me he also has blue eyes and
 sand-colored hair

 is he as tall as you are

 not quite about an inch shorter i would say
 and you are about five feet eight inches tall are
 you not

 hardly that much five feet seven would come
 closer to it

 your colleague is an older man i presume

 not so very old hes only fifty-one

 and you are about thirty-five

 more than that thirty-eight to be exact

 thank you i hope you do not think i am too in-
 quisitive

 not at all

 are you familiar with professor wilsons experi-
 ments pryor inquired

 oh yes i helped him with some of them but i
 finally had to beg off

 and why was that if i may ask

 i hate to tell you woodbury grinned sheepishly
 the fact of the matter is that i am altogether too
 squeamish to be a good biologist inorganic chemistry
 is more in my line you see i cant stand seeing helpless
 little animals suffer

 i can readily understand that pryor assured him
 how about professor wilson from what you say i
 dont imagine he has any compunctions against inflicting
 pain on animals in the interests of science

 oh you mustnt think he is cruel or anything like
 that hes just a good scientist thats all he takes the
 attitude that the end justifies the means

 would you mind describing the experiments which
 you saw professor wilson perform

 why certainly but just a minute that sounded
 like doctor wilsons step woodbury darted to the
 door threw it open and called down the corridor doc-
 tor wilson would you mind coming into my office
 a moment later pryor was being introduced to the
 eminent chemist professor wilsons countenance was
 grim and forbidding it looked like the face of a man
 who had met with a fearful tragedy and had become
 soured against the entire world the coolness of his
 demeanor which bordered on rudeness was in marked
 contrast with the friendly courteous good nature of
 professor woodbury

 mr pryor is interested in your experiments with
 haemato-porphyrin woodbury explained

 is that so turning to pryor he demanded what
 are you doing here why do you want to know about
 my experiments who are you anyway

 driven by necessity pryor did some quick thinking


amazing stories

and some glib lying i am a veterinarian he fibbed i
was engaged by a man who operates a large poultry
ranch several of his thoroughbred roosters have died
mysteriously from the circumstances surrounding
their deaths it looks as if sunlight had something to do
with it i had never heard of any similar cases before
so i studied up on the chemistry of light it occurred
to me that something like that substance may have caused
the death of those roosters i shall appreciate it very
much if you will show me one of your experiments or at
least explain the principle of it to me

  this ingenious fabrication seemed to satisfy wilson
for he led pryor into the sanctorum of his stuffy pri-
vate laboratory from a shelf wilson took down an
eight-ounce glass jar and handed it to pryor this
he said dramatically is haemato-porphyrin

  pryor held the jar up to the light it was about a
quarter full of a beautiful fluorescent dark red powder

  i also have it in solution wilson explained this
brown solution is alkaline the red one is an acid
solution

  which one do you use in your experiments pryor
asked

  either it really doesnt matter the same results
are obtained in either case would you like to see the
effect which this has on an animal

  if it isnt too much trouble

  if i wasnt willing to do it i wouldnt make the
offer wilson growled without the slightest suggestion
of a smile

  he departed and came back a few minutes later with
a white mouse squirming in his bony hand from a
drawer he produced a small black object which turned
out to be a tiny sweater wilson fitted the odd garment
over the animals body in such a way that only the legs
the tail and the tip of the mouses nose were exposed

  now well have to go into the dark room he an-
nounced as he led the way into a tiny chamber which
was illuminated only by the blood-red glow of a ruby
lamp

  with an ordinary hypodermic syringe he explained
i inject a small quantity of the solution into the blood
stream of the mouse as long as i keep it in the dark
it will behave in a perfectly normal manner but notice
what happens when i place it in the sunlight

  he carried the animal back into the laboratory and put
it inside a wooden box which was open at the top it
was on a bench in front of a window through which the
afternoon sunlight was streaming wilson opened the
window and placed the box so that the direct rays of
the sun shone into it

  is it necessary to open the window pryor asked

  yes you see this is ordinary window glass it is
opaque to the ultra-violet rays in the sunlight if the
glass panes of the sash were quartz it would not be
necessary to open the window watch what happens to
the mouse

  for a while the animal scampered around in the shaded
part of the box apparently none the worse for the ex-
perience but when it trotted out into the lighted part
of the receptacle it suddenly began to stagger in a
few seconds its legs crumpled and it lay on its side as
if paralyzed

  wilson picked the box up and carried it back to the
dark room almost instantly the mouse revived and
started to run around as if nothing had happened



  why did you put that black garment on the mouse 
pryor inquired

  to protect its body from the light wilson eluci-
dated the paralysis of the animals limbs which you
just witnessed was due to the fact that its legs were ex-
posed to the light because only a small part of its body
was affected i was able to revive it by taking it away
from the light notice what happens when i remove the
protection of the sweater

  he picked up the mouse and took off the tiny black
garment then he put it back in the box and carried it
out into the laboratory again the light from the open
window had hardly fallen on the back of the little crea-
ture before it toppled over and lay limp and motionless
back into the dark room the professor carried the box
but this time the mouse did not revive even after wil-
son had tried to bring it back by forcing oxygen into
its lungs and by using other methods of resuscitation its
tiny heart had stopped beating it had ceased to breathe
it was stone dead

  after witnessing the murder of this innocent animal
pryor could readily sympathize with woodbury who
had balked at being a party to such scientific slayings
he said nothing however except a word of appreciation
and thanks to professor wilson

  by the way professor he remarked is it neces-
sary to use direct sunlight in order to produce effects
like this

  why do you ask that

  i was wondering you said something about ultra-
violet rays it is possible to produce such rays artifi-
cially is it not

certainly i sometimes use artificial sources of light
in my experiment here is one of the lamps i use
pryor bent over and looked up at the light bulb

  i suppose that metallic spot is mercury he re-
marked

yes all of these lamps have mercury in them
when the current is turned on some of the mercury
vaporizes thats what produces the ultra-violet rays
isnt it possible to produce ultra-violet rays with a
bulb that doesnt contain mercury pryor asked

  not that i know of wilson replied

  perhaps i am wrong said the visitor but i have
heard that there is a new type of lamp which was intro-
duced recently for use in the poultry industry it oper-
ates in an ordinary light socket and contains no mer-
cury

oh you mean the cx lamps woodbury vol-
unteered youve heard of them havent you doctor
only superficially wilson admitted my impres-
sion is that those new lamps are still in the experimental
stage do you know anything about them 

  not much but i know that they will produce ultra-
violet rays

  one more question if you please professor wilson
pryor interposed do you know whether or not the ex-
periment you just conducted would work with a larger
animal-say one as large as a sheep

  his answer was startling most assuredly i have
tried it myself on half a dozen large animals some of
them were considerably larger than sheep

  and the results  pryor prompted

  the results well i would call them extremely
gratifying and for the first time since pryor had met
him professor wilson smiled but there was no mirth
seven sunstrokes



in that smile it reminded pryor of the horrible grin
on the face of a man-eating shark it made him shud-
der

  with hasty expressions of thanks to both the men
of science pryor took his departure he was glad to
get outdoors where he could fill his lungs with pure
untainted air

            chapter xii
            more suspects

pryor spent the next few days visiting the chem-
ical laboratories of universities in different parts
of southern california and in interviewing the
other three men on his list

  the first of these was theron ward phd he was
short and slender pryor guessed his weight to be not
more than one hundred and twenty pounds except for
a narrow fringe of dark-brown hair his head was bald
large bulging eyes dull grey in color seemed to be
always staring as if in perpetual surprise this effect
was accentuated by a pair of enormous spectacles with
concave lenses

  pryor opened the conversation by asking professor
ward if he was familiar with benjamin moores experi-
ments in producing formaldehyde from carbon dioxide
and water exposed to ultra-violet light

  why yes ward told him it happens that i have
been doing some work along that same line myself but
i have to confess that my experiments thus far have not
been very satisfactory i have not been able to produce
formaldehyde without the aid of a catalyst such as fer-
ric chloride or ferric oxide

  do you know of any other examples of poisonous
substances being produced by exposing non-poisonous
compounds to sunlight or ultra-violet rays  pryor asked
him

  offhand i cant think of any such example the pro-
fessor replied why 

  i thought possibly you might be familiar with the
work which doctor wilson has been doing with haemato-
porphyrin injected into the blood of animals

  pryor thought he saw a startled look come into those
large bulging eyes but of this he could not be certain
the answer came readily enough im sorry but that
is out of my line i know nothing whatever about doc-
tor wilsons work

  doubtless you have used this substance haemato-
porphyrin for other purposes pryor suggested

  no i have not to tell you the truth i know abso-
lutely nothing about it organic chemistry is a very
broad subject you know you can hardly expect one
man to be familiar with every individual phase of it
of course not pryor agreed from what you
say i assume that there isnt any haemato-porphyrin
on the shelves of your laboratories

  im certain that there is none of it here ward as-
sured him perhaps doctor wilson could furnish you
with a small quantity of it if you wished to use it for ex-
perimental purposes

  thank you for the suggestion said the business
counsellor you have been very considerate perhaps
you will be willing to answer one more question

  why certainly i shall be glad to answer your ques-
tions-if i can

  pryors question was do you know of a kind of

a lamp which can be operated in an ordinary light socket
and which will deliver ultra-violet rays 

  why yes there is such a light it is made by the
american electric company i believe the bulb is
made of quartz glass

  do you know whether a lamp of that sort actually
does produce ultra-violet rays

  undoubtedly it does of course the rays from such
a source will not be as powerful as those renerated by
the regular ultra-violet ray tubes but i am sure that
some ultra-violet light can be produced with a lamp
such as you describe

  do you happen to know the trade name of those
special lamps

  no i do not you can probably find out by phon-
ing to the local office of the american electric com-
pany

  thank you professor i appreciate your courtesy
very much

  you are quite welcome sorry i couldnt be of more
help to you

  you have helped me more than you realize was
pryors significant comment and by the way pro-
fessor i suppose you were away during the holidays
once more those bulging eyes seemed to protrude
a trifle further than usual for an instant ward hesi-
tated then he answered calmly oh yes my daughter
lives in oakland she has two children i always spend
christmas and new years day with her

  the next man whom pryor interviewed was john holt
professor of chemistry at cabrillo university except
for the color of his eyes and his general build he did
not resemble very closely the mental picture which pryor
had constructed from the descriptions of jackson for
one thing he was much younger forty-three to be exact
his height was hardly more than five feet five inches
and his weight approximately one hundred and thirty-
five pounds the corners of his mouth drooped con-
stantly he was anything but cordial

  with considerable difficulty pryor managed to worm
the following information out of him he had heard
of haemato-porphyrin and the experiments of professor
wilson but a few adroit questions from pryor revealed
the fact that his knowledge of this work was very limited
asked if he had any haemato-porphyrin in his laboratory
or if he had ever used any of it himself he answered
both questions in the negative with the one hundred
and ten volt ultra-violet lamps however he seemed to be
familiar although he expressed doubt if they actually
produced ultra-violet rays potent enough to produce
effects comparable to sunlight

  the last interview was with a department head in one
of californias largest institutions of learning his
name was howard winthrop affable courteous and
accommodating he willingly answered pryors questions
in his laboratory there was a small supply of haemato-
porphyrin winthrop was well posted on the experiments
of professor wilson and had himself duplicated some
of them with small animals he knew about the ultra-
violet ray lamps for use in the poultry industry and
showed pryor one of them which he had used for ex-
perimental purposes when pryor asked him where he
had spent the holidays he declared that with the excep-
tion of christmas day new years day and sundays
he had spent the entire vacation working in his labor-
atory on the university campus


amazing stories

  on the morning following his interview with win-
throp the master of mystery went to his office and
barked into his dictaphone a detailed report of his in-
vestigations while his secretary was transcribing his
dictation he wrote out in copper-plate long hand a brief
summary of the salient information obtained from each
of the suspects

  for nearly an hour he sat studying this resume dur-
ing most of this time his eyes seemed fixed on the pa-
per but in reality their gaze was directed inwardly into
that marvelous mind which was weighing measuring
and analyzing every impression and fact

  suddenly his fist came down on the table and he
yelled eureka i have it

  his secretary who had been trained not to disturb
him while he was thinking out a problem must have
heard the exclamation for she opened the door and said
softly here is your report of the strickland case mr
pryor

  the master of mystery took the typewritten pages
gathered up his own penciled notes and with a mumbled
thanks miss walker i wont be back today bolted
out of the office

  he walked briskly to detective headquarters and after
a few minutes wait was ushered into spanglers office

  i thought you might be interested to know that i have
solved the strickland murder case he announced

  is that so the detective smiled i was hoping
youd flop this time so i wouldnt have to bother making
an arrest

  that may not be necessary anyway pryor told him

  what do you mean

  i mean that under the circumstances you can hardly
expect me to reveal the name of the murderer to you un-
less i think he deserves to be punished

  fair enough but suppose i agree not to make the
arrest without your o k if i promise you that will
you tell me who did it

  pryor grinned tell you what ill do lieutenant-
ill give you the same chance to solve this mystery that
i had myself only ill save you all the work of gather-
ing evidence here is a typewritten report giving a
complete account of my investigations if you wish i
shall be glad to leave it with you

  ill look at it right now spangler declared and
while im giving it the once over perhaps you would
like to read the letters and wires i have received 
was saving them until they all came in even if you
know who did it you may find these messages in-
teresting

  undoubtedly pryor agreed perhaps they will
verify my judgment

  only one of the wires contained any significant in-
formation signed by a police official of dallas texas
it read as follows

 men who knew mendez here say
he had friend named andrew jackson
who drank with him often stop
tacicson was about forty five years
old medium sized athletic build eyes
blue sandy hair small moustache
stop coroner says death might have
been caused by something besides
sunstroke

burke

  the message from council bluffs iowa was in the
form of an air mail letter

  dear lieutenant spangler it said 

  in reply to your inquiry in regards to ruth whipple
i am sending you the following information

  ruth whipples real name is ruth holzberg she
was born in des moines in  her mothers maiden
name was mary slocum she was only seventeen when
she married emil holzburg who was then attending
the state university they kept their marriage secret
until ruth was born after which marys parents had
the marriage annulled five years later mary holz-
burg met samuel whipple they were married and
moved to council bluffs for obvious reasons ruth
took her stepfathers name and only a few intimate
friends knew her real name whipple always was kind
to ruth treating her like his own child ruths mother
died in  whipple and his stepdaughter went to
california merely for a vacation so far as we have
been able to ascertain they have no close friends or rela-
tives in california

  we have not been able to trace holzberg since he
graduated from the university university authorities
say he was an excellent student and that he did espe-
cially fine work in chemistry

  if we can be of any further assistance to you in this
matter please call on us

yours truly

                           william anderson

pryor waited until spangler had finished reading
the report then he said what do you make of
it

  it looks like you are on the right track the detective
admitted but i wouldnt take a chance on arresting
any one of those men on the strength of the flimsy evi-
dence you have collected so far

  not even after reading this letter pryor pointed
to the message from council bluffs

  i couldnt find anything in that letter that would help
solve the problem said spangler did you get any-
thing out of it

  most assuredly mr andersons letter contains two
very important links in the chain which binds our mur-
derer to his crimes ill have to admit that before i
read this letter i was a bit uncertain but now i am posi-
tive that my first guess was correct

  youre still talking in riddles to me the detective
confessed

  perhaps this will help you to visualize our problem
pryor remarked as he handed spangler the sheet of pa-
per on which he had epitomized the results of his inter-
views with the five suspected men this is what the
detective read

chapter xiii
miss strickland again

spangler studied this list for a few minutes be-
fore he remarked well if i were asked to pick
the one most likely to be the murderer id have to put
my finger on wilson he seems to be the one that
knows the most about that tomato-porcelain stuff or
whatever you call it and with a whole years vacation
he had plenty of chance to get the other five too

  the other five died during the summer vacation
pryor reminded him all of these college men were at
liberty then

  thats right even at that the suspicion seems to
point at wilson but if you believe what you read in
the detective stories that means that wilson couldnt
possibly have done it the murderer has to be the one
that is least suspected like this fellow winthrop

  we can safely eliminate winthrop from our list of
suspects pryor told him i checked his assertion
that he spent the greater part of his christmas vacation
doing some research work in the university laboratories
and i found that it was true he couldnt possibly have
been the man who did strickland to death

  well that helps narrow it down said spangler
cheerfully and for that matter why not eliminate
two more

  which ones do you mean

  woodbury and ward neither of them comes any-
where near the description of jackson i suppose you
still think that the man who did it is the same man who
called himself jackson

  of that i am positive pryor assured him

  o k then that leaves only wilson and holt of
course ward could have covered his bald head with a
wig but my guess would be wilson after all this
isnt a story book even if it does sound like a fairy tale
in real life the guilty person is usually the one that you
have reason to suspect most-not the one that is least
suspected

  true enough pryor conceded providing the sus-
picions are well founded

  spangler waited patiently for pryor to divulge the
name of the man he thought was guilty but all the
master of mystery said was do you mind if i use
your phone

  help yourself said the detective

  pryor dialed a number when the call was answered
he said this is mr pryor i would like to speak to
miss strickland if you please

  soon a soft melodious voice said good afternoon
mr pryor

  good afternoon miss strickland are you going
to be home for an hour or so

  why yes

  may i see you for a few minutes if i come to your
home now

  why yes of course i shall be glad to have you
come out any time mr pryor

  she was more beautiful than ever when she greeted
him in her living room half an hour later

  with characteristic bluntness pryor plunged into the
mission which had brought him there

  i came to tell you that i have solved the mystery
surrounding your fathers death


amazing

stories

  pained surprise flashed across her lovely face

  you mean- she said in a trembling voice you

mean that-

  yes said pryor without waiting for her to finish
the sentence your father was murdered and i have
found his murderer

  he was totally unprepared for the effect which this
announcement had on the girl with a low moan she
sank down on the davenport buried her face in her
bent arm and began to sob convulsively

  before this unexpected storm of grief pryor was
as helpless as if he were paralyzed he wanted to com-
fort and console her but he didnt know what to say-
he didnt know what to do so he said nothing and did
nothing presently she raised her head dabbed at her
face with a flimsy ridiculously inadequate handker-
chief and said please forgive me mr pryor this is
such a shock that i-i-well i just lost control of my-
self im sorry

  pryor finally found his voice but my dear miss
strickland why should you weep at the thought of ap-
prehending the man who was responsible for your
fathers death

  dont you understand to mother and me this
means nothing but a lot of unwelcome publicity for
over a year we have been trying to live down the scandal
which was laid at fathers door at the time when the
whipple girl was ruined the public had just about
forgotten us when father died now you say he was
murdered that means more publicity it means rak-
ing over all the detestable filth that we thought was
buried cant you see why mother and i would much
prefer to have the world think that father died a
natural death

  i understand now said pryor in a tone of regret
how blind i have been i pride myself on my so-called
analytical mind and here i have completely failed in
my analysis of your attitude but you dont need to
fear miss strickland the police know very little about
this and i am under no obligation to inform them after
all i was first asked to help your father and now it
looks as if the only way i can help him and his dear
ones is to remain silent

  she looked up at him with the light of gratitude
gleaming through the tears in her eyes as she said i
cant tell you how much i appreciate your kindness
mr pryor i realize what a sacrifice this means to
you you are known as a man who always completes
successfully every task he undertakes it will take a
lot of sacrifice on your part to refrain from telling
lieutenant spangler about your success in this case

  it may not be necessary to make that sacrifice
pryor smiled that doesnt trouble me nearly as much
as another consideration does

  what do you mean

  i mean the attitude of the murderer himself no
doubt he felt that he had ample justification for com-
mitting those six murders you see he was ruths real
father whipple was just her stepfather but regard-
less of how he felt he had no right to assume such
arbitrary and despotic powers he virtually appointed
himself to be the judge and jury and executioner all
rolled into one it would be dangerous to permit such
a man to escape without some punishment

  but how are you going to punish him without hav-
ing him indicted

  i think i know how to do it pryor told her may
 use your phone

  talking softly into the instrument pryor first made
sure that he had the right person on the line then in
a loud deliberate voice he said your real name is
emil holzburg isnt it

  who are you the man at the other end demanded
without answering the question pryor went grimly
on

  at various times you have also used the name jack-
son havent you in texas it was andrew jackson in
hollywood it was albert jackson that is true isnt
it

  who are you this time the question came in a
frightened whisper that was barely audible

  never mind who i am my name has nothing to do
with the case what does matter is that i know who
you are and what you have done i know that you
murdered james strickland and the five other men who
were accused of causing the ruin of your daughter ruth
i also know that you used a chemical called haemato-
porphyrin in committing these six murders

  what are you going to do the voice was a trifle
louder but it still trembled with fear

  nothing was pryors astonishing response it
happens that i am a friend of james stricklands
daughter turning you over to the police would mean
distressing publicity this miss strickland and her
mother wish to avoid for that reason you will prob-
ably be safe from the strictly legal consequences of your
crimes

  for that i am grateful to- the man started to

say but pryor interrupted him with

  that does not mean that you are to escape the con-
sequences of your crimes

 what-how-why- the voice stammered

and pryor went inexorably on

  you are a man of superior intellect holzburg you
certainly must realize that even if you thought you had
ample justification for avenging your daughter you had
no right to take the law into your own hands having
done so it devolves upon you to carry out the remainder
of the laws work

 what do you mean

  you have appointed yourself judge jury and execu-
tioner for james strickland and five other men it is
only logical that you should also assume the responsi-
bility for punishing the man who murdered them
you mean

  now that you know your crimes have been dis-
covered you must be guided entirely by your own con-
science good-bye

chapter xiv
gathering the loose threads

for several days pryor scanned the columns of
the los angeles newspapers with the utmost care
then one morning he found the story he was
looking for he tore out the article and slipped it be-
neath the cover of a notebook which he placed in his
pocket

  forty minutes later he was in spanglers office

  oh hello mr pryor the detective greeted him
im glad you came to see me that strickland case is
seven sunstrokes



getting my goat i cant do anything else for thinking
about it i even lay awake nights trying to figure out
how you could be so all fired sure about the one you
think murdered strickland

  but you know now of course

  darned if i do after all my deliberating i still
think that wilson is the man

  pryor smiled it wont be necessary for you to
trouble your mind about it any more lieutenant the
case is all settled-settled in a way that seems to be
best for everybody concerned you wont need to bother
about arresting anybody miss strickland and her
mother will be spared the ordeal of unwelcome publicity
i have completed my task successfully and the murderer
has received a just punishment did you see this in
todays times and he handed the newspaper clip-
ping to spangler

  the detective read it and then exclaimed well ill

be- i dont know what so the murderer was that

nice chap woodbury

  yes woodbury jackson and holzburg are one and
the same person

  is he the one you suspected

  he was the one i knew did it

 whatever made you suspect him

  it was largely a matter of mathematics

 what do you mean by that

  woodbury was the only one of the five who had all
the knowledge and all the opportunities necessary for
the commission of stricklands murder

  i dont get you yet

 then let me elucidate wilson knew all about
haemato-porphyrin but he said he knew nothing about
the cx ultra-violet ray lamp and i saw no reason for
doubting his assertion ward knew about the cx
lamps but did not have a supply of haemato-porphyrin
readily available and was not familiar with the action
of this substance on animals holt knew about the
violet ray lamps for ordinary lighting circuits but he
knew very little about haemato-porphyrin winthrop
possessed both the knowledge and the materials re-
quired but he lacked the opportunity because he was
working in his laboratories during the christmas vaca-
tion that leaves woodbury who knew all about the
one hundred and ten volt ultra-violet ray lamp in fact
he was the only one of the five who knew the trade
name cx

  i see now how you happened to make such a clever
guess but after all it was nothing more than a guess
now was it

  call it a guess if you wish did you ever work out
a jigsaw puzzle of a famous persons portrait

  i guess i did waste my time that way when i was a
kid spangler replied whats that got to do with it 
only this when you work out a puzzle like that
it sometimes takes only a few pieces to identify the per-
son represented even though the picture is only one-
tenth complete you can often tell positively what the
final result will be after that each piece you add
merely serves to corroborate what you already know
do you get the analogy now 

  in a way i do

  very well then suppose i admit that my original

judgment was nothing but a guess it required only the
addition of two more pieces to my jigsaw puzzle to
make that guess a certainty i obtained those two pieces
from the air mail letter which our friend mr anderson
of council bluffs supplied

  youve still got me guessing spangler admitted
what did you get out of that letter

  two very important details namely our quarrys
name and his approximate age the name of ruths
father was holzburg dont you get the significance of
that he must have graduated from college just about
the time of the world war you could hardly blame
him for wanting to change such a teutonic name as
holzburg all he aid was to translate it into english
holz you know is the german for wood

  and what about his age

  that was in the letter too he was married while
he was a college student the girl he married was seven-
teen at the time he was probably not more than nine-
teen ruth was born a year later she was seventeen
when she died about a year ago add it up and what do
you get thirty-eight exactly the age of woodbury
and several years younger than any of the others

  but i thought you said that jackson and the man
who committed the murders were the same person

   i still think so

  but jackson was a lot older than thirty-eight ac-
cording to the descriptions we had of him also your
report says that woodbury was five feet seven inches
tall and jackson wasnt over five feet six

  you will also recall that he was stoop shouldered
that would easily account for the missing inch wood-
bury naturally took the precaution of disguising him-
self it is not very difficult for a man of his age to
make himself look several years older

  right you are spangler conceded but what do
you suppose this newspaper article means it almost
looks as if woodbury committed suicide what do you
think about it 

  with a grim inscrutable smile pryor replied that
hypothesis is as good as any however i for my part
prefer to accept the newspapers account of the tragedy
you mean-

  pryor picked up the clipping and read

savant is martyr to science

  william emil woodbury professor of chemistry at
santa ana university was found dead in his laboratory
yesterday afternoon circumstances surrounding his
death indicate that he met with an accident while ex-
perimenting with an apparatus for producing ultra-
violet rays he had evidently been testing the effect of
this light on his own person for the part of his body
above his waist was nude when he was found

  according to professor hermann wilson head of
the department of chemistry professor woodbury has
been performing a series of experiments with a rare
substance which when injected into the blood of an
animal makes it extremely sensitive to ultra-violet light
it is thought that some of this chemical might have been
absorbed by woodburys aystem and that the action of
the ultra-violet ray light produced an effort similar to
that of sunstroke

      jtsychologists-and others-are greatly concerned about the effects-

      j possible and assured-of machines and the machine age on human life and
      endeavor but who has ever stopped to consider the possible reactions-
      or thoughts-of the advanced machine of the future that apparently was left
      to our brothers across the sea and one of them at least has done an excellent bit
      of work on its presentation here is a story that is different indeed and thor-
      oughly english in its atmosphere

 one of the doctors companions stepped from the
 background

 this he inquired is-was the machine you were
 telling us about

 there was a touch of a sneer in his voice as he put
 the question and indicated the quivering liquid with the
 toe of one shoe

 yes the doctor admitted slowly that was it

 and therefore you can offer no proof of the talk
 you were handing out to us added the other man

 weve got film records joan began tentatively
 theyre pretty good   

 the second man brushed her words aside

 oh yes  he asked sarcastically ive seen pictures
 of new york as its going to look in a couple of hundred
 years but that dont mean that anyone went there to
 take em theres a whole lot of things that can be done
 with movies he insinuated

 joan flushed but kept silent the doctor paid no at-
 tention his brief flash of anger had subsided to leave
 him gazing sadly at the remains before him

 who can have done it he repeated half to himself

 his daughter hesitated for a moment before she sug-
 gested 

 i think-i think it must have done it itself

 an accident-i wonder murmured the doctor

 no-no not quite that she amended i think it
 was-lonely the last word came out with a defiant rush

 there was a pause

 well can you beat that said one of the others at
 last lonely-a lonely machine thats a good one
 and i suppose youre trying to feed us that it committed
 suicide miss well it wouldnt surprise me any noth-
 ing would after the story your father gave us

 he turned on his heel and added to his companion

 come on i guess someonell be turnin this place
 into a sanitarium soon-wed better not be here when it
 happens

 with a laugh the two went out leaving father and
 daughter to stare helplessly at the residue of a van-
 ished machine

  v rather here quickly joans voice called
      i down the long corridor

  i  dr falkner who was writing checked him-
         self in mid-sentence at the sound of his daugh-
         ters urgency

  father she called again

  coming he shouted as he hastily levered himself
 out of his easy chair

  this way he added for the benefit of his two com-
 panions

  joan was standing at the open door of the laboratory

   its gone she said

  what do you mean he inquired brusquely as he
 brushed past her into the room run away

  no not that joans dark curls fell forward as her
 head shook look there

  he followed the line of her pointing finger to the
 corner of the room

  a pool of liquid metal was seeping into a widening
 circle in the middle there rose an elongated silvery
 mound which seemed to melt and run even as he looked
 speechlessly he watched the central mass flow out into
 the surrounding fluid pushing the edges gradually
 further and further across the floor

  then the mound was gone-nothing lay before him
 but a shapeless spread of glittering silver like a mini-
 ature lake of mercury

  for some moments the doctor seemed unable to speak
 at length he recovered himself sufficiently to ask hoarse-
 ly

  that-that was it

  joan nodded

  it was recognizable when i first saw it she said

  angrily he turned upon her

  how did it happen who did it he demanded

  i dont know the girl answered her voice trembling
 a little as she spoke as soon as i got back to the
 house i came in here just to see that it was all right it
 wasnt in the usual corner and as i looked around i
 caught sight of it over here-melting i shouted for
 you as soon as i realized what was happening


illustrated by morey

 a second later there came a stunning ex-
 plosion  the cause of the disaster must
 always remain a mystery  i only know
 that when i looked up the vessel was no-
 where to be seen    only a rain of metal
 parts dropping to earth all about me


amazing stories

   at length joan sighed and moved away as she raised
her eyes she became aware of a pile of paper on the
corner of a bench she did not remember how it came
to be there and crossed with idle curiosity to examine it

   the doctor was aroused from his reverie by the note
of excitement in her voice

   look here father she called sharply

   whats that  he asked catching sight of the wad of
sheets in her hand

   as he came closer he could see that the top one was
covered with strange characters

  what on earth   he began

   joans voice was curt with his stupidity

   dont you see she cried its written this for us

  the doctor brightened for a moment then the ex-
pression of gloom returned to his face

   but how can we    

   the thing wasnt a fool-it must have learned enough
of our language to put a key in somewhere to all this
weird stuff even if it couldnt write the whole thing
in english look this might be it it looks even queerer
than the rest

   several weeks of hard work followed for joan in her
efforts to decipher the curious document but she held
on with painstaking labor until she was able to lay the
complete text before her father that evening he picked
up the pile of typed sheets and read steadily without
interruption to the end   

arrival

s we slowed to the end of our journey banuff be-
gan to show signs of excitement

  look he called to me the third planet
at last

   i crossed to stand beside him and together we gazed
down upon a stranger scene than any other fourth planet
eyes have ever seen

  though we were still high above the surface there
was plenty to cause us astonishment

   in place of our own homely red vegetation we beheld
a brilliant green the whole land seemed to be covered
with it anywhere and everywhere it clung and thrived
as though it needed no water on the fourth planet
which the third planet men call mars the vegetation
grows only in or around the canals but here we could
not even see any canals the only sign of irrigation
was one bright streak of water in the distance twisting
senselessly over the countryside-a symbolic warning of
the incredible world we had reached

  here and there our attention was attracted by out-
croppings of various strange rocks amid all this green
great masses of stone which sent up plumes of black
smoke

   the internal fires must be very near the surface of
this world banuff said looking doubtfully at the rising
vapors

  see in how many places the smoke breaks out i
should doubt whether it has been possible for animal
life to evolve on such a planet it is possible yet that
the ground may be too hot for us-or rather for me

   there was a regret in his tone the manner in which
he voiced the last sentence stirred my sympathy there
are so many disadvantages in human construction which
do not occur in us machines and i knew that he was
eager to obtain first hand knowledge of the third planet

   for a long time we gazed in silent speculation at this
queer green world at last banuff broke the silence

   i think well risk a landing there zat he said
indicating a smooth open space

   you dont think it might be liquid i suggested it
looks curiously level

   no he replied i fancy its a kind of close vege-
tation anyway we can risk it

   a touch  the lever sent the machine sinking rapidly
towards a green rectangle so regular as to suggest the
work of sentient creatures on one of its sides lay a
large stone outcrop riddled with holes and smoking
from the top like the rest while on the other three sides
thick vegetation rose high and swayed in the wind

  an atmosphere which can cause such commotion
must be very dense commented banuff

   that rock is peculiarly regular i said and the
smoking points are evenly spaced do you suppose   

   the slight jar of our landing interrupted me

   get ready zat banuff ordered

  i was ready i opened the inner door and stepped
into the air-lock banuff would have to remain inside
until i could find out whether it was possible for him to
adjust men may have more power of originality than
we and they do possess a greater degree of adaptability
than any other form of life but their limitations are
nevertheless severe it might require a deal of ponder-
ous apparatus to enable banuff to withstand the con-
ditions but for me a machine adaptation was simple

  the density of the atmosphere made no difference
save slightly to slow my movements the temperature
within very wide limits had no effect upon me

  the gravity will be stronger banuff had warned
me this is a much larger planet than ours

   it had been easy to prepare for that by the addition
of a fourth pair of legs

   now as i walked out of the air-lock i was glad of
them the pull of the planet was immense

  after a moment or so of minor adjustment i passed
around our machine to the window where banuff stood
and held up the instruments for him to see as he
read the air pressure meter the gravity indicator and
the gas proportion scale he shook his head he might
slowly adapt himself partway to the conditions but an
immediate venture was out of the question

   it had been agreed between us that in such an event
i should perform the exploration and specimen collect-
ing while he examined the neighborhood from the
machine

   he waved his arm as a signal and in response i set
off at a good pace for the surrounding green and brown
growths i looked back as i reached them to see our
silvery craft floating slowly up into the air

  a second later there came a stunning explosion a
wave of sound so strong in this thick atmosphere that
it almost shattered my receiving diaphragm

   the cause of the disaster must always remain a mys-
tery  i only know that when i looked up the vessel was
nowhere to be seen-only a rain of metal parts dropping
to earth all about me

   cries of alarm came from the large stone outcrop and
simultaneously human figures appeared at the lowest of
its many openings

  they began to run towards the vreck but my speed
was far greater than theirs they can have made but
half the distance while i completed it as i flashed
the lost machine



across i could see them falter and stop with ludicrous
expressions of dismay on their faces

  lord did you see that cried one of them

  what the devil was it called another

  looked like a coffin on legs somebody said mov-
ing some too

flight

anuff lay in a ring of scattered debris

  gently i raised him on my fore-rods a very
little examination showed that it was useless to
attempt any assistance he was too badly broken he
managed to smile faintly at me and then slid into uncon-
sciousness

  i was sorry though banuff was not of my own
kind yet he was of my own world and on the long trip
i had grown to know him well these humans are so
fragile some little thing here or there breaks-they
stop working and then in a short time they are decom-
posing had he been a machine like myself i could
have mended him replaced the broken parts and made
him as good as new but with these animal structures
one is almost helpless

  i became aware while i gazed at him that the crowd
of men and women had drawn closer and i began to
suffer for the first time from what has been my most
severe disability on the third planet-i could not com-
municate with them

  their thoughts were understandable for my sensitive
plate was tuned to receive human mental waves but i
could not make myself understood my language was
unintelligible to them and their minds either from lack
of development or some other cause were unreceptive
of my thought-radiations

  as they approached huddled into a group i made an
astonishing discovery-they were afraid of me

  men afraid of a machine

  it was incomprehensible why should they be afraid
surely man and machine are natural complements they
assist one another for a moment i thought i must
have misread their minds-it was possible that thoughts
registered differently on this planet but it was a possi-
bility i soon dismissed

  there were only two reasons for this apprehension
the one that they had never seen a machine or the
other that third planet machines had pursued a line of
development inimical to them

  i turned to show banuff lying inert on my fore-rods
then slowly so as not to alarm them i approached i
laid him down softly on the ground near by and retired
a short distance experience has taught me that men
like their own broken forms to be dealt with by their
own kind some stepped forward to examine him the
rest held their ground their eyes fixed upon me

  banuffs dark coloring appeared to excite them not a
little their own skins were pallid from lack of ultra-
violet rays in their dense atmosphere

  dead asked one

  quite dead another one nodded curious looking
fellow he continued cant place him ethnologically
at all just look at the frontal formation of the skull
-very odd and the size of his ears too huge the
whole head is abnormally large

  never mind him now one of the group broke in
hell keep thats the thing that puzzles me he went

on looking in my direction what the devil do you
suppose it is

  they all turned wondering faces towards me i stood
motionless and waited while they summed me up

  about six feet long ran the thoughts of one of
them two feet broad and two deep white metal
might be-his thought conveyed nothing to me four
legs to a side fixed about halfway up-jointed rather
like a crabs so are the arm-like things in front but
all metal wonder what the array of instruments and
lenses on this end are anyhow whatever kind of power
it uses it seems to have run down now   

  hesitatingly he began to advance

  i tried a word of encouragement

  the whole group froze rigid

  did you hear that somebody whispered it-it
spoke

  loud speaker replied the one who had been making
an inventory of me suddenly his expression bright-
ened

  ive got it he cried remote control-a telephony
and television machine worked by remote control

  so these people did know something of machinery
after all he was far wrong in his guess but in my
relief i took a step forward

  an explosion roared something thudded on my body
case and whirred away i saw that one of the men was
pointing a hollow rod at me and i knew that he was
about to make another explosion

  the first had done  injury but another might crack-
one of my lenses

  i turned and made top speed for the high green vege-
tation two or three more bursts roared behind but
nothing touched me the weapon was very primitive
and grossly inaccurate

disappointment

or a day and a night i continued on among the
hard stemmed growths

  for the first time since my making i was com-
pletely out of touch with human control and my exis-
tence seemed meaningless the humans have a curious
force they call ambition it drives them and through
them it drives us this force which keeps them active
we lack perhaps in time we machines will acquire it
something of the kind-self-preservation which is allied
to it-must have made me leave the man with the ex-
plosive tube and taken me into the strange country but
it was not enough to give me an objective i seemed to
go on because-well because my machinery was con-
structed to go 

  on the way i made some odd discoveries

  every now and then my path would be crossed by a
band of hard matter serving no useful purpose which i
could then understand once too i found two unending
rods of iron fixed horizontally to the ground and stretch-
ing away into the distance on either side at first i
thought they might be a method of guarding the land
beyond but they presented no obstacle

  also i found that the frequent outcroppings of stone
were not natural but laboriously constructed obvious-
ly this primitive race with insufficient caves to hold its
growing numbers had been driven to construct artificial
caves the puzzling smoke arose from their method of
heating these dwellings with naked fire-so wasteful a


amazing

stories

system of generating heat that no flame has been seen on
the fourth planet save in an accident for thousands of
years

  it was during the second day that i saw my first
machine on this planet

  it stood at the side of one of the hard strips of land
which had caused me so much wonder the glitter of
light upon its bright parts caught my lenses as i came
through the bushes my delight knew no bounds-at
lat i had found a being of my own kind in my excite-
ment i gave a call to attract its attention

  there was a flurry of movement round the far side
and a human figure raised its head to look at me

  i was able to tell that she was a woman despite the
strange coverings that the third planet humans put upon
themselves she stared at me her eyes widening in
surprise while i could feel the shock in her mind a
spanner dropped from her hand and then in a flash
she was into the machine slamming the door behind her
there came a frantic whirring as she pressed a knob
but it produced no other result

  slowly i continued to advance and as i came the agita-
tion in her mind increased i had no wish to alarm her
-it would have been more peaceful had her thought
waves ceased to bombard me-but i was determined to
know this machine

  as i drew clear of the bushes i obtained a full view
of the thing for the first time and disappointment hit
me like a blow the thing had wheels not just neces-
cessary parts of its internal arrangements but wheels
actually in contact with the ground in a flash the
explanation of all these hard streaks came to me un-
believable though it may seem this thing could only
follow a track specially built for it

  later i found that this was more or hss true of all
third planetf land machines but my first discouragement
was painful the primitive barbarity of the thing sad-
dened me more than any discovery i had yet made

  forlornly and with little hope i spoke to it

  there was no answer

  it stood there dumbly inert upon its foolish wheels
as though it were a part of the ground itself

  walking closer i began to examine with growing
disgust its crude internal arrangements incredibly i
found that its only means of propulsion was by a series
of jerks from frequent explosions moreover it was so
ludicrously unorganized that both driving engine and
brakes could be applied at the same time

  sadly as i gazed at the ponderous parts within i be-
gan to feel that i was indeed alone until this encounter
my hope of discovering an intelligent machine had not
really died but now i knew that such a thing could
not exist in the same world with this monster

  one of my fore-rods brushed against a part of it with
a rasping sound and there came a startled cry of alarm
from within i looked up to the glass front where the
womans face peered affrightedly her mind was in
such a state of confusion that it was difficult to know
her wants clearly

  she hoped that i would go away-no she wished the
car would start and carry her away-she wondered
whether i were an animal whether i even really ex-
isted in a jumble of emotions she was afraid and at
the same time wa angry with herself for being afraid
at last i managed to grasp that the machine was unable
to run i turned to find the trouble

  as i labored with the things horrible vitals it be-
came clear to me why men such as i had met showed
fear of me no wonder they feared machines when
their own mechanisms were as inefficient and futile as
this what reliance or trust could they place in a ma-
chine so erratic-so helpless that it could not even tem-
porarily repair itself it was not under its own control
and only partially under theirs third planet mens at-
titude became understandable-commendable-if all their
machines were as uncertain as this

  the alarm in the womans mind yielded to amazement
as she leaned forward and watched me work she
seemed to think me unreal a kind of hallucination

  i must be dreaming she told herself that thing
cant really be mending my car for me its impossible
some kind of horrid nightmare   

  there came a flash of panic at the thought of mad-
ness but her mind soon rebalanced

  i just dont understand it she said firmly and then
as though that settled it proceeded to wait with a grow-
ing calm

  at last i had finished as i wiped the things coarse
but necessary oil from my fore-rods i signalled her to
iush again on the black knob the whirr this time was
succeeded by a roar-never would i have believed that a
machine could be so inefficient

  through the pandemonium i received an impression
of gratitude on my thought plate mingling traces of
nervousness remained but first stood gratitude

  then she was gone down the hard strip i watched
the disgusting machine dwindle away to a speck

  then i turned back to the bushes and went slowly on
my way sadly i thought of the far away red fourth
planet and knew that my fate was sealed i could not
build a means of return i was lost-the only one of
my kind upon this primitive world

the beasts

they came upon me as i crossed one of the
smooth green spaces so frequent on this world
my thought-cells were puzzling over my condi-
tion on the fourth planet i had felt interest or dis-
interest inclination or the lack of it but little more
now i had discovered reactions in myself which had
they lain in a human being i should have called emo-
tions i was for instance lonely i wanted the com-
pany of my own kind moreover- i had begun to ex-
perience excitement or more particularly apathy

  an apathetic machine

  i was considering whether this state was a develop-
ment from the instinct of self preservation or whether
it might not be due to the action of surrounding matter
on my chemical cells when i heard them coming

  first there was a drumming in my diaphragm swell-
ing gradually to a thunderous beat which shook the
ground then i turned to see them charging down
upon me

  enormous beasts extinct on my planet a million years
covered with hair and bearing spikes on their heads
four-footed survivals of savagery battering across the
land in unreasoning ferocity

  only one course was possible since my escape was cut
off by the windings of one of the imbecile-built canals
i folded my legs beneath me crossed my fore-rods pro-
tectingly over my lenses and diaphragms and waited

mars tthe earth
the lost machine



  they slowed as they drew close suspiciously they
came up to me and snuffled around one of them gave a
rap to my side with his spiked head another pawed my
case with a hoofed foot i let them continue they did
not seem to offer any immediate danger such primitive
animals i thought would be incapable of sustaining
interest and soon move off elsewhere

  but they did not snuffling and rooting continued all
around me at last i determined to try an experimental
waving of my fore-rods the result was alarming they
plunged and milled around made strange bellowing
noises and stamped their hooves but they did not go
away neither did they attack though they snorted
and pawed the more energetically

  in the distance i heard a mans voice his thought
reached me faintly

  what the ells worritin them dam cattle bill he
called

  dunno came the reply of another lets go an
ave a look

  the beasts gave way at the approach of the man and i
could hear some of them thudding slowly awav though
i did not as yet care to risk uncovering my lenses

  the mens voices drew quite near

   strewth said the first  ow did that get ere
bill

  search me answered the other wasnt ere arf
an hour ago-that ill swear what is it anyow

   anged if i know ere give us a and and well
turn it over

  at this moment it seemed wise to make a movement
my balancers might be slow in adjusting to an inverted
position

  there was a gasp then

  bill came an agitated whisper did you see that
rod there at the end it moved blessed if it didnt

  go on scoffed the other  ow could a thing like
that move youll be sayin next that it   

  i unfolded my legs and turned to face them

  for a moment both stood rooted horror on their faces
then with one accord they turned and fled towards a
group of their buildings in the distance i followed them
slowly it seemed as good a direction as any other

  the buildings not all of stone were arranged so as
almost to enclose a square as the men disappeared
through an opening in one side i could hear their voices
raised in warning and others demanding the reason for
their excitement i turned the corner in time to face a
gaggling group of ten or twelve abruptly it broke as
they ran to dark openings in search of safety all save
one

  i halted and looked at this remaining one he stared
back swaying a little as he stood his eyes blinking in
a vague uncertainty

  what is it he exclaimed at last with a strange
explosiveness but as though talking to himself

  he was a sorely puzzled man i found his mental
processes difficult to follow they were jumbled and
erratic hopping from this mind picture to that in un-
controlled jerks but he was unafraid of me and i was
glad of it the first third planet man i had met who was
not terror-ridden nevertheless he seemed to doubt
my reality

  you fellowsh shee the shame sl do he called deaf-
eningly

  muffled voices all around assured him that this was so

 thash all right then he observed with relief and
 took a step forward

 i advanced slowly not to alarm him and wre met in the
 middle of the yard laying a rough hand on my body-
 case he seemed to steady himself then he patted me once
 or twice

 goo ol dog he observed seriously goo ol
 feller come long then

 looking over his shoulder to see that i followed and
 making strange whistling noises the while he led the way
 to a building made of the hard brown vegetable matter
 at openings all about us scared faces watched our prog-
 ress with incredulous amazement

 he opened the door and waved an uncertain hand in
 the direction of a pile of dried stalks which lay within

 goo ol dog he repeated lie down theresh
 a goo dog

 in spite of the fact that i a machine was being mis-
 taken for a primitive animal i obeyed the suggestion
 -after all he at least was not afraid

 he had a little difficulty with the door fastening as he
 went out

the circus

there followed one of those dark periods of
quiet the animal origin of human beings puts
them under the disability of requiring frequent
periods of recuperation and since they cannot use the
infra-red rays for sight as we do their rests take place
at times when they are unable to see

 with the return of sunlight came a commotion out-
 side the door expostulations were being levelled at
 one named tom-he who had led me here the previous
 day

 you aint really goin to let it out one voice
 was asking nervously

  course i am why not tom replied

 the thing dont look right to me i wouldnt touch
 it said another

 scared thats what you are tom suggested

 praps i am-and praps youd ve been scared last
 night if you adnt been so far gone

 well it didnt do nothin to me when id had a few
 argued tom so why should it now

 his words were confident enough but i could feel a
 trepidation in his mind

 its your own funeralsaid the other dont say
 afterwards that i didnt warn you

 i could hear the rest of them retire to what they con-
 sidered a safe distance tom approached making a show
 of courage with his words

 of course im goin to let it out whats more im
 takin it to a place i know of-it ought to be worth a
 bit

 youll never  

 oh wont i

 he rattled open the door and addressed me in a fierce
 voice which masked a threatening panic

 come on he ordered out of it

 he almost turned to run as he saw me rise but man-
 aged to master the impulse with an effort outwardly
 calm he led the way to one of those machines which use
 the hard tracks opened a rear door and pointed inside

 in you get he said

 i doubt if ever a man was more relieved and surprised
 than he when i did so


amazing stories

 with a grin of triumph he turned around gave a
 mocking sweep with his cap to the rest and climbed into
 the front seat

 my last sight as we roared away was of a crowd of
 open mouthed men

 the sun was high when we reached our destination
 the limitations of the machine were such that we had
 been delayed more than once to replenish fuel and water
 before we stopped at last in front of large gates set
 in a wooden fence

 over the top could be seen the upper parts of pieces
 of white cloth tightly stretched over poles and decorated
 by further pieces of colored cloth flapping in the wind
 i had by this time given up the attempt to guess the
 purposes of third planet constructions such incredible
 things managed to exist on this primitive world that it
 was simpler to wait and find out

 from behind the fence a rhythmical braying noise per-
 sisted then there came the sound of a mans voice shout-
 ing above the din

 what do you want-main entrance is round the
 other side

 wheres the boss called tom i got something
 for him

 the doors opened to aliow us to enter

 over there in his office said the man jerking a
 thumb over his shoulder

 as we approached i could see that the third planet
 mania for wheels had led them even to mount the office
 thus

 tom entered and reappeared shortly accompanied
 by another man

 there it is he said pointing to me and there aint
 another like it nowhere the only all-metal animal
 in the world-howll that look on the posters

 the other regarded me with no enthusiasm in his eyes
 and a deal of disbelief in his mind

 that long box thing he inquired

 sure that box thing here you he added to me
 get out of it

 both retreated a step as i advanced the new man
 looked apprehensively at my fore-rods

 youre sure its safe he asked nervously

 safe said tom course its safe

 to prove it he came across and patted my case

 im offering you the biggest noise in the show busi-
 ness its worth ten times what im asking for it-i
 tell you there aint another one in the world

 well i aint heard of another admitted the show-
 man grudgingly whered you get it

 made it said tom blandly spare time

 the man continued to regard me with little enthu-
 siasm

 can it do anything he asked at last

 can it- began tom indignantly here you
 he added fetch that lump of wood

 when i brought it the other looked a trifle less doubt-
 ful

 whats inside it he demanded

 secrets said tom shortly

 well its got to stop bein a secret before i buy it
 what sort of a fool do you take me for lets have
 a look at the things innards

 lo  said tom sending a nervous look sideways at
 me either you take it or leave it

 ho so thats your little game is it im to be the

 sucker who buys the thing and then finds the kid inside
 workin it it wouldnt surprise me to find that the
 policed like to know about this

  there aint no kid inside denied tom its just
-just secret works thats what it is

   ill believe you when i see

  tom waited a moment before he answered

   all right he said desperately well get the blasted
lid off of it    here hey come back you

  the last was a shout to me but i gave it no notice
it was one thing to observe the curious ways of these
humans but it was quite a different matter to let them
pry into my machinery the clumsiness of such as tom
was capable of damaging my arrangements seriously
stop it bawled tom behind me

  a man in my path landed a futile blow on my body
case as i swept him aside before me was the biggest
of all the cloth covered erections

  here i thought there will be plenty of room to
hide

  i was wrong inside in a circular space stood a line
of four footed animals they were unlike the others i
had met in that they had no spikes on their heads and
were of a much slenderer build but they were just as
primitive all around in tier upon tier of rings sat
hundreds of human beings

  just a glimpse i had and then the animals saw me
they bolted in all directions and shouts of terror arose
from the crowd

  i dont remember clearly what happened to me but
somewhere and somehow in the confusion which fol-
lowed i found tom in the act of starting his car his
first glance at me was one of pure alarm then he seemed
to think better of it

  get in he snapped weve got to get clear of this
somehow-and quick

  although i could make far better speed than that pre-
posterous machine it seemed better to accompany him
than to wander aimlessly

the crash

adly that night i gazed up at the red fourth
planet

  there rolled a world which i could understand
but here all around me was chaos incredible unreason-
ing madness

  with me in the machine sat three friends of toms
whom he had picked up at the last town and tom him-
self who was steering the contraption i shut my plate
off from their thoughts and considered the day i had
spent

  once he was assured that we were free from pursuit
tom had said to himself

  well i guess that deserves a drink

  then he stopped on a part of the hard strip which
was bordered by a row of artificial caves

  continually as the day wore on he led me past gaping
crowds into places where every man held a glass of col-
ored liquid strange liquids they were although men
do not value water on the third planet and each time
he proudly showed me to his friends in these places he
came to believe more firmly that he had created me

  towards sunset something seemed to go seriously
wrong with his machinery he leaned heavily upon me
for support and his voice became as uncertain as his
thoughts were jumbled
the lost machine



 anybody cornin my way he had inquired at last
 and at that invitation the other three men had joined
 us

 the machine seemed to have become as queer as the
 men in the morning it had held a straight line but now
 it swayed from side to side sometimes as though it
 would leave the track each time it just avoided the
 edge all four men would break off their continuous wail-
 ing sounds to laugh senselessly and loudly

 it was while i struggled to find some meaning in all
 this madness that the disaster occurred

 another machine appeared ahead its lights showed
 its approach and ours must have been as plain then
 an astounding thing happened instead of avoiding one
 another as would two intelligent machines the two lum-
 bering masses charged blindly together truly this was
 an insane world

 there came a rending smash our machine toppled
 over on its side the other left the hard strip struck
 one of the growths at the side of the road and burst
 into naked flames

 none of the four men seemed more than a little dazed
 as one of them scrambled free he pointed to the blaze

 thash good bonfire he said jolly good bonfire
 wonder if anybodysh inshide

 they all reeled over to examine the wreck while i
 forgotten waited for the next imbecility to occur on this
 nightmare world

 itsh a girl said toms voice 

 one of the others nodded solemnly

 i think youre right he agreed with difficult dignity

 after an interval there came the girls voice

 but what shall i do im miles from home

  sall righ said tom quite all righ you
 come along with me nishe fellow i am

 i could read the intention behind his words-so could
 the girl

 there was the sound of a scuffle

 no you dont my beauty no runnin away dan-
 geroush for lil girlsh--lone in the dark

 she started to scream but a hand quickly stifled the
 sound

 i caught the upsurge of terror in her mind and at that
 moment i knew her

 the girl whose machine i had mended-who had been
 grateful

 in a flash i was amongst them three of the men
 started back in alarm but not tom he was contemptu-
 ous of me because i had obeyed him he lifted a heavy
 boot to send it crashing at my lens human movement
 is slow before his leg had completed the back swing
 i had caught it and whirled him away the rest started
 futilely to close in on me

 i	picked the girl up in my fore-rods and raced away
 into the darkness out of their sight

discouragement

at first she was bewildered and not a little fright-
ened though our first meeting must have shown
 that i intended no harm

  gently i placed her on top of my case-work and hold-
ing her there with my fore-rods set off in the direction
of her journey she was hurt blood was pouring down
her right arm

we made the best speed my eight legs could take us

i	was afraid lest from lack of blood her mind might go
blank and fail to direct me at length it did her mental
vibrations had been growing fainter and fainter until
they ceased altogether but she had been thinking ahead
of us picturing the way we should go and i had read
her mind

at last confronted by a closed door she had shown me

i	pushed it down and held her out on my fore-rods to her
father

  joan   he said and for the moment seemed un-
surprised at me-the only third planet man who ever
was not until he had dressed his daughters wounds
and roused her to consciousness did he even look at me
again

  there is little more they have been kind those two
they have tried to comprehend though they cannot he
once removed a piece of my casing-i allowed him to do
so for he was intelligent-but he did not understand i
could feel him mentally trying to classify my structure
among electrically operated devices-the highest form of
power known to him but still too primitive

  this whole world is too primitive it does not even
know the metal of which i am made i am a freak  a
curiosity outside comprehension

  these men long to know how i was built i can read
in their minds that they want to copy me there is hope
for them some day perhaps they will have real ma-
chines of their own    but not through my help will
they build them nothing of me shall go to the making of
them

   i know what it is to be an intelligent machine in a
world of madness   

  the doctor looked up as he turned the last page

  and so he said it dissolved itself with my acids
he walked slowly over to the window and gazed up to
mars swimming serenely among a myriad stars

  i wonder he murmured i wonder

  he handed the typewritten sheets back to his daughter
joan my dear i think it would be wisest to burn
them we have no desire to be certified

  joan nodded

  as you prefer father she agreed

  the papers curled flared and blackened on the coals
-but joan kept a copy

     n our own little world we are doing pretty well if progress was not par-
     ticularly rapid at the beginning of life-as far as we know-civilization it
     seems to us has more than justified its existence within the last century-mechan-
     ically speaking but what if there is a race of intelligent beings somewhere in
     the universe to whom we might well seem like a lot of groping ignorant chil-

ohn baldwin stretched his long lank form
and arose from the easy chair his book fell to
the floor

   what you readin 

   his wife was sewing on little johns much torn
and worn breeches

 book on astronomy answered big john very in-
teresting tells all about the planets and stars and
things called nebulae and what inconceivable distances
there are between us and the stars we see each night
wheres alice

 abed and asleep an hour ago

 aliced be interested in this wasnt her professor
jameson quite a bug on stars

 pie in one hand and with the other jingling small
change in his pocket the tall man passed out into the
backyard to gaze at the stars about which he had been
reading the heavens shone with points of light mil-
lions of them perhaps the book had said that some
of them were billions of miles away even the closest
was too far even to be reached during a lifetime riding
in the swiftest airplane out in the back lot where the
horses were pastured the big pond reflected many ovf the
low-hung gorgeous diamonds of light shaking his head
as though to give it up the gaunt man turned to go
in to bed

   suddenly a flare from above lighted the land about
john baldwin wheeled and gazed in terrified awe at what
he saw high above nearly at the zenith was a great ball

   of blue-white light from it streamed a trail of fire that
appeared to extend back to the stars from whence it
seemed to come more brilliant it flared changing to a
blinding dazzling mass of light which bore down on the
little farm as a great demon intent on destruction a
shrill whistling sound filled the air and the terrified far-
mer screamed in horror as he saw his home and family
directly beneath this oncoming doom

  with a terrific crash the descending firebrand struck
the earth right in the center of the big pond a mighty
wave splashed into the air as spray a hiss of steam and
a detonation as of a siege mortar followed the earth
shook the buildings rocked and the horses and cattle
stampede as the pond waters struck the white hot object
in their center time after time blown back at each on-
rush by the great steam cushion formed at contact
vapor arose and filled the air a drizzle of moisture
began to fall as the vaporized water struck the cooler
air around and the pond waters churned and boiled

  john john mrs baldwin called in a voice which
trembled and shook

  im all right dear called the farmer please bring
our big electric torch and well see what damage has been
done looks like one of alices professors pets has
settled on us of a sudden

  examination showed little except that the stock was
uninjured except for a calf or jwo scaled by flying hot
water at the contact of the meteorite with the pond

  well no good staying up tonight no one is going
to steal it thats sure lets go to bed and see it in the
morning when its cooled off

chapter ii

  a lice awoke at dawn as her eyes drank in the
glory of the dawn spreading over the neat farm
- - they rested on the stock that was her fathers
pride how peculiar-they were all crowded to the
north fence whereas they were usually over at the pond
this time of day with eyes following mind to the pond
she started in genuine surprise pond there was none
more startling than that however was a gigantic shape
in the center of the pond bed glittering and flashing
in the sunlight slowly revolving on a central shaft was
a cylinder of burnished metal fully fifty feet high here
was a mystery to solve

 dad dad what is it

  big john was walking slowly around the big machine
-for machine it surely was no accident could produce
a perfect pyramid twelve sided and tapered beautifully
from each end of the cylinder to its middle

  well daughter looks as though one of your pro-
fessor jamesons pets had visited us the sides are all
so smooth and slick that i cant imagine where on earth
it could have been made and much less who could be
shooting such things about

  dad i dont believe you are really that dumb you
say it was very hot when it struck honestly dad is
there anything to conclude except that it has been sent
here from off the earth either by design or by accident
now you stay here and ill get my note book i want
you to make written notes of all that goes on while i
locate dr jameson-he must not miss this

  she disappeared briefly into the house and returned
with note book and pencil

  there dad ill be back in an hour

         	 

  by three oclock dr jameson was on the farm and
with alice and big john was hard at it to solve the prob-
lem of the visiting metal stranger

  do you believe it has come from without our earths
atmosphere doctor asked alice i cant recognize
the metal and the construction of the cylinder looks too
perfect

  i should say replied the professor that this
cylinder has been sent here by design from some place
outside our atmosphere offhand i should say it has
come an enormously long distance but we should know
soon for if youll observe the cylinder is becoming more
active

  sure enough the cylinder was opening up as the two
halves of the cylinder separated an inner wall appeared
it was much the same as the outer shell except that it
was perforated at regular intervals about the circum-
ference

  without any warning a violent hoot followed by a
screaming wail issued from the cylinder at the perfo-
ration point

  better get away said professor jameson the
near future will show what type of intelligence made
that and what type of being it expected to find on this
earth

  as the three hastily descended to the ground the wail
was repeated much louder this time
trun shouted big john run for the house

   the sides of the cylinder were pouring out a dense
black cloud from the perforations this rose immedi-

ately toward the heavens and spread into a giant plume
the great signal column floated slowly up another
issued with a loud blowing noise ten times it was re-
peated then the hooting began again then hoots
followed by screeches that fairly split the eardrums
then again the signal glouds

	 

  no further movement of any kind was observed about
the cylinder until after dusk light was fading fast from
the sky and still no movement or sound about the big
cylinder finally alice squealed in delight as the cyl-
inder came to life the aperture from which the dark
smoke had appeared was streaming out a golden rain
accompanied by luminous vapors-a vivid pink which
rolled out and up billowing and massing as it rose high
into the heavens suddenly there was complete dark-
ness  even the vapor glow was quenched from out the
blackness a blinding flash split the darkness and a second
later the three observers were literally blown to earth by
a concussion that made all deaf for a full minute again
complete blackness save for the points of stars

wow wasnt that an ear splitter said big john

  at this moment the next spasm began and the trio
watched with wonder the issuance of the pink vapor the
billowing and when the darkness came they all threw
themselves flat and placed hands over their ears an-
other terrific explosion-then silence and darkness

  how long do you believe these signals will last big
john asked his question in a rather worried tone of
voice

  signals will continue at more or less regular inter-
vals for weeks unless we can find a way to stop them
it would seem reasonable to expect some sort of method
of stopping them to be provided by the being who de-
signed that cylinder well go to bed now and tomorrow
we may be able to find a way to stop the signals and
get inside

chapter iii

dawn found the doctor abroad and active at
sunrise big john was at his side after con-
siderable experimentation the exposed shell of
the cylinder yielded to a pry bar and a large section of
the cylinder flew off revealing a dim interior the three
investigators climbed in and gazed about them evenly
distributed about the small room were beings lying as
though dead the general appearance of each was that
of a quadruped in size about as large as a big bulldog
the rest of the body was perfectly smooth and nearly
the shape of an egg

  to one side of the small circular room jameson found
a metal box closed by a common hasp type of fastening
this he quickly opened inside was a large sheaf of a
material that resembled paper but was certainly a su-
perior material with the assistance of big john the
box and sheaf were wrenched loose from the small shelf
to which they had been fastened unfolding the sheaf
of opaque yet unbelievably thin sheets of paper-like
material they gazed with utter awe upon the most beau-
tiful panorama photograph in colors that man could
imagine across the top of the picture was a long set
of characters-very evidently writing of some sort

  passing over the photo to the rest of the manuscript
the three people attempted to make something of the
beautifully executed figures they found there
cosmic steeple-chase



  obviously this is writing but of what kind we can
only guess the code used is extremely simple i sin-
cerely doubt if we are any of us intelligent enough to
decode that

  they turned page after page of the manuscript and to
their delight found nearly every page bore a photograph
with lines of the hieroglyphics below it evidently in ex-
planation and discussion of the photographic view one
photo showed what was evidently an evening scene
strangely enough there were three suns setting along the
horizon three suns should indicate but one thing the
planet on which the photos were made was somewhere
out in space far from our own solar system

  now for the rest of this treasure house said dr
jameson laying down the manuscript well find
many interesting things if im not mistaken lets hope
they are not all as grotesque and horrifying as the display
here on the floor

  the party went slowly down into the cylinder where
they found much of importance showing the types of
life models of machinery and pictures of scenes from
the land from which the cylinder had come

  progressing on to the room above the industrial dis-
play the three humans found in it a veritable wealth of
articles and demonstrations which depicted the art liter-
ature science and research of the beings who lived on
this far away planet

  suddenly he pointed in great excitement at the sketch-
ings before him

  friends you are looking at the very first navigation
map of the universe that earth beings ever saw this
is a map showing the position in space of the more im-
portant star groups and certain centers where planets
may be found about some of the bigger older stars
note this grouping the lines that represent flight and
this other group over here

  scarcely able to contain his enthusiasm the professor
searched further while alice and her dad scanned the
map to the upper left was a grouping of stars evi-
dently seven of them in a group down at the lower
edge was a set of stars which could be recognized only as
one group-that commonly known as the big dipper
true to our view of stars the two outer stars in the cup
of the dipper formed a nearly direct line toward a single
brilliant star on the map located about one-third the way
from the left edge of the map this star was a
brilliant red color with a few rays about it easily
recognized about this were a few less brilliant stars
arranged in the form of the familiar little bear about
the big bright red star picture were arranged ten
small dots all at diiferent positions from the fifth dot
out from the red star was a line which streamed across
the pictured space in a magnificent curve terminating
at one of nine dots surrounding a rather small yellow-
ish spot which evidently was a star

  let me show you said dr jameson here we are
at the left you recognize the great bear or big dipper
it of course points to the north star polaris with two
of its stars polaris is part of the little bear which we
see represented by those stars about polaris over here
you see the tiny yellow star surrounded by its nine dots
alice if you cant deduce the meaning of that from the
rest of the constellations i fear your courses with me
were lost motion and energy what puny little star do
you think that is

  why dr jameson its our own tiny old sol and the

dots are its nine children the planets furthermore the
line sweeping across the space shown here is supposed to
represent the path of this cylinder in which we stand
leading us to infer that this cylinder was made and pro-
jected from the fifth planet of a planetary system about
polaris

  now dad what you dont know is that polaris is 
trillion miles from us and that therefore its light requires
some  years to reach us according to calculation this
cylinder could have been made fairly recently as we do
not believe that speed of material objects in space is
limited except by the time required to acquire velocity
or should i say to exercise acceleration of course light
travels rapidly but even light is slow compared to what
speed might be attained by a properly attracted or pro-
pelled object which traveled freely in space

  well gasped the professor that is exactly what i
deduced

  lets go and get some lunch though we can each
take an armload of these manuscripts and this map and
work on them outside wre have an excellent start with
this map and the labels on some of these things we
recognize

chapter iv

eager hands opened the door of his car as
jameson pulled up with a swirl at the doorstep of
john baldwins modest home

  harry-i-i mean professor jameson im so glad
to see you

  alice became confused and glanced about to see if any-
one had heard her blunder

   i cant tell you how delighted i am to be here alice
and do call me harry

  are you planning to stay indefinitely alice
laughed as she indicated a large gladstone that the pro-
fessor was hauling out of the tonneau of his car

   this young lady contains the result of three months
study and travel in his bag is more new knowledge
than you can find in a score of encyclopedias

  are the manuscripts finished  how did you do it all
in this short time but do come in

  yes i should say come in young fellow give me
that mysterious bag and follow my young imp alice to
your room well have supper as soon as you wash and
brush up a bit

  john baldwin known popularly as big john pushed
the two young people ahead of him into the house de-
posited the heavy traveling bag in the hallway and
watched with evident pleasure while alice led the way
upstairs to jamesons room

   seated at the table at the close of the delicious supper
the group of people began to edge the conversation
around to include queries about the great piece of news
that they all knew jameson had brought

  to reiterate a bit began professor jameson when
they had adjourned to the living-room we consider our-
selves fortunate to have translated the written records
of our visitors these notebooks are translations of the
manuscripts each represented three months work
he lifted from the group of manuscripts the one they
had first looked at in it they found the beautiful cokr
photographs which showed orange colored foliage and
peculiar forms of life on what they had found was the
fifth planet of a group of ten revolving about the polaris
group of suns


amazing stories

  this contains much that is of interest but even more
we find in these other manuscripts now as to the
general method used in translating or should i say inter-
preting these when i left here i went immediately
to an old friend of mine whom i knew to be intensely
in astronomy and who is immensely wealthy i finally
prevailed on this mr blake to subsidize a translation of
these manuscripts i engaged six assistants and have
been hard at work since and so interested in the whole
proposition has mr blake become that he has placed
the bulk of his fortune at my disposal as head of a group
whose lives will be devoted to the thorough investigation
of what we find in these manuscripts

  i have here a brief outline of the combined trans-
lations of all these manuscripts the professor continued
in his discussions of the summers work on the manu-
scripts shall i read it

  yes please do please alice begged

  there followed several hours of reading of the trans-
lations discussions of what was read and study on the
plans sent for use during the proposed trip to polaris
complete plans were found for building a space ship
capable of making the long journey through space to
polaris and with these were whole volumes on the life
and conditions to be found on polaris planets

  at last the final parts of the translations were reached
and jamesons reading concluded

   we suggest that you collect about you a representa-
tive group of your best intelligences and interest them in
this proposed trip it will likely take the length of ten
revolutions of your planet about your sun for the entire
trip we assure you that you will return to your planet
and bear with you enough knowledge to make you as
the gods among your fellow-beings

  that was all we could get clear jameson finished
up fortunately the plans and directions for the space
traveler are very plain-many photos diagrams actual
pieces of material and clear cut designs

  john its one oclock i think you all ought to
come to bed

  all right flora well quit for tonight i wonder
if ill see whirling planets and great many-colored balls
of fire chasing each other through my dreams con-
cluded big john

  he did so did jameson and alice but that wasnt
all that these two dreamed about some way the stars
were all blue eyed for jameson and alice saw a tall
sandy-haired professor striding about on her dream-
moons

chapter v

would like to see mr blake please

  the speaker a young man dark in complexion
addressed himself to the doorman at the home of
jordon blake

  come in i will tell mr blake you are here and give
him your card sir

  thank you replied the young man as he went into
the library

  five minutes passed and at length a voice aroused
the visitor frorn the deep contemplation of a set of star
charts on one wall

  you are mr allen bellant i judge the older man
asked pleasantly of his visitor

  yes and you are mr blake i have come to make

a request of you mr blake will we be quite alone
yes indeed what can i do for you asked blake
as he closed the hall doors

  i have in the recent past been called in for consulta-
tion on certain decoding work being done under the
direction of a professor jameson you know him im
sure

  yes indeed i know jameson-fine fellow but just
whats the connection queried blake

  mr blake i happened to stumble into the entire story
connected with that decoding work and have at my finger
tips all the data and information with which to organize
my own party build a space ship and go to polaris as a
representative of earth it happens that i know you
have set your heart on being the first of earth-men to
visit our star neighbors for this reason alone i think
you would rather i did not set up my own party and beat
you to it my proposition is this you will engage me
as the official physicist for this proposed trip you are
backing oh i know all about it-how you neednt
know if you dont see my way ill have to get financial
backing elsewhere and take all the glory of leaving first
i understand the plans and principles of the proposed
space ship better than anyone now connected with it
young man do you know that you are trying to
blackmail me that doesnt go here-ill hire whom i
please for this trip i dont believe you anyway the
plans for our future trip have been locked away in a
safety vault ever since they were worked out-you are
bluffing and anyway i dont see why i should be bullied
by the first stranger who happens along

  jordon blake ill ask you to glance at these sheets
of van dyke prints and he held out a sheaf of plans
to the older man

  well-what have you to say now

  i-well-damn it young man you are plain racket-
eering-blackmailing i guess you do have the dope on
the space ship but i shall expose you-have you arrested
and put in prison for blackmail my word is law in this
vicinity blake sputtered growing excited

  my dear sir lets not get excited why use that
ugly term blackmail  i am merely making you what i
feel is a very fair proposition i am offering you silence
and assistance in your proposed trip for the mere privi-
lege of accompanying you on the voyage as physicist
s for your threat of openly condemning me and having
me arrested if i were you id be careful what i did
may i recall to your memory that there is a certain
colored gentleman hiding in your firewood i mention
the name of worthington need i say more

  bellant smiled with a crooked sort of twist to his
mouth and laughed gently as blake flushed hotly then
went pale

  where did you hear my name associated with that
of worthington it was all a mistake started by a
malicious lie i was perfectly square and then he lied
about it all i had to do it orlose my entire fortune
i tell you i was square it was all a terrible mistake
the courts would not think it square should i choose
to tell what i know i may find it necessary to publish
what might rob you of every cent you now have of
course if you are reasonable and comply with my very
modest request that i be engaged as your official physicist
on the trip to polaris i am sure i can forget and let by-
gones be by-gones

  i wont submit to such brow-beating you cant
cosmic steeple-chase



scare me that way youve heard some remark dropped
somewhere and are using it to try to frighten me into
giving you what you want no im damned if ill con-
sider you at all for the trip

  jordon blake blustered mightily and accompanied his
outburst with sweeping gestures

  very well said bellant quietly you are making
the decision for me in order to get the financial support
i need to beat you out to polaris i shall have to expose
your dark past i am afraid-much as i regret it

  he rose to leave picking up his hat and cane and
passed into the hallway blake remained irresolute be-
side the mantel once he started forward then stepped
back

  i must bid you good evening mr blake bellant
spoke gravely and disappeared from the library door
blakes voice suddenly came dearly from the library
bellant wait come back you win

  bellant hesitated a moment then at a second call from
blake he closed the door and returned to the library

  i am glad to see you are reasonable after all mr
blake he said

  im not reasonable or id throw you out bellant
however i believe we can use a man of your wits on
this trip you shall be signed up now as our official
physicist on the trip to polaris providing you will sign
a statement that you know absolutely nothing about my
private affairs here is paper and my pen write out
our contract you will include the statement i have men-
tioned what salary do you want

  all i ask is that you completely furnish a private
laboratory aboard this space ship in accord with my di-
rections this is to be entirely secret and you will have
to agree to know absolutely nothing about it-you
scarcely know me and engaged me because of my reputa-
tion do you understand you must not interfere in
any way with experiments i may wish to perform do
you agree very well ill put it all in the contract
half an hour later the two men parted at the door
apparently good friends

  i am sure we will get along famously on our coming
voyage said bellant now that we thoroughly under-
stand each other he added as a parting shot and turn-
ing on his heel got into his car and drove off

chapter vi

he next morning about nine oclock a young man
called at the farm and asked to see jameson

  it was alice who met him and informed him that
jameson would be back from town shortly in the
meantime it would be her pleasure to entertain a friend
of professor jameson

  my name is allen bellant the caller told her

  i am alice baldwin i was a student under profes-
sor jameson last year in college i studied astronomy in
his classes

  i guess you are interested in the interstellar visitor
you had last spring then the visitor suggested that
cylinder is my reason for coming although i see now i
didnt know what attractions there were up here he
continued looking boldly at the girl

  alice flushed and laughed confusedly she was not
sure she liked this young fellow-yet he was young and
appeared to be interesting

maynt i show you about the farm a little the girl

suggested and presently the two of them were wander-
ing from meadow to woodland from pasture land to the
barnyard laughing and talking

  shortly harry jameson drove up parked his car and
went into the house a little later he came out looked
about for alice and seeing her with a young man de-
cided not to interrupt as he was turning to sit down
on the porch alice saw him and immediately brought
bellant to the house

  professor jameson this is mr bellant a friend of
yours i have been entertaining him while he awaited
your return from town

  bellant of course i know him he was a great
aid in helping us over certain technical points in decod-
ing of the plans we looked at last night

  jameson welcomed bellant warmly and asked what
brought him this far from his home

  explanations followed and bellant gave jameson a let-
ter of introduction and instruction from jordan blake
in which the financier asked that bellant be given all de-
tails as he was to accompany the party on the polaris
trip since bellant had an exceptionally good reputation
as a physicist jameson was very pleased with the pros-
pect had he known to what direction bellants atten-
tion was going to turn during this proposed trip he
would never have consented to go ahead with the plans
even during the examination of the cylinder and in the
long discussion in the afternoon harry found much
amusement in the rather open admiration bellant showed
alice sometimes to the girls confusion several times
jameson found bellants mind and eyes centered on alice
at the end of a long explanation of some parts of the
plans for the ship and trip

  that evening bellant proposed that the whole family
go into town to see a movie after much discussion
the family decided that just alice harry and bellant
should go and that the rest would stay at home this time
it was finally so arranged and the trio went off to the
small city soon after the evening dinner

  after the show they visited a confectioners for a dish
of ice cream where bellant monopolized the attention of
alice and in every way held the center of the girls in-
terest

  jameson pondered was he he wondered quite sud-
denly really jealous such a thought had never entered
his head before but as the idea filtered in and about his
mind he became suddenly conscious that he felt a
genuine affection for this student he had taught she
had flowered out so much during the summer-had liter-
ally grown up from a college girl to a young woman

  at return to the farm jameson agreed to get together
a set of data for bellant to take with him that evening
on his return home in the meantime bellant said he
and alice would stroll about the yard in the moonlight
jameson hurried through the drawings and notes he was
copying for bellant and in half an hour went outside in
search of the couple

  he called softly but had no reply a thorough search
of the yard disclosed no sign of the two and harry was
at a loss as to where to find them suddenly he heard
a voice raised in mild protest it was alice speaking

  please dont mr bellant

  the voice came from the summer house down the lane
toward the wooded part of the farm again the protest
came

  i asked you to stop




amazing

stories

  but i love you girl jameson heard bellant say in a
very low voice

  nonsense replied alice youve only just met
me anyway i am not sure i like you-i know i shall
not if you insist on annoying me

  silence ensued and harry debated whether he should
intrude or simply wait for them to return from the sum-
mer house the final outcry decided him

  allen bellant if you touch me again i shall go in
and leave you

  harry was off like a streak the girl was being an-
noyed and harry was certain now that his interest in
alice was at least more than casual as jameson arrived
at the summer house where the moonlight filtered
through in black lace and silver bellant stepped up to
alice took her in his arms and attempted to kiss her

  mr bellant alice cried in alarm and then as if in
appeal and pleading to a protector she called aloud
harry harry

  with an exaltation of soul and a thrill of greater joy
than he had ever known before jameson covered the dis-
tance between them in a bound grasped bellant by the
shoulder and whirled him back against the railing with
a crash the physicist struck the low seat tripped and
plunged headlong over the side to the grass below

  oh thank you harry the girl cried softly as jame-
son gathered her into one quick embrace unfortunately
bellant had picked himself up just in time to see the two
in each others arms

  so thats it is it he half sneered well of course
i didnt know i was trespassing im sorry if i caused
you any worry old man but i completely lost my head
too much moonlight i guess

  your drawings and data are in your car bellant
id rather not talk to you now youd better go i will
look you up later

  jameson spoke in a restrained voice obviously holding
himself in leash only by great effort

  all right ill go dont forget though im going
on that trip to polaris with you i rather suspect miss
baldwin plans to go too doesnt she

  with a queer little laugh bellant left them and they
heard him slam his car door

  the man and woman stood quietly side by side while
bellant made his retreat then as the car slipped away
into the distance harry turned to the girl and started
to speak

  no lets go in-not tonight i-i dont trust myself
now you were wonderful and i want to think about
it i-i just called for you as if you belonged to me
didnt i

  as he started to speak again alice hushed him a sec-
ond time

  no-not tonight we are not ourselves right now
i cant trust myself to judge sanely now im too happy
yet a little frightened too take me in harry

  it was well past midnight when jameson arose from
his lonely seat on the porch and made his way to bed
calmed at last and infinitely happy

chapter vii

just a year and a day had passed since the arrival
of the cylinder from polaris during that time the
complete translation of the manuscript had been
made and directions for a space ship followed to com-
pletion

  the last potato had been stowed away in the food
lockers ten years supply of condensed milk was aboard
refrigerating rooms held hundreds of whole animals
for fresh meat supply thousands of small packages of
spices teas coffees and condiments were stowed away
below the enormous enameled water tank had been
filled and the water purifiers and recoverers were in
place for work not a molecule of water should escape
from this ship once abroad in space in the storerooms
were myriads of blocks of chocolate and various con-
centrated foods huge slabs of compressed dehydrated
vegetables were stacked aside tons of dried fruits and
hundreds of cases of canned fruits filled one section
barrels of lime juice occupied one refrigeration room
another was stacked with several tons of butter and
margarine each compartment was crammed to the
limit everything that could possibly be needed was
provided and a space found for it in this big ship which
was soon to sail the seas of space

  the night of june st was clear and cloudless about
the completed ship were hundreds of tents this was
the big night and many people were there to witness
the take-off of the ship many had come to witness what
they termed the big flop they did not believe that
the ship would actually fly others were there to see
the greatest event in history take place a delegation of
scientists from foreign nations arrived about ten oclock

  the members of the expedition or interstellar league
were all established in their apartments all told there
were twenty-six scientists three ladies including alice
baldwin and two of the wives of the scientists besides
these there was a cook two maids and a steward the
time of departure had been set for midnight and every-
one was excited even staid and elderly professors
paced the floor and nervously wished the ship was on
her way relatives of the passengers were saying their
goodbyes and wives were departing in tears as they left
their husbands for at least ten years-many firmly be-
lieved forever john baldwin and his wife were visit-
ing calmly with jameson and their daughter alice to
them the greatest blow would come when the huge ship
actually rose from the ground into space

  outside flares lighted the glade about the traveler
and sightseers sat patiently about waiting the exciting
event soon to take place some had built camp fires and
large shadows danced across the tree tops at the edge of
the cleared space in the woods everyone became more
restless as the time eased up toward midnight

  at eleven fifty all but passengers were ordered off the
ship at eleven fifty-five the doors swung into place and
were sealed-no one knew for how long the oxygen
apparatus was started and the purifiers started their
long grind of work the port windows showed a glow
of light from within and at one side where a small bulge
occurred in the side of the ship the astronomical instru-
ments were being trained on polaris with great care

  at one minute to twelve at a signal from within the
ship john baldwin threw a switch on a nearby tree
which fired ten cannons that shot skyward flaring pro-
jectiles long trails of green red blue and golden rain
fell away behind these signals the whole countryside
for a hundred miles was watching for this-telegraph
wires sang and radios flashedthe news abroad it meant
the departure of the earth for polaris

  thirty seconds left big john stepped under the ship
to the base ignited a master fuse which led to six enor-
cosmic steeple-chase



mous flares of magnesium metal on the base these
would be visible for hundreds of miles as the ship
streaked out into space

  ten seconds a shrill whistle split the air and every-
one in the glade started back as close to the edge of the
woods as possible

  two seconds yet a salute of three bombs shot up
into the air and exploded with terrific concussions on the
exact stroke of midnight and on the second the space
ship swayed slightly slowly rose like a balloon and ever
gaining speed fled out and up toward the pole star its
flares lighting the whole land about

  as it shot up and away a great shout arose from the
assembled group colored lights sprayed a rain of fire
and balls of red and green from the edges of the ether
ship that flashed out after the stars the whole affair
seemed a mass of colored lights and fire this was the
greatest celebration man had known for centuries-the
fences of space were being hurdled and man rode the
steed that raced in the steeple-chase

  john baldwin sobbed aloud and turned to his wife
her eyes were full of tears but she uttered no sound
out into eternity two of their dearest and nearest ones
sailed-pioneers on the cosmic ocean of space

chapter viii

t x ow perfectly absurd laughed alice baldwin
i-i as she lifted a whole library table on one hand
 - and moved it across the side of the room
whatever can be the explanation of that harry i
could never lift that table on earth what changes have
come over us to so increase my strength 

  the party composed of some thirty scientists had been
some hours on the way toward their goal-the star
polaris the large space ship in which alice and harry
stood bore some twenty-eight other souls through the
cosmic night on toward the pole star bound for the fifth
planet in the system of ten that had been found tosur-
round polaris

  your strength has not increased dear except as we
think in terms of relativity the gravitational effect of
earth is no longer felt by the articles in the ship if it
were not for the artificial dense body in our base the
furniture would all float about the room in response to
every breeze or air current if you tried to walk you
would find yourself shooting across the room to bang
into the other wall

  i see what you mean but cant you explain it a little
more fully im dumb i guess

  dearest you dont need to be bothered with any
more explanations suffice it to say that the pedestal
of this ship is loaded with a close relative of neutronium
that mythical element made of condensed protons and
electrons the gravity effected thereby or the space
curving is about half as great as earth itself but lets
forget all that and dream of the future it seems a long
time-ten years-till we can be together for always but
nfark my words before you know it well have been
on our journey for a year

  what do you mean harry

  jordan blake entered the room at that moment and
paused to listen to what harry had to say

  according to our watches and the ships log about
three terrestrial years will elapse before we set foot on
land again-if we dont get annihilated between times

however youll never believe it you see we wont
eat more than once in three days with gravity halved
and traveling without any real time unit to observe but
our watches time becomes only relative of course as
we lose track of time our watches will soon get out of
adjustment we do not do so many things nor do our
bodies need to function at such a speed as formerly-
result we do not grow old so rapidly the ten years
of time to be consumed in the journey earthly speaking
will cause a change of only about five years in those
aboard this ship seems incredible but youli find k
true now off to rest alice-one tires even out in
space

  im a bit curious about some of the features of our
trip i never understood

  jordan blake blew a cloud of blue smoke toward the
lights in the ceiling and continued

  from my limited reading on such subjects i under-
stood that as a body approaches the speed of light il
becomes shorter and shorter in the direction of motion
until at a speed of  miles a second it would be
but half the length it was originally if it reached the
speed of light it would have become zero in length is
that right

  it is not in my opinion answered the young profes-
sor quickly you refer to the lorenz-fitzgerald theory
of course we of this cruise have come to regard this
theory as possible only when applied according to earthly
standards

  you tell us continued mr blake that we will
cover the distance between earth and polaris in three
solar years or less and in the same breath you state that
polaris is  light-years from earth i gather from that
we will average twenty-three times the speed of light
on our trip am i right

  you are correct mr blake as a matter of fact
i see no reason why we could not gain much higher
speeds than that however speed becomes only rela-
tive to ones capacity for conceiving it in my opinion
if one thinks in large thoughts he should be able ta
take in the idea of eternally gaining speed we scientists
have concluded after much thought that we are not
traveling in ordinary space once we reach the speeds
approaching that of light we begin to travel in the fourth
dimension of space we believe the laws we so solemn-
ly pronounced correct as professors of physics and
mathematics do not seem to hold once we get off the
earth it would seem certain that we would be crushed
by the acceleration of this ship as it rushes faster and
faster we are not subject to the same conditions here
as on earth-thus every molecule of the ship and con-
tents is pulled equally along so there is no tendencj
for any part to flatten out as we used to believe sudden
high acceleration would treat organic bodies

  run along professor ill think it all over you
must get your rest because well need you at your besl
on this trip

chapter ix

the daily routine continued to be kept and as alice
had taken on the responsibility of keeping the time
and calendar for the party it was she who an-
nounced finally that they had been on their way some
two and a half years throughout this time the ship had
hurtled through space at the unimaginable speed of some
five million miles a second


amazing

stories

  the mathematician in the party had long ago ceased
to argue about the speed of the ship for the first year
a constant effort had been made to bring theory and fact
together in figures and formulas showing that the speed
being attained was theoretically possible speeds greater
than light had always been conceived impossible yet the
facts remained that they were making twenty-three times
the speed of light the famous theory of lorenz-fitz-
gerald stating that as the speed of a body increased to-
ward that of light the body contracted physically in
the direction of motion did not seem to hold after
much discussion and thought the entire body of scien-
tists confirmed the opinion of jameson that the ship must
no longer be traveling in regular three dimensional space
whether the machine and its occupants had passed into
a higher dimension was no longer problematical-it ap-
peared to be cold fact in other words harry explained
to alice at the speed they had attained they could no
longer be bounded by three dimensional space but had
become subject to the laws of another dimension

   the first sign of trouble aboard appeared almost simul-
taneously with alices announcement that only six months
of earth time remained before the scheduled arrival at
erb the planet for which they were headed for nearly a
year the physicist aboard allen bellant had been paying
a little too much attention to alice in the opinion of
harry jameson this was not at first annoying but as
the attentions became more and more insistent alice
showed great resentment and even spoke to bellant
assuring him that he was wasting his time apparently
this meant nothing to the young scientist for he con-
tinued his personal favors and even increased his efforts
to talk to the girl admonitions by the older men in the
party did not deter him and it was only after an open
breach of faith that jameson finally forced himself to
accost the young fellow

  it was while the greater portion of the ships popula-
tion was asleep that the first clash came alice had just
left harry on watch for other space ships to return to
her stateroom and was passing up through the darkened
corridor when allen bellant suddenly stepped out from
behind a pillar and confronted her

  oh you startled me so mr bellant the girl
gasped as she struggled to regain her composure i
had no idea anyone was about

  so i surprised you eh well i guess i can get some
of your favors too why dont you give me a break
ive tried every way to interest you and you just give
me a cold stare i tell you i love you

  the girl recoiled from this outburst against the wall
of the ship a half frightened expression on her face

  oh dont try to high-hat me resumed the young
fellow now entirely irrational i know what im say-
ing and im going to have you see i dont care how
but get me youll be mine sooner or later

  mr bellant cried the wrathful girl fully herself
again i will ask you to stand aside and allow me to go
to my rooms i dont care to discuss anything with you
and certainly pot in the ugly mood in which you now
seem to be

  oh you dont dont you well we wont need to
discuss it ill just take what i want and make you
like it

  the man strode forward suddenly and caught alice
before she knew what was happening with all her
strength the girl fought off this half-crazed fellow but

she was no match for his strength farther and farther
back he bent her attempting to get the kiss he thought
he should have the girls back was nearly broken and
her head swam as she struggled to free herself with
a last effort she screamed aloud

  harry harry

  damn you you witch ill have you yet call your
lover and see what good it does

  with this the young physicist dropped alice where she
was and fled only an instant before jameson appeared at
the lower end of the corridor

  alice alice did you call

  jameson hurried up the dark hallway and did not even
see the girl before he tripped over her prostrate body

  dear are you hurt what was it tell me
quickly he cried in tense but low tones

  alice smiled weakly at him and shook her head sink-
ing immediately into unconsciousness jameson lifted
her quickly and took her to the rooms of his colleague
smith whose wife was aboard shortly they had re-
vived the girl and she sat up blinking

  what was it dear harry pressed the question

  i-i dont exactly remember the girl faltered
something large and black came to me and frightened
me ill be all right now i guess no id rather go
back on watch with harry ill feel safer there

  after their return to the observatory the girl confided
to jameson just what had occurred for many minutes
they discussed it and after mature thought harry arose
and went directly to bellants room to see the fellow
better have it out at once harry thought

  at jamesons knock the door was flung open by the
defiant and sullen bellant

  ive nothing to say to you i dont want to talk to
you you must think im dumb not to know what goes
on between you and that girl oh dont look so right-
eous-im not blaming you any i simply intend getting
mine too

  this tirade from the physicist was met in stony silence
by jameson the young astronomers face was slowly
whitening and becoming tense bellant noted this and
suddenly fear entered his heart and a frightened look
flitted over his face he tried to shut the door but
jameson flung it open throwing the culprit to the floor
within stepping inside harry closed and locked the
door

  bellant i ought to whip you within an inch of your
life for those last remarks what you infer is neither
true nor in any way justified by miss baldwin or myself
i gather that you said practically the same thing to miss
baldwin that is unforgivable i came here to dis-
cuss this with you calmly you meet me with vile in-
sinuations i dont know that i am doing you a favor
by refraining from thrashing you good

  by this time bellant had fully recovered from his
momentary faint-heartedness rose insolently and with a
swagger faced jameson a leer and smirk twisting his
good-looking mouth into a half smile

  trying to scare me out playing the hero why
take that better than thou attitude afraid ill horn in
and take her away from you why man i know how
lovely she is you cant have her all yourself as i
said before i intend to get mine just as you are getting
yours

  jameson went white his body became tense his eyes
flashed steel-blue sparks as he spoke
cosmic steeple-chase



  i warned you i told you you were mistaken now
hear this you are a lying coward i gave you the benefit
of the doubt before now ill give you something else

  with a stride jameson covered the distance between
them and struck bellant full on the jaw ordinarily the
blow would have felled a larger man but bellant was on
his toes and kept his senses striking back with all his
strength back and forth they fought around the room
upsetting tables smashing chairs tearing the drapes and
creating a fearful hub-bub on their feet now clinching
and rolling heavily about gauging each other pounding
and strangling it was the primitive beast in each man
fighting for the possession of the one woman on their
feet once more the two circled cautiously suddenly
jameson tripped on a torn rug falling to one knee in-
stantly bellant rushed him a broken chair leg upraised to
strike jameson froze in his position his body steeled
to answer the instant command his mind was ready to
flash as bellant towered above him bringing the chair
leg down with terrific force toward jamesons skull the
kneeling man flashed into action his right fist shot up
like a bolt of lightning his left shoulder caught the terri-
ble blow of the chair leg as he rose the right fist catch-
ing bellant squarely under the chin and lifting him clear
off the floor without a grunt or a groan the physicist
sailed through the air and alighted in a dishevelled and
unconscious heap jameson looked once at the fallen
man and turned to go

  open this door shouted a voice outside and some-
one pounded heavily on the panels jameson went to the
door shot back the bolt and flung open the door

  what is the meaning of this what is this fight
about  who began the affair  a hundred questions
from the ten people assembled outside the door fell
quickly from their lips past them all jameson strode
turning to answer only as he reached the end of the
corridor

  ask bellant he said and disappeared

chapter x

during the next six months very little was seen
of bellant about the ship he seemed to have
been completely cowed by the beating he had re-
ceived from jameson most of the time the young phy-
sicist spent in a private laboratory of his own which he
had fitted up before leaving earth what he was doing
no one knew as he took no one into his confidence

  as the period of three years drew to a close bellant
was forgotten in the excitement of the approach to their
goal every hour brought the system of the polaris
suns and planets closer and closer

  the day came when the entire system of four suns
and the accompanying ten planets was visible in the
larger of the telescopes the primary set alpha with
its three units seemed to be the center of the planetary
system the secondary star the ninth magnitude com-
panion of alpha seemed at an enormous distance from
the primary bodies and seemed to have little or no effect
on the planets all three bodies in alpha were excep-
tionally brilliant and the pair which rotated as a sort
of dumb-bell shaped unit end over end were light blue
and a pink color respectively the central body about
which this gyrating pair swung was a dazzling white-
not yellow like old sol had been but pure intense white

  it was while engaged in observations on this system of

suns that the discovery was made far ahead to the left
several of the party using low power telescopes noted
several odd black shapes these increased from pin
points to definite dots in the space of a minute and at
the same time took on a definite shape-long and thin
like wee dashes of black in space

  immediately jameson ordered the speed of the earth
ship checked besides wishing to come up slowly to
these bits of matter he thought it high time that they
return to the third dimension of space by cutting down
enormously on speed they were getting perilously near
their goal to travel at rates so excessive of normal
interplanetary speed a slow approach would give time
for observation also

  by this time the black dashes in space had become
definite shapes they were much like black cigars in
appearance now-very far off but of definite shapes and
therefore not stray matter in space

  the first of our colleagues i wonder from where
these space ships came we will know soon now for a
few days more will put us into yon system and down to
our landing on erb the fifth planet of the system

  jameson talked with alice considerably during the
next few hours and the two were the first to discover
the ship overtaking them from behind or properly
below them

  immediately ten of the scientists donned space suits
and in groups of three or four went through the air
locks out on the hull of the space flyer to watch the over-
taking ship pass them they took with them celestial
maps on which earth and old sol were plainly indicated
if opportunity offered these would be sent to the passing
stranger

  the small speck behind gradually grew to a sizable
spot took on shape and finally drew alongside the earth
flyer the newcomer was built in the form of a sphere
and had no ports or windowsvisible it was made of
what looked like a glass with all the visual qualities of
some of earths white metals several of the scientists
at once decided it must be made of a transparent metal
of some sort or else a specially hardened and colored
glass

  jameson and the rest who went out on the hull
waved and signalled every type of code they thought
might even be noticed by the occupants of the strange
ship as no doors or windows showed on the hull of
the sphere the earth men assumed that the hull of the
ship must be transparent at least from within they
were unable to peer into the sphere from the earth ship

  by now the sphere ship had come to the same speed
as the earth flyer and by token of this jameson reasoned
that the occupants of the stranger had recognized the
earth men as living beings suddenly a small section of
the sphere swung inward on a hinge and from within
the port thus formed a small sphere floated out followed
by five more-a dull grey colored fabric body it appeared
to be these seemed to be propelled by small jets of
escaping gas under pressure one sailed over to the
earth ship circled above the heads of the men and re-
turned to its own ship suddenly all of the fabric
spheres rose and flashed over the intervening space be-
tween the flyers coming to rest on the hull of the earth
ship

  the jameson party gathered around the visitors and
were suddenly surprised to see a plate in one of the
fabric sides glow to light on it came a diagrammatic


amazing stories

picture of the solar system a pointer indicated the
third planet earth and a picture of a man appeared be-
side it across the plate a way the diagram indicated
the ninth planet of the solar system discovered by earth
men only a few years earlier beside this planet appeared
a picture of a small sphere-like body with short ap-
pendages-all covered with heavy scales suddenly the
picture became a movie-the sphere body pictured rushed
across the diagram to the earth man and with a small
instrument detached from its belt sent a brilliant crim-
son streamer at the man blasting him to shimmering
dust there followed in quick succession a movie of the
two space flyers and as the two approached the polaris
system the earth ship was pictured to turn tail and speed
away back toward earth the plate darkened then
flashed a picture of the two ships approaching the polaris
system closely suddenly the spherical ship flashed side-
wise and crashed into the earth ship which it burst
asunder and passed on through unharmed

  the plate went black and with a quick jerk the six
fabric spheres rose from the earth ship swiftly swoop-
ing in an arc these spheres struck down six of the earth
party and streaked out for their own ship

  a declaration of war shouted jameson they
want to be the sole representatives at the conclave at
erb that scene shows them to be from the ninth planet
of sol-the one discovered a few years ago so little
is known about it that we were unable to tell if it was at
all habitable these beings must be able to stand terrific
heat changes probably there is no liquid in their make-
up

  at the moment jameson was violently bumped from
behind and as he whirled to see what had hit him a piece
of paper suddenly materialized in the void before him
and floated toward the deck as he reached for it he
was quickly bowled over and thrown along the deck re-
peated efforts to see what had hit him disclosed nothing
at all-all his colleagues were twenty feet from him

  gaining his feet quickly jameson recovered the paper
which had so mysteriously appeared before him as he
straightened up he was surprised to note a luminous
trail streaking out from the earth ship to the sphere
of the declared enemy the fabric spheres of the enemy
were preparing to enter their ship as this luminous streak
reached them suddenly these spheres were thrown
roughly to one side and the trail of faint purple dis-
appeared into the circular opening in the side of the
sphere quickly the fabric spheres crowded into the
opening and the circular door swung into place leaving
a perfectly smooth surface

  jameson hurried to the entrance lock of his own ship
and plugged in his microphone to the interior speaker
in the ship

  get bellant for me quick he may be able to explain
some of this light phenomena to us

  weve been trying to find him for five minutes and
cant locate him his clothes are gone and so are all his
note books and valuables we have had something
wrong with the air-locks just now too-they opened and
closed by themselves for no apparent reason you had
better come in

 this answer was rather stunning but jameson was
not one to linger when cold facts might be available
within suddenly the paper in his hand caught his eye
he remembered the bowling over he had just received-
and looked quickly at the enemy sphere it was rapidly

moving ahead jameson began to think quickly bellant
gone locks operated by themselves he had been knocked
about a trail of purple haze to the spherical flyer a note
materializing from mid-air hastily he turned and went
rapidly through the air locks into the flyer

  call alice baldwin on the general news speaker he
commanded as he doffed his space suit

  sorry jameson but weve been trying to locate her
for the past ten minutes mrs smith was wishing to
speak with her weve searched the whole ship-even
the store rooms its very strange what with both mr
bellant and miss baldwin disappearing at once

  it was enough to crystallize the vague ideas jameson
had been framing in his mind he ripped open the
folded paper he had recovered out on the hull of the
ship

  my god jameson was not profane but spoke as
if in prayer

  what is it harry jones queried as he took off
his space suit

  that infernal bellant he has left this ship for that
enemy sphere-and lies abducted alice with him he
created the strange path of purple haze from us to the
other flyer where is the sphere  we must catch it-
quickly

  too late harry the sphere is already out of sight
jones was not consoling in the least

  then start immediately for erb we must obtain
the help of our hosts in finding that rascal bellant and
my fiancee alice i will search the universe for them if
necessary

  you are absurd jameson smith spoke it would
be impossible for bellant to get from our ship to that
enemy sphere without us seeing him not to speak of
taking with him an active girl like alice without our
knowledge

  that is where you are wrong smith countered
jameson listen to this note it is brains not brawn
that win you can best appreciate the saying mind
over matter by trying to find me-or your ex-sweet-
heart shes mine now

  i alone know what bellant has been working on in
the past six months for months this young man-
brilliant in spite of his corrupt morals-has been work-
ing on a physico-chemical method of obtaining a complete
invisibility for himself and all material or persons near
him should he so desire very apparently he had accom-
plished his end and has used his discovery to cover his
abduction of alice and his flight to the enemy ship how
he expects to be received i do not know i hope he is
able to protect alice against those enemy beings should
they be hostile

  give orders for immediate high speed i will remain
on watch until we get into our fourth dimensional speed
and are well on our way we must reach erb as quickly
as possible now take every reasonable risk to push us

  smith will you and jones please take observation
positions to guard against destroying any of our col-
leagues ships we must arrive at erb before the enemy
sphere does

  they may do incalculable harm if they arrive long
before us

  for the first time the men and women in the earth
ship felt acceleration shock so great was the strain
thrown on the ship by the sudden and rapid increase to
the highest possible speed
cosmic steeple-chase



chapter xi

the planets of the polaris system soon came into
prominence in the immediate foregrounds of the
heavens and as the earth ship flashed past other
ships in its mad careen through space toward erb the
majesty of the three suns of the polaris system unfolded
in all its glory as the flyer rushed up to the ten planets
above jameson cut down the speed until once again the
flyer was rushing through three dimensional space at a
comparatively slow speed

  at last the ship was in the general plane of the ecliptic
of all polaris planets and turned inward in search of the
fifth planet erb off to the left was the farthest flung
planet-the outpost of the polarian space travelers now
it passed the seventh planet glorious in its crescent form
as it reflected the light of its parent suns

  erb i see it slow down-we will have to go care-
fully to avoid sliding past we cant land at this speed

  but even as jameson spoke a giant space liner flashed
past them headed for the planet everyone who could
observed this speeding craft through glasses and tele-
scopes onward it fled-in ten minutes it approached
erb now it slowed down and swept in a far flung
spiral curve on past the planet and back and around it
ever approaching closer after swinging completely
around the planet three times each time coming closer
the liner entered the atmosphere and slowed perceptibly
slanting down toward the surface of the giant sphere
finally it disappeared around the sphere and apparently
landed on the other side

  well try it-more speed jameson took charge of
the controls and the earth flyer took a dive into its first
big swing in the spiral about the planet

  erb seemed to spin before them as the space ship spun
about the sphere down anil down they went at last
entering the atmosphere the ships hull glowed to a red
as it flashed through the air the interior of the flyer
grew very warm and jameson called for a check in the
speed at last they were over the planets surface and
below them was the great landscape they had expected
to see-orange colored foliage with some few sprinklings
of green here and there a group of peculiar buildings
flashed beneath them they whirled over an enormous
sea-nearly a quarter the way about the planet this
body of water extended

  the capital shouted one of the observers and all
eyes were focused off to the right where thousands of
buildings appeared-all colors tall and round thousands
of them the ship veered around and sailed over the
city in the very middle of which lay an enormous open
field on which could be seen hundreds of ships many of
which appeared to be like the earth ship

  down to this field the men of earth floated the voyage
of three years through cosmic night coming to an end
with a scarcely perceptible jar as the ship settled on its
pedestal base

  spontaneously the thirty travelers from earth burst
into a cheer and a rush was made for the doors in the
lower part of the ship

  before opening up however careful tests were made
of outside pressure temperature humidity and atmos-
pheric composition though low in oxygen and high in
temperature the atmosphere was found to be livable and
with great joy the men and women of earth descended
to the ground the first for three long years the high

barometric pressure of the air caused some difficulty
at first but soon the earth party was breathing well the
enormous size of the planet caused the gravity pull to
be exceedingly large and it was with great difficulty
that the party advanced to the center of the large field
where a reception committee awaited respectfully

  before a word or greeting was exchanged the erbians
offered strange shoe-like apparatus and jameson being
the leader tried these on instantly the terrific gravity
pull was relieved and the professor quickly urged the
rest to get on a pair

  greetings men of earth

  not a word had been spoken but the message came
to every man sharp and clear for the first time jame-
son and his party became aware that the erbians were
much like earth men-the figure was much the same
the size being slightly larger and although there were
minor differences the bodies of these sons of polaris
were very much like those of jameson and the rest

  the star sol sends erbians his blessings and saluta-
tions through his children men of earth we are here
at your call and come in peace

  jameson bowed low with these words not in subjuga-
tion but in full recognition and respect of the erbians

  the erbian hears and understands you he does
not speak vocally but makes his meaning clear to you by
thought welcome to erb and may our planet give you
a comfortable home while you are here please bring
your party to the building yonder all of your effects
will be transferred for you from your ship to your home
while here

  the entire party was conducted to a beautiful building
to the right of the field and each assigned to a separate
apartment of five rooms every room had a special me-
chanical servant each of which had been designed to
respond to commands of the visitors not one of the
earth party ever did obtain a full understanding of how
these servants were constructed and operated

  at the earliest opportunity a conference was held be-
tween the leaders of the erbians and jameson with jor-
dan blake and a few others chosen to act as executive
committee immediately jameson laid before these men
of erb the falsity of bellant and the war-like attitude
of the fabric sphere beings from the ninth solar planet
encountered in space when bellant had abducted alice
assistance was asked in locating this ship and a warrant
for the arrest of the entire crew was issued by alkad
the presiding officer of the erbians

  magnetic messages were relayed to every planet and
satellite in the system including the outpost planet and
the penal or corrective satellites setting watchers on the
alert for this space ship it was apparently the only
one made in a spherical shape for the erbians had not
used such a shaped flyer for centuries of their time this
would make it easy to recognize as most other flyers com-
ing in were shaped much like the earth ship or long and
cylindrical as a final help ten police ships were ordered
abroad to patrol the interplanetary space of the system
to try to locate the war-like vessel

  for ten days of the erbian time about forty-five
earth hours the earth men were kept busy learning all
about the conference next to be held twenty days were
yet to elapse before the conference of the universe was
to start earth men were among the last to arrive as
they were from one of the most far flung systems repre-
sented in the conclave many beings were represented


amazing stories

here on erb the surprising thing to the earth men was
the similarity of all reasoning beings in the physical form
although some were certainly peculiar

  it seems that the creator has a very definite set of
laws of evolution over his entire cosmic group of uni-
verses the leader of the erbians explained at a group
conference there is a variation in the detail in most
cases but the basic principles are all the same the
animal world the planet and the mineral world all go
through certain stages of evolution there will be at
this conference almost every stage of the evolution of
the three types of life i have mentioned i will see to it
that you all get a chance to see your inferiors and su-
periors-although frankly you earth beings are nearly
at the bottom of the scale that will be represented here

  mineral life i say thats new to me observed
smith to jameson i wonder what such a being would
look like

  well i believe its the key to the life we saw in the
fabric spheres from the enemy space flyer why oh
why dont we hear some word of that ship i tell you
im nearly wild in spite of my outward calm wrhat has
happened to alice where is she what has bellant
done with her oh if only these police ships would lo-
cate the sphere id go out and get it myself

  the leader alkad continued with his explanation of
the stages of physical and mental evolution it seemed
that certain types developed mentally more than physi-
cally and others just the reverse the moral develop-
ment was largely dependent in the environment and
speed of development

  gradually jameson lost interest in the very interesting
discussion and at last arose and left the conference he
headed directly for the earth space ship on his way
he was intercepted by a messenger

  harry jameson the police have sighted the sphere
ship you desire to capture they lost it as it went out of
our system we do not police space beyond our system

  what types of weapons do you have which i could
use myself jameson inquired

  he was informed that a special car had been con-
structed for police duty during this conclave of the
universe it was just completed with the latest devices
for capturing an enemy or for annihilating him this
ship the messenger offered for jamesons use

  the two entered an air rocket and were thrown high
into the upper atmosphere of the planet where the rocket
could travel without much friction and at prodigious
speed a three hour flash through the upper air brought
them a quarter the way about the planet where they de-
scended and made a landing in a large metal recoil net
which eased off the shock of the stop

  a short trip in a surface car driven by a reaction
motor brought the pair to the police yards here they
found the new space police ship very small it was big
enough only for three men but in it were masses of
machinery the whole was not more than thirty feet
across

  the ship had several observation windows about the
circumference on six different sides equidistant one
from the other were six powerful ray projectors-all
were paralyzing rays and designed to put out of com-
mission all machinery in the path of the ray all liv-
ing material also would be paralyzed by these rays
inside the ship was a powerful attractor any object
which was focused in the field of the attractor would

be held fast and hard in any definite position desired

   the mechanism for controlling and driving the ship
as well as the controls of speed position a magnetic
radio communication with the central station of erb and
the controls of the rays and attractors were all located
in a large control board directly in front of an operators
comfortable seat as a crowning glory a section of the
ship was devoted to machinery producing about the
flyer a protective shield through which no heat rays or
any known rays or missiles could pass this made the
ship impregnable and assured the positive capture of any
ship or body the flyer might take after as to speed
there was no known method for obtaining a higher speed
than the police car could attain

  needless to say jameson was delighted after an
hour of instruction in operation and control he selected
two helpers and with no word other than a registration
in the police records for outbound space ships flashed
up through the atmosphere of erb out into the black
night of polaris interplanetary space

chapter xii

the erbian police ship under the hand of jameson
shot out into space at right angles to the plane of
the ecliptic of the planets of polaris somewhere
in space close about this system lurked a spherical space
ship now outlawed by its refusal to comply with the
demands of the police ship which had sighted it and
commanded it to land immediately on erb the task of
finding this speck of matter in the vast ocean of dark
void seemed colossal to the two helpers in the flyer with
jameson but the young professor seemed not to realize
the enormous chances of missing what he was searching
for

  now the space car swung in a giant arc covering a
half billion miles allowing observation of the whole
polaris system of planets

   after a swing back again searching vainly over the
space on the one side of the planetary plane or ecliptic
jameson flashed his car up through the system barely
missing two of the outer satellites of one of the planets
now on the outer side of the planetary system he again
began the search for the dot that would indicate the goal
of his search

  three billion miles of arcs in many directions re-
vealed no trace of the enemy sphere

   might as well return to erb i guess sighed jame-
son there isnt a sign of them out here they must
have gone a long way out into space to wait for a chance
to slip in on some little inhabited planet or satellite
pardon professor but what is that speck ahead of
us heading for he outer-most planet of our system
there is very little on that planet but snow and ice-
our men there live in air-tight heated buildings

  sure enough-the outlaw ship all the speed we
have boys lets get them

   remember your proximity to the planets professor
full speed would put you through the system in about
two seconds

   this caution from his helper prevented jameson from
applying too much speed at this critical time and helped
to steady him to the task of overtaking the outlaw un-
seen with a careful hand on the controls the police car
swept in a vast arc down towards the wee black dot
in an effort to approach the outlaw from behind the
cosmic steeple-chase



planet and surprise it before it could escape a chase
out into space was not what they wanted once within
a few miles ol the sphere jameson knew he could apply
the force of the attractors and literally drag the helpless
enemy to erb where a full accounting could be had

  at a terrific speed jameson drove his new car at the
planet where they knew the outlaw to be preparing to
land closer now almost upon the planet the police car
flashed with a rush jameson brought his ship about the
curve of the planet and immediately sighted the enemy
about to land some thousand miles away apparently
they observed jamesons car at the same instant for the
sphere of glass-like metal dropped toward the ragged
snow-covered mountains of the planet like a plummet-
much too rapidly to be safe for the occupants jameson
thought

  help watch for them use that electric magnifying
telescope for me please commanded the professor of
his helpers we must not lose them among this rough
country of crags caves and hollow mountains

  over the spot believed to have been the point where
the sphere had dropped to the surface the police car
circled each of the three occupants searching the land-
scape for evidence of the outlaw suddenly a streamer
of brilliant red cut through the semi-darkness of the
atmosphere from beneath a rough mountain crag-just
missing jamesons ship by a few feet

  whee that was close careless of me to forget
our own protection turn on that generator for me
will you please jameson spoke quickly and the per-
spiration stood out on his forehead in beads as the re-
actionary nervous shock set in he had certainly allowed
his men to come near to death the heat ray from the
enemy would have fused the windows of the police
ship easily had it struck home

  with the protective shield about them the members
of jamesons party proceeded quickly to the attack
down they dropped and began the maneuvering which
they hoped would cause the sphere to make known its
exact location around the great crags and deep valleys
the police car sailed hoping to draw the fire of the enemy
and thus locate the hiding spot

  once again the red ray flashed out at the police ship
and the three occupants cried in triumph as they spotted
the sphere of the outlaws lurking in a deep recess be-
tween the mountains

  fire at them with our paralyzing ray-quickly be-
fore they move-over there see

  the helpers saw and had the ray in operation before
jameson ceased to speak the red heat ray of the ene-
my stabbed out once more turning harmlessly aside as
it struck the protecting energy-wall about the police car
the paralyzing ray sought and met this red ray a blind-
ing shower of sparkling flashes followed and suddenly
the red ray ceased to be

  the attractor quickly-get them as they are and hold
them sight first and get them in focus then switch on
the current to hold them i will pilot us back to erb
and drag them with us cried jameson excitedly
ready-shoot or theyll escape there thats fine
now hold on to them

  with a triumphant gesture the professor sent the
police car speeding up and away in a sweeping arc for
erb dragging the unwilling outlaw with him beam
after beam of heat ray dis-ray and explosive ray were
flashed at her captor by the sphere all to be turned

aside by the protective shield that surrounded the police
car

  as they neared erb the helpers in the police car held
the sphere bathed in paralyzing rays to prevent these
outlaws from raying the people or buildings on erb
slowly they settled to the ground in the center of the
landing field and squads of armed officers surrounded
the outlaw sphere ray guns in hand at last jameson
appeared from the police car and ordered the enemy
ship cut open this was hazardous for it meant the use
of electronic knives and should one of these slip slightly
the occupants of the ship might suffer too dear an in-
dividual was believed to be in this ship to take great
risks so jameson ordered very thin slices cut away each
time

  as the outlaws observed their ship being cut to pieces
they apparently decided that to surrender peacefully
would be the safest course and before great damage was
done a section of the hull opened and out sailed a sphere
bearing a white flag

  surrender came the command from jameson and
the sphere with the white flag dipped in recognition and
acquiescence

  stand by with your air police ready to stop any
attempts at escape or reprisals ordered jameson to the
erbian officers

  from the spherical ship came sphere after sphere each
bearing a white flag at last no more emerged and
jameson felt sure all the sphere beings were emerged
but somewhere in the ship were hidden two earth people

  search the ship i will lead one of the spheres
must proceed us in our search to protect us from a trap
please do not come alkad there may be danger and
you should not expose yourself this is our dispute so
let us settle it as best we can

  jameson spoke to his erbian friend earnestly and
started toward the outlaw ship followed by erbian police
and one or two of his own party

  wait i shall avoid exposing either yourself or my
men alkad spoke sharply we possess a type of ma-
chine which will do this investigating for us elam
he called to one of his escort and communicated some
message to his kinsman this individual nodded and
hurried away on a rocket sled

  we have just completed a sort of robot which will do
this investigating for us the machine sees hears
smells and to a certain limit feels or reacts to physical
touch stimuli we may note all these things through a
separate receiver out here-a sort of radio transmission
you would call it here comes elam with the robot and
receiver now

  soon the marvelous robot was inside the ship con-
trolled from the receiver by electric impulse watching
and listening at the receiver harry jameson excitedly
gave commands for directing the robot now they could
see through the robots eyes and hear through its ears
the interior scenes and noises of the ship down into
the body of the ship they seemed to go a scream
reached their ears and the robot halted tried the knob
of a door near him and waited for orders

  break the door down came the command and the
robot charged the panel shattering it to bits

  alice shouted harry as the robots eyes registered
the scene before it alice sat bound to a sort of chair
and over her leaned bellant frozen in the act of reach-
ing toward the helpless girl the sight of the giant robot

of shinning metal seemed to paralyze him with fear

  harry is outside to rescue you he will kill your
tormentor jameson heard the robot enunciate with
difficulty to the man and woman on whom its electrical
eyes gazed

  quick have the robot seize bellant before it is too
late shouted jameson to the operator at his side

  the robot strode one step forward and then hesi-
tated the operator at jamesons side asked quickly
which bellant was-he did not know and had had to
hesitate to find which the robot should seize

  the man-please be quick replied harry in
anxiety too well he knew what might happen

  apparently bellant took the situation in clearly at
the outset and seeing the robot hesitate he stepped back
to a table picked up something and with a throwing
movement stepped quickly close to alice and stooped
toward her arms outstretched

  even as harry saw this and cried out the pair of hu-
mans before the robot suddenly faded from view-
vanished completely

  bellants invisibility robe gasped the young astrono-
mer move the robot forward quickly follow any
trail of violet luminosity bellant is escaping with
alice

  the operator of the robot seemed nonplused and
failed to comprehend jamesons full meaning instead
of moving the robot forward instantly he turned to
harry for further direction

  quickly groaned jameson rush the robot for-
ward arms outstretched follow any violet colored
trails in the air oh please act-do something

  the operator jumped into action and the robot ran
forward arms outstretched despite turning and mad
rushing about the room not a single solid object did the
robot encounter

  its too late bring the robot out here well have
to search for bellant somewhere else he is gone with
alice

  at the moment out from the sphere came a rapidly
moving air sled with apparently no one on it behind
the sled a violet haze streamed not an individual no-
ticed this until the sled was well launched into the air
and streaking away at an ever increasing speed

  police after that sled commanded alkad as he
indicated the rapidly dwindling form of the sled

  instantly a dozen special speed sleds flashed up and
streaked out after the fugitive alkad and jameson
flung themselves flat on a new sled and the driver ap-
plied the power with a scarcely perceptible thrust
the sled carried its passengers forward at a speed un-
known in earthly atmospheric travel alkad estimated
for jameson that they were traveling at a speed of about
five hundred miles per hour

  well overtake them shortly there isnt an air sled
made that can equal these in speed alkad commented
see the police ahead of us theyll catch your man
for you

  the fugitive sled was again in full sight as the police
sleds gained on it and jameson leaned forward as if to
help the sled along closer now they swept the air
screaming past their windshield with a shrill note
ten minutes chase brought the police sleds upon the
fleeing vehicle and as alkads conveyance pulled up over
it the cordon of the law drew tightly about bellant

  with no warning whatever bellant literally dropped

his sled on a steep decline toward the mountainous re-
gion below them immediately the police dived after
him but the sudden change in direction ef bellant had
caught the police sleds unawares and they were miles
past the spot bellant first dropped before they could
bank on a turn and drop quickly after him

  by the time the pursuers were well down on their
descent bellants sled was down among the peaks with
unbelievable skill the fugitive zig-zagged through the
crags and peaks of this rugged range covered with the
stubby orange colored growth of dwarfed trees the
sleds of the law rapidly dropped toward the sharp peaks
and the great gorges below

  the foremost police sled dived almost vertically into a
great gorge into which bellant had sped rapidly the
pursuer gained on bellant now he was over him
apparently ordering him to halt an instant later a
flash of jagged lightning bolted upward from bellant to
the sled of the law with a loud detonation the pursu-
ing sled officer and machinery disappeared

  with the flash of the detonation bellants sled dived
into the shadow of the deep canyon below and dis-
appeared

  a full hours search ty all the police cordon failed to
reveal a trace of the outlaw a conference down in the
cool depths of the great gorge led to a decision to return
to the city the whole fleet rose as one and streaked
away through the blue of the erbian sky

chapter xiii

on return to the city at last jameson took time to
observe what surroundings he had on this new
planet with the assurance of alkad that not a
moment should elapse without a police cordon on the
search for bellant and alice the young astronomer gave
his attention to the coming conclave mainly because
he felt it a duty

  there were representatives from over a thousand dif-
ferent systems many forms of organic life were repre-
sented the earth representatives were about the low-
est in the scale of the animal life represented and from
the earth man the type went on up some individuals be-
ing highly developed mentally-eons ahead of earth men
-and some developed physically to the highest degree

  the intellectual giants were very similar to the earth
men in appearance although their reasoning power was
beyond the comprehension of the earth men the phys-
ical progress in animals had resulted in all sorts of odd
developments for the most part the body was smaller
and the appendages were much shortened and all use-
less parts were eliminated the head had enlarged in
most cases and the appendages of locomotion were nearly
gone because of the lack of use as the beings developed
mechanical locomotion to a higher degree plant life
was represented as well as the animal over a hun-
dred of the guests of the erbians were of plant origin
although the men of earth soon learned that distinctions
between plant animal and mineral life were really mat-
ters of degree rather than kind most of the plant life
used a rolling motion of the body to propel itself from
one place to another the bodies were of regular cel-
lulose structure but highly complex with many special
tissues never found in earthly plant life

  very prominent among the visiting types of life were
the mineralites as smith soon dubbed them these
cosmic steeple-chase



were individuals whose body was composed of crystals
of minerals most of the higher types were built up
of thousands of minute crystals of many colors glow-
ing with light as a rule presumably the individuals
multiplied by enlarged growth and division or in the
same general fashion as the earthly hydra reproduces
-by simple budding of a new individual at one part
of the body

  as jameson and his party were conveyed about by
alkad and his men they were shown many delightful
pieces of cultural art-drawings pottery and even
sculpture work

  soon they were conveyed to a part of the planet where
the sciences were studied and because of their interest
in astronomy jameson and a few of his fellowmen were
shown the electronic telescope through which old sol
and the nine planets and asteroids had been detected

  not alone were there great physical chemical and
biological laboratories but in as great proportion the
erbians had schools devoted to the study of psychology
of geology and of the general best ways of living they
made a slave of their science whereby they provided
by its means the necessary machines robots and elec-
trical and chemical devices to completely free them of
all drudgery and necessity for making a living every-
one of the erbians had a chance to select a branch of in-
telligence he liked best while going through his pre-
liminary training and after his general education was
complete he devoted the rest of his life to the problems
found in his field

  here said one of the guides during a trip through
one of the advanced chemical research buildings is a
department devoted to the study of the constitution of
all matter we believe everything is made from one
initial material-perhaps energy we are attempting
to trace matter back to the beginning our greatest
minds believe they are reaching a glimmering of the
truth while we never expect to lift the veil of mystery
surrounding creation we do expect to be able to deduce
something of what is beyond the veil by the manifesta-
tions of that beyond which come to us as creations

  here was a very good sample of what the earth men
found most of the problems of erbians to be-almost
beyond the limits of their imaginations jameson and
his mates quickly divined that the little they knew of all
knowledge was as nothing compared to the least intelli-
gent of the erbians

  i would like to inquire about the organic individuals
you sent to earth in the cylinder you sent us they are
a species found here jameson put his question to
alkad

  they were a type of intelligence which we developed
for our own use literally they are organic thinking
machines doubtless you of earth possess mechanical
thinking machines-calculators slide rules integrators
which take much of the dry everyday grind out of your
complicated calculations just so do we have thinking
machines except that ours are organic and have a partial
intelligence of their own we developed this type of
life to aid us in the more simple lines of thought the
thinkers may be educated to function in almost any in-
tellectual field those sent to you were specially edu-
cated on space navigation and all the necessary mechan-
ical and electrical knowledge necessary for this trip you
have made to be quite frank we consider the thinkers
to be capable of quite as much real intelligence as any

of you earth men the difference is that you are able to
cover many fields while a thinker is trained in one field
only

  may we take a trip over the polaris system of plan-
ets before the conclave begins requested jameson

  certainly i will give you a guide and you may use
your own ship you will be allowed to land on every
planet except the innermost of our system the elec-
tronic equipment there is too delicate to allow anyone to
come closer than ten thousand miles unless specially
trained in that field our specialists spend centuries in
study before they are allowed even a preliminary visit
to the power-sphere as we call it elam will you con-
duct the earth party and ship about our system re-
turn in fifteen days we shall then begin our conclave

  with no more ado the party returned to the space
ship in which they had come from earth and began the
tour of the system for many days they went from
planet to planet visiting the more interesting parts of
each until at last only the outermost planet remained
this was the planet which was so cold and on which
erbians existed only when protected by great heated
dome buildings it was only after much persuasion that
their guide took them to this faraway place fortunate
it was that the earth men insisted on seeing this ice-
covered sphere for had they not bellant would doubt-
less have remained at large for all time

  as they descended on the planet guided by elams
direction they were able to look down into one of the
great glass-domed buildings and were surprised to see
there the great glass-like ball of the space ship owned
by the sphere bodies from the solar system guided by
elam the earth ship dropped carefully through an
opened dome and after closing the dome above them at-
tendants in the form of mechanical robots guided the
ship to one side and anchored it securely opening
great ovenlike heaters the robots warmed the large
building up to normal again after the penetrating cold
of the outside when air conditions were adjusted and
the temperature was endurable upon a signal from a
small house at one side the robots opened the flyer to
allow the earth men to emerge

  an erbian came from the small house to greet them
immediately upon questioning by elam the erbian ad-
mitted he was housing an unregistered space ship in
another building but said the ship had claimed to be
coming into the polaris system from the solar system
-had wished to stop for repairs and supplies he im-
mediately agreed to conduct the party to the other build-
ing where jameson felt sure he would find alice and
bellant

  before boarding a peculiar platform with the earth
party the erbian gave directions by a telepathic thinker
that the spherical space ship and all occupants were to be
held till he arrived the thinker it seemed was a
specialized telepathy unit and could easily transmit a
message or mental image to a similar thinker in the
other building with a final direction to a second thinker
the erbian boarded the platform and announced that
they were about to go into the fourth dimension for a
brief interval in that dimension they could safely and
easily go beyond the intervening rock and ice into the
other building just as an airplane can easily go over
into a field surrounded by a very high fence the plane
needs only to rise from two dimensions into the third
dimension travel over the obstacle and drop down safely


amazing stories

on the other side back into the second dimension solid
objects offered no more resistance when traversed in
the fourth dimension than a fence offers when hurdled
by means of ascent into the third dimension

  each one held his breath as the platform started to
move there was only the sensation of a sort of slip-
ping motion-no particular direction but each felt he
was moving somewhere then the solid walls rockjce
and snow all appeared to be half transparent it was as
though they were looking both at the solid objects and in-
side them at the same time the whole scene from the
earth space ship clear to the enemy sphere ship was
plainly before them including all the rock and ice be-
tween the buildings

  with a swirling-like feeling the earth men came to a
sudden slipping stop and once more the walls were solid
and the building opaque

  immediately jameson sprang to the floor and started
for the enemy spheres he was stopped by the erbian
in charge of the great domed building

  you will wait until your guide advises me as to your
status here the erbian communicated

  we are here to arrest those individuals in the sphere
ship they are outlaws w hy havent you notified erb
of this the police have been looking everywhere for
this ship-havent you had the messages

  the erbian conferred with elam and it was a very
serious group which approached the silent sphere ship
of the outlaws

  bellant come out and bring alice with you jameson
called loudly at the open door of the space flyer

  there was no response for a moment and then the
door of the ship flew shut suddenly the ship rose quickly
and after circling a moment headed directly for the glass
dome above if it struck the great arch and broke
through all in the room below would perish from the
sudden chill of the outside atmosphere besides that
tons of glass would shower down on them cutting every-
one to ribbons there was no time to run for shelter-
the sphere ship was half way to the top and ever gain-
ing speed twenty seconds and it would crash through
the dome out toward space the erbians both shouted
aloud saying a certain set of vowels quickly

  instantly in response to the vocal call of the erbians
six great robots about the building flashed into action
stepping to a beam transmitter as a man throwing the
power switch and training the ray on the escaping ship
in less time than it required to shout the command

  the fugitive swirled drunkenly about and careened
to one side but continued to rise ever more slowly the
rays had paralyzed the machinery and any life in the
sphere still the ship rose and the men below became
anxious for fear the big ball would crash through the
dome from the momentum it had gained at last the
fatal second came-would the dome hold against the
impact of the slowly moving ship

  with a resounding crash the big glass-like ship struck
the dome top and rebounded as a rubber ball from the
snap of the elastic give in the dome structure a shower
of fine glass rained over the rebounding sphere and slid
off to flitter down to the floor only a few individuals
were cut and so great was the joy at the capture of the
outlaw that no one minded the slight injuries

  the erbian in charge immediately dispatched a dozen
robots with glass squares to repair the damage done to
the dome and with a powerful attractor he pulled the

sphere to the floor the door was pried open and in-
side went jameson and half a dozen others ray pistols
in hand

  strange to say not a sphere body could be seen later
they learned that bellant had stolen back to the landing
field on erb and appropriated the space traveler with-
out permission a long search disclosed bellant with
alice in a tiny cubby hole at the base of the ship where
he had hoped to escape detection

  come out bellant ordered jameson and the sub-
dued physicist obeyed without a word

  turning the culprit over to two of his men jameson
picked up the unconscious form of alice and tenderly
carried her outside it was with great eagerness that
harry waited while the erbian administered a stimu-
lating drug to bring alice out of her unconsciousness a
full ten minutes elapsed and the first faint fluttering of
her eyelids brought harry to her side

  darling are you all right the young astronomer
cried it is harry-you are safe at last no longer
shall bellant torture you speak to me dear

   the girl tried to speak but only made strange gurgling
noises another attempt brought better results alice
whispered that she was only very weak from lack of
food and water it seemed that bellant had failed to lay
in a supply of the two necessities before making off
with the sphere ship as the sphere bodies were mineral
in nature they used no organic food and very little
water

  despite jamesons protestations bellant was placed
in a room by himself and left unpunished for his gross
misdeeds the erbian did not understand physical pun-
ishment and so did not feel that a good whipping might
be efficacious after making all arrangements for a re-
turn of the sphere ship to erb the entire party returned
to the earth ship via the fourth dimension and made
ready to return to erb

  the return was uneventful and although harrys
fingers itched to get at bellant elam saw to it that the
two men stayed apart at a trial later bellant was
convicted of gross misconduct and was sentenced to ten
years study of social behavior under a guard it was
later decided to return bellant to earth when the party
set out on the return voyage

  the fact that no more trouble was encountered with
bellant proved that the fellow was pretty well subdued

chapter xiv

at last able to devote his entire energy to the
object of the voyage to polaris jameson plunged

	into the conclave and the meeting of all the
various delegates from all over the universe literally
hundreds of individuals were brought together there
each a little different from every other one and some
vastly different from the earth men among the more
unusual types of life were beings whose bodies were so
far advanced in evolution as to be nothing but a brain
carried about by mechanical servants these peculiar
fellows came from the very depths of the milky way
they had been making a tour of the universe when they
stopped to visit the polaris planets they represented
as high an intelligence as could be found the earth men
were told strange as it seemed they were the ones with
whom it was easiest for the men of earth to communi-
cate
cosmic steeple-chase



  month after month passed and ever new and more
marvelous things were revealed to the earth men their
store of knowledge was rapidly becoming too great to be
useful-literally thousands of the marvels of chemistry
biology and physics would be hundreds of years ahead
of the people to whom the delegates of earth would re-
turn much of the knowledge would remain only as
records until the intelligence level of the average man of
earth rose to a point where such information would be
of value much of the more intricate reasoning and in-
formation passed about at the conclave simply passed
over the heads of jameson and his men-they did not
have the experience to enable them to grasp what was
going on many of the more miraculous feats of intel-
ligence displayed at general meetings simply didnt reg-
ister with the earth men the operations of mind on
these higher levels meant nothing at all any more than
a complicated calculation of marvelous radio apparatus
would mean anything to an african bushman very
quickly jameson learned that to understand a thing some
part of it must fall within his previous experience so that
it could be recognized at least in part

  the months rolled on each one adding to the store
of knowledge and the volumes of notes which were all to
be taken back to earth the delegates to this conclave
had agreed upon a meeting once every period of erbian
years which amounted to about a century of earth time
no one on the visit this time from earth would ever
meet at the conclave again but with the secrets of pro-
longing life the jameson party hoped to impart to the
new generations of earth many times the usual three
score ten years allowed man for his span of life

  important points of universal law were decided upon
and visits between planetary systems were arranged
the earth men were scheduled for a visit to alpha cen-
tauri ten earth years hence-and in the meantime a
group of erbians was to visit the solar system to see
what could be done for the general betterment of the
inhabitants of the planets there

  all war between systems was banned as a matter of
course and a court of judgment was set up for settling
disputes arising between parties in the same system as
a special recognition of the efforts of earth men since
they were the intellectual babies in the conclave the
solar system was chosen for the next conclave a century
hence many a conjecture was made as to just what
progress mankind could make in the century before him
until he became host to the universe

  after a year and a half of erbian time the conclave
proper broke up and a large majority of the visiting
delegates boarded their ships sealed their doors and
sailed away into the sea of space toward their respective
homes the delegation from earth was to remain how-
ever and after all but a few of the visiting parties had
gone plans were laid and put into use to educate the
thirty members of the party from earth

  day by day the earth men learned what the marvels
of raw energy were and how to obtain the energy di-
rectly from the molecular forces holding matter together
in this bellant went farther than any of the rest of the
party since it was his field strangely he and jameson
became more intimate in their relations than ever before
but through it that feeling that the other was an enemy
ran and each was constantly on his guard

  the day came when the earth party was to see the
solar system through the marvelous electronic telescope

of the erbians they were all to be well versed in cosmic
geography before the lesson was finished since jameson
was the leader of the party he it was who first glimpsed
the tiny ball of fire and the nine planets and hundreds
of asteroids faintly visible about the central sun fortu-
nately for the observers the plane of the ecliptic of the
solar system is nearly at right angles to the polar axis
of the universe as indicated by men of earth this made
the observer on polaris look down on the solar system
from above the plane of the ecliptic and observe the
planet bodies circling in their orbits about the sun

  there before the party the scene was gradually de-
veloped after jamesons initial observation and shortly
there appeared on the big screen a shadowy picture of a
small ball of fire and spaced about it were wee points
faintly luminous each representing a planet the asteroid
belt appeared to be a faint circle of light placed at the
fifth position of bodes numbers

  jamesons mention of this caused the erbians to in-
quire what this bodes numbers might be

  it has been observed that the planets and asteroids
are distant from the sun at intervals which seem rather
regular and correspond roughly to -------
- explained harry in best astronomical style
but we are about convinced that this relation is entirely
accidental and has no real law as bode would have it
the distances and numbers get entirely out of gear as we
go from the inner planets the first four about the sun
to the outer or major planets

  much investigation followed and the men of earth
learned a great deal about the solar system that had
never even been suspected by earth men before the
erbians believed that all planets of sol with the possible
exception of mercury were inhabited by living beings-
not all like men but some sort of life they pointed out
some of the types of life exhibited during the conclave
and showed where the mineral beings could easily live
on jupiter

  but the major planets are all excessively cold alice
interrupted they all range around  degrees below
zero fahrenheit all water would be ice even the
clouds we see about these planets are probably clouds
of condensed carbon dioxide

  the discussion waxed warm and to the erbians de-
light men of earth actually argued some of the erbians
off their feet this pleased the polar men and with re-
newed vigor the education process was attacked

  at every turn harry and alice were together learning
side by side always in their shadow bellant followed
he made no effort to interfere did not annoy the girl
nor did he bother jameson notwithstanding jameson
kept very close watch and for over a year the guard he
kept over alice was vigorous and attentive since all of
bellants equipment and apparatus had been taken from
him the girl no longer feared the invisibility cover with
which bellant had formerly captured her she actually
enjoyed an occasional tiff with bellant in their intel-
lectual clashes during study hours

  three years had passed and still the party from earth
studied the whole of the erbian race was immensely
proud of what they had contributed to the education of
these thirty inferior beings from the far away solar sys-
tem not alone in the scientific fields had the party
been thoroughly trained and advanced but in sociology
religious life the ways of living and general government
by this time each and every member of the earth party


amazing

stories

was as an intellectual giant compared to other earth be-
ings especially had bellant progressed in physical
studies his knowledge of electricity and raw energy
was astounding even to the erbians it was whispered
that perhaps he knew too much what use would he
make of his knowledge he had proved a rascal twice
before-why not again

  how much truth this whispered fear had in it they
were to find out all too soon

  as the fourth and last year of their visit drew to a
close the men of earth began to turn their thoughts
toward home-yes even that germ-infested dirty striv-
ing old world earth looked very good to these chil-
dren of sol for after all a few years cannot basically
change human nature the women in the party for all
the marvelous things they found to do on erb where
everyone was a part of society and no sex distinctions
were made were frankly homesick the erbians could
scarcely comprehend this but after thinking upon a sub-
ject rightly concluded that even with all that man had
learned on his visit with them he was in principle
just a high grade animal with a rising but not risen
intellect

  from this time on the party became more restive and
after many attempts to get full attention to further
studies the erbians wisely concluded that earth mans
cup was full and that more intelligence poured therein
would simply run over the sides to waste with regret
for every teacher likes to impart his knowledge to the
fullest extent the great leader alkad of the erbians
made a lengthy speech of appreciation for the attentive
and willing attitude of the earth men while visiting erb
and informed them that the erbians wished them god-
speed on their return voyage which would require an-
other three-year period of cosmic travel back to the
solar system

  this polite but welcome dismissal of the earth men
was met with open welcome by the entire party after
conference jameson delivered a return address express-
ing the lifelong thanks and appreciation of the men of
earth for all the wonderful knowledge given them by
their beloved brothers and benefactors the erbians
thanks were given for the original invitation to come to
polaris and for the books of knowledge accompanying
the invitation

  full energies were now turned toward the recondition-
ing of the space ship and all kinds of supplies were laid
in for the return voyage

  a trailer ship was designed and attached for carrying
specimens special machinery volumes of notes and
greatest of all a few individuals from various systems
who agreed to go back to earth the sphere-bodies
from the ninth planet of sol were to return to their
home and the erbians urged that the two ships join
company allow themselves to be fastened together and
return to the solar systems as brothers

  with great misgiving jameson and his leaders agreed
bellant was especially agreeable to this plan later we
learned that the idea was suggested by bellant

  as a crowning glory elam the guide of the eartli
party while in the polaris system asked to be allowed
to go back to earth with the party naturally the whole
party was overjoyed for they not only admired elam
but loved him as a brother

  preparations were finally completed the earth ship and
the glass-like spherical ship of the sphere-bodies were

firmly fastened together with a communicating door be-
tween and the loaded trailer ship was attached to the
base of the earth flyer with final farewells many heart-
aches and promises of an early visit from the erbians
to earth the three-ship unit rose slowly from the sphere
erb sailed up vertically to the plane of the ecliptic of the
polaris planets and with an ever increasing rush
streaked out into space with twenty-nine hearts bent on
a quick return to earth only bellant was not quite
ready to land on the earth-not until he had complete
control of plans he was even then laying for his great
coup could jameson have looked into bellants heart
at this time he would have severed the ships instantly
and thrown bellant into irons for the rest of the voyage

chapter xv

shortly after the homeward start elam called
for a general meeting here he brought forth a
plan for making the voyage back to earth seem
much shorter

  standing on the table amid the group he demonstrated
a synthetic drug much used on erb for producing tem-
porary slowing down of all bodily functions with it he
showed a drug for relieying this condition upon cal-
culation it was found that one injection of the drug
would hold a man in a sort of suspended animation for
a full year at that time it was deemed advisable to re-
vive the individual and recondition him physically the
body very slowly wasted away during this period as it
was used for food-only a minute amount of energy was
required to keep the body alive in this condition the
subject retained a hazy consciousness during the entire
time with periods ofnatural sleep

  it was agreed that most of the party should be placed
under the influence of the drug jameson was to remain
on guard keeping things in order the rest of the party
would be brought out of their sleep-like condition every
year for a month

  the injection was continued until all but jameson
alice and bellant were placed in their beds elams
approach to bellant was met with a stone-wall resistance
the physicist not only desired to remain awake but in-
sisted that he be let alone-he had much to do on his
notes he said and there were many experiments he
wished to conduct although a bit worried by this
jameson agreed with the warning that on no account
would he tolerate any treachery bellants only response
was a rather faint smile and an all-enveloping look at
alice elam noted this and remembering the mans
history determined to keep close watch on bellant

  with alice placed under the drug influence there
remained only jameson elam and bellant about the
ship these three had their meals together and one
remained on watch while the others slept the time
dragged while each had ftiuch to keep him busy they
all longed for the time when the rest of the party
would be revived

  bellant worked in his shop incessantly behind closed
doors he even refused to admit elam while he was
working insolently telling elam that he wouldnt under-
stand anyway this was the first insult that elam had
ever had and he went to jameson to get its full mean-
ing when jameson translated the statement the erbian
boiled with a rage he had not known in his whole life
he was absorbing a few of the traits of earthmcn in
cosmic steeple-chase



spite of himself it was only by very sharp disciplining
that jameson prevented elam from going right back to
attack bellant how very primitive for an erbian
jameson pointed out

  without further word elam went to work in his
laboratory aboard and remained very secluded for the
balance of the first year it was only when the year
was up that the two earth men saw what he had been
working on

  coming from the laboratory with elam one bearing a
flask of the drug which relieved the state of coma of the
sleeping passengers and the other holding an injection
needle were two very strange looking organisms they
stood about four feet tall had an eye a nose an ear
and a sort of long snout all arranged on the top of the
body proper there were four arms with four very
supple tentacles for fingers and for means of locomo-
tion each had a wheel on which he rolled along the
wheel was part of the body and had a sort of tire of
cartilage about it and was centered on a ball and socket
joint of bone they were flesh colored and hairless
each seemed to balance perfectly on its wheel-foot as
bellant called it

  meet my new servants gentlemen commented elam
as he came forward the one with the flask is called
tick the other tock i name them so because they are
designed to respond to those names only i have heard
some of your party refer to a certain tick tock who is
i presume some one of importance on your planet

  the two earth men roared with laughter and when
jameson explained who tick tock was elam joined in
the laugh

  but where did you get them i am sure you didnt
bring them with you said bellant

  no replied elam i grew these right here on board
in the past four months you will remember that i
brought a great number of containers of organisms with
me when we left erb i have put these together and so
controlled them as to grow these servants they have
brains too-but not too powerful ones as you know
there are two parts of all animals which control kinds
and extents of growth in them the chromosomes with
their genes and the glands of the body mainly the so-
called ductless glands to make a complicated matter
simple i simply alter the genes in the chromosomes to
get the different traits i want brought out and control
the glands chemically to promote or retard growth in dif-
ferent parts of the body its a matter of control in
both kind and extent of animal growth

  let us bring the party out of its sleep and feed them
-they will be rather thin by now

  after much work the entire party was revived and
each declared he had been but dozing a few minutes
however a glance at the constellations proved to each
that he had indeed been dozing a long time

  for a month the party ate and slept normally en-
joying life immensely then the entire bunch was re-
turned to the state of coma and this time jameson went
under the drug too his assistant white took over the
duties of the ship and with him alice stayed awake
she knew a great deal about jamesons plans and was
able to help white enormously again bellant refused
the drug and again elam tried to find out what great
problem was occupying bellant so continuously

  bellant had become so busy that he asked to have his
meals sent to his workroom alice was indignant at

first but on the advice of elam she simply awaited de-
velopments

  elam was elated this was just the chance he wanted
when asked bellant readily agreed to have one of
elams peculiar animal servants bring in his meals lit-
tle did he realize what that piece of flesh could be trained
to do

  day after day elam spent with his servant altering
the internal structure and training it hour upon hour
after a month the servant became more alert and
several times bellant noted the animal looking carefully
about for some reason bellant did not suspect that the
animal could have intelligence perhaps it was the ap-
pearance of the thing-just a hairless bunch of flesh
apparently

  far from the dumb animal it appeared to be however
the servant was observing and each day when it re-
turned from bellants laboratory it recorded what it
had seen every day it drew plans duplicates of what it
had seen in bellants rooms soon bellant became too
engrossed to note much of what the servant did the
animal took to making bellants bed and straightening
up his drawing desk it cleaned the floors-did every-
thing a good servant and valet could do bellant came
to depend on it greatly

  all this while elam was assembling copies of the notes
and plans that bellant believed to be his alone soon
the servant began to draw diagrains of complicated elec-
tric machinery bellant was actually building and elam
built them too studying carefully each part for its pur-
pose gradually a glimmering of the truth came to
him how he wished it possible to take by force the
thoughts from bellants mind but long ago the erbian
had found it impossible to read the thoughts of an in-
dividual unless the subject willed it so so much of the
guess work he was speculating on could elam certify
if only he were able to delve into bellants mind

  month after month passed and finally bellant became
less seclusive he took his meals with the others again
and was more jovial at elams suggestion the
servant was still detailed to clean up and tidy bellants
room soon bellant began to spend a great deal of time
in the base of the ship where the great driving mech-
anism was several times elam surprised the physi-
cist as he was meddling with the wiring of the great
blue globe and the green disc each time bellant ex-
plained that he was trying to get in mind exactly how the
ship was propelled and elam believed it-for that was
exactly what bellant was doing-learning how the mech-
anism worked

  elams suspicions now became practical certainties and
once more he became a recluse in his laboratory every
few days he would l-eturn to the company of the rest
of the people each time spending every minute he could
looking at alice this annoyed bellant considerably as
he felt that here was a new contender for the beautiful
girls favor he questioned elam closely about what
occupied him so much in his lab and each time elam
replied that he was growing a new type of servant this
was really the truth although the servant was not quite
what he led bellant to believe it was

  the second year came to an end and once more the
whole party was awakened and fed well for a month
and again placed under the drug influence this time
alice went too and jameson remained conscious to com-
plete the journey now well on towards the end they


amazing stories

 had made better time on the return and the trip would
 be shortened by about three months that meant that
 only eight months were left jameson was jubilant-
 he intended to make short work of disposing of bellant
 once on earth and then he and alice could have that
 home they both wanted had he known the short but
 terrific struggle they would go through by that time he
 would have forced bellant into using the coma-producing
 drug and cut loose from the sphere ship attached to the
 earth flyer

   a month later elams servant began to report clandes-
 tine visits of bellant to the sphere ship it had been
 agreed to remain separate parties throughout the voyage
 this was a breach of faith both on bellants part and
 that of the sphere-bodies again elams fears were
 being confirmed and he redoubled his labor in his work
 shop one day he was finished and confided to jameson
 that he had a masterpiece finished but that  one was
 to see it for some time he would however show it to
 jameson first

   following this elam suddenly decided that the three
 men-bellant jameson and himself-should make a
 tour of the rooms to observe the sleeping passengers it
 was so arranged and the three made the tour giving
 each party a thorough inspection as to general health
 and room conditions all three being interested in alice
 it was not surprising that they lingered rather long in
 her room elam pointed out how healthy the girl looked
 and how curly her hair was-a rather odd thing for him
 to do thought jameson

   the next watch when elam alone stayed on guard
 while bellant and jameson were supposed to be asleep
 a shadowy figure stole down the corridor to alice bald-
 wins door and slipped inside the room a moment later
 the shadow reappeared one arm full of some soft cloth-
 like things-possibly clothing stealing back the cor-
 ridor the shadow slipped out of sight for about five min-
 utes and then reappeared bearing in its arms something
 very large and bulky it staggered a little as it fled down
 the corridor a second time stopped at alices door
 looked hastily about and melted from sight into the
 shadow of the open door two minutes elapsed and
 again the shadow slipped out into the darkened hallway
 apparently bearing the same large bulky bundle in its
 arms again it hurried up the corridor and silently
 turned down a side hall a footfall sounded from be-
 low and the shadow made a dash for its room popping
 inside and clicking the latch just as bellant came into
 view

   the physicist had heard the swish and the click of
 the latch and stopped dead still a moment using his
 flashlight he picked out jamesons door and without a
 knock of warning flung open the door and stepped with-
 in throwing his spotlight on the sleeping form of jame-
 son without a doubt the sleeper had not moved for
 some time and was genuinely startled when bellant
 aroused him satisfied that it had not been jameson
 whom he had heard he mentioned the incident and to-
 gether they went in search of elam whom they found
 in the observation room making some calculations as to

 	their speed position in space and so on

   have you been here long inquired bellant sharply

   ever since i left you at your room replied elam
 why do you ask

   could you prove you have been here all the time
 jameson queried some one was just through our

corridor and it was neither of us sure you werent

  you must be dreaming im sure ive been here for
a long time i think youre working too hard jameson
i am sure you dont get enough sleep bellant com-
mented elam the last statement carried double mean-
ing but it went over bellants head entirely

  well its mighty funny i swear i heard a rustle
and then the click of a latch you are sure you werent
back then for anything elam

  bellant he has already told you he has been here
since he left us jameson said with some heat for all
his admiration of the physicists knowledge in jamesons
heart smouldered a mild hate for this fellow

  the incident passed and no more was thought of it-
at least not for a few months

  once again the three men made a tour of the sleeping
passengers and each was found to be exactly as before
this time it was bellant who commented on alices
beauty he and jameson agreed that if possible alice
was more beautiful than before

  she seems to have more color today and her hair
seems more flaxen than it was jameson noted and bel-
lant agreed elam looked on and said little for some
reason elam had this time advised against a close ex-
amination of the passengers and so the tour was soon
complete

chapter xvi

by now the solar system was quite visible and by
means of high power the telescope revealed tjie
entire system with its nine planets the asteroids
and the central sun it was when the ship was within
a week of the solar system that the blow fell jameson
was on guard and elam and bellant had been at rest
for some time

  without warning while jameson was making some
pencil sketches of the solar system through the telescope
the planets and sun slid off to the left leaving the field
of the instrument jameson was nonplused for a mo-
ment and then grasped a small hand instrument caught
the star sol in the field and was amazed to see the
whole system apparently swinging away to the left for
a full minute he was speechless suddenly the truth
dawned-the solar system was not veering to the left
cavorting off through space-the earth ship was off its
path frantically harry worked with the controls all
to no avail the ship simply would not respond and
every minute the course away from earth was widening
and swinging away into space

  down to elams room jameson raced and burst in 
the sleeping man quickly he related what had hap-
pened and elam came rushing up to see for himself by
now they were headed way out into space the solar
system behind to the left

  now do as i say find out if the sphere ship is still
attached to us apd report to me immediately elam
commanded and as harry hurried away the erbian
darted to the workroom of bellant the physicist was
gone and so were all of his effects even the machines
he had been building lay wrecked and shattered elam
slipped quickly into his own laboratory closed the door
and made several rapid adjustments of dials and
switches rapidly he made the changes hesitated to
see that they were correct and hastened back to the
observatory just in time to meet jameson as he came in
cosmic steeple-chase



  its gone the whole ship is gone-cut away slick
as a whistle-only a scar on the outer shell shows where
they were say you dont suppose-im going to
see

  the words tumbled from jameson as rapidly as possi-
ble

  you neednt-hes gone i just looked to see said
elam all his notes clothes and delicate apparatus
are gone too he is in the enemy sphere and it is his
diabolical knowledge of electrical apparatus that is forc-
ing us off our path lets have a look at the machinery
of this ship

  the two men rushed down into the machinery room
and were shocked to find the whole blue ball a-crackle
with brilliant white sparks

  the infernal pup shouted jameson he means
to drive us clear away from earth never to get back-
but why

  cant you guess man elam yelled above the
crackling noise

  alice

  harry nearly screamed the name and bolted away for
the girls room not waiting to open the lock jameson
crashed through the panels of the door and stood horri-
fied-the bed was empty and all the wardrobe of the
girl was gone-even to toilet articles

  with a hoarse cry jameson rushed to the obser-
vation room still they were veered away fgpm old
sol large now before them again he tore at the con-
trols and again the ship refused to respond

  will you avenge your sweetheart you are doomed
to travel throughout all space till you collide with some
wandering body which annihilates you

  it was the voice of bellant and as jameson looked
about he spotted a new loud speaker in the room be-
side it was a television screen

  yes it is bellant speaking you see me now i
am in the sphere ship-the one you call your enemy
well try to get at me now

  a long laugh followed and jameson bounded across
the room to demolish the screen where bellant leered at
him elam stepped in just in time to save the apparatus

  let me alone-damn the beast-he has alice let
me at him roared the maddened man

  bp calm harry that is only a television screen
listen to bellant perhaps we can discover a way to
check-mate him elam reasoned

  yes do be calm-but youll never check-mate me-
you are checking out here is someone you will be glad
to see-for the last time see her and on the screen
appeared the image of the sleeping face of alice

  god give her strength shut it off-i cant stand it
elam smash the infernal thing

  a hollow laugh echoed from the loud speaker and the
mocking voice continued

  i am about to bring her out of her sleep-see the
needle-recognize the flask of reviving drug oh i
thought so

  god he docs have the drug-all these people
asleep and he has that reviving drug if only i could
kill him-and alice too for id rather she were dead
than in his hands groaned jameson covering his
face with his hands

  are you in earnest-would you kill your sweetheart
rather than allow her to be a slave to bellant think
quickly elam said tensely

  yes-anything but that she be with him id kill her
sooner god forgive me she would rather i know
oh elam you dont know how dear she is to me if
only i could kill him

  yes if only you could said the mocking voice from
the loud speaker jameson go to your telescope and
train it on the solar system in the foreground you
will find us-a little black dot-as we start on our first
honeymoon voyage-not to earth at present but shortly
your machinery is wrecked and ere long you will all die
from some collision in space my story shall be that i
did all i could to save alice and that she was demented
by the awful scene of your death-accidental of course
-while on erl-a landslide killed all of you well
i shall now apply the needle

  jameson had been searching the space without and ex-
claimed as he found the black dot of the sphere ship
way off toward the earth he seemed doomed never to
see again

  suddenly elam spoke

  harry if you would save the life of alice to be lived
out with bellant while you wander space till you die
speak quickly

  never snapped the grief-stricken jameson

  then keep one eye on the sphere ship and watch
this television screen with the other all right bellant
revive your prize-may she be your everlasting dam-
nation

  i shall cried the voice of bellant and the screen
showed him plunging the needle home into the arm of
the form which lay in his arms

  for five seconds nothing happened then the lips of the
figure smiled stretched into a grin and then into a leer
without warning a flash of blue-white flame shot across
the screen a deafening crash came from the microphone
and then both went dead instantly jameson turned to
the telescope and caught the image of the far away
sphere as he centered it in his instrument the glass-
like surface of the enemy ship glowed to a brilliant
white and with an enormous burst of blue and white
spray the whole ship shattered into cosmic dust

  my god the young astronomer slipped to the floor
and his exclamation was a prayer uttered in complete
agony for he had killed the dearest person in the world
to him

  come harry jhere is work to be done said elam
all is not lost i promise you joy greater than you ever
knew before if you will follow my directions

  there is no joy for me now the prostrate fellow
cried i wish i might die too

  what would you say if i told you that your sweet-
heart lives-is near you now

  i dont believe those stories about spiritual life elam
go away and leave me until i can collect my senses
harry jameson your sweetheart lives-she is not
dead i will show you if you will only give me the
chance the body into which bellant pushed the needle
a moment ago was not your alice you will remember
i told you i was working on a new servant that was
the servant-a replica of alice to all physical appear-
ances really only a piece of flesh scarcely alive and
loaded inside with a charge of the erbians most power-
ful explosive when the needle plunged into that life-
less arm you saw on the television screen it delivered
not the life-giving drug you thought but an exciting

author of the murgatroyd experiment futility etc

                      part iii

what went before

frank nankivell bob mariston and george duncan
ex-army officers and ray willis veteran revolution pro-
moter penetrate into the tierra prohibitiva a section of
the brazilian jungle lying between the rio tapajos and the rio
xingu they find a strange city named troyana which has
been lost to the world for ages it is peopled by a race of
profound scientists descendants of the ancient trojans who
hold as slaves the descendants of the inhabitants of the lost
atlantis they are hospitably received by nahum an official
of the city nankivell falls in love with estha his hosts
granddaughter

  troyana is a benevolent autocracy ruled by the nobles under
their master there are four classes of nobles wearing purple
crimson blue and yellow robes respectively below these are
the black-clad burden bearers or atlantean slaves

  during an annual religious ceremony the adoration of the
golden calf a revolution breaks out headed by amos a crimson-
robed traitor the slaves capture the lower city while the
nobles hold the sanctuary in the upper city the fight develops
into a stalemate

  nahum learns of the attachment between estha and nankivell
and advises the strangers to leave troyana they do so carry-
ing estha with them the next afternoon she is recaptured
while the rest sleep

  that night nankivell sees her in a vision as a captive of
amos without waking his companions he steals all of the
ammunition and returns to her rescue despite the sentence of
death passed on him if he returns the others return to their
homes

  nankivell gets to the lower city pressed by burden bearers
he descends into a labyrinth below the city where he is menaced
by giant toads and finds a race of richly clad people sleeping in
huge crystal cylinders he cannot open the cylinders and en-
deavors to return to the sanctuary he emerges from the laby-
rinth to find himself in the jungle where gedaliah the warder
of the outer ways of troyana is about to attack with his indian
guards hoping to rescue the nobles nankivell attacks with
them

  they win through to the city but art captured by amos he
offers them safety and rich rewards if they will join him but
they refuse by a ruse which estha is able to effect by virtue
of her having been high priestess of the golden calf at their
annual religious ceremonies she hypnotizes the slaves who
are now on the side of the traitor amos long enough to allow
nankivell and herself to escape to the sanctuary nankivells
return is condoned but the master refuses to permit his mar-
riage to estha until the rebellion is crushed

  the energy and weapons oftroyana are almost exhausted
nankivell sends a radio message to mariston and willis asking
them to return to the city bringing cobalt the substance from
which the nobles of troyana generate their energy by atomic
disintegration he has no way of knowing whether they receive
his message

  with all hope gone jereboam a noble of the highest rank
tells of an ancient legend it says that the court of atlantis
is in a state of suspended animation in huge crystal cylinders
far below the city headed by nahum and nankivell an
expedition goes to the labyrinth below the city to wake the
sleepers and ask their aid

  the expedition is attacked by the underground dwellers a
race of giant toads and wins through with heavy losses they
find the sleepers and awaken them the atlantean king agrees
to aid them and send his subjects for cobalt instead of bring-
ing it they treacherously attack the nobles of troyana with a
paralyzing violet ray before they can take shelter fully half of
the expedition including nankivell are paralyzed in their tracks

chapter xiv
between two fires

   a pencil line of light sprang from jereboams
   flashtube it fell full on the rigid form of

  j  nankivell and jereboam held his breath
  slowly movement returned to nankivells
frozen limbs jereboam increased the flow
of static electricity nankivell suddenly recovered and
with a shout he raced to safety beside the keeper of the
sacred treasure

  now its my turn he announced grimly

  he disregarded the ray which was vainly seeking to
penetrate to him through the protecting cylinder and
coolly loaded his rifle

  step out and draw their fire jereboam he said

  without hesitation jereboam did as he was bid the
violet ray flashed toward him and enveloped him in a
dim radiance hardly had it moved when nankivell
acted he leaped out around the opposite side of the
cylinder and threw his rifle to his shoulder it sounded
with a deafening crash

  his aim was true there was a flash from the ma-
chine and the ray winked out the atlanteans who had
been operating it turned and fled

  i guess its war red war cried nankivell

  he reloaded his rifle and took deliberate aim the
weapon roared twice and the atlanteans were mere heaps
of dead flesh lowering his rifle he picked up the flash-
tube which jereboam had used to counteract the effects
of the violet ray the stream of current was still play-
ing from it and he directed it upon the form of the
keeper of the sacred treasure in another moment
jereboam had recovered the use of his limbs and was
crouching behind the cylinder beside nankivell

  take the tube jereboam and restore the rest of our
men ill cover the door with my rifle

  he raised the rifle to his shoulder while jereboam
restored nahum who lay nearest to them as soon as
the junior warder was able to use his limbs he grasped
a tube and assisted jereboam in his work from behind
cylinders where they had sought refuge the men of
troyana came forth

  form up behind me and well rush that door cried
nahum

  youll do no such fool thing retorted nankivell
sharply no one knows what is behind there cer-
tainly that ray isnt their only weapon let one or two
advance cautiously while the rest cover their advance
with flashtubes ill do the same with my rifle

he shuddered as he thought of the thirty-
five hundred steps before he started up
the long ascent    nankivell dared
not wait until they were close enough for
accurate shootinq




amazing stories

  you were ever wise in warfare brother nankivell
said nahum it shall be done as you suggest

  at the word of command two men whose black robes
bore a narrow crimson stripe advanced slowly toward
the opening the others following in a thin line at ten
paces distance on the flank of the line walked nanki-
vell his rifle held at the ready

  sixty of the hundred yards separating them from the
door had been passed before the next attack came with-
out warning the two men in advance swayed for a mo-
ment and then fell headlong nankivell saw a cloud of
light green gas sweeping over the floor toward them
back he shouted back for your lives

  he set the example by a hasty retreat hardly had
they reached the shelter of the cylinders than four of the
atlanteans appeared in the doorway holding in their
hands long tubes mounted on stocks like rifles they
pointed the tubes toward the nobles of troyana
scatter cried nankivell

  they scattered like dust and none too soon from the
tubes which the atlanteans bore came a whistling hiss
four sparks flew through the air when they reached
the spot where a moment before had been a closely
packed group of men they burst into thousands of tiny
whirling fragments some of them struck their targets
and howls of anguish rose from the unfortunates who
were smitten by the strange weapons

  again nankiveils rifle cracked one of the atlan-
teans went down with a cry of agony the others hasti-
ly retreated out of sight before he could reload he
watched the doorway carefully ready to fire instantly
nahum came cautiously toward him

  what think you brother nankivell he asked can
we dare to rush them could we get within range our
flashtubes would be deadly but i fear they would slay
most if not all of us before we could do them damage
i expect youre right said nankivell nervously his
eye never leaving the doorway the best thing is to
cut and run gather our men together and make for
the entrance where we came in ill hold the rear until
you are all out and then ill cut after you once in the
labyrinth well be able to hold our own there are a
dozen places between here and the city where they cant
reach us with their weapons because of the curves in the
path until they are within range of our weapons oh
you would would you 

  a man had reappeared in the doorway for an instant
a small object in his hand he hurled it toward them
as he did so nankivells rifle cracked and he went down
in a heap he started to crawl toward the doorway and
nankivell raised his rifle for a second shot he lowered
it without firing

  let the poor devil go he said he was probably
only obeying orders anyway ive too few cartridges
left to waste any get the men together and start the
retreat nahum i cant hold them long

  nahums voice rang out through the cavern the no-
bles of troyana began to move slowly toward the lower
end of the vast cavern nankivell kept his eyes fixed
on the object which the atlantean had thrown into the
room

  run he cried suddenly bounding toward the dis-
tant doorway from the object was coming a cloud of
pale green gas spreading with frightful rapidity toward
them

  the men of troyana needed no second word like

frightened rabbits they fled toward the doorway and
temporary safety nankivell ran last looking backwards
every few steps it was well that he did so for three of
the atlanteans appeared in the doorway the long tubes
in their hands before they could discharge their death-
dealing projectiles nankivells rifle spoke the two left
standing beat a hasty retreat

the way was long and weary but the cavern en-
trance yawned before them at last as they plunged
into its depths nankivell stopped for a last look down
the long cavern across the upper end he could see a
dozen figures racing toward the upper entrance they
were the men who had been restored to life while the
first six were out getting ready their terrible weapons
among them nankivell could pick out the figure of the
king he dropped prone and covered the flying figure

  no he said regretfully as he rose ive only got
four cartridges left and i dont dare waste them id
probably miss a running man at that distance and i dont
care to let them know that a rifle isnt infallible

  he turned to nahum

  you had better form our men in column again he
said leave most of the charged tubes in the rear ill
command the rear guard and hold the atlanteans back
on every curve until the main body rounds the next one
then well retreat after you ive got ten shells for my
pistol and four for my rifle so i can delay them a while
look out for the divellcrs

  nahum formed his men in the formation suggested by
nankivell with a dozen men the american held the
rear while the balance made their way forward

  i dont think well have them after us for a while
said nankivell to mordecai the leader of the detachment
with him theyll stop to rouse a number of their com-
rades before they start in pursuit our biggest danger
will be from the dwellers

  nankivells prediction was borne out by subsequent
events no attack came from the rear the column
made its way forward at a good speed gradually the
light faded out and all along the line hand lights began
to glow

  look out for trouble he suddenly exclaimed his
nose had caught a whiff of the reptilian odor which
marked the presence of the huge toads who had taken so
heavy a toll of the column on its way out

  hardly had the words left his mouth than there came
the crash of a flashtube from the main body ahead the
musky odor became nauseating

  look sharp with the lights he cautioned

  the little group of men under his command turned
their lights nervously first one way and then the other
presently a vague form could be made out in the gloom
ahead of them

  charge him cried nankivell setting the example bv
running forward with a shout the huge bulk retreated
before him with a slight scuffling sound the stench
became almost intolerable

  as he passed a cross corridor a huge bulk lunged
toward him but nankivell was not napping his flash-
tube roared and the dweller was cast aside in a crumpled
heap from ahead of him could be heard the occasional
roar of a tube telling that the main body was not im-
mune from attack

  the bulk he was pursuing turned upna cross passage
nankivell approached cautiously his tube held ready he
troyana



shot his light down the route which the dweller had
taken but saw nothing a slight scuffling sound behind
him made his hair stand on end and chills run up his
spine he whirled about but before he could complete
the movement a flashtube roared behind him

  the way is clear brother nankivell came mor-
decais calm voice

  thanks said nankivell we had better catch up
with the main body i think the dwellers are enough
protection for our rear just now

  abandoning all efforts to guard the way behind them
the rearguard raced forward ever on the alert for the
approach of the huge toads presently a flash and a roar
a hundred yards ahead told them that they had almost
closed the gap which separated them from the main
body

  nankivell looked back along the way they had come
through the darkened passage a slender pencil ray of
violet light made itself dimly visible in the gloom

  here they come he cried mordecai and one other
stay with me the rest join nahum ill try to stop
them

  pie dropped prone his rifle stock cuddled against his
cheek the source of the violet light came nearer now
it was only a hundred yards away beside him prone
 the floor their lights extinguished lay his two com-
panions nankivell could not see the source of the violet
light but he knew pretty well where it must be he lined
his rifle as carefully as he could in the darkness and with
a prayer squeezed his trigger

  there was a flash of orange light and an ear-splitting
crack from up the tunnel came a cry of pain and the
violet light veered wildly again nankivell fired the
light dropped to the floor and he could hear the sound
of running feet he rose to go forward but there came
the fateful hissing sound he had heard in the vast cavern
only now a hundred times intensified through the
dark a tiny spark wended its way toward him

  he sprang to the side of the cavern realizing the use-
lessness of the move when that spark burst everything
within a radius of a hundred yards would be struck
by the tiny whirling sparks whose touch meant agony
unspeakable suddenly the spark died away there was
a hiss and an overwhelming reek of fetor nankivell
turned on his light one of the huge dwellers had been
creeping up in the darkness and the strange missile had
struck it fairly

  never thought id learn to love one of those things
he said whimsically but if i had time id go back and
drop a tear on his ugly carcass come on men the war
is over for a minute lets retreat to the next turn and
make another stand

  with mordecai and his companion ahead of him
nankivell sprinted up the tunnel he dared not turn on
his light and prayed fervently as he ran that none of the
dwellers would choose that moment for an attack luck
was with him and he rounded the next curve and saw the
lights of the main column a hundred yards ahead of him

  speed up your retreat nahum he cried the
atlanteans are after us

  we are almost beyond the region of the under-
ground dwellers was the- welcome answer if you
can hold them back for another half mile we will be in
the safe region

  ill hold them as long as the ammunition holds out
replied nankivell the next time ill let them come

to close quarters and use my pistol more effectively

   the column went on leaving the three men alone in the
 dark around the corner a dim glow of violet light
 could be seen he drew his pistol and slipped off the
 safety there was a dull thud in the darkness and then
 silence suddenly his nose caught a whiff of a strange
 sweet odor he sniffed again and his head swam and his
 senses reeled with a sudden suspicion he turned on his
 light twenty yards ahead of him on the floor lay a
 small globe from which pale green gas was slowly ooz-
 ing

   run he gasped staggering to his feet

   mordecai rose feebly but the other man did not stir
 nankivell stooped and grasped him by the collar the
 man was slight and with an effort of which he had not
 known himself capable nankivell threw the man over
 his shoulder and staggered at a feeble trot up the corri-
 dor toward troyana

   he had gone less than a hundred yards when a beam
 of pale violet light pierced the darkness over his head
 he dumped his burden on the ground and whirled about
 the source of the light had rounded the curve he
 raised his pistol and fired

   again there came a sound of retreating feet and the
 light winked out nankivell shouldered the unconscious
 form of his follower and staggered on he made his
 way for four hundred yards before he came to another
 bend in the tunnel he dropped his burden and bent
 over it his ear at the mans chest

   farewell brother he said sadly as he raised his
 head may the great architect bless and receive you
 and may your years in the place where you have gone be
 happy ones

   with a sudden thought he raised the body of the dead
 man and held it before him like a shield

  run mordecai he exclaimed join nahum and
tell him that i will hold the rear alone bid him haste
all he can

  the planner demurred but nankivell spoke per-
emptorily

  obey my orders he said alone i may be able
to hold them with the added care of you i could do
nothing go

   mordecai turned and fled up the tunnel nankivell
 lifted the body of the dead man and moved forward
 around the curve in the distance he could see the flicker
 of the deadly violet beam

   nearer it came until it was only thirty yards from
 him the wandering beam picked him out and played
 over the dead body nankivell crouched behind it pray-
 ing that it would not penetrate the flesh he felt a sud-
 -den numbness in his side as the beam found an unpro-
 tected spot the beam raised and played over the rest of
 the tunnel presently it winked out footsteps ap-
 proached slowly he gripped his pistol and waited

 the oncoming atlantean was less than ten feet from
 him when nankivell fired there was a crash as
 the man fell without a pause nankivell fired twice
 more down the cavern screams of pain rewarded him
 again came a sharp hiss but nankivell was on his feet
 and running for dear life he rounded the curve before
 the spark burst sending its thousands of sparks of de-
 struction in all directions

   i think thatll hold them for a while he muttered
 its lucky those big toads havent complicated matters


amazing stories

 more now if i can catch up with nahum before he is
 too far away

  he ran at his best speed up the tunnel it began t
slope upward and his breath came hard he rounded a
curve and found himself in a tunnel barely ten feet
across a hundred and fifty yards ahead of him
marched the main body

  i think ive stopped them for the present he said to
nahum as he panted up but theyll come on again if
we can reach the sanctuary and close the door on them
well get a breathing space at least how many men
did you lose on the passage

  eight said nahum sadly seven taken by the
dwellers and one smitten by a poorly aimed flashtube
the stairs are but a few hundred yards ahead it is
while we climb them that the atlantean will have their
chance to make an end of us

  not necessarily said nankivell cheerfully i still
have a few shots left and i think i have them pretty
well buffaloed ill go last and take an occasional pot-
shot at them if they get too frisky climbing the stairs
is going to be the hard task i doubt whether all of us
can make it

  those to whom the great architect gives strength
will win through to safety replied nahum we are
all in his hands

  before them loomed the flights of steps nankivell
shuddered as he thought of the thirty-five hundred steps
before them he looked back along the route they had
come in the distance flickered the deadly violet light

  forward he cried there is no time for loiter-
ing	 
the column started up the long ascent nankivell
climbed slowly in order to keep his hand steady he had
mounted two hundred steps before the violet light
reached the bottom of the flight now it started to
mount but it was no longer playing about as it had been
it held a straight course and one which it was easy to
avoid crouched on one side of the steps nankivell
waited

  when he judged that the light was within sixty steps
of him he raised his rifle to his shoulder steadily he
squeezed his trigger from the source of the light came
a brilliant purple flash and then darkness a sound as
of men in agony reached him a lucky shot had wrecked
the device which had been brought after them he raised
his rifle again and fired his last remaining shot into the
huddle of dark forms he could dimly see below him
there was a sound of a body falling and he knew that
his last shot had been a good one he raised his rifle
to hurl it down toward them but a thought made him
pause

  if they find the empty gun theyll know im out of
ammunition and theyll come right on he reflected
its an awful weight to carry up these long stairs with
me but i dont dare discard it well here goes

  he turned and went rapidly up the three hundred re-
maining steps of the flight as he reached the top he
paused almost exhausted

  whew he cried i had no idea that climbing was
such hard work if i hadnt been doped up by jereboam
two years ago id never be able to make it

  he paused to recover his breath before he made his
way along the level space which separated the flights
the main body was half way up the next set of steps
he stopped and waited pistol in hand until the end of

the column had climbed to the top dim as the light was
in the lower stretches his eyes so long accustomed to
darkness could see plainly when the main body had
disappeared on the level stretch he started his climb

  again he thought that his legs would fail him before
he surmounted the last of the five hundred steps but
grim necessity drove him on at the top he paused

  ill make a stand here he said theyll meet with
no opposition on the second flight and theyll come on
more carelessly

  he lay prone and watched down the steps presently
the forms of his pursuers came into view climbing
slowly as though they bore heavy weights wrhen they
were within thirty steps of the top they paused nanki-
vell could see that the three men in the front rank bore
the long tubes from which had come the deadly sparks
after a consultation one of them raised a tube to his
shoulder nankivell dared wait no longer he leveled
his pistol and fired

his aim was good with a choking cry the gunner
threw up his arms and fell backwards carrying
another man with him in his fall nankivell fired again
and one of the remaining gunners sank with a groan
the third raised his weapon and nankivell spent another
of his few remaining rounds the man dropped his
tube and grasped at his shoulder nankivell leaped to
his feet and fled along the level toward the third flight

  his marksmanship had been good enough to stop the
pursuit for a time and he climbed two flights well behind
the main body before there was a sign of continuing
pursuit

  this time the atlanteans changed their tactics in-
stead of coming on in a compact group they scattered
the gunners in front at each hundred steps they would
pause and fire upward a volley of their deadly sparks
which would burst into fragments each of them loaded
with suffering and death nankivell dared not wait
until they were close enough for accurate shooting
when they were as nearly as he could judge a hundred
and fifty steps below him he fired one of his four re-
maining loads he aimed low and he could hear the
ricocheting bullet whine through the air the atlanteans
dropped in their tracks like one man

  again nankivell fired and this time his shot took
effect an atlantean gave a cry of pain and leaped con-
vulsively upward a volley of sparks flew upward and
burst below him one spark fell on him and nankivell
bit his lips to keep from screaming in agony as it touched
him the gunners were preparing to fire again he
leaped to his feet and fled as fast as his wearied limbs
would allow

  at the top of the fifth flight he turned and dropped
prone his heart pounding as though it would burst
again the atlanteans came resolutely ahead in a scat-
tered formation

  i cant stop them much longer sobbed nankivell
through set teeth ill give them the two shots i have
left and hope it will hold them until we can win through
to safety

  he rested his pistol ow the top step and took deliber-
ate aim his pursuers were climbing slowly stopping
every fifty steps to send a volley of deadly sparks ahead
of them again he let them come within a hundred and
fifty steps before he fired

  at his first shot one of the gunners dropped in a heap
troyana



and slipped slowly down the stairs  sparks flew up to-
ward him but fortunately they burst behind him and he
was not harmed with a prayer on his lips he fired his
last shot a gunner rose to his feet with a shriek and
plunged down the long flight nankivell rose deliber-
ately and started down the stairs

   he had gone but ten steps when the atlanteans rose
-with one accord and fled back down nankivell did not
press his advantage as soon as the retreat was well
started he retraced his steps and made his way slowly
and with infinite difficulty up the sixth of the seven
flights leading to the sanctuary and he hoped to safety
as he surmounted the last of the steps he found the
main body waiting for him

   i fear we can not climb the last flight unaided
gasped nahum as nankivell joined them can you
hold them for ten minutes

   my last shot has been fired replied nankivell we
must press on else death is our portion

   a groan greeted his words it was checked by an ex-
clamation from jereboam

  succor he cried look one comes from the
sanctuary

   down the flight of steps came a blue-clad planner
at break-neck speed nahum rose and made his way
slowly up the steps to meet him the others trailing after
him many of them on all fours

   the planner raced down and came to a pause before
nahum

  have you brought aid and comfort junior
warder he gasped

   alas no i bring only added peril replied nahum

   then is troyana indeed doomed cried the mes-
senger

  what mean you demanded nahum while a mur-
mur rose from the men

   our store of energy is completely gone was the
answer not one atom remains in the sanctuary the
cohorts of amos have battered in the walls of the upper
city and are now hammering at the door of the sanctuary
itself

chapter xv
rescue

there was a moment of silence as the messenger
cried his words of doom it was broken by
nahums voice

   to the sanctuary he cried hoarsely

   forgotten were fatigue and aching muscles forgot-
ten were the ruthless enemies behind them in ihe mind
of each noble of troyana was but one thought to get
to the sanctuary and to interpose his body between the
cohorts of amos and the holy of holies in the assem-
bly hall as one man they raced up the long weary flight
of stairs sobbing with weariness yet held to their high
purpose by the ingrained training of centuries

  foremost in the race were nahum and nankivell
the aged junior warder was driven by his loyalty to
troyana and to the high order of which he was a mem-
ber nankivell was impelled by a different motive be-
fore his minds eye floated a sickening vision-estha
helpless in the hands of the degenerate bearers of
burdens

   the ascent seemed endless it required a separate
effort of his will for nankivell to mount each one of the

steps his heart pounded until it seemed that it would
burst through his ribs his breath came in sobbing
gasps yet strive as he would nahum kept three steps
ahead of him and was the first to mount the last step
without a pause he raced along the level corridor which
led to the entrance to the beleaguered citadel

  as nankivells feet reached the level he stumbled and
fell for an instant on one knee as he rose he was
tempted again to throw away the useless rifle which
bore him down as though it weighed a hundred pounds
he paused for an instant before he threw it down then
with an expression of grim determination he slung the
weapon back over his shoulder and ran as best he could
after the flying figure of the junior warder

  on the level nankivells younger muscles stood him
in good stead he was abreast of nahum when they
came to the gap in the rock through which they had
passed to descend into the regions below the lower city
side by side they dashed into the sanctuary

  a cry of dismay broke from nahums lips and was
reechoed by nankivell the situation was even worse
than the message of ill omen they had heard had led
them to believe through a gap which had been battered
in the walls of the sanctuary itself poured a stream of
black-clad figures evidently amos supply of energy
was exhausted as well as that of his opponents for no
crash of flashtubes was heard with sword club and
axe the burden bearers attacked the thin line of bril-
liantly clad nobles who opposed them

  crimson blue and yellow were mingled indiscrimi-
nately in the bitterly held battle line the nobles were
outnumbered three to one and still through that gap
in the wall more black-clad figures poured with a
cry nahum drew his sword and dashed forward to take
his place in the line of battle nankivell glanced at his
useless weapons with a groan

  oh for just one bandolier of ammunition he cried
well anyway a springfield makes a good club
grasping his useless weapon by the muzzle he threw
himself into the fight he found himself beside zepha-
niah the master was endeavoring with a short sword
in the use of which he was none too expert to defend
himself against the attack of two men armed with heavy
axes as nankivell reached him his guard was broken
down and a heavy axe swept down toward his head
nankivell thrust forward the stock of his rifle and de-
flected the blow stepping back a step he swung the
weapon it crashed down on the head of his assailant
at the same instant zephaniahs sword was driven home
in the body of the other attacker

  you come in good time brother gasped the master
have you word of cheer

  none most worshipful sir other enemies are at
our heels with strange and terrible weapons

  then must we retreat while we may replied zepha-
niah

  they had drawn back from the front of the battle line
the master swept a keen eye up and down the line the
nobles reinforced by the men who had accompanied
nahum into the lower regions were momentarily hold-
ing their own men in black robes with only a narrow
band of color about their necks to mark their exalted
rank were still pouring through the doorway which led
to the chamber where the court of atlantis slept and
now came a sudden diversion which gave his forces an
advantage


amazing stories

  as nahums men joined the line a flashtube crashed
a dozen men who were in front of the heavy charge of
static electricity went down as though a thunderbolt had
smitten them the first crash was followed by another
and yet another until all along the line tubes flashed and
roared the front rank of amos forces was swept
away and tossed into heaps mere husks of quivering
scorched flesh above the din could be heard nahums
voice

  forward he cried sweep the scum back to their
haunts

  a cheer answered his words more crashes of dis-
charging tubes filled the air with a roar of sound sword
in hand the nobles pressed forward for a moment it
looked as though they would be victorious and again
hurl their attackers out of the sacred precincts they had
dared to profane

  there was a sudden cessation of the sound of dis-
charging tubes the nobles still pressed forward but
the burden bearers no longer retreated behind them
stood a figure attired in the crimson robes of the cryp-
tic rite and with the golden jewel of a master flashing
on his breast

  their tubes are exhausted he shouted now they
are at your mercy one more charge and we possess the
upper city forward

  amos cried nankivell

  he searched frantically in his pockets hoping against
hope that he would find an overlooked cartridge but his
hope was vain the black-clad line surged forward
driving back the defenders of the sanctuary by sheer
weight of numbers an inspiration came to nankivell

  where are the women he shouted to zephaniah

  in the assembly hall

  nankivell drew back from the battle line and raced at
top speed toward the inner hall where stood the holy
of holies the great altar of troyana

  he burst through the half dozen men who guarded it
inside were a crowd of women and children on their
knees praying silently for their men who battled to the
death outside he looked around but could not find the
one he sought

rfstha he shouted

a-j here frank answered a clear voice as estha
rose from her knees

  the other pistol quick he panted if i can
shoot amos we may turn the tide yet

  she handed the weapon to him he paused for an
instant to snatch a hurried kiss before he dashed out
into the battle which waged in the courtyard amos
was still in plain sight urging forward his minions

  nankivell opened the pistol and gave an exclamation
of disappointment he had thought that he had left
two cartridges in it but there was only one if he used
it to end amos evil career there would be no sudden
and merciful death for his beloved when the last barrier
was smashed and the hordes of burden bearers poured
into the assembly hall to work their will on the women
of their masters

  joo bad but it cant be helped he muttered kill-
ing him is our best chance

  he moved forward until he was in the thick of the
fight amos stood motionless barely thirty yards from
him he could get no closer safely he raised the
pistol and carefully aligned the sights on the center of

the renegades broad chest he slowly tightened his
grasp there was a sharp crack as the weapon went
off nankivell hurled it to the ground with a cry of
rage just as he fired one of the combatants lurched
against him his lone bullet had gone wide of the mark

  a blow fell on the back of his head and he lurched
forward in an instant he was surrounded by black-
clad figures who thrust at him with swords and daggers
and strove to reach him with their axes their very
numbers hindered them so that for an instant he was
unharmed a sword hit home in his thigh and he dropped
on one knee his hand came in contact with an axe
which had fallen from the hand of a smitten man and
he staggered to his feet the weapon in his hand

  the close-packed ring about him gave back as a huge
atlantean rushed at him a heavy axe lifted above his
head nankivell dodged back and the axe swept harm-
less through the air he leaped to one side as well as
his crippled leg would allow and smote in turn but his
weakened leg would not support him and he went down
with a diabolical grin the atlantean raised his axe for
a second stroke nankivell shut his eyes but before
the blow could fall a sword flashed across him and
buried itself to the hilt in the black-clad body

  nankivell staggered to his feet axe in hand beside
him stood nahum holding a bloody sword

  to my back the junior warder shouted

  nankivell obeyed back to back the two men fought
nahums sword a whirling circle of steel while nanki-
vells rose and fell with deadly effect two men could
not long wage battle against such odds but help was
close at hand there was a sudden surge and a group of
yellow-clad figures burst through the sombre ring they
circled the two men and bore them back to the battle
line where the retreating nobles were doggedly con-
testing every step of the way

  the odds had grown until five burden bearers op-
posed every one of the higher degrees by sheer weight
of numbers they forced them back until the nobles were
gathered in a circle about the wide doors of the assembly
hall

  the shouting had long since died out there was no
breath to waste in vain cries in that terrible struggle
only the ring of steel on steel and the dull thud of
falling axes could be heard with now and then an in-
voluntary cry of anguish from a wounded man

  no quarter was asked or given if a noble fell be-
neath the feet of his former slaves he knew his fate a
sword or an axe ended his life if he were sorely wound-
ed if not he was dragged to the rear doomed to be
offered as a sacrifice to that grotesque travesty in the
lower city before which the burden bearers celebrated
their depraved worship the atlanteans were waging
a grim war of extermination on those who had held
them in subjection and bred them like cattle for count-
less generations

  the circle of the altars defenders grew steadily
smaller as man after man fell before the dogged attack
of the atlanteans still there was no thought of sur-
render and each man fell on the ground where he
stood and another stepped forward to take his place
nankivell drew back from the front line for an instant
and looked around a cry of dismay and horror came
from his parched lips through the gap in the stone
which led to the lower regions emerged a line of men
attired in leather harness sparkling with brilliant gems
troyana



and with short cloaks of vivid colors hanging from their
golden collars in the hands of the foremost were long
thin tubes somewhat resembling rifles the long-sleep-
ing king of atlantis had come to the aid of the descend-
ants of his abandoned subjects

  at nankivells cry there was a momentary pause in
the fighting both sides looked at the newcomers anx-
iously the burden bearers feared that their former
masters had obtained assistance while only those who
had fought underground with nahum knew who the
newcomers were

  a word of command barked sharply through the
silence the gunners raised their long tubes

  fly cried nankivell into the assembly hall and
close the doors or all is lost

  the last part of his speech was drowned in a sharp
long-drawn-out hiss from the threatening tubes came
a volley of bright sparks which sailed through the air
toward the defenders of the altar just before they
reached their goal they burst and the air was filled with
thousands of whirling motes of light they settled on
friend and foe alike

  now the battlefield rang with screams of agony from
the unfortunates who were struck by those whirling
motes they rolled on the ground in almost unsupport-
able agony

  above the screams sounded another hoarse word of
command the gunners raised their tubes again a
shudder ran through the ranks of the troyana nobles
helpless against this horrible weapon the seconds
seemed to be years in length nankivell felt that he
could no longer stand the strain and that a scream
would burst from his lips despite himself unless his tor-
tured mind gave way before the horror he knew was
coming the atlantean king raised his hand his lips
opened to give the word of command which would send
another volley of death-dealing missiles into the ranks
of troyana

  through the silence came a sharp crack before
nankiveils astonished gaze the atlantean king spun
around and fell headlong the command ungiven an-
other vicious report split the air and one of the gunners
threw up his arms and fell backwards as he did so there
was a sharp hiss from his tube a spark left it and
traveled straight up it burst and showered the whirl-
ing motes of light down on the adherents of the king
of atlantis

  with growing wonder nankivell whirled about in
the doorway of the assembly hall standing on the top-
most of the seven steps which separated the doorway
from the courtyard were two figures in their hands
were rifles from which a steady stream of fire now
poured on the remnants of the court of atlantis

  bob mariston he cried unable to believe his eyes
ray willis he shouted as he recognized the second
figure

  he turned and hobbled up the stairs unslinging his
rifle from his back as he did so 

  give me ammunition he cried

  mariston ceased his fire long enough to unsling a
bandolier and toss it to him

  dont waste a shot youngster he cried as he re-
loaded his rifle and fired again and again at the retreating
invaders from the lower levels

  now there were three rifles pouring in a deadly hail
of missiles and the remnants of the atlantean kings

court were crowding one another to win through the
narrow gap in the rock to comparative safety in an-
other moment they were gone

  the three riflemen turned their weapons on the ranks
of the burden bearers they fired rapidly but their
volume of fire was too small to have much effect on the
hundreds of black-clad figures who had followed amos
from the lower city with the menace of the atlantean
nobles removed the attack was resumed desperately
as they fought the nobles were still being driven back
despite the withering fire of the rifles

  two figures detached themselves from the battle line
and raced toward the assembly hall they came to a
halt before the newcomers

  brought you energy worshipful brother cried
one to mariston

  oh hello nahum answered mariston fraternal
greetings most worshipful sir yes ive got thirty
pounds of the stuff in my pack here

  then troyana is saved was the joyous rejoinder
of nahum and zephaniah

  mariston grounded his rifle and slid out of the sus-
penders of his pack he tossed it to nahum the
junior warder fumbled with the straps for an instant
and then rose the light of victory in his eyes

  it is here he cried come we will start the pro-
jectors

  followed by zephaniah he ran behind the battle line
toward the room which housed the emergency power
unit adjoining the assembly hall the two men disap-
peared from view mariston raised his rifle and re-
sumed firing

  for another five minutes the battle raged then from
a huge tube mounted on top of the power unit came a
fierce red light like an avenging flame it swept down
on the ranks of the burden bearers and in its wake was
death and destruction robes burst into flames and a
sickening smell of burning flesh permeated the air with
cries of terror the cohorts of amos turned and fled

  a second ray joined the first side by side the two
beams of red swung over the battlefield and where they
passed was left no living thing the burden bearers
left alive fled with cries of fear through the gap they had
made in the sanctuary walls and sought haven in the
lower levels in a minute the courtyard was free from
living enemies

  the rifle fire had ceased there was nothing left to
shoot at nankivell grounded his rifle and wrung maris-
ton and willis by the hand

  you got my message he asked uselessly of
course i know you did i was sure youd come but
you sure got here in the nick of time another ten min-
utes and it would have been just too bad

  glad to see you old man cried mariston his arm
about nankivells shoulder ray and i were afraid
it was your ghost when we heard your voice on dunes
trick receiver we started at once and we won through
although we lost every man of our followers

  let me ask you a question broke in willis did
you rescue estha all right wed have come after you
that morning if you hadnt stolen all of the ammunition
we had

  yes estha is safe replied nankivell of course
youd have come you darned fool but i did better alone
i knew what i was about

  for a wonder laughed willis


amazing stories

  i suppose you and estha are married long ago
  nankivells face fell

  no he said we arent the master couldnt see
it at least not until amos was defeated and our rule was
reestablished

  in that case i hear wedding bells chiming said
willis with a chuckle how about it bob

  i hope so laughed mariston his face grew sud-
denly sober and he looked at nankivell

  frank he said hesitatingly balkis-

  is still alive and will probably thrash you for wot
coming back with me two years ago she-

  zephaniah stood before them

  worshipful brother mariston and you brother wil-
lis he said ceremoniously to you are the thanks of
troyana due for your rescue of her in her extremity no
gift that our city affords will be denied you you have
but to ask and you shall receive

  well talk that over later most worshipful sir
said mariston brusquely meanwhile brother willis
has another thirty pounds of cobalt you had better
take it and get busy there is work yet to be done
work asked zephaniah in puzzled tone as he took
the pack which willis handed him and tossed it to a
planner who stood near by

  yes important work youve got amos on the run
now keep after him dont give him a chance to bolster
up his mens morale which is shot to pieces right now
gather every man and well go after him where he lives
get your flashtubes ready

  a sudden glow illuminated the masters face

  those are words of wisdom he said every flash-
tube is empty but with the energy you have brought we
can recharge them all in an hour then we will be ready
to march

  meanwhile added nankivell you had better close
that door through which we went down below

  that is being done by brother jereboam replied
the master he will close it and also drop fourteen
emergency doors each one hundred feet thick at the
top and bottom of each flight of steps leading below we
need fear nothing further from that quarter now if
brothers mariston and willis will come with me we
will prepare for the attack

  after wre settle amos well talk about what to do to
those chaps down below said nankivell meanwhile
you can load the flashtubes without us i want to see
estha and i fancy that my friends have someone they
would like to see as well well be ready to march as
soon as you get the flashtubes charged

  in an hour we will be ready to storm amos strong-
hold replied the master

chapter xvi
balkis

with mariston and willis at his heels nankivell
led the way toward the door of the assembly
hall they walked through cheering ranks of
planners and craftsmen who strove to do honor to their
rescuers as they passed through the doorway into the
vast hall the din of cheering was left behind in the
inner shrine the entire concourse were on their knees
while jereboam stood before the altar offering thanks to
the great architect for the aid he had vouchsafed the

city they paused until the prayer was ended as the
kneeling throng rose to their feet nankivell spoke
estha he called

  jereboam turned at the words and saw them
honor be to those to whom honor is done he cried
in a ringing voice

women of troyana do honor to worshipful
brother mariston and to brother willis for the trials
they have undergone and for the aid they have rendered
oh stow that exclaimed willis uncomfortably
mariston grinned at him quizzically

  better get used to it ray he advised laughingly
theyre going to make a hero of you in spite of all you
say or do so you might just as well like it

four of the women came forward before mariston
they dropped on their knees while one of them spoke
worshipful sir she said the humble thanks of the

women of troyana-

  help cried mariston faintly while willis and
nankivell grinned

  better get used to it bob said the latter

  mariston stepped forward and raised the leader of the
deputation from her knees

  i appreciate your gratitude he said but really
youre thanking the wrong man ray willis is the
man who is really responsible for our being here please
favor him with your attention for a while he likes it
brother nankivell and i have serious business to at-
tend to

  the woman caught willis hand and raised it to her
lips mariston and nankivell hurried away with wil-
lis cry of double-crossers ringing in their ears

  it was a dirty trick frank chuckled mariston
but i know you went to see estha and ive waited two
years to see balkis i wonder where she is

  well find out from estha old man shes in the
alcove to the north of the oriental throne now buck
up for i think you have another installment of hero-
worship coming such are the penalties of grandeur
he led the way to the alcove where estha was wait-
ing her face aglow with joy mingled with anxiety
are you hurt frank was her first question
nothing serious he replied i got a dig in my leg
that ill let you bandage although it has quit bleeding
already if it hadnt been for bob mariston here my
name would have been dennis sure enough i really
think you had better go down on your knees to thank
him he expects it and he likes that sort of stuff

  he winked as he spoke estha and a girl who stood
behind her in the dark shadows dropped on their knees
estha reached for maristons hand with the evident in-
tention of kissing it

  frank nankivell ill wring your neck cried maris-
ton as he leaped for his companion

  youre a hero any way you look at it bob cried
nankivell as he dodged the attack you might just
as well like it come on estha well leave worshipful
brother bob to the tender mercies of his admirers for
a while i want you to bind up my leg

  he caught her by the hand and lifted her to her feet
with a parting laugh at maristons rueful countenance
he led her away to the main hall leaving mariston to
face the still kneeling girl

  really now protested mariston i wish you
wouldnt kneel to me like that im not used to it and
besides-
troyana



  his voice trailed off into silence as the girl looked
up he stared at her unbelievingly for an instant and
then a wave of color passed over his face

  balkis he cried

  balkis looked at him shyly

  may i not thank you worshipful sir she said
for what you have done for troyana and for my coun-
trymen 

  balkis he exclaimed a note of pain in his voice
am i worshipful sir to you you didnt use to use
such formality

  but then you were not one whom the wearers of
the purple had seen fit to honor as one who merited the
homage and thanks of all she answered her face
averted now it is fitting that i kneel to humbly offer
you thanks

  mariston stepped forward and raised her to her feet

  if youre going to act like that im going to be sorry
that i came back here he said balkis ive longed
so much to see you arent you just a little glad to
see me

  surely i am glad to see my citys rescuer she an-
swered with downcast eyes never was any one more
welcome than you are

  welcome because i brought aid he demanded

  why else my lord

  mariston turned away a wry expression on his face

  i suppose so he said naturally you were glad
to see amos and his followers thrust back where they
belong well were going down after them in a few
minutes an hour should suffice to restore the rule of
the master without any serious fighting

  fighting she exclaimed faintly must there be
more fighting

  a little im afraid amos will fight to the last
ditch and so will a few of his followers

  must you go she asked you have done enough
cannot you stay here and let the others fight the last
battle

  not by a long shot he declared i wouldnt miss
the final windup for anything i havent done any
fighting at all yet this may be a first-class scrap
why shouldnt i go

  as my lord wills she answered who am i that
my wishes should influence one of your exalted rank

mariston turned back toward her an expression
of pain on his face

  i didnt expect a greeting like this from you balkis
he said i came back here when nankivell called to me
to bring aid to him and to my brothers i would have
come for that reason but i had another thing which
urged me more strongly even than loyalty hardly had
i left troyana two years ago than i realized that i had
thrown away any chance of happiness that the world
might hold for me i realized how utterly wrong and
foolish i had been when i told nankivell that a mar-
riage between him and estha would not bring happi-
ness my heart was sore at my folly

  when i found that he and estha had outwitted me
and that she had fled with him i rejoiced for them but
my heart bled the more in trying to save them i had
offered my own heart as a sacrifice and it had been a
vain one

  had the opportunity been mine i would have re-
turned but the way was forever closed to me then and

there i swore that if the way should ever open i would
return to troyana never to leave again when i heard
nankivells message my heart leaped with a throb of
joy for i knew that if i lived to win through i would
see you again i dreamed of many ways in which you
would greet me but never of a way like this

  and why did my lord wish to see his humble hand-
maiden asked the girl

  need i tell you balkis it was because i loved you
because you were more to me than all else in the world
your face has been before me day and night and your
voice has rung in my ears i came back here that i
might say to you those words i foolishly choked back
the words i love you balkis i have won through to
your side now i avow my love for you and ask you to
be my wife will you take me

  surely my lord she replied could any maid of
troyana refuse anything which the rescuer of her city
asked did not jereboam order us to honor you and
to grant your desires surely i will wed with you
my lord and count myself honored

  a groan burst from maristons lips

  it is not for gratitude that i wish you to marry me
balkis he cried unless you love me dont offer
yourself as a sacrifice on the altar of gratitude for that
would make neither of us happy tell me do you love
another 

  how could i think of love for another when my lord
has honored me by offering to wed with me a humble
maid who is nothing unless my lord thinks that being
born in the blue is a virtue surely but one love could
fill my heart love for him who braved all dangers to
come to the rescue of my hardly pressed countrymen
let gratitude be cried mariston hoarsely answer
me plainly is there one whom you love

  yes my lord she said faintly there is one whom
i have loved for years one who i have prayed would
one day favor me

  mariston bowed his head he raised it again in a
moment a rare smile showing through the pain

  i might have known he said softly i wish you
every happiness with the man of your choice balkis
i am sorry that it had to turn out so but if you are
happy i shall be content who is he

  it is one who might have had me long ago for the
asking but who steeled his heart against me and left me
desolate for that i vowed that i would one day punish
him have i done so

  why-who-what do you mean

  balkis raised her head and allowed her glorious eyes
to look full into his

   oh bob you silly boy she cried laughter and tears
in her voice dont you know its you dearest its
always been you now kiss me quickly before i scream
balkis he cried hardly believing his ears

  she held out her arms and he caught her to him in a
passionate embrace

   break away there thirty feet is the footage limit 
that kiss came nankivells cheery voice

  mariston released balkis for an instant

  go soak your head frank he said

  aint love grand estha went on nankivelfs cheery
raillery can you imagine staid old bob mariston act-
ing like a love-sick calf and inviting his best friend to
soak his head such is life i suppose he wont even
have time to tell me how duncan is getting along


amazing stories

  hes in the same condition i hope to be in soon mar-
ried retorted mariston now will you please make
yourself scarce for a week or two youve been with
estha for the past two years but balkis and i have to
make up on lost time

  oh woodman spare her limbs cried nankivell in
mock alarm as mariston caught balkis to him again
estha isnt that a disgusting sight right out in
public too not a bit of decent reticence i can
hardly believe that it is your very proper cousin who is
making such a spectacle of herself i really think we
should call nahum to come and put a stop to it

  will you please take poison replied mariston
this place is entirely too crowded for comfort about
two less would be just right

  such words to his old friend too estha love has
a deteriorating effect on some people hasnt it

  yes frank it has came in a smothered tone from
balkis were acting almost as silly as you and estha
usually do

  bulls-eye cried nankivell however seriously
you had better break away for a moment afighting we
must go right soon worshipful sir and youd better
clear the cobwebs and moonshine from your brain
youre likely to need all your wisdom if any also i
have some bad news for you

tt hat is it frank asked mariston as he settled
  vv his arm around balkis waist

  youre planning to get married arent you

  sure as shooting

  i hope you do but i wouldnt bet  it heres the
proposition balkis is in the same boat that estha is
in she wears the blue and her marriage is a state
matter and one that must be approved by the master

i	have been plaguing zephaniah for the past two years to
consent to my wedding to estha but thats as far as i
got

  the dickens cried mariston whats his objec-
tion 

  he never exactly refused outright replied nanki-
vell although if nahum hadnt been so hot for it i
think he would have however he didnt give his con-
sent and put me off promising an answer after amos
was overthrown and the old order was re-established in
troyana

  well that wont take long

  i hope not but it may take a longer time than you
expect to be sure amos had no energy left when he
launched his last attack but he may have some now
where would he get it

  you saw those men who were firing at us when you
came in the ones you shot down first

  yes

  well those werent amos men nor were they his
allies at that time had we been able to march against
the lower city at once the battle would have been short-
lived but this hours delay worries me amos is a crafty
old fox and he saw those men we didnt kill all of
them nor any large part of them im afraid that hell
have sought them out and patched up some sort of an
alliance with them

  who were they

  briefly nankivell told mariston of the trip made into
the caverns below the lower city and what had been
found there

  isnt the road blocked for them demanded mari-
ston

  the road by which we entered their domain is
blocked but unfortunately there are two other paths to
those caves one leads out into the jungles but the
other leads to the lower city i left the elevator down
at the lower level with the door open when i entered
there two years ago to be sure there isnt an elevator
powered but i am uneasy

  if the power is off what can they do

  nothing i hope but im not at all sure those
men know a good deal about science as is shown by
their weapons if they find that elevator they may be
able to power it from below if they have done so we
may find a warm welcome waiting for us in the lower
city

  hmmm that wont be so good

  it wont even be funny but luckily we have three
rifles and lots of ammunition i held them back for
quite a while with one rifle a pistol and thirty-one cart-
ridges with our combined fire we may be able to do
something even if they do meet us

  well time enough to solve that problem when we
are face to face with it therell be some way out
meanwhile ive got two years of back kisses coming
from balkis and im going to collect right now

  he turned toward her but paused as his eye fell on
a tall stately figure who had approached unseen
nahum he cried

  bob mariston cried the junior wtarder as he
grasped the hand of his friend others will thank you
for the aid you brought so timely let me tell you
simply that i am glad to see my friend again and to re-
joice with him and with my niece in their happiness
oh stammered mariston excuse me youre her
guardian arent you i ask your permission and your
blessing

  granted my friend replied nahum granted be-
fore it is asked my earnest prayers shall accompany
yours when your petition is offered to the masters
throne but now war calls us from the arms of love
the master bids me tell you that the flashtubes are
charged and the brethren assembled as soon as you
join us we will march

chapter xvii
the end of the golden calf

at the door of the assembly hall zephaniah and
ray willis came forward to meet them in the
- courtyard where the desperate battle had raged
four bodies of men were drawn up the lines of men
were brilliant in their blue and yellow robes with here
and there a splash of crimson marking where a brother
of the cryptic degree had taken his place in the ranks
the belts of all were hung heavy with flashtubes

  here are all that are left of the nobles of troyana
said the master one of these four bodies will remain
here as guards under the command of the junior warder
the other three bodies will be under the command of
jereboam hosea and myself brother nankivell will
accompany me as my second in command and brother
willis will go with jereboam in the same capacity wor-
shipful brother mariston will go with hosea and guide
him with his wisdom
troyana



  there are three main entrances to the lower city
each is reached by a shaft in which is a vertical con-
veyor capable of carrying fifty men each body will
take a separate shaft and will fight its way through the
lower city meeting in the great amphitheater

  on the way thither jereboams force will take pos-
session of the crypt as soon as its possession is se-
cure jereboam will open the vault so that a continuous
flow of energy will be assured he will start the main
converters and will remain there with sufficient men to
guard what he has captured with him go all of the
cryptic degree except three the rest of his party
under the command of brother willis will join us in
the amphitheater which is close at hand he will enter
it by the south entrance

  the detachment under hosea will seize the main gen-
erator unit and start the largest compressors we will
drive the burden bearers to the lowest levels and air
will be needed at once hosea will organize an emer-
gency force large enough to keep the generators and
compressors at work and to guard the place worship-
ful brother mariston will take command of the rest and
make a circle through the city so as to enter the amphi-
theater from the west

  brother nankivell and i will sweep through the city
driving the burden bearers to the lower levels and enter
the meeting place from the east the amphitheater is the
place where the heaviest resistance will be met with if
we meet with any at all all will bear in mind that no
more burden bearers are to be killed than is absolutely
necessary we have already so reduced their numbers
that we will be short of human labor for a generation
drive them below where we can sort them over at our
leisure and mete out suitable punishment to the lead-
ers whom we feel should be made an example of

  what of amos most worshipful sir asked hosea
capture him if you can brother senior warder
but above all harm him not better it is that he escape
for the present and take refuge with his followers than
that he be harmed such a traitor as he is has never
before been known in the annals of troyana and such a
one should be suitably punished now does everyone
understand the plan and his part in it

  there was a murmur of assent from the leaders
then may the great architect aid and bless us and
may our arms prevail against the forces of sin and
iniquity brethren to your posts

  under their leaders the three bodies swung off to
take up their appointed tasks their paths coincided
for a few hundred yards they came to an intersecting
passage and zephaniah halted them while he spoke to
mariston

  your path turns left here he said when you
reach the vertical conveyor fill it with men set the con-
trol for maximum speed and wait so far no elevators
are powered my detachment will enter the farthest one
as soon as i give the signal power will be applied to
all three simultaneously in that way we will all attack
at the same time and avoid having one body left to face
all the forces of amos you understand your part of
the plan

  thoroughly most worshipful sir

  then go the power will be on in about ten min-
utes

  at the next cross corridor jereboam turned off to
the right with his command leaving the third contingent

under zephaniah and nankivell to push on alone

  i am relieved about one thing brother nankivell
said the master i feared that amos had secured an-
other supply of power and might meet us in the upper
city outside the sanctuary the fact that he awaits
our attack below would indicate that he is really help-
less

  i certainly hope so weve lost enough men already

  yes and they are men whom we can ill spare for
they can be replaced but slowly the great architect
grant that our losses are at an end

  in silence the detachment marched on horizontal
conveyors ran through the walls paralleling their line
of march but it was no part of zephaniahs plan to place
power on any devices outside the walls of the sanctuary
before he had to any power he supplied would be
equally at the command of amos at last the column
paused before a recess in the wall before them was
an empty vertical conveyor at a word from the master
nankivell and fifty of the nobles crowded into the small
space nankivell set the control lever for maximum
speed downward at the same time setting the automatic
stop which avould bring the car to rest at the level of
the amphitheater

  all ready he reported to zephaniah

  the master pressed a button on a box which he
carried in his hand a disc on its front glowed green
and zephaniah spoke clearly toward it

  power on please he said

  hardly had the words left his lips than the car shot
down with sickening speed nankivell caught at the
control lever with a groan before he had time to move
it the downward acceleration ceased and the car began
to slow down it stopped with a sudden jerk the
heavy stone block which shut it off from the lower city
moved aside automatically before them lay an empty
passageway

  come out quickly cried nankivell

  he set the example by springing out into the empty
corridor one man remained in the elevator as soon
as it was empty the stone block slid in front of it

  spread out in a skirmish line cried nankivell

  the men who had come with him ran down the cor-
ridor in both directions dropping prone at five yard
intervals in a moment the stone block slid to one side
and another fifty men joined him it was only a matter
of minutes for the third contingent under zephaniah to
enter the corridor as the master emerged he turned to
nankivell

  what was that noise he demanded

  it sounded like a flashtube in the distance re-
plied nankivell the other bodies are probably en-
gaged

  then there is no time to be lost cried zephaniah
form in column and follow me

  he led the way at a swinging run down the passage
for three hundred yards they met with no resistance
they swung around a corner before them were three
black-clad figures evidently sentries at the sight of
the gorgeously attired column they gave cries of alarm
and fled away the intermittent crash of flashtubes
could be heard quite plainly now and several times the
sharp crack of a rifle punctuated the noise

  here is where we meet resistance if ever cried
the master

  with the column at his heels he burst into the vast


amazing stories

amphitheater with its seating capacity of thousands as
they passed the doorway a blinding flash of light filled
the hall and they were hurled to the ground by a ter-
rific crash

for a moment they could see nothing gradually
the scene cleared on the floor before them lay a
group of burden bearers evidently caught by the crash
which had greeted them on their entrance further back
stood another larger group hesitating whether to stand
their ground or to fly

  charge them cried nankivell one good charge
and theyll break and run

   he sprang to his feet and raced across the floor as he
spoke the nobles of troyana trailing after him the
hesitating group broke and fled at their approach with
cheers the men following nankivell raced on they
reached the middle of the great hall suddenly there
came a sound which froze the marrow in nankivells
bones above the sound of shouting came a sharp hiss
a spark floated through the air from the seats on the
opposite side of the hall and made its way toward them

   scatter he cried scatter out and take cover

   obediently they scattered but not soon enough the
spark burst and thousands of tiny whorls of light floated
downward death in the touch of each of them before
they landed inspiration visited nankivell

   flashtubes he shouted fire a couple of tubes up-
ward 

  he set the example by discharging one of his tubes
into the air all of the sparks in the vicinity of the dis-
charge died out in darkness others followed his exam-
ple and the menace was temporarily over another hiss
came from the seats and a half dozen sparks floated up

  flashtubes again cried nankivell hit them be-
fore they burst

   the air was torn by the thunder of discharging tubes
nankivell did not use his he rapidly unslung his rifle
and brought it to his shoulder again came the
menacing hiss but mingled with it came the crack of
nankivells weapon a figure rose from the distant
seats and fell forward to the floor

   again and again nankivells rifle cracked the hiss-
ing kept up steadily but the carefully aimed flashtubes
of the nobles of troyana killed the tiny sparks before
they had time to burst and spread death and destruction
broadcast there was a momentary lull in the fighting
a dull plop was heard behind them nankivell looked
around and a hoarse cry of alarm came from his lips on
the dais behind them where stood the golden calf was
a group of men attired in the dress of the long-sleeping
nobles of atlantis as he looked one of them hurled a
small round object to the amphitheater floor there was
another dull plop a cloud of light green gas could be
seen emerging from the two spheres on the floor

   nankivell swung around and leveled his rifle at the
group on the dais before he had time to fire a fateful
hiss came from behind him the crash of flashtubes
told him that his followers had seen and were combating
the menace he leveled his rifle and fired one of the
figures on the dais dropped but a volley of the deadly
gas bombs came from above the cloud was perilously
close

   charge the seats came zephaniahs ringing voice

  the nobles of troyana turned and charged toward
the section of seats from whence had come the deadly

sparks they were within a hundred yards of it when
a dozen dull green spheres flew through the air to break
in front of them they were caught between two clouds
of the deadly gas

  to the north cried zephaniah

  they swung to the left and raced toward the north
side of the hall from directly behind them came an-
other hiss and the air was alive with the malignant
sparks they did not pause to reply to the fire but fled
toward the north they had almost reached the north
tier of seats when a cloud of black-robed figures rose and
swept down on them

  the nobles met the attack with the crash of flashtubes
the front of the attack melted away but for every bur-
den bearer who fell two rose to take his place behind
them rolled the deadly gas while overhead the terror-
inspiring sparks writhed through the air as if in intel-
ligent pursuit of them

  make a stand men cried nankivell its all we
can do

  he dropped to the floor and cuddled the rifle to his
cheek the group on the dais were still plainly visible
he lined his sights on them and fired an atlantean
noble fell headlong he reloaded but did not fire as the
futility of it struck him the deadly cloud of gas was
only a few feet away

  a sudden shout faint and far distant came from the
south side of the hall mingled with it was the crack
of a rifle

  ray willis cried nankivell joy vibrant in his
voice

  he threw up his rifle and fired rapidly from the
seats where the deadly fire of sparks had rained on them
a fresh volley rose from the air but mingled with the
hissing came the crash of flashtubes and the crack of
willis rifle taken iw flank the entrenched sleepers
were doomed

  with a shout zephaniah led his men against the wav-
ering burden bearers before him they fought bravely
for a moment before they broke and fled in all directions
nankiveils rifle spoke as rapidly as he could work his
bolt and fire the defeat had been suddenly changed
to victory but for one thing the deadly cloud of gas
was creeping steadily nearer nankivell began to cough

  im afraid theyve got us he cried to zephaniah

  even as he spoke he became aware that the gas was
growing less dense it seemed to be retreating from
them rather than advancing above the din of battle
he could hear a distant hum and a sigh as of rushing
air he looked inquiringly at zephaniah

  we are saved cried the master hosea has
captured the generator unit he has seen our peril
through observers and he has started the largest com-
pressors they will change the air in this hall in four
minutes when driven at top speed let us attack the
dais

  at his call his men rallied about him and started an
advance toward the distant dais on which stood the figure
of the golden calf from the west side of the hall
another body of men entered and advanced toward them
nankivell gave a cry of joy in the lead ran mariston

  the three bodies met in the center of the great amphi-
theater willis and mariston grasped nankivells hand
warmly but there was no time for congratulations
from the dais came a stir of movement and a dull violet
light flashed through the air
troyana



  at zephaniahs command the nobles of troyana scat-
tered and ran toward the dais hardly had the ad-
vance started than it ceased everyone in the room
stood frozen with horror through the air pulsing like
a malignant living entity came a sound a sound of fear
and terror distant and yet near it filled the hall ham-
mering away at the brains of the hearers as though
drilling holes through the living tissue

  the drums came a wailing cry the hooves of
the calf woe woe woe

  damn shouted willis amos must have snagged
some power somewhere shoot men shoot all you
know good work bob the maristons always could
shoot wheres nankivell  oh there you are young-
ster keep your eyes open theyll charge in a minute

  he threw up his rifle and fired again and again with
deadly accuracy the violet ray was roaming over the
floor of the amphitheater fully half of the nobles of
troyana were standing frozen in their tracks paralyzed
by the strange ray willis leaped to his feet

  come with me frank he cried

  with nankivell at his heels he turned and raced back
toward the seats nankivell realized his strategy and
gave a whoop of joy in a few moments they had
reached the seats and were climbing rapidly upward
from the elevation they had gained they could overlook
the dais

  now youngster dont waste a shot cried willis
as he dropped prone you fire at the men ill take
their damned machine

nankivell fired steadily the range wras not
great and his weapon took a terrific toll of the
atlantean nobles willis fired slowly taking a careful
and deliberate aim with each shot the third time he
fired the violet light winked out

  hurrah cried nankivell

  don t cheer yet that be only a stall said
willis grimly

  he reloaded and fired again a blinding flash came
from the dais and the device from which had come the
violet beam burst into fragments

  with shouts of triumph the handful of troyanans
who had escaped the deadly paralyzing ray charged at
the platform the remnants of the court of atlantis met
them weapons in hand for a moment the fight was
an even one but above the ring of steel on steel came a
steady crack-crack-crack as maristons pistol woke to
life

  willis and nankivell ran down the tiers of seats and
scurried across the floor they raced up the steps to
the dais to find the fight over the last of the sleepers
lay prone on the platform barely thirty of the nobles
of troyana were still on their feet

  this battle has cost us dearly said willis as he
looked around the amphitheater where hundreds of
blue and yellow robed figures lay sprawled on the floor

  those men are all right laughed nankivell that
purple ray paralyzes but it doesnt kill a reduced
charge from a flashtube will bring them around in good
shape weve won with little loss

  he advanced toward zephaniah as he reached his
side the master raised his hand and pointed dramatically
on the altar at the foot of the huge misshapen golden
calf stood a solitary figure attired in a robe of bril-
liant crimson heavily embroidered with gold on his

breast there flashed the golden jewel of a master
  amos cried nankivell

   he raised his rifle but zephaniah placed a restraining
hand on his shoulder

  lower your weapon brother nankivell he said
the archtraitor must be taken alive

  he waved back his followers and advanced alone to-
ward the altar amos watched him with a grim expres-
sion of malevolence on his face

  amos cried the master the fate which gedaliah
prophesied has overtaken you alone and helpless you
are left to face the wrath of the master whose authority
you flouled and whose place you strove to usurp you
have come to the end of your treachery lay down
your arms if you bear any for further resistance will
not avail the council will decide your fate

  amos drew himself up and answered in a ringing
voice which filled the entire hall

   zephaniah he said upstart who sits in the blue
throne which is mine by right victory will avail you
nothing defeated i will yet bring victory from de-
feat hearken the hooves of the calf spell yfeur
doom

   in the silence the demoniac drumming again filled the
air until it seemed that the heads of the hearers would
burst from sheer agony the sound died down for an
instant and amos voice could be heard again

  for you zephaniah the calf has called for all
your vaunted wisdom there are things of which you

invite the calf to choose between us

  fearlessly zephaniah strode up to the altar face
to face he stood with amos on the breast of each of
them was a symbol of power and authority the crim-
son robes of amos and the blue robes of zephaniah each
bore the same symbols of majesty

   at last usurper we stand face to face cried amos
let the calf judge between us and mayhap take us
both to our doom

   look out zephaniah cried willis

   his pistol flew up and spurted flame but he was too
late amos had stooped and touched a button on the
base of the image there was a blinding flash and an
explosion which shook the hall the massive figure
of the golden calf rose in the air for an instant and
then toppled and fell

   full on the two men it landed crushing them together
in death the grotesque figure fell apart in fragments
its mission ended the false god set up by the nobles of
troyana for their debased slaves to worship had ceased
to exist carrying with it in its destruction both the rene-
gade who had tried to turn it to its last base use and
the faithful master of troyana who had upheld to the
death the worship of the great architect of the uni-

  brother warder of the south your report

  good worshipful sir complete order has been
restored in the lower city and your sublime rule is estab-
lished as it was before the traitor amos raised the
standard of rebellion against the oriental throne the
vault is open and regular supplies of energy are assured
while undermanned the crypt functions properly i
have received reports from the new warder of the
outer ways that he has recruited six hundred cowans
to serve us he also reports that twenty of the three and
thirty eggs of the guardians of the jungle have hatched
in another year the full eleven packs will again range
the jungles to guard our domain from invasion five
parties attracted by gold have entered our territory
none of them will return but for our paucity of num-
bers troyana is as it was before the rebellion the last
of the sleepers has been sought out and replaced in his
cylinder and again sleeps the sleep he chose and from
which there will be no second waking

  it is well brother warder of the west your re-
port

  nahum rose in his place

  worshipful sir he announced the required thirty
days have passed since our last master passed to his
rest and reward in the eternal halls of the great archi-
tect during that trying period you have ruled wisely
and well but your period of authority is at an end i
declare that the first duty of the council is to choose a
successor to our lamented brother most worship fill
zephaniah

  mariston rose and laid down the scepter which he held
in his hand

  to you warder of the west he said i surrender
the emblems of imperial authority and the oriental throne
which i have unworthily filled

  nahum walked the length of the hall and seated him-
self in the throne which mariston had vacated maris-
ton took a seat by his side

  a new master must be chosen declared nahum
what is the will of the brethren

  mariston rose to his feet

  brother warder he said there is but one man
here who should be chosen to fill the throne in the east
you have served through every office in the council save
the highest and it is fitting and proper that you should
now serve in that

  there was a murmur of applause but nahum silenced
it with raised hand

  just before this council was constituted he said
with a smile i was informed by brother jereboam
that i had been chosen to fill the vacant place in the
ranks of the keepers of the sacred treasure no wear-
er of the purple may be master so another must be
chosen what is the will of the brethren

  jereboam rose

  brother warderhe said i agree with worshipful
brother mariston that there is but one man here who
should logicallybe called to the vacant throne but for
one brother here the glory ox troyana would be no
more this brother has filled in past years the dignity
to which he should now ascend during the past month
he has filled the oriental throne both wisely and well

for the throne of most worshipful master of this
council and ruler of troyana our choice should be wor-
shipful brother mariston

  a roar of applause swept the room mariston was on
his feet in an instant

  what i have done is nothing he cried if anyone
has saved the city it is brother nankivell the vacant
throne-

  nothing doing bob cried nankivell you know
that i havent either the brains or dignity enough for the
oriental throne i agree with brother jereboam you
are the man for it

  brother warder of the south cried nahum de-
clare the will of the brethren

  your words are their will brother warder it is
the unanimous desire of the brethren that worshipful
brother mariston be declared master of the council
amid the ringing cheers of the planners nahum
took mariston by the hand and seated him in the blue
throne

  let me be the first to declare my loyalty most
worshipful sir he said it is no surprise to me
you were the logical choice

  as the cheering died down mariston grasped his
scepter and rose to his feet his eyes twinkled as he
looked around the hall

  the throne of the master carries grave responsi-
bilities he said but it also carries privileges long
ago i knew what would be my first decree if i occupied
the oriental throne brother nankivell

  surprised frank nankivell rose to his feet

  most worshipful sir he said

  i find on the trestle board a petition of yours ad-
dressed to the oriental throne said mariston in it
you crave my permission to be united in marriage with
estha the granddaughter of our warder of the west
several times this petition has been considered and post-
poned it is now my order that this your prayer be
granted let the decree be entered

  a volley of cheers rent the air while nahum stepped
down and faced nankivell

  my son in fact he cried as he gripped nankivells
hand

     	  

  ray willis had got that far in his disconnected and
often incoherent story on the last night the fever had 
him when he awoke in the morning he was rational
and remembered nothing of his strange adventures we
tried to piece it out later but he could never remember
anything of what followed he left troyana once by his
own choice and it is only natural to judge that he left
again of his own free will and accord mariston would
hardly refuse him permission he had no magnet to
hold him in the city as had mariston and nankivell i
presume that the decree entered by zephaniah on nanki-
vells return to the city was enforced and that was what
was the matter with his memory of that you who have
read the story can judge as well as i can i carried out
my part of the bargain and left ray willis in belem
with his diamonds intact

  that was four years ago and i have never heard
from him since

in the realm of books

highbrow science fiction

brave new world by aldotis huxley
  published by doubleday doran  co
  inc garden city l new york
   pages 

it seems that mr huxley either dis-
likes science particularly its possible
future development or that he does
not believe in science at any rate the
book gives a lot of decidedly undeserved
credit to one ford whose highly stan-
dardized sweatshops apparently led hux-
ley to the belief that ford is the origi-
nator of standardization huxley even
goes so far as to call the era in which
the book takes place a f probably
meaning anno fordis and to give a
high dignitary of his utopia the title
fordship and also use the words by
ford or oh ford if his characters
indulge in mild swearing in other
words ford apparently is elevated to
the position of demi-god and his book
my life and work replaces the bible

  the book starts with a description of
the central london hatchery and con-
ditioning centre where over the en-
trance the new worlds motto com-
munity identity stability is promi-
nently displayed here the new worlds
children are produced strictly artificially

  by hvpnopaedic machines the children
are taught platitudes to make them
happy in whatever station in life they
are destined to fill all children are
also conditioned to look upon death as
something natural and they are taken
regularly to morgues and also to hospi-
tals of the dying and are rewarded by
chocolate eclairs after having witnessed
the death of a few new world citizens

  now there appears a character one
marx an alpha plus but he has queer
impulses not at all standardized be-
cause someone made a mistake when he
was being conditioned by adding too
much alcohol to his blood surrogate he
is attracted toward lenina and he being
an alpha plus obtains one of the few

permits to visit a reservation of savages
in new mexico where life is carried on
as it was before the era of ford

  here they find linda who has a natu-
ral born son

  the son john knows nothingof civil-
ization and as permission is granted to
bring linda and her son to london a
sensation is created

  lenina develops a passion for john
but lie repulses her even when she
seductively approaches him in despair
john finds refuge in an abandoned light-
house where he finally hangs himself to
escape huxleys brave new world

  from the point of view of the scien-
tific fiction fan this book is a decided
flop its contents which at times almost
become obscene but arc at all times
supercharged with sex will undoubtedly
bar it from circulation in boston but the
book may serve to call the attention of a
great many readers to the fact that there
is a class of  fiction in existence which
deals with scientific subjects-c a b

dr smith accepts miss robbs
challenge

editor amazing stories

  gadzooks quoth the assemblage of spright-
ly and courteous gentlemen-and no small
sprinkling of fair and beauteous damsels-
assembled to witness the march j oustings
dame robb doth wield a trenchant pen

  for they had seen that embattled maid cross
lances with sir smith that gray and war-torn
old veteran and had seen him unhorsed hel-
met here buckler there greaves and fragments
of armor scattered hither and yon the doughty
knight lay prostrate upon the sand while his
charger galloped madly away but though
dazed and demoralized by the force of his over-
throw no bones are found to be broken and
old doc gathers up his scattered impedimenta
and turns painfully to continue the battle afoot
all of which is a somewhat verbiose preamble to
the statement that richard seaton is still will-
ing and able to defend his customary mode of
speech

  miss robb is clever she writes forcibly and
well and i am gratified indeed that such a one
pays me the compliment of enjoying my efforts
i must admit that by her judicious selection and
concentration of words and expressions from my
stories she has composed a sour symphony in-
deed but when it is considered that she has
culled those expressions from some two hundred
fifty thousand words it becomes clear that lier
picture is not quite in true perspective in the
same line of thought i may be allowed to point
out that while a dilute solution of vanilla is
pleasant to the senses yet the concentrated x
extract is so violently nauseous as to be almost
unrecognizable

  before i proceed to a general defense i will
answer miss robbs one direct question yes
miss robb i can explain that point i will point
out first however that you are wrong in your
statement that not a single one of the foreigners
spoke english as seaton spoke it dunark
spoke precisely as seaton did because their
brains had been imprinted one upon the other
the others did not speak as he did because he
taught them pure english instead of the sort
of language he himself used in his everyday
life-he taught them the form of speech he and
other educated men used in public

  now to the defense concerning repetition
that is deliberate if miss robb will do a bit
of observing she will notice that certain ex-
pressions are characteristic of certain men and
that in every-day life those expressions are re-
peated over and over again in seatons con-
versation i drew faithfully a living scientist a
phd in chemistry word for word i de-
liberately so wrote seatons character and per-
sonality into those stories partly to lend veri-
similitude to a highly improbable tale but
mostly in protest against the stereotyped stilted
and utterly unnatural conversation forced upon
the unfortunate scientists portrayed in all too
many stories for i have known personally
have worked with and have played with some
hundreds of highly trained specialists in sci-
ence whose degrees use up the alphabet and
most of them in their everyday conversations
with friends and fellow-workers talk like
human beings most of them really arc human
beings in fact one eminent man-whose name
most of you would recognize if i were at liberty
to give it-swears like a pirate upon the golf
links and in his conversation habitually mixes
in the same sentence words which drive college
graduates to the dictionary and the latest cur-
rent slang i might also add that the man from
whom crane was drawn is one of the few
scientists of my acquaintance who never lapses
into colloquial language when talking in small
friendly groups scientists as a class can and
in public generally do choose their words with
care but in their laboratories they do not and
the purported intimate conversations of the
scientists in many stories not only bores most
of us to extinction but also destroys in great
part the illusion of reality which the authors
are trying to create

  so far i have been upon firm ground i
have known what i was talking about having
made a large enough number of observations so
that the probable error in my result is small
however when i attempt to defend ray use of
the term cuddle-pup to which miss robb
objects so vigorously i cannot fall back upon
the law of averages since my romantic experi-
ence has been limited but must cite the results
of only one series of experiments this of
course is indefeusible from a scientific stand-
point and is justifiable only by the fact that
since the census enumerator undoubtedly
counted miss robb as only one individual her
ideas should not be allowed any more weight

than those of the subject of my experiments-
my wife

  i have been married to that subject for prob-
ably as long a time as miss robb has lived in
spite of that we are still in love with each
other-so much so that we play together as a
twosome by choice and lest miss robb con-
clude that the subject must be in some sense
abnormal i will adduce the following data all
of which may be proved

  in golf she shoots around  consistently
she has been womens champion of our city
for six or seven years is an excellent swim-
mer and quite an athlete generally she is
a splendid dancer and has never known what
it is like to be a wall-flower she is also able
to hold her own in club debates and discussions
which call for serious reading and original
thinking while she is too old-fashioned to
smoke cigarettes or to drink alcoholic liquor
she has so handled things that we and our
children enjoy a real home life

  now i have called this subject cuddle-pup
and many other things not mentioned in my
stories for years with no unpleasant results
therefore i felt no hesitation in having my
hero use such terms it may be however that
that particular expression carries a connotation
of vulgarity to the younger generation which it
does not carry to me and which it most em-
phatically was not intended to carry to anyone
if so and if there is expressed in these columns
any general sentiment against such pet names
i shall certainly refrain from using them in my
stories henceforth

the atom radium on watch
dials

editor amazing stories

  almost every letter in discussions contains
some slam for either the magazine the authors
the quality of the paper or the stories what
do they want for a quarter a magazine as
large as websters dictionary as for the
stories in the magazine what do they read
them for if they dont like them you say
mr editor that you want criticisms as well as
compliments how come you cant suit every-
body somebody wants stories by this author
paintings by this artist and reprints somebody
disagrees entirely with him and pretty soon you
have a war all printed in discussions i cant
figure it out can you but thats that
lets get technical

  i understand that every clement is composed
of atoms molecules electrons and minute par-
ticles of all i also understand the electrons
and the protons are positive now suppose the
polarity of the electrons could be changed from
positive to negative would not the element which
they formed be disintegrated i learned that
like charges of electricity repel and that unlike
charges attract would this apply to the pro-
tons and electrons again supposing that the
electrons could be changcd to protons ahd the
protons to electrons would not the clement
which they formed become different one

  now for just one more question

  a fellow was arguing with me that the dials
of watches are painted with radium i said
it was phosphorus or a like substance treated
with radium but that there was no radium used
in the substance as radium is almost priceless
who is right

  we are glad indeed to print your very in-
teresting letter you have hit the nail on the
head as the proverb has it in what you say
about the impossibility of pleasing everybody
still criticism is helpful and we aim to please
you are a little confused in what you understand
about the composition of the elements as ele-
ments exist they are molecules in most cases
each molecule contains several atoms the atom
is supposed to contain a nucleus made up of

the january issue scores tre-
mendous hit

editor amazing stories

  shall i burden you with inadequate superla-
tives in praise of the january issue of a s
none would suffice

  i have on file the complete set of a s and
every other sciencc fiction magazine ever pub-
lished and with no attempt at false exaggera-
tion let me say the january issue of a s sur-
passes any other issue of science fiction in
any magazine ever published 

  the cover the blending of color harmonies
and the exactness of detail in this remarkable
drawing raises morey into a class with paul if
not higher the colors are not glaring yet the
cover impresses one with its force and power

  power thats itl the picture describes the
story power the story power is equal in
merit to the painting of power the two
coincide in the nth degree of perfectness

   the editorial is worthy of dr sloane

  tumithak of the corridors is one of the
finest stories ever printed in the pages of a s
the story is conciscly written and has none of
the marvelous escapes by inexperienced young
men against hundreds of thousands of enemies
thus saving their country in the nick of time
this fault is all too prevalent it does my heart
good to see none of it in this issue of a s

  if the following lemurian documents are
a well written and as interesting as pyg-
malion i have no protest coming

  as yet i havent read the inevitable con-
flict-i expect it to be as excellently written
as the other stories in this issue

  if i were giving the mag a percentage as
to quality id say it is  per cent perfect a
few reprints once in a while or a reprint
annual would supply the other  per cent

  i cannot say who is my best author as it is
too difficult to choose among the many excellent
ones on your staff

   id like to see a story from the pen of a hyatt
verrill and merritt youve certainly neg-
lected them

  if any readers need back copies from 
and up ill be glad to supply prices and full
information on request i welcome letters on
stf anyway

  by the way i notice the a in amazing
on the cover has a star in it it deserves to
be there the magazine is an all-star issue

the temperature op interstel-

editor amazing stories

   i write this letter to tell you the impressions
i get from amazing stories

  as a general thing i enjoy the stories but
i think the scientific errors in them are very
misleading they give a false impression of
science and of the universe personally i enjoy
trying to find how many errors there are in
the stories it is interesting to see whether or
not i can detect them

  however i do not condone the false impres-
sion they give as an example of one of the
errors commonly made in the interplanetary
stories i will point out that most authors speak
of absolute zero as though all interstellar space
were at that temperature this is a false
assumption for absolute zero does not exist
anywhere in the universe it is a scientific
term for an imaginary and unattainable scien-
tific conception which can be approached in-
finitely closely but can never be reached

  remember that what you may consider
errors in a story may be simply a stretching
of facts as there is danger that by rigid ad-
herence to the facts of today disagreeable ele-
ment of dryness might be introduced into our
pages our authors should be permitted we
think to stretch things a little the absolute
zero is an abstract subject about which our
present knoweldge is limited tell us of any
more statements which you regard as scientific
errors distinguishing between them and the
needs of a fiction-writing author-editor

an interesting letter from one
of our authors the interna-
tional scientific association

editor amazing stories

   an interesting consideration has recently oc-
curred to me which may prove of interest to
a certain class of readers and may offer
material for a story by one of the writers better
trained in higher physics than i-dr smith
dr breuer or john w campbell jr

   we start from page  of eddingtons the
nature of the physical world discussing
times arrow the thing that makes us sense
past and future he says if    we find
more and more of the random element in the
state of the world then the arrow is pointing
toward the future if the random element de-
creases the arrow points to the past again
page  he says the practical measure of the
random element which can increase in the uni-
verse but can never decrease is called entropy
on page  he says that when the final equili-
brium is reached when shuffling is complete
we lose times arrow there is no past or
future time exists but docs not pass the
universe is static in the famous warmctod

   let us summarize this entropy was intro-
duced to science as a useful if rather mysterious
function in thermodynamics like most such
functions its use has since then enormously
increased let it suffice to confirm its sig-
nificance in the present problem it is this if
entropy randomness or shuffling increases
we are moving toward the future if it de-
creases we are going into the past of the sys-
tem in question and in the far future the
shuffling will have reached its maximum in
utter disorganization and time will cease to
flow the universe will be static-run down-
ended

   now as has often been done before consider
time as a stream in some places the speed of
the current is greater or smaller than in others
and in the end it flows into a stagnant time-
less inland sea

  good enough here we are in our part of
space drifting along at a definite speed some-
where else the flow is swifter relative to our
speed and time passes into the future more
rapidly entropy increases faster elsewhere
the reverse is true and relative to us time
lags if we were to pass into the first swifter
system and then return to our own we might
live a lifetime there for a day or an hour or a
second of our time returning from a part of
space where time flows more slowly than in
ours the reverse would be true a day of life
there might be centuries here we would land
far in the future

   at first sight this might seem a means of
time-traveling but it is not time lost is not
regained we can live a life-span in the faster
world and return to earth decrepit feeble
oldsters while our little nephew has been aging
from five to six months or years or even
days after a few hours of pell-mell adventure
in the slow world we return to find our earthly
lives lost for good and earth celebrating the
holidays of five thousand or ten thousand years
hence

  do such places in space exist have we
evidence to show that such things are possible
eddington supplies one example himself where
there is perfect equilibrium where shuffling
entropy has reached a maximum as in the
interiors of some stars time will stand still
but what of the others

   remember this speed of time-flow is relative
to whatever reference we choose-earths rate
in our case looking into a part of the time-
stream where the flow is slower we drift past
a floating observer of that world into his future
where disruption has increased and to us pro-
cesses that have a definite rate in our world
are happening faster there are disorganizing
faster for example evolution progresses faster
atoms disintegrate faster men die sooner the
stars are holocausts of disintegration and dis-
organization and if their time flows slower
than ours they should approach some state where
there is no flow at all an equilibrium we
know such closed stars and eddingtou shows
us that there time stands still

   the opposite case of faster flow remains
the observer in that world is passing our
instant and his past is coming toward us we
seem to move into his past the processes of
his world seem reversed to us life devolves
men grow young and atoms are born one of
the newest facts of physics is millikans dis-
covery that the cosmic rays indicate the building
up of atoms somewhere in the universe for

the purposes of scientifiction at least i think
the likelihood of our proposition is established
it remains for dr breuer or dr smith or
mr campbell to develop the idea in a story

  there is another consequence of this idea of
shuffling as measuring the passage of time if
we preserve the strict analogy with a pack of
cards that eddington uses less strictly such
a pack will approach a condition of complete
disorganization but once there if the shuffling
continues there is no choice but to become
more organized to travel back in time that
can certainly be worked up into a useful mech-
anism also it is possible by repeated shuffling
to obtain a completed sorted pack again such
an occurrence has a definite calculable prob-
ability small but not zero suppose that
should happen to the universe it would return
to its initial state at creation and there
would be a nearly infinite number of possible
futures open to it if the something that pro-
duces shuffling in the universe keeps on the
warmctod need not be a real death and even
before reaching that static state the universe
may be reborn and pursue any one of an enor-
mous number of futures

  i have one word to add with regard to the
international scientific association unavoid-
able troubles necessitated reorganization and
consequent upheaval during the past year this
is still going on but order is being brought out
of chaos however the office of secretary has
changed hands several times at very short
notice and as a result of the sum total of these
disturbing elements a large number of applica-
tions from the united states canada and eu-
rope have gone unanswered as foreign di-
rector and acting secretary i now want to
apologize to all who have not been answered
to beg them to have patience and to write again
if they are still interested and to assure them
that in any case their letters will receive per-
sonal replies before very many weeks have
passed as soon as the reorganization is complete
and the work of the various offices can be re-
distributed i say this particularly to our
english applicants who may have felt that we
were a bit too cautious about having members
in another country the friendly rival of our
own i can only say that our name expresses
our purpose and it is our earnest desire that
our first european branch be established by
englishmen in england

  there is little sense in criticising authors and
artists moreys february cover is one of his
best and the first illustration for the rack-
eteer ray is an interesting departure from his
usual style in the quarterly taine was
superb as ever amazing stories if somewhat
slow and reserved remains the aristocrat of sci-
entifiction where science is more than a thread

a letter from one of our highly esteemed au-
thors it tells its story so well and at such
length that it requires  comment from us-
editor

a tribute to p schuyler miller

the causes of senility

editor amazing stories

  after reading jack williamsons recent opus
magnum entitled the stone from the green
star for the eighth time i sat down shut
my eyes in meditation and spent an hour con-
templating his fallacious supposition of rejuven-
ation it appears from williamsons story
that old age presupposes some idiosyncrasy or
contamination of the glands which may be
abolished through the imbibing of some in-
vigorating liquor say for instance buttermilk
on what hypothesis lie bases this astounding
conclusion i have been at a loss to discover
inasmuch as the accepted concensus of opinion
originating from actual experiences deviated in
a bee-line to opposing facts

  old age is a glandular disease old age can
be alleviated by neutralizing the poisons in
glands old age is not compatible with the
growing magnitude of the brain old age is
unnecessary especially in modern civilization
shades of cagliostro but that is truth how-
ever merely because all iron is metal all metal
is not iron nor is all that glitters gold nor
are williamsons panacea for old age verified
by facts

  primarily the intrinsic cause of old age is
due to sedimentary deposits i both the arterial
and venous structure this condition influencing

the inelasticity common to old age if the
formation of these deposits is not checked ad-
jacent parts of the anatomy will inevitably
follow resulting in the deterioration commonly
known as old age

   now the science of gerocomy teaches that
arteriosclerosis-the clogging up of the arteries
by chalky deposits-invariably precedes senility
that the elimination of these sedimentary de-
posits rejuvenate the body by regaining elas-
ticity mr williamson evidently is not aware
sedimentary deposits occurring in the system
are analagous to calcareous incrustations which
appear in boiler-tubes with the difference that
the latter are subject to cleansing if a re-
juvenating elixir is actually conceivable through
some chemical ambrosia then the chemical
amalgamation of the ingredients of the alkahest
enter into the realm of the imaginable

   so far as biological interpretation extends
corporeal senescence constitutes a major involu-
tion in direct opposition of the evolution of the
life-cycle which transpires normally in the
latter half of the third decade by no means
whatsoever is it possible to annihilate the pro-
gressively deteriorating stages of senility the
shrinkage of flesh glandular defects and venous
ossification by this i do not mean to imply
that prolonging life to at least  years is an
absurdity not however by any methods cate-
gorically similar to the suggestions of wil-
liamson

   for the past three months i have been en-
gaged in obtaining a protoplasmic formula for
synthetic haemoglobin contrasting the previ-
ously highly significant investigations of p
schuyler miller and dr walter elkington to
the effect that vertebrate evolution recapitulates
identical changes to be found in the blood if
successful this unprecedented formula may in-
crease the longevity of the human race to an
astounding extent

   o	zeus in writing this extensive anatreptic
communication i have acquired the anathema
of all writers-anapciratic paralysis of the
digits a warning i should think to make
the convolutions of the cerebellum squirm in an
effort to accelerate the solution to my formula
so that p schuyler miller may live five cen-
turies continually producing stories like the
arrhenius horror

from the author of the laugh-
ing death

editor amazing stories

   about ten days ago i discovered a letter from
you dated may   the letter reads

  a correspondent speaks of a blunder in
your story the laughing death where you
indicate the spaniard as not being of the white
race    etc

  frankly i do not remember any spanish
character in that particular story my intelli-
gence would certainly not permit such an error
knowingly

  for many weeks i have been absent on a
transcontinental camping tour  miles long
touching about all the important scenic points
in the u s a and a number in canada and
mexico that explains your neglected letter
i took the trip for pleasure and had as guests
the entire way five boys whose work at school
where i teach had brought them to my atten-
tion our car was fast and powerful -cylinder
packard which added to our comfort and en-
joyment and enabled us to cover a large terri-
tory

  while encamped one night north of malibu
beach and somewhere near oxnard california
i strolled along the highway after the sound
of the booming waves had put the boys to sleep
i came upon a couple before a small umbrella
tent brilliantly lighted by a gasoline lantern
the couple were bound for reno nevada where
things were on the up and up and where he
expected to get started in electrical work he
was lying on his stomach  the sand reading
an amazing stories-april issue-just finished
the laughing death we got to talking
about the story and how it left the fate of the
characters in uncertainty in the moonlight
there with bits of seaweed about our feet i
told him how a writer might clarify the situ-
ation and when i was through the impromptu
narrative he spat into the water and said

editor amazing stories

  although the prospects of publication of this
critical letter are i suppose somewhat nebu-
lous as a reader of amazing stories since its
inception i feel it my duty to register a protest
against the ever-growing avalanche of slang in
your stories

  i will not presume to draw your attention
to the requirements of good english or of
literature in this connection as others have
already done so in the past i simply state as
a fact that ever since dr e e smith in his
skylark stories utilized slang conversation
requiring one of his own mechanical educa-
tors to understand his example has been aped
by an ever growing number of contributors to
your pages

  i do not wish to penalize dr smith unduly
i have no other fault to find with his truly
unique stories i wish i could say the same for
some of his disciples

  the crowning travesty however which has
inspired this letter appears in your december
issue and is entitled sky cops

  to begin with there is not even one vestige
of science to redeem this tenth rate tale unless
you call ready-made space fliers and the usual
unexplained rays science i do not anyway

  i do not care whether mr harl vincent is
a successful author or not i should not think
he has built up his reputation by such pot-
boilers as this take for instance the absurdity
of the sergeant deliberately releasing the arch-
bandit from the handcuffs whilst swearing to
search the whole solar system for him after-
wards why not have taken his captive with
him this is assuming there was only space
for two in the machine otherwise he could
have taken the captain as well believing as
he did that the whole crew of the mother ship
was in rolenskis pay surely the presence of
two helpless and much wanted men would not
appreciably increase the odds against him

  possibly however mr vincent considers
that in the distant future wherein his story is
placed world atavism is gradually setting in
this would appear to be indicated by the low
standard of education of the major portion of
his characters and the officers and their sub-
ordinates mike not only criticizes the orders
from his captain but emphasizes his own views
by spitting in disgust here therefore we have
a possible explanation of the spitting swearing
sergeants childish mentality

  i do trust that something will be done to
check this deluge of crude illiterate phraseology
and that all such disgusting matter as spitting
etc will be ruthlessly cut out by the editorial
pen in future

  one last appeal surely by all known data
it is an extraordinary thing to postulate as in
sky cops and others of that ilk that slang
will remain completely unchanged in the remote
future i personally find it impossible to im-
agine that in thousands of years time our
revolting but fortunately extremely hypothet-
ical friend sergeant mike will be giving utter-
ance to such well-worn and rapidly passing
words as attaboy yeah bum lousey okay
big boy you guys etc etc

  yours is easily the best magazine of its kind
even with all these defects but how can you
he surprised at its condemnation as trash by
those who do not know your publication and
casually purchasing a copy commence reading
such puerile valueless rubbish as a story like
sky cops stop the spitting etc complex
anyway if you will not do anything else please

  it is fair to say that with the exception of
this very severe letter our english correspon-
dents have treated us very well wc felt that
sky cops was an excellent story it was so

april 

full of action and the end came so unexpectedly
harl vincent is an electrical and mechanical
engineer holding a high position with one of
the great electrical companies of america he
has made a very great success as an author of
short stories having published a great many
during the last few years as regards slang
and the sergeants language the author had
to use slang of the present day for nobody
knows what slang of the future will be but
remember that you must not think that the
united states is given to slang it is fair
to say that in this country you may not hear a
word of slang for weeks or months in some
quarters poor america has sins enough to
answer for without this one-eeitor

a letter of criticism different
quite from others

editor amazing stories

  i	have just finished reading the discussions
of the january issue up to the letter by r e
bowland jr it was dull and uninteresting
but there sparks began to fly and most letters
following kept it up bowland jr took a
grand slam at those asking for reprints saying
that magazines which had reprints have weak-
kneed editors and also stating that amazing
is a truly ideal magazine why not reprints
of course mr bowland wouldnt want any
because he read the magazine since it started
almost a good idea i think would be to have
a special edition containing reprints as you
have suggested those who didnt want re-
prints neednt read it better still print em
in book form so they can be kept in bookcases
as for amazing being truly ideal ill
say it isnt if it was paul would be the chief
artist also there would be stories by flag
merritt verill flint taine cummings tiffen
rousseau douglas hall and others also there
would be full page illustrations and not half
page ones as most of them really arc a good
illustration was for the story by paul h
lovering in the january issue but alasl there
are more of these things f j ackerman de-
clares that amazing was good until recently
hes wrong it has not been good for over a
year where is wells the good old keller
stories the old full page illustrations the time
when there were eight or nine stories in each
issue when science talks were given over
wrny gone gone forever unless amazing
peps up with all the suggestions from readers
no clange nor teps are taken of a new de-
partment just an we are thinking about it
or we admit it is not a bad plan yet nothing
is done another magazine has changed back
to large size got better paper took on a large
staff and used that great artist paul almost
always and has a form to sign your name and
send in a petition for scientific movies sev-
eral pictures have started because of this
movement

  mr sam springs of glendale calif says
that he likes stories discussed that are not too
old yet goes ahead and tells us what he thinks
of stories as far back as october 

at least i agree with you that women in
stories are necessary if not dealt with too much

  mr rowderhill of england says that a few
stories apart from science would be welcome
please do not print stories that are not scien-
tifiction if he is desirous of other kinds of
stories but still amazing be should read
other magazines

  why not more by kateley he is good lets
have drawings by muller paul is swell per-
fect wesso i rate next morey is last al-
though starting with the december issue his
covers have become quite good the inside
illustrations of the january issue were among
the best ever by morey the one for in-
evitable conflict deserved to be a cover it
was one of the best i ever saw-including
pauls work too if you keep this up amaz-
ing might return to its old peak

  it is a long time since we have given any
of h g wells stories as wc have already
published the best works by him dr keller still
writes for us we feel that full page illustra-
tions are objectionable to a certain extent be-
cause they take up so much room we are a
little disinclined to do anything that will crowd
out the reading matter that according to our
correspondents is what they want most we
happen to know from good authority that the
signed petitions for science fiction movies had
nothing to do with their production the stories
are what count

amazing stories



a letter from the canal zone

how readers take science in
fiction stories

  editor amazing stories

   upon receiving a new copy of amazing
 stories i turn to my favorite the discussions
 column almost before i have finished the stories

  i have always found this to be the most inter-
  esting part perhaps of the magazine for in it
  are portrayed the reactions of the readers to the
  various ideas presented by their favorite authors

    since i first commenced reading scientifiction
  it has been my habit to compare diligently the
  various magazines that use this type of story for
  a long time a s was the only one that followed
  it entirely several others occasionally published
  stories of a scientific or super-scientific na-
  ture but a s stood on a pinnacle of its own
  my preference for it is based on the fact that
  it presents known scientific facts in an easily
  assimilative form while its stories written in a
  delightfully breezy and adventurous manner
  contahi plenty of science and are therefore very
  instructive

    other so-called scientific fiction magazines
  i have in mind are strange tales wonder
  stories and weird tales i say so-
  called for these magazines attempt only to
  liave a sketchy scientific background to their
  yarns take strange tales for instance its
  stories run to stirring action usually with a
  strong and not always too well done love-theme
  but with only the most meager amount of science
  whenever a story contains more than this mere
  trifle o technical stuff its readers immediately
  set up a howl in the department that corre-
  sponds to discussions to my mind that re-
  action smacks of a preference for trashy light
  reading

    wonder stories is a bit better i consider
  it a cross between a s and strange talcs
  occasionally it shows a few glimmerings of
  sense particularly when it publishes the stories
  translated from the german secured during the
  last few months as for weird tales i
  can only say that i consider its attempts at
  scientifiction a collection of fantastic nonsense
  although when it sticks to its regular type of
  occult story it is unsurpassed i prefer a s
  because i can not only learn something from its
  pages but because if one were to remove from
  the others the tiny amount of science they con-
  tain they would become merely the mediocre
  junk one can see in fifty other magazines
  on any newsstand

    i cannot say that i have any favorite on your
  staff of authors the men who turn out the
  stories for a s are so uniformly excellent that
  it is indeed a difficult matter to pick between
  them while i may not always like the plot of
  a story or the ideas it presents i almost never
  find any fault with the literary style or method
  of presentation my reading of scientifiction is
  purely critical and observing

    one more thing although i fear this must be
  a brickbat in the july and august issues
  appeared the raid of the mercury and the
  superman respectively by a h johnson
  these were very fine stories well written and
  with good science but they most evidently had
  their inspiration in the iron heel by jack
  london plagiarism is a harsh word but while
  hestitating to use it here i would suggest that
  mr johnson be a bit more careful in the future
  his use of the black group for instance
  the mymidons and the plutocracy as well
  as a basis plot of an aristocracy of wealth and
  leisure as the future despotic rulers of this
  country check a trifle too closely with the
  black groups the mercenaries and the
  plutocracy of jack londons tale

    our effort and it is not an easy one is to
  get a good amount of science into our stories
  we do find that science impairs the appreci-
  ation by our readers and we can assure you that
  the getting of stories with a reasonable amount
  of science in their plots has proved a very diffi-
  cult matter and one which assumes more and
  more importance from the editorial standpoint
  we are very glad to hear you say that you
  have no favorite on our staff of authors mr
  campbell for instance has proved a great
  favorite we will leave the answer to your
  remarks on mr johnsons stories to the author
  it would be interesting to see what he has to
  stay about them-editok

the light rays of the cosmic
universe

 editor amazing stories

   ive been reading amazing stories for
 about one year and for the kind of stories they
 are supposed to be they are all ok

   now i would like to know more about bent
 light suppose that this world is surrounded
 by suns all on different sides and the rays are
 shooting at us from all different directions
 the suns are bombarded by each other as well
 as ourselves now how could the light reach
 us traveling at the rate of  miles a sec-
 ond through all the interference of the other
 light rays their interference would cut down
 the speed of each suns rays till the speed
 would amount to nothing by the time they reach
 us and our earth throws out rays to meet them
 so how could rays be bent around us or any
 other star i know if you put a stick in flow-
 ing water the water flows around it because
 the water is all flowing one way but if you put
 the stick in a tub of water the pressure is from
 all sides and it is not bent please answer this
 in your discussions columns as there arc
 quite a few of us interested in the subject

                          t a jones

                             jefferson street
                            phillipsburg n j

   light rays are not changed in their velocity
 by the interference of other light rays the
 rays which bombard the earth are trivial as re-
 gards the stars and celestial objects with the
 exception of the sun and the moon the moon
 gives us a little radiation but the sun it is
 which takes care of our temperature its radia-
 tions are not troubled by those of the stars so
 if you will concentrate your thoughts on the
 fact that the practical state of affairs is that
 the sun takes care of the temperature of the
 earth and that the moon as a reflector throws a
 small proportion of the light of the sun on the
 earth and forget about the millions of stars
 which are so far away that they give us a very
 minute amount of heat and can be really left
 out of practical consideration you will get a
 pretty good common sense state of affairs-
 editor

the question of artists criti-

cism of sub micro sco pic and
awlo of ulm

 editor amazing stories

    this is the first letter which ive written to
 your magazine and i hope it will be the only
 critical one

   to start with the cover i may say that it
 is rather too garish to appeal to the truly sci-
 entific individual and although i have no such
 criticism to make a great many people brand
 the magazine as being pseudo-scientific because
 of the impression derived from the cover
 pertinent to the cover question is the old dis-
 pute about the artist paul is or was undoubt-
 edly your best illustrator this cant be denied
 however i see that paul does all the illustrating
 for another magazine in the same field as a s
 so maybe you cant get him for your magazine
 if so i see the reason for your defending
 morey and wesso so valiantly these may
 sound like rabid criticisms but im not alone
 in these thoughts

    criticising the stories is a fruitless expendi-
 ture of time and energy because to people of
 widely different temperament and mentality
 different stories have their varied interests and
 faults however a person who could swallow a
 story such as submicroscopic and its sequel
 awlo of ulm without a murmur of criticism
 cannot be of very intelligent or penetrating
 mind the story might appeal to the jaded
 appetite of an over-studious moron but to one
 who boasts the least scientific knowledge the
 story must be distasteful you will probably
 say that i tqok the story too seriously but the
 too abundant impossibilities spoil even the few
 original ideas which lend interest to any tale

    as for the other stories which you print none
 merit the criticism that meeks story does in
 fact most of them are instructive and all are
 at least of interest to the readers

   you say that meek is a scientist himself yet
 he has published under his name submicro-
 scopic and awlo of ulm and after these
 two numerous brickbats i can add long live
 a s and im always with you

some comments of mr gelulas
automaton a curious pic-
ture of the future

 editor amazing stories

    no doubt that daily you receive letters from
 the readers of the amazing stories-and after
 reading the magazine for a long long time i
 think it might be a good idea to drop you a
 line

    i just finished reading the automaton by
 a j gelula

   the automaton is similar to the iron
 age story-but i would say that both stories
 were incomplete the iron age was good to
 some extent-because it explained at the end
 how machines could get control of the human
 race and could possibly destroy it

    in automaton mr gelula reached the real
 point-he did hit the right spot-as his idea is
 not a tale-his idea is a real coming invention-
 which is progressing much faster than any in-
 ventions we could think of

   the automaton is in existence today and
 it is really able to perform everything-it can
 read write talk-only it does not reason nor
 is it able to think but this is not very far away

   men invented machinery to do almost any-
 thing read write talk which already works in
 duplicate and when man perfects it when
 machines will be able to think and reason it will
 then be the end of the human race which already
 happened in the past and will happen again

    the machine will rule the world will destroy
 the human race and at the end will die out itself
 -which will be again the new beginning of the
 world of a new race from a tiny bug up 
 another stage where we are today-but this takes
 millions of years-perhaps less or more

    when automaton reached the stage as it did
 in mr gelulas story-which it will in time-
 the automaton will refuse to obey the men it
 will declare a war on the human race-destroy
 it then it will fall to pieces itself because hu-
 mans generate one from another starting small
 and growing bigger and getting accustomed to
 climate and mode of living but here the auto-
 maton will fail-because it stands still and
 change of climate will destroy it

   we are well aware that climate shifts and
 in years and years from now the north pole
 will be a tropical country

    this is my idea of what future has in store
 for us also it is my best reason out of how
 it happened in the past which we will call the
 lost civilization

throwing an object in a moving
train-what will its
velocity be

 editor amazing stories

   i have read your magazine for some years
 and i find it as good as it could be one of
 the features i like best is where you settle
 questions that are asked you from time to time
 and that is the main purpose of this letter to
 ask a question

   if a man in a train throws an object 
 mph the same direction as the train which
 is also going  mph what is the velocity of
 the object thrown

   i say  mph and i think i am right
 but my friend is insistent that i am wrong

    i hope you can settle this

the skylark of space wanted

detective stories not
favorites

 editor amazing stories

   i first started your magazine when you were
 printing the jules verne story a trip to the
 center of the earth and burroughs the
 land that time forgot but i didnt care so
 much for them

   however about a year ago i got an old copy
 containing the second part of the skylark of
 space boy what a story but i could not
 get the other parts however i got the sequel
 and all the other issues up-to-date so no more
 missing instalments im a confirmed-i almost
 said addict but i guess admirer is a better
 word anyway im a steady reader

   i am like some of your other readers i dont
 care much for love stories in science fiction but
 spacehounds of i pc cured me cant you
 coax smith to give us a sequel and another
 skylark story

   that epilogue seems to worry some of your
 readers but it is the simplest part for me

   says the epilogue dear children this all
 happened in the year one when your ancestors
 were young and foolish now just write a nice
 little prologue saying-this dear children is
 another story about your illustrious ancestors
 and everything will be jake in other words
 you write the story and ill tell you how

    i dont think much of detective stories in your
 last few issues im not keen on detective
 murders anyway id rather kill a few mar-
 tians and that chinese doctor is too gruesome
 for words the steam shovel was not so bad
 but the ambidexter sent cold shivers all over
 me

   is there any chance of getting the august
 september and october  issues containing
 the skylark of space through your office or
 lias it or will it be produced in book form

   if you look through recent issues of the
 magazine you will find correspondents who have
 back issues of the magazine in their possession
 and we hope that you will be able to get some
 back issues from them we are unable to sup-
 ply from our files any old issue we use de-
 tective stories when they involve some good
 science only and if you will look them over
 you will find that those which we publish are
 scientific dctcctive stories-editor

 oldest readers of a s without having a letter
 printed in your discussion department i
 have no brickbats to throw for all your stories
 are above that

all my comments are favorable to a s

   names of authors mean nothing to me i
 do not judge stories by their originators i
 read the stories and judge the authors by their
 work in the february issue carlyle bessette
 claims in his letter that he didnt buy the
 summer quarterly because he didnt approve
 of coblcntz stories such an idea is the most
 absurd i have ever heard no offense meant
 to mr bessette

    in one of your copies or rather several pub-
 lished some years ago you ran a serial the
 second deluge i consider it one of the best
 ever printed by you why more like this are
 not printed i cannot say for they certainly
 would be appreciated

    i do have a bone to pick with several dis-
 cussioners these readers claim the stories
 printed in the past do not compare with present
 ones in my opinion copies years ago compare
 favorably with the present ones

   the stories of a s arewellmixed in
 each issue i find stories of no onenature pre-
 dominant which therefore should appease
 everyones tastes

    one author i would like to see in your fold
 is rar cummings he certainly has that touch
 that carries a punch

always a booster

                john kingsmore

                      colgate street

                               philadelphia pa

    it sometimes seems to tis that in the light
 o some of the criticisms which we receive in
 all humility we should hardly publish such

 warm appreciation as appears in your very kind
 letter mr coblentz is a well-known author a
 poet and a critic in one of the sunday maga-
 zines that go with the daily papers we con-
 sider him a very high grade author he has
 published a book of poetry and we have had
 the pleasure of using his poetical work in our
 columns we hope you may yet see some of
 ray cummings work-editor

result of an imagination run-
ning wild the heavyside
layer

 editor amazing stories

   be prepared for the worst you shall now
 feast your eyes upon the result of an imagina-
 tion running wild inventors authors and
 editors have strong imaginations so you cant
 very well call me thoroughly insane call it
 a very short short story without plot or reason
 if you like there might be some facts in it
 so here goes

   the uppermost layer of the heavyside layer
 is an area of very minute particles of frozen
 hydrogen as you probably know compressed
 hydrogen in a frozen state has all the char-
 acteristics of a metal having a silvery lustrous
 appearance thats where the reflection of
 radio waves comes in gravity at the north
 pole is very strong because of no centrifugal
 force causing a much thinner layer of pro-
 tecting atmosphere hence the cold the par-
 ticles of frozen hydrogen are much more
 crowded there and the suns rays striking the
 frozen hydrogen produce an abundance of
 colors hence the aurora borealis

   well thats that regarding the january
 issue of a s this is not more imagination
 so keep on reading with only a slight mistake
 here and there why it was one of the best issues
 i have had the pleasure of reading in the
 story power scott terris quickly pulled out
 of a terrific dive without experiencing temporary
 blindness which would have been the case in
 real life

   i am all a-flutter waiting to meet troyana
 and i hope shes as good as her predecessor
 drums of tapajos dont disappoint me
 captain

   keep up the fine policy of a s and hang
 on to doc smith list me as one of the
 thousands yearning for the return of seaton
 and crane how about the skylarks in
 book form

                    joseph w -buck

                        so th court
                       cicero illinois

   your views about the heavyside layer are
 original to say the least net gravity at the
 north pole is only slightly greater than at
 the equator your views about the low tem-
 perature at the north pole are also quite
 original and the same can be said about your
 theory of the aurora borealis we are sure
 that you are pleased with troyana we are
 still hoping to see the skylark of space in
 book form-editor

a tribute to and criticism of
the stories we publish

 editor amazing stories

   i greatly enjoyed your recent story called
 spacehounds of ipc and hope you will give
 us more of the same kind i like the simple
 straightaway narrative style in which it is
 written i believe that your readers are more
 interested in interplanetary tales than in any
 other kind i deplore the stories you sometimes
 publish which are full of grammatical errors
 and written in an obviously juvenile style-
 apparently by people who have had no training
 in writing fortunately they are few in your
 magazine neither do i like stories that reek
 with the most awful human suffering i greatly
 enjoy the clever pictures you run and wish
 there were more of them

              bertha gordon

                       champlairi ave
                                  chicago 

   the spacehounds was certainly an ex-
 cellent story and it proved to be quite a favorite
 our pages are edited and proofread carefully
 but wo suppose we are not infallible just the
 same well try to do better if weve let a lot
 slip by if we put in more pictures there would
 be less text and that is certainly one of the
 reasons that induces your criticism-editor

they gave me the ha-ha
    when i offered to play

 but i was the life of the party after that

t he first day of dorothys house
party at her cottage on the shore had
been a huge success with an after-
noon of swimming boating and golf-
ing we were all set for the wonderful
dinner that followed

  well folks said bill enthusi-
astically as we were leaving the
table i dont know how you feel
but im all pepped up for a good
dance

 fine cried dorothy dick
roberts has his banjo and can sure
make it hum now who can play the
piano

  instantly the laughter and merri-
ment ceased all looked at one an-
other foolishly but  one said a word

  how about you jim you play dont
you asked dot

  yes ill play far far away
laughed jim

  well then mabel will you help us
out

  honestly dot i hate to admit it but
i cant play a note she answered

  it certainly looked as if the party were
going flat plenty of dancers but no one
to play

then i offered to play

  if you folks can stand it i offered
shyly ill play for you

  the crowd silent until now instantly
burst out in laughter

  you may be able to play football jack
but you cant tackle a piano

  quit your kidding cut in another
ive never heard you play a note and
ive known you all your life

  there isnt a bar of music in your
whole makeup laughed mabel

  a feeling of embarrassment mingled
with resentment came over me but as i
strode to the piano i couldnt help chuck-
ling to myself when i thought of the
surprise i had in store for them

  no one knew what to expect they
thought i was about to make a fool of
myself some laughed others watched
me wide-eyed

  then-i struck the first snappy chords
of that foot-loosing fox-trot st louis
blues dick was so dumb-
founded he almost dropped
his banjo but in a flash he
had picked up the rhythm
and was strumming away
like mad

 although they could
hardly believe their cars
the crowd were all on their
feet in a jiffy and how
they danced fox-trots
waltzes-with rests few
and far between

after a good round of

dancing i decided to
give them some real mu-
sic and began a beautiful in-
dian love lyric

  the couples who but a moment
before had been dancing merrily
were now seated quietly about the
room entranced by that plaintive
melody

  no sooner had the last soft notes died
away than i was surrounded by my as-
tonished friends questions were fired at
me from all sides

  how wonderful jack why havent
you played for us before

  how long have you been studying
why have you kept it a secret all
these years when you might have been
playing for us

  who gave you lessons he must be
wonderful

i reveal my secret

then i explained how some time before
i made up my mind to go in for something
besides sports i wanted to be able to
play-to entertain others-to be popular
but when i thought of the great expense
and the years of study and practice re-
quired i hesitated

  then one day i ran across an announce-
ment in a magazine telling of a new
quick and simple way to learn music at
home without a teacher

  i was a little skeptical at first but it
was just what i wanted so i sent for the
free booklet and demon-
stration lesson the mo-
ment i saw it i was con-
vinced and sent for the
complete course at once

  when the lessons arrived
i started right in giving a
few minutes of my spare
time each day and what
fun it was-even from the
very beginning no mo-
notonous scales-no tedi-
ous exercises-no tricky
methods - just a simple
