 beneath the softly sobbing sea

 sad cities crumble silently

 pale kings peer down from futile thrones
 pale queens lament with soundless moans
 recalling vanished loveliness

 in long-forgotten lyonesse

 pale ladies smile so eerily

 the years creep by so wearily

 the surges sob so drearily

 in far forsaken lyonesse

 pale knights sway restless to and fro
 when neptunes distant bugles blow

 pale nuns among the pallid weeds

 count ceaselessly their coral beads

 with mild and gentle wofulness
 in weird and wistful lyonesse

 pale lovers watch with wan despair
 pale maidens floating golden hair

 pale jesters tarnished cap-and-bells
 chime faintly with the ocean swells
 a requiem of tenderness
 for lost and lonely lyonesse

 pale ladies smile so eerily

 the years creep by so wearily

 the surges sob so drearily

 in dead and drowned lyonesse


the wind was blowing half a
gale and little spits of sudden
snow were whirling through
the gray november twilight as we
alighted from the accommodation
train and looked expectantly up and
down the uncovered way-station plat-
form seasonable weather for
thanksgiving i murmured setting
my face against the howling blast and
making for the glowing disk of the
station-masters light

ed jules de grandin sinking his chin

side of the little red-brick depot as my
friend tandy van riper stepped for-

weird tales

you have monsieurf de grandin
asked as he dropped into a scat in
van ripers luxurious daimler lan-
dau and tucked the bearskin carriage
rug snugly about his knees

 well yes and no our host
replied   the house has been up
-in america-for something like
eight years i believe but its new to
us weve been in residence just a
little over a month and were giving
a regular old-fashioned thanksgiving
party by way of housewarming  

 um  the frenchman nodded
thoughtfully your pardon mon-
sieur it is perhaps that i do not speak
the american well but did yon not
say the new house has been up in this
country for only eight years i fear
i do not apprehend is it that the
house stood elsewhere before being
erected here

  precisely van riper agreed
with a laugh the cloisters were
built-or rebuilt i suppose youd say
-by miles batterman shortly after
the close of the world war batterman
made a potful of money during the
war and a lot more in lucky specula-
tions between the armistice and the
treaty of versailles i reckon he
didnt know just what to do with it
all so he blew in a couple of hundred
thousand on an old cyprian villa had
it taken down stone by stone shipped
over here and re-erected the build-
ing was a sort of remodeled mon-
astery i believe and took batter-
mans eye while he was cruising about
the mediterranean in  he went
to a lot of trouble having it moved
here and put up and everything
about the place is exactly as it was in
cyprus except the heating and
plumbing avhich he added as a sort
of afterthought quaint idea wasnt
it

 decidedly the frenchman
agreed  andthis monsieur batter-
man did he so soon tire of his ex-
pensive toy

  humph not exactly i got it
from the administrators i couldnt

have afforded to pay a quarter the
price batterman spent on the-place
let alone give him a profit on the
transaction but the fact is the old boy
dropped off suddenly a year or so
ago-so did his wife and daughter
the doctors said they died from eat-
ing toadstools by mistakefor mush-
rooms whatever the cause was the
whole family died in a single night
and the property would have gone to
the state by escheat if the lawyers
hadnt dug up some ninety-second
cousins out in omaha we bought the
house at public auction for about a
tenth its value and im figuring on
holding it for a while itll be a
novel sensation living in a place the
knights templars once occupied eh  
very novel-very novel indeed
monsieur de oran din replied in a
queer fiat voice you say the
knights of the temple once occupied
this house   

  so they tell me-some of their old
furnitures still in it  

  de grandin made an odd sound in
his throat and i turned quickly to
look at him but his face was as set
and expressionless as the features of
a japanese buddha and if the half-
smothered exclamation had been
meant for conversation he had evi-
dently thought better of it for he sat
in stony silence during the rest of the
drive

nphe snow squalls had stopped by
 the time we drew up at the house
but the wind had increased in ve-
locity and in the zenfth we could see
the gibbous moon buffeted about in a
surf of windblown clouds against
the background of the winter sky the
irregular outline of the cloisters
loomed in a forbidding silhouette it
was a high rambling pile of gray
masonry in which the characteristics
of romanesque gothic and byzantine
architecture were oddly blended the
walls were strengthened by a series
of buttresses crenelated with battle-
ments and punctuated here and there
the chapel op mystic horror



with small cylindrical watch-towers
the windows were mere slits between
the great stones and the massive en-
traneeway seemed fitted for a port-
eullis yet a great hemispherical dome
rose from the center of the building
and a wide shallow portico with grace-
ful fluted columns topped by doric
capitals stood before the gateway

  cocktail hour had just struck as we
passed through the wide entrance to
the main hall and a party of sleek-
haired gentlemen and ladies in fash-
ionably scanty attire were gathered
before the cavernous fireplace chat-
ting and laughing as they imbibed the
appetite-whetting amber drinks

  it was an enormous apartment that
hall clear fifty feet from tiled floor to
vaulted ceiling and the darkness was
scarcely more than stained by the
flickeiing glow of blazing logs in the
fireplace and the yellow beams of the
tall ecclesiastical candles which stood
singly in high wrought-iron stand-
ards at intervals along the walls
draped down the bare stone sides of
the hall hung a pair of prodigious
tapestries companion pieces i
thought depicting particularly gory
battle scenes and i caught a fugitive
glimpse of a black-armored knight
with a cross-emblazoned surtout hack-
ing the turbaned head from a saracen
and the tag end of the latin leg-
end beneath-ad majorem dei glo-
riam

  piloted by our host we mounted the
wide balustraded stairease to the
second of three balconies which ran
round three sides of the -long hall
found the big barnlike room assigned
us changed quickly to dinner clothes
and joined the other guests in time to
file through a high archway to the
oak-paneled apartment where dinner
was served by candle-light on a long
refectory table set with the richest
silver and most opulent linen i had
ever seen

  greatly to his chagrin de grandin
drew a kittenish elderly spinster
with gleaming and palpably false den-

tition i was paired off with a miss

	shane a tall tawny-haired girl
with tapering statuesque limbs and
long smooth-jointed fingers the milk-
white skin of the pure-bred celt and
smoldering rebellious eyes of inde-
terminate color

  during the soup and fish courses
she was taciturn to the point of
churlishness responding to my at-
tempts at conversation with curt uni-
syllabic replies but as the claret
glasses were filled for the roast she
turned her strange half-resentful
gaze directly on me and demanded
dr trowbridge what do you think
of this house

  why-er i temporized scarcely
knowing what to reply it seems
rather gorgeous but-

  yes she interrupted as i paused
at a loss for an exact expression but
what   

 well rather depressing-too
massive and mediaeval for present-day
people if you get what i mean  

  i do she nodded almost angrily
i most certainly do its beastly
im a painter-a painter of sorts
she hurried on as my eyes opened in
astonishment at her vehemence  and

	brought along some gear to work
with between times during the party
van told me this is liberty hall and
i could do exactly as i pleased and
gave me a big room on the north side
for a workshop ive a commission
ive simply got to finish in two weeks
and i began some preliminary

sketches yesterday but- she

paused taking a sip of burgundy and
looking at me from the corners of her
long brooding eyes as though specu-
lating whether or not to take me fur-
ther into her confidence

  yes i prompted assuming an
air of interest

   its no go do you remember the
red king in through the looking-
glass

    the red king   i echoed  im
afraid i dont quite


weird tales

  dont you remember how alice
took the end of his pencil in her hand
when he was attempting to enter a
note in his diary and made him write
the white knight is sliding down
the poker lie balances very badly   

  i must have looked my bewilder-
ment for she laughed aloud a deep
gurgling laugh in keeping with her
rich contralto speaking voice oh
im not a psychopathic case-i
hope   she assured me   but im cer-
tainly in a position to sympathize with
the poor king its a christmas card
im doing-a nice frosty sugar-
sweet christmas card-and im sup-
posed to have a noel scene with oxen
and asses and sheep standing around
the manger of a chubby little naked
boy you know-quite the convention-
al sort of thing she paused again
and refreshed herself with a sip of
wine and i noticed that her strong
white-fingered hand trembled as she
raised the etched glass to her lips

  my professional interest was
roused the girl was a splendid
vital animal lean and strong as
artemis and the pallor of her pale
skin was natural not unhealthy yet
it required no special training to see
she labored under an almost crushing
burden of suppressed nervousness

  wont it work out i asked
soothingly

  no her reply was almost ex-
plosive no it wont i can block
in the interior all right though it
doesnt look much like a stable but
when it comes to the figures some-
thing outside me-behind me like
alice behind the red king you know
and just as invisible-seems to snatch
the end of my charcoal and guide it

i	keep drawing- another pause

longer this time broke her recital

  drawing what if you please
mademoiselle de grandin turned
from his partner who was in the midst
of recounting a risque anecdote and
leaned forward his narrow eyebrows
elevated in twin arches his little

round blue eyes fixed and unwinking
in a direct questioning stare

  the girl started at his query   oh
all manner of things she began
then broke off with a sharp cachin-
nating laugh half hysterical just
what the red king said when his
pencil wouldnt work she shrilled

  for a moment i thought the little
frenchman would strike her so fierce
was the uncompromising gaze he bent
on her then ah bah let us not
think too much of fairy-tales pleasant
or grim if you please mademoiselle
he returned after dinner if you
will be so good dr trowbridge and
i shall do ourselves the honor of in-
specting these so mysterious self-dic-
tated drawings of yours until then
let us consider this excellent food
which the good monsieur van riper
has provided for us abruptly he
turned to his neglected partner
yes mademoiselle he murmured
in his deferential flattering manner

  and then the bishop said to the
rector-



dinner completed we trooped into
the high balconied hall for cof-
fee tobacco and liqueurs a radio
artfully disguised as a mediaeval
flemish console squawked jazz with
a sputtering obbligato of static and
some of the guests danced while the
rest gathered at the rim of the pool
of firelight and talked in muted
voices somehow the great stone
house seemed to discourage frivolity
by the sheer weight of its antiquity

 trowbridge my friend de
grandin whispered almost fiercely in
my ear as he plucked me by the
sleeve mademoiselle shane awaits
our pleasure come let us go to her
studio at once before old mere ioie
tells me another of her so detestable
stories of unvirtuous clergymen  

  grinning as i wondered how the
little frenchmans late dinner part-
ner would have enjoyed hearing her-
self referred to as mother goose i
the chapel of mystic horror



followed him lip the first flight of
stairs crossed the lower balcony and
ascended a second stairway narrow
and steeper than the first to the up-
per gallery where miss o shane wait-
ed before the heavily carved door of
a great cavelike room paneled from
flagstone floor to beamed ceiling with
age-blackened oak wainscot candles
seemed the only mode of illumination
available in the house and our hostess
had lighted half a dozen tapers which
stood in two antique girandoles so
that their luminance fell directly on
an oblong of eggshell bristol board
anchored to her easel by thumbtacks

  now heres what i started to do
she began indicating the sketch with
a long beautifully manicured fore-
finger this was supposed to be the
inside of the stable at bethlehem and
-oh the short half-choked ex-
clamation uttered with a puzzled
questioning rising inflection cut short
her sentence and she stared at her
handiwork as though it were some-
thing she had never seen before

  leaning forward i examined the
embryonic picture curiously as she
had said at dinner the interior rough
and elementary as it was did not re-
semble a stable crude and rough it
undoubtedly was but with a rudeness
unlike that of a barn cubic rough-
hewn stones composed the walls and
the vaulting of the concamerated roof
was supported by a series of con-
verging arches with piers based on
blocks of oddly carved stone repre-
senting wide naked feet toes forward
standing on the crowns of hideous
gargoylish heads with half-human
half-reptilian faces which leered hell-
ishly in mingled torment and rage be-
neath the pressure in the middle
foreground was a raised rectangular
object which reminded me of a flat-
topped sarcophagus and beside it
slightly to the rear there loomed the
faint spectral outline of a sinister
cowled figure with menacing upraised
hand while in the lower foreground
crouched or rather groveled a second

figure a long boldly sketched female
form with outstretched supplicating
hands and face concealed by a cas-
cade of downward-sweeping hair
back of the hooded monkish form
were faint outlines of what had ap-
parently first been meant to repre-
sent domestic animals but i could see
where later heavier pencil strokes had
changed them into human shapes re-
sembling the cowled and hooded
figure

  i shuddered involuntarily as i
turned from the drawing for not only
in half-completed line and suggestive
curve but also in the intangible spirit
of the thing was the suggestion of
something bestial and unhallowed
somehow the thing seemed to suggest
something revolting something preg-
nant avith the disgusting incongruity
of a ribald song bawled in church
when the kyrie should be sung or of
rose-water sprinkled on putrefying
offal

  de grandins slender dark brown
eyebrows elevated till they almost met
the shoreline of his sleekly combed fair
hair and the waxed points of his di-
minutive blond mustache reared up-
ward like a pair of horns as he pursed
his thin lips but he made no verbal
comment

  not so miss oshane as though
a sudden draft of air had blown
through the room she shivered and i
could see the tiny hummocks of hor-
ripilation rise on her forearms as she
stared wide-eyed at her own cre-
ation   it wasnt like that  she ex-
claimed in a thin rasping whisper
like the ghost of a scream i didnt
do that

  eh how do you say mademoi-
selle de grandin challenged re-
garding her with his unwinking cat-
stare you would have us to under-
stand that-

  yes she still spoke in a sort
of awed wondering whisper i
didnt draav it that way i blocked in
the interior and made it of stone for
i avas pretty sure the holy land


weird tales

stables were masonry but i didnt
draw those beastly arch-supports
they were just plain blocks of stone
when i made them i did put in the
arches-not that i wanted to but be-
cause i felt compelled to do it but
this-this is all different her
words trailed off till we could scarcely
catch them not because of lowered
tone but bccause they came higher
thinner with each syllable stark
unreasoning terror had her by the
throat i could see and it was with the
utmost difficulty that she managed to
breathe

  ilm  de grandin tweaked the
pointed ends of his mustache let
us recapitulate if you please made-
moiselle yesterday and today you
worked on this sketch yes you
drew what you conceived to be a
jewish stable in the days of caesar
augustus-and what else if you re-
call

  just the stable and the bare out-
lines of the manger then a half-com-
pleted figure which was to have been
joseph and the faintest outlines of
the animals and a kneeling figure be-
fore the cradle-i hadnt determined
whether it would be male or female
or whether it would be full-draped
or not for i wasnt sure whether id
have the magi or the shepherds or just
some of the village folk adoring the
infant you see i gave up working
about  this afternoon because the
light was beginning to fail and be-
cause-

  eh bien because of what if you
please mademoisellef the french-
man prompted sharply as the girl
dropped her recital

  because there seemed to be an
actual physical opposition to my
work-almost as if an invisible hand
were gently but insistently forcing
my pencil to draw things i hadnt
conceived-things i was afraid to
draw now do you think im crazy   

  she paused again breathing audi-
bly through slightly parted lips and i
could see the swelling of her throat

as she swallowed convulsively once or
twice

  ignoring her question the little
frenchman regarded her thoughtfully
a moment then examined the drawing
once more this who was to have
been the good saint joseph now he
asked softly was herobed after this
fashion when you limned him

   no id only roughed out the body
he had no face when i quit work

  um mademoiselle he is still
without a face de grandin replied

  yes but theres a plaee for his
face in the opening of his hood and
if you look elosely you can almost see
his features-his eyes especially i
can feel them on me and theyre not
good theyre bad wicked cruel-
like a snakes or a devils see hes
robed like a monk i didnt draw him
that way  

  de grandin took up one of the
candelabra and held it close to the
picture scanning the obscene thing
with an unhurried critical stare then
turned to us with a half-impatient
shrug tenez my friends he re-
marked i fear we make ourselves
most wretchedly unhappy over a mat-
ter of small moment come let us
join the others



tvtidnight had struck and de gran-
-lvj din anj j managed to lose
something like thirty dollars at the
bridge tables before the company
broke up for the evening

  do you really think that poor
oshane girl is a little off her rock-
er i asked as we made ready for
bed

  i doubt it he replied as he
fastened the sash of his pale lavender
pajama jacket with a nervous tug
indeed i am inclined to believe all
that she told us-and something
more  

  you think it possible she could
have been in a sort of day-dream
while she drew those awful things
thinking all the while she was draw-
the chapel of mystic horror



ing a christmas card i asked in-
credulously

 ah bah he returned as he
kicked off his purple lizardskin slip-
pers and leaped into bed   what mat-
ters it what we think unless i am
more mistaken than i think we shall
know with certitude before very
long and turning his back upon
me he buried his face in the pillow
and dropped off to sleep

t might have slept an hour perhaps
a only a few minutes when the sharp
impact of an elbow against my ribs
roused me eh i demanded sit-
ting up in bed and rubbing my eyes
sleepily

    trowbridge my friend   de gran-
din s sharp whisper came through the
darkness listen do you hear it

    huh   i responded but

  ps-s-st he shut me off with a
minatory hiss and i held my peace
straining my ears through the chill
november night

  at first i heard nothing but the
skirling of the wind-fiends racing past
the turreted walls and the occasional
creak of a rusty hinge as some door
or shutter swung loose from its fasten-
ings then very faint and far-away
seeming but growing in clarity as my
ears became attuned to it i caught
the subdued notes of a piano played
very softly

    come  de grandin breathed
slipping from the bed and donning a
mauve-silk gown

  obeying his summons i rose and
followed him on tiptoe across the bal-
cony and down the stairs as we
descended the music became clearer
more distinct someone was in the
music room touching the keys of the
big grand piano with a delicate harp-
sichord touch liebestraum the com-
position was and the gently struck
notes fell one after another like
drops of limpid water dripping from
a moss-covered ledge into a quiet
woodland pool

  why its exquisite i began but
de grandins upraised hand cut short
my commendation as he motioned me
forward

  seated on the bancal before the
piano was dunroe oshane her long
ivory fingers flitting over the ivory
keys her loosened tawny hair flowing
over her uncovered white shoulders
like a spilth of molten bronze from a
blast-furnace runner from gently
swelling breast to curving instep she
was draped in a clinging shift of
black-silk tissue which revealed the
gracious curves of her pale body with
a subtle glow like a winter moon half
seen through veils of banking storm-
clouds

  as we paused at the doorway the
dulcet german air came to an abrupt
ending the girls fingers began aveav-
ing sinuous patterns over the keys as
though she would conjure up some
nether-world spirit from their pallid
smoothness and the room was sudden-
ly filled with a libidinous macabre
theme in b minor beautiful and se-
ductive but revolting as a painted-
faee corpse already touched by the
hand of putrefaction swaying
gently to the rhythm of the frenetic
music she turned her face toward us
and i saw her eyes were closed long
lashes sweeping against white cheeks
pale fine-veined lids calmly lowered

  why i exclaimed softly why
de grandin shes asleep shes-

 a quick movement of his hand
stayed my words as he stole softly
across the rug-strewn floor bent for-
ward till his face was but a few inches
from hers and stared intently into her
veiled eyes i could see the small
blue veins in his temples swell and
throb and the muscles of his throat
bunch and contract with the physical
effort he made to project his will into
her consciousness his thin firm lips
moved forming soundless words and
one of his small white hands rose
slowly finger-tips together as though
reeling thread from an invisible skein
paused a moment before her face then


weird tales

moved slowly back with a gliding
stroking motion

  gradually with a slow diminuendo
the wicked salacious tune came to a
pause died to a thin vibrating echo
ceased still with lowered lids and
gently parted lips the girl rose from
the piano wavered uncertainly a mo-
ment then walked from the room with
a slow gliding step her slim naked
feet passing soundless as a drift of
air over the tessellated floor slowly
she mounted the stairs one hand trail-
ing gently on the carved baluster the
other raised with a sort of humble
reverence to her bosom

  silently in a sort of breathless
wonder i watched her disappear
around the curve of the stone stair-
way and avas about to hazard a wan-
dering opinion when a sharp exclama-
tion from the frenchman silenced me

  quick my friend he ordered
extinguishing the tall twin candles
which burned beside the piano let
us go up unless i am more badly
mistaken than i think there is that
up there which is worth seeing

  i followed him up the stairs down
the first gallery to the second flight
and down the upper balcony to the
bare forbidding room miss shane
used as studio ah he breathed
as he struck a wax match and ignited
the candles before the drawing-board
did i not say it parhleu friend
trowbridge mademoiselle shane
has indulged in more than one sort of
unconscious art this night or jules
de grandin is a liar  

  as the candle flames leaped to burn-
ing points in the still air of the room
i started forward then shrank back
from the sketch their radiance re-
vealed progress had been made on
the picture since we had viewed it
earlier in the evening the hooded
figure in the foreground was now
clearly drawn and it was no monk
but a steel-clad warrior with long
white surtout drawn over his armor
and a white hood pulled forward half
concealing his thin bearded face but

there was a face there where there
had been none before-a thin vulpine
wicked face with set cruel eyes which
gloated on the prostrate figure before
him the upraised arm which had no
hand when miss oshane showed us
the drawing after dinner now ter-
minated in a mailed fist and between
the steel-sheathed fingers it held the
stem of a chalice a lovely tulip-
shaped cup of crystal as though it
would scatter its contents to the pol-
ished stone with which the pictured
room was paved one other thing i
noted before my glance shifted to the
female figure-the long red passion
cross upon the white surtout was re-
versed its long arm pointing upward
its transverse bar lowered and even
as i saw this i remembered vaguely
that when knightly orders flourished
it was the custom of heraldic courts
thus to reverse a sir-knights coat of
arms when he was degraded from his
chivalry as unworthy to maintain its
traditions

  what had been the rough outlines
of the manger were now firmly
drawn into the representation of an
altar complete with crucifix and
tabernacle but- veiling the cross so
lightly sketched that stare as i would
i could not make it out was an odd-
shaped winged form somewhat re-
sembling a bat with outstretched
wings

  before the altars lowest step the
female figure now drawn with the
detail of an engraving groveled
starkly chin and breasts knees and
elbows instep and wrists pressed
tightly to the stones open suppliant
hands stretched forward palms up-
ward  rippling masses of hair flowing
forward like a plume of smoke blown
in the wind and obscuring the face

  and what was that upon the second
step leading to the sanctuary at
first i thought it an alms-basin but a
second glance showed me it was a
wide shallow dish and in it rested a
long curve-bladed knife such as i
had seen french butchers wear in
the chapel of mystic horror



their belts while enjoying a noonday
smoke and resting for a space from
their gory trade before the entrance
of an abattoir

  good heavens i gasped turn-
ing from the grisly scene with a feel-
ing of physical sickness this is
terrible de grandin what are we

going to do-  

  barbe et tete de saint denis we
do this he replied in a furious
hissing voice  par bleu shall jules
de grandin be made a fool of twice in
one night  not if he knows it 
seizing a soap-rubber from the
tray he bent forward and with half
a dozen vigorous strokes reduced the
picture to a meaningless smear of
black and gray smudges

  and now he dusted his hands
one against the other as though to
cleanse them of something foul let
us to bed once more my friend i
think we shall find something inter-
esting to talk of tomorrow  

shortly after breakfast next morn-
ing he found an excuse forsep-
arating dunroe oshane from the
rest of the company will you not
have pity on our loneliness ma-
demoiselle he asked here we lie
imprisoned in this great jail of a
house without so much as a radio
program to cheer us through the
morning hours may we not trespass
on your kindness and beg that you
play for our delectation   

   play the girl answered with a
half-incredulous smile why dr
de grandin i dont know one note
from another i never played the
piano in my life 

  um he looked polite doubt
as he twisted the ends of his mus-
tache it is perhaps that i do not
plead our cause fervently enough
mademoiselle f  

  but truly i cant play she per-
si steel

  thats right dr de grandin
one of the young men chimed in
 dunroes a whiz at drawing but

shes absolutely tone-deaf cant
carry a tune in a basket i used to
go to school with her and they al-
ways used to give her a job passing
out programs or selling tickets when
the class chorus sang

  de grandin shot me a quick glance
and shook his head warningly

  what does it mean i asked as
soon as we were together once more
she declares she cant play and her

friends corroborate her but-

 but stranger things have hap-
pened and mordieu still stranger
ones will happen again or the pre-
sentiment which i have is nothing
more than the consequences of a too-
liearty breakfast he broke in with
one of his quick elfin smiles let us
play the silly fool friend trow-
bridge  let us pretend to believe that
the moon is composed entirely of
green cheese and that mice terrorize
the pussy-cat so doing we shall learn
more than if we attempt to appear
filled with wisdom which we do not
possess



rh i know what lets do miss
m prettybridge the lady of the
scintillating teeth whom de grandin
had squired to dinner the previous
evening exclaimed shortly after 
oclock that night this is such a
wonderful romantic old house-im
sure its just full of memories lets
have a seance  

  fine splendid capital chor-
used a dozen voices wholl be the
medium anybody got a ouija board
or a planchette table

  order order please the self-
constituted chairwoman rapped per-
emptorily on a bridge table with her
lorgnette  i know how to do it
well go into the dining-room and
gather about the table then when
weve formed the mystic circle if
there are any spirits about well make
em talk to us by rapping come on
everybody  


weird tales

  i dont think i like this miss
oshane murmured as she laid her
hand on my arm her usually pale
face was paler still and there was an
expiession of haunted fear in her big
gray-green eyes as she hesitated at the
doorway

  	 i dont care much for such non-
sense myself i admitted as we fol-
lowed the others reluctantly into the
refectory

  be close to me while this pro-
gresses friend trowbridge de
grandin whispered as he guided me to
a seat beside him i care not much
for this business of the monkey but it
may be the old she-fool yonder will
serve our purpose unwittingly the
greatest danger is to mademoiselle
dunroe keep watch on her  

  the candles in the dining-room wall
sconces were extinguished and with
miss prettybridge at the head of the
table the entire company was seated
at the board each one with his hands
outspread on the dark polished oak
before him his thumbs touching light-
ly his little fingers in contact with
those of his neighbors to right and
left

  spirits miss prettybridge in
her role of priestess threw out the
customary challenge spirits if you
are here tonight signify your pres-
ence by rapping once on the table

  thirty seconds or so elapsed with-
out an answer to the ladys invitation
a woman half-way down the board
tittered in half-hysterical embarrass-
ment and her neighbor silenced her
with an impatient sh-s-s-sh then
distinctly as though thumped with a
knuckle the ancient table gave forth a
resounding crack

  if the spirit is a man rap once
if a woman twice instructed miss
prettybridge

  another pause somewhat longer
this time then slowly distinctly two
soft knocks from the very center of
the table

  oh a woman trilled one of the
girls how perfectly thrilling

 and your name is-what de-
manded the mistress of ceremonies in
a voice which trembled lightly in
spite of her effort at control

  thirteen slow clear strokes sound-
ed on the table followed by one then
by eighteen then others in series un-
til nine distinct groups of blows were
recorded

    m-a-r-i-e-a-n-n-e-marie anne-a
french girl   exclaimed miss pretty-
bridge whom do you wish to
speak with marie anne  rap when i
come to the name as i call the roll
dr trowbridge   

  no response

  dr de grandin

  a sharp affirmative knock an-
swered her and the visitant was bid-
den spell out her message

  followed a rapid telegraphic series
of blows on the table sometimes com-
ing so quickly that it was impossible
for us to decode them

  i listened as attentively as i could
so did everyone else except jules de
grandin after a moment during
which his sleek blond head was thrust
forward inquiringly he turned his at-
tention to dunroe shane

  the logs were burning low in the
fireplace but a shifting flickering
glow soaked through the darkness now
and again its red reflection lighting
up the girls face with a strange un-
earthly illumination like the nimbus
about the head of a saint in a medi-
aeval painting

  i felt the frenchmans fingers stif-
fen against mine and realized the
cause of his tenseness as i stole a
fleeting glance at miss oshane her
eyes had closed and her red petulant
lips were lightly parted as though
in sleep over her small regular fea-
tures had crept a look of longing
ecstasy like that of an hieromartyr
breathless with adoration

  even my limited experience with
psychotherapy was sufficient to tell me
she was in a condition verging on
hypnosis if not actually over the bor-
derline of consciousness and i was
the chapel of mystic horror



about to leap from my seat with an
offer of assistance when the insistent
pressure of de grandins finger on
mine held me back turning toward
him i saw his head nod sharply to-
ward the doorway behind the girl and
following his silent bidding i cast my
glance into the passageway in time
to see someone slip quickly and noise-
lessly down the hall

  for a moment i sat in wondering
silence debating whether i had seen
one of the servants creep past or
whether i was the victim of an optical
illusion when my attention was sud-
denly compelled to a second figure
then a third a fourth and a fifth pass-
ing the archways opening like flashes
of light against a darkened wall my
reason told me my eyes were playing
pranks for the gliding soundless fig-
ures filing in quick procession past
the proscenium of the dining-room
door were tall bearded men encased
in gleaming black steel armed cap-a-
pie and shrouded from shoulder to
spurs in voluminous sable cloaks

  i blinked my eyes and shook my
head in bewilderment wondering if
i had fallen into a momentary doze
and dreamed the vision but sharply
with theatrical suddenness there
sounded the raucous brazen bray of
a bugle the skirling squeal of an un-
oiled windlass reeling out rope the
thud of a drawbridge falling into
place then above the whistling no-
vember wind there winded another
trumpet flourish and the clatter of
iron-shod hooves against stone paving-
blocks

 why what was that miss
prettybridge forgot the spirit message
still being thumped out on the table
and threw back her head in momen-
tary alarm

  sounds like a troop of scouts out
for an evenings lark put in our
host rising from the table queer
they should come out here to toot their
bugles though

  ha parbleu you say rightly my
friend de grandin broke in rising

so suddenly that his chair tilted back
and fell to the floor with a resounding
crash it is queer most damnably
queer boy scouts did you say
prie dieu they be not scouts of evil
in search of some hapless little lad
avhile a company of empty-headed
fools sit idly by listening to the chat-
ter of their decoy

  did none of you recognize the
message the spirit had for me

  we looked at him in silent astonish-
ment as he lighted the wall-eandles
one after another and faced us with
a countenance gone livid with fury

  alt bah it is scarcely worth trou-
bling to tell you he cried but the
important message the spirit had for
me was a silly little nursery rime

        great a little a

          bouncing b

        the cats in the cupboard

          and cant see me

  no mordieu the cats might not
see that accursed decoy spirit but
jules de grandin could see the others
as they slunk past the door upon their
devils work trowbridge mon vieux
look to mademoiselle shane if you
will  

  startled by his command i turned
round dunroe oshane had fallen
forward across the tabic her long
tawny hair freed from its restraining
pins and lying about her head like a
pool of liquid bronze her eyes were
still closed but the peaceful longing
expression had gone from her face
and in its stead was a look of un-
utterable fear and loathing

  take her up some of you de
grandin almost shrieked bear her
to her chamber and dr trowbridge
and i will attend to her then mon-
sieur van riper if you will be so
good i shall ask you to lend us one
of your swiftest motor cars

 a motor car-now van ri-
pers incredulous tone showed he
doubted his ears

   precisement monsieur permit
that i compliment you on the exoel-


weird tales

 lence of your hearing   the french-
man replied a swift motor car
with plenty of fuel if you please
there are certain medicines needed
to attend this sickness of body and
soul and to strike directly at its
cause and we must have them without
delay dr trowbridge wall drive
you need not trouble your chauffeur
to leave his bed

ten minutes later having no more
idea of our destination than i had
of the underlying causes of the last
half hours strange events i sped
down the turnpike van ripers pow-
erful motor warming up with every
revolution and gaining speed with
every foot we traveled

  faster faster pour vamour de
dieu my friend the little french-
man besought as we whirled madly
around a banked curve in the road
and started down the two-mile
straightaway with the speedometer
registering sixty-five miles an hour

  twin disks of lurid flame rose
above the crest of the gradient before
us growing larger and brighter every
second and the pounding staccato of
high-powered motorcycles driven at
top speed came to us through the
shrieking wind

  i throttled down our engine to a
legal speed as the state troopers
neared but instead of rushing past
they came to a halt one on each side
of us   where you from    demand-
ed the one to our left on whose arm
a sergeant s chevrons showed

  from mr tan ripers house-
the cloisters i answered im dr
trowbridge of harrisonville and
this is dr de grandin a young
lady at the house has been taken ill
and were rushing home for medi-
cine

  ump the sergeant grunted
come from th cloisters do you
dont suppose you passed anyone on
the road

  no- i began but de grandin

leaned past me peering intently into
the constables face

  for whom do you seek onon ser-
gent he demanded

  night riders the words fairly
spat from the policemans lips lot
o dam kidnapers sir old lady
down th road about five miles-name
o stebbens-was walkin home from
a neighbors with her grandson a
cute little lad about three years old
when a crowd o bums came riding
hell-bent for election past her
knocked her for a loop an grabbed
up the kid masqueraders they was
-wore long black gowns she said
an rode on black horses went away
whoopin an yellin to each other in
some foreign language an laughin
like a pack o dogs be god theyll
laugh outa th  other side o  their dirty
mouths if we ketch em

  come on shoup lets roll he
ordered his companion

  the roar of their motorcycles grew
fainter and fainter as they swept
down the road and in another mo-
ment we were pursuing our way to-
ward the city gathering speed with
every turn of the wheels



xe had gone scarcely another

  	 mile before the slate-colored
clouds which the wind had been piling
together in the upper sky ripped apart
and great clouds of soft feathery
snowflakes came tumbling down blot-
ting out the road ahead and cutting
our speed to a snails pace it was
almost graylight before we arrived at
the outskirts of harrisonville and the
snow was falling harder than ever as
we headed up the main thoroughfare

  helas my friend there is not
the chance of the chinaman that we
can return to the cloisters before
noon be our luck of the best de
grandin muttered disconsolately
therefore i suggest that we go to
your house and obtain a few hours
rest me i am almost frozen and a

warm bed will be welcome as a kiss
to a love-siek lad  

  but how about the medicine you
wanted i objected hadnt we
better see about getting that first
non he returned it will
keep the medicine i seek could not
be administered before tonight-if
that soon-and we can secure it later
as well as now  

t ather surprized at our unherald-

ries of a bachelor physician and his
eccentric friend nora mcginnis my
housekeeper and general factotum
prepared a toothsome breakfast for us
next morning and we had completed
the meal lingering over coffee and
cigarettes a little longer than usual
when de grandins face suddenly
went livid - as he thrust the folded

last-minute news sandwiched between
the announcement of a sheriffs sale
and a patent medicine advertisement

  johnskill-sergeant eos swell of the state
constabulary is dead and private shoup in
a serious condition as the result of a battle
with a mysterious band of masked ruffians
near this place early this morning shortly
after  oclock last night matilda stebbens
of osmond ville who was returning from a
visit to a neighbors with her three-year-old
grandson george was attacked by a com-
pany of men mounted on black or dark-
colored horses and enveloped in long black
gowns according to her story to the troop-
ers the leader of the gang struck her a
heavy blow with a club or blackjack evi-
dently with the intention of stunning her
and seized the little boy lifting him to his
saddle had it not been for the fact that
mrs stebbens still affects long hair and
was wearing a stiff felt hat the blow would
undoubtedly have rendered her unconscious
but as it was she was merely knocked into
the roadside ditch without losing conscious-
ness and as she lay there half stunned
from the blow she heard the kidnapers ex-
change several words in some foreign
language italian she thought before they
set cfut at a breakneck pace giving vent to
wild whoops and yells the direction of
their flight was toward this place and as
soon as she was able to walk mrs stebbens
hobbled to the nearest telephone and com-
municated with the state police

  sergeant rosswell and private slioup
were detailed to the case and started in
pursuit of the abductors on their motor-
cycles encountering no one along the road
who would admit having seen the company
of mysterious mounted gangsters about
two miles this side of the cloisters palatial
country place of tandy van riper well-
known new york financier according to
trooper slioup he and his companion came
upon the kidnapers riding at almost in-
credible speed drawing their pistols the
state policemen called on the fleeing men to
halt and receiving no reply opened fire
their bullets though fired at almost point-
blank range seemed to take no effect troop-
er shoup declares and the leader of the
criminal band turned about and charged
him and his companion deliberately riding

shoup a shot fired by rosswell directly at
the horse which was about to trample him
took no effect though the pistol was less
than three feet from the beasts breast
shoup is suffering from a broken arm

the head which he alleges was dealt him
when one of the thugs struck him with the

  working on the theory that the kid-

who assumed this fantastic disguise strong
posses of state police are scouring the
neighborhood it is thought the little steb-

family are known to be in very moderate
circumstances and the chances of obtaining
a ransom for the lad are slight

  you see de grandin asked as i
put the paper down with an exclama-
tion of dismay

  no im hanged if i do i shot
back the whole gruesome business
is beyond me is there any connec-
tion between what we saw at the clois-
ters last night and-

  mori dun rat noir is there con-
nection between the serpent and his
venom-the devil and the flames of
hell he cried yes my friend
there is such a connection as will take
all our skill and courage to break i
fear meantime let us hasten let us
fly to the city hospital there is
that there which shall prove more than
a surprize to those vile miscreants
those forsworn servants of the lord
when next we see them mon vieux
  what in the world are you talking
about i demanded whom do
you mean by forsworn servants of
the lord

  ha good friend he returned
his face working with emotion you
will know in due time if what i

suspect is true if not- he

raised his narrow shoulders in a fatal-
istic shrug as he snatched his overcoat
from the hall rack

for upward of half an hour i cooled
my heels in the frosty winter air
while de grandin was closeted in con-
ference with the superintendent of the
city hospital but when he came out
he was wearing such a smile of serene
happiness that i had not the heart to
the chapel of mystic horror



berate him for leaving me outside so
long

  and now kind friend if you will
take me so far as the pro-cathedral i
shall have done the last of my errands
and we may begin our journey to the
cloisters   he announced as he leaped
nimbly into the seat beside me

 the right reverend de motte
gregory suffragan bishop of our dio-
cese was seated at his desk in the
synod house as de grandin and i
were announced and graciously con-
sented to see us at once he had been
a more than ordinarily successful
railway executive a licensed legal
practitioner and a certified public ac-
countant before he assumed the cloth
and ills worldly training had taught
him the value of time and words both
his own and others and rarely did
he waste either

  monsieur v ftveque de grandin
began after he had greeted the gray-
haired cleric with a rigidly formal
european bow   in the garden of
your beautiful church there grows a
bush raised from a sprig of the holy
thorn of glastonbury-the tree which
sprang from the staff of the blessed
joseph of arimathea when he landed
in britain after his voyage and trav-
ail monseigneur we are come to
beg a so little spray of that shrub
from you  

  the bishops eyes opened wide with
surprize but de grandin gave him no
time for reflection

  monseigneur he hurried on it
is not that we wish to adorn our own
gardens nor yet to put it to a shame-
ful commercial use but we need it-
need it most urgently in a matter of
great importance which is to-
ward- 

  leaving his chair he leaned across
the bishops wide rosewood desk and
began whispering rapidly in the
churchmans ear

  the slightly annoyed frown which
mounted to the bishops face as the
little frenchman took the liberty
changed slowly to a look of in-

credulity then to an expression of
amazement you really believe
this he asked at length

 more monseigneur i almost
know it de grandin assured him
earnestly and if i am mistaken as
i hope i am but fear i am not the
holy thorn can do no harm while it

may- he paused waving his

hand in an expressive gesture

  bishop gregory touched one of the
row of call-buttons on his desk you
shall have the cutting from the tree
and be very welcome   he assured my
friend but i join with you in the
hope you are mistaken  

  grand merci monseigneur de
grandin acknowledged with another
bow mordieu but your great heart
is equaled only by your massive intel-
lect  half the elergy would have said
i raved lxad i told them one small
quarter of what i related to you  

  the bishop smiled a little wearily
as he put the sprig of thorn-bush into
de grandins hand   half the elergy
like half the laity know so much that
they know next to nothing he re-
plied

 name of a name de grandin
swore enthusiastically as we turned
toward the cloisters and they say
he is a worldly man pardieu when
will the foolish ones learn that the
man who dedicates worldly wisdom to
heavens service is the most valuable
servant of all



dunroe oshane was attired in a
long brown-linen smock and hard
at work on her drawing when we ar-
rived at the cloisters shortly before
luncheon she seemed none the worse
for her fainting fit of the previous
night and the company were rather
inclined to rally de grandin on the
serious diagnosis he had made before
rushing wildly away to secure medi-
cine for her

  i was amazed at the good-natured
manner in which he took their chaff-


weird tales

ing but a hasty whisper in my ear
explained his self-eontrol apes
anger and fools laughter are alike to
be treated with scorn my friend   he
told me we-you and i-have
work to do here and we must not let
the hum of pestilent gnats drive us
from our purpose  

  bridge and dancing filled the eve-
ning from dinner to midnight and
the party broke up shortly after 
with the understanding that all were
to be ready to attend thanksgiving
services in the near-by parish church
at  oclock next morning

  ts-s-st friend trowbridge do
not disrobe de grandin ordered as
i was about to shed my dinner clothes
and prepare for bed we must be
ready for an instant sortie from now
until cockcrow tomorrow i fear
whats this all about anyhow
i demanded a little irritably as i
dropped on the bed and wrapped my-
self in a blanket theres been
more confounded mystery here than
i ever saw in a harmless old house
what with miss  shane making
funny drawings and throwing faint-
ing-fits and bugles sounding in the

courtyard and-

  ha harmless did you say he
cut in with a grim smile my
friend if this house be harmless then
prussic acid is a healthful drink at-
tend me with care if you please do
you know what this place is
certainly i do i responded with
some heat its an old cypriote

villa brought to america and-

  it was once a chapter house of the
knights of the temple he inter-
rupted shortly and a cyprian chap-
ter house at that does that mean
nothing to you  do you not know the
knights templars my friend   

  i ought to i replied ive been
one for the last fifteen years  

  oh id id he laughed you
will surely slay me my friend you
good kind american gentlemen who
dress in pretty uniforms and carry
swords are no more like the old

knights of the temple of solomon
than are these other good men who
wear red tarbooshes and call them-
selves nobles of the mystic shrine
like the woman-stealing pilgrim-mur-
dering arabs of the desert

  listen the history of the tem-
plars order is a long one but we can
touch its high spots in a few words
formed originally for the purpose of
fighting the infidel in palestine and
aiding poor pilgrims to the holy city
they did yeomen service in the cause
of god but when europe forsook its
crusades and the saracens took jeru-
salem the knights whose work was
done did not disband not they in-
stead they clung to their various
houses in europe and grew fat lazy
and wicked in a life of leisure sup-
ported by the vast wealth they had
amassed from gifts from grateful pil-
grims and the spoils of battle in
 they bought the isle of cyprus
from richaid i of england and es-
tablished several chapter houses there
and it was in those houses that un-
speakable things were done cyprus
is one of the most ancient dwelling-
places of religion and of her illegiti-
mate sister superstition it was there
that the worshipers of cytherea god-
dess of beauty and of love-and other
things less pleasant-had their strong-
hold before the romans held the
lfrd it was drenched with unspeak-
able orgies the very name of the
island has passed into an invidious
adjective in your language-do you
not say a thing is cyprian avhen you
would signify it is lascivious cer-
tainlv  

 but--

  hcdr me he persisted waving
aside my interruption this cyth-
erea was but another form of aphro-
dite and aphrodite in- turn was but
another name for the eastern goddess
astarte or istar you begin to com-
prehend her rites were celebrated
with obseene debaucheries but her
worshipers became such human swine
that only the most revolting inver-
the chapel of mystic horror



sions of natural things would satisfy
them the flaunting and sacrifices of
virtue were not enough they must
needs sacrifice-literally-those thin gs
which impersonated virtue-little in-
nocent children and chaste young
maidens their foul altars must run
red with the blood of innocence
these things were traditions in
cyprus long before the knights
templars took up their abode there
and as one can not sleep among dogs
without acquiring fleas so the knights
grown slothful and lazy with nothing
to do but think up ways of spending
their time and wealth became addicts
to the evils of the earlier heathen
ways of their new home thoughts
are things my friend and the evil
thoughts of the old cyprians took root
and flourished in the brains of those
unfortunate old warrior-monks whose
hands were no longer busy with the
sword and whose lips no longer did
service to the most high god

  you doubt it consider though
philip iv and clement v undoubt-
lessly did jacques de molay to death
for no better reason than that they
might cast lots for his raiment the
fact remains that many of the knights
confessed to dreadful sacrileges com-
mitted in the chapter houses-to
children slain on the altars once dedi-
cated to god to young virgins done
to death amid horrid ceremonies all
in the name of the heathen goddess
cytherea

  this very house wherein we sit
was once the scene of such terrible
things as those about its stones must
linger the presence of the evil men
the renegade priests of god who once
did them these discamate intelli-
gences have lain dormant since the
fourteenth century but for some
reason which we will not now discuss
i believe they have wakened into
physical beings once more it was
their reincarnated spirits we saw flit-
ting past the door last night while
mademoiselle dunroe lay in a trance
it was they who took the little boy

from his grandmothers arms it was
they who slew the brave policeman
it is they who will soon attempt to
perform the hideous inversion of the
mass unless i am mistaken

  see here de grandin i expos-
tulated there have been some deuced-
ly queer goings-on here ill admit
but when you try to tell me that a lot
of old soldier-monks have come to life
again and are traipsing around the
countryside stealing children youre
piling it on a bit too thick you know
now if there were any evidence to
prove that-

 silence his sharp whisper
brought me up with a start as he
rose from his chair and crept cat-
like toward the door opening it a
crack and glancing down the dark-
ened corridor outside then

  come my friend he bade in a
low breath come and see what i be-
hold

  as he swung the door back i glanced
down the long stone-paved gallery
dark as erebus save as cancellated
bars of moonlight shot obliquely down
from the tiny mullioned windows
piercing the dome and made out a
gliding wraithlike figure in trailing
white garments

 dunroe oshane i murmured
dazedly watching the retreating form
slipping soundlessly down the dark
balcony the wavering light of the
candle she bore in her upraised hand
cast gigantic shadows against the
carved balustrade and the sculptured
uprights of the interlaced arches
supporting the gallery above and
hobgoblin shades seemed to march
along beside her like an escort of un-
clean genii from the legions of eblis
i watched open-mouthed with amaze-
ment as she slipped down the passage
her feet obscured in a haze of trail-
ing draperies treading noiselessly her
free hand stretched outward toward
the balcony rail next moment the
gallery was deserted abruptly as a
motion picture fades from the screen
when the projecting light winks out


weird tales

dunroe shane and her flickering
rushlight vanished from our sight

  quick friend trowbridge the
frenchman whispered after her-it
was through that further door she
went  

  quietly as possible we ran down the
gallery paused before a high pointed-
topped door and wrenched at its
wrought-iron handle the stout oak-
en panels held firm for the door wras
latched on the farther side

  ten thousand little red devils
de grandin cried in vexation we
are stalemated

  for a moment i thought he would
hurl himself against the four-inch
planks of the door in impotent firry
but he collected himself with an ef-
fort and drawing a flashlight from
his jacket pocket handed it to me with
the command hold the light steady
on the keyhole my friend   the next
instant he sank to his knees produced
two short lengths of thin steel wire
and began methodically picking the
lock

  iia he exclaimed as he rose and
dusted the knees of his trousers
those old ones built for strength
friend trowbridge but they knew
little of subtlety little did that
ancient locksmith dream his handi-
work would one day meet with jules
de grandin

  the unbarred door swung inward
beneath his touch and we stepped
across the stone sill of a vast
dungeon-dark apartment

  mademoiselle he called softly

	 mademoiselle dunroe - are you
here   

  he shot the searching beam of his
flashlight hither and yon about the
big room disclosing high walls of
heavy carved oak massive pieces of
mediaeval furniture-a great canopy-
bed several cathedral chairs and one
or two massive iron-bound chests-
but found no living thing

  mordieu but this-is strange he
muttered sinking to his knees to flash

his light beneath the high-carved bed
 into this room she did most certain-
ly come but a few little minutes ago
gliding like a spirit he insisted
and nowr pouf out of this same room
she docs vanish like a ghost cest
tres strange

  though somewhat larger the room
was similar to most other bedchambers
in the house paneled with rather
crudely carved age-blackened wood
for the entire height of its walls
ceiled with great beams which still
bore the marks of the adz and floored
with octagonal marble tiles of alter-
nate black and white we went over
every inch of it searching for some
secret exit for save the one by which
we had entered there was no door in
the place and the two great windows
were of crude semi-transparent glass
let into metal frames securely cement-
ed to the surrounding stones plainly
nobody had left the room that way

  at the farther end of the apart-
ment stood a tall wardrobe elaborate-
ly decorated with carved scenes of
chase and battle opening one of the
double doors letting into the press
de grandin inspected the interior
which like the outside was carved in
every available place um he
commented surveying the walls care-
fully under his flashlight it may
be that this is but the anteroom to
-ha

  he broke off pointing dramatically
to a carved group in the center of one
of the back panels it represented a
procession of hunters returning from
their sport deer boar and other ani-
mals laslied to long poles which the
huntsmen bore shoulder-high the men
were filing through the arched en-
trance to a castle the great doors of
which swung back to receive them
one of the door-leaves apparently
had warped loose from the body of
the plank from wdiich it was carved
for it swung loose a full quarter-inch

  cest tres adroit nest-ce-pas
my companion asked with a delight-
the chapel of mystic horror



eel grin had i not seen such things
before it might have imposed on me
as it is-

  reaching forward he gave the
loosened door a sharp quick push
and the entire back of the wardrobe
slipped upward like a sliding win do w-
sash revealing a narrow opening

  and what have we here de
grandin asked playing his spotlight
through the secret doorway

  straight ahead for three or four
feet ran a flagstone sill worn smooth
in the center as though with the shuf-
fling tread of many feet beyond that
began a flight of narrow stone stairs
which spiraled steeply down a shaft
like the flue of a monster chimney

  de grandin turned to me and his
little heart-shaped face was graver
than  had ever seen it though his
tightly waxed mustache twitched and
quivered at the points like the whis-
kers of an irritable tom-cat his eyes
were without the customary glitter
which illuminated them when he was
excited trowbridge dear kind
friend lie said in a voice so low and
hoarse i could scarcely make out his
words we have faced many perils
together-perils of spirit and perils
of flesh-and always we have tri-
umphed this time we may not if
i do not mistake rightly there lies
below these steps an evil more ancient
and potent than any we have hitherto
met i have armed us against it with
the weapons of religion and of sci-
ence but-i do not know that they
will avail say then will you turn
back now and go to your bed  i shall
think no less of you for no man
should be compelled to face this thing
unknowingly and there is now no
time to explain if i survive i shall
return and tell you all if i come
not back with daylight know that i
have perished in my failure and think
kindly of me as one who loved you
deeply will you not now say adieu
old friend he extended his hand
and though it was steady at the wrist
i saw the long smooth-jointed fingers

were trembling with suppressed ner-
vousness

  i will not i returned hotly
stung to the quick by his suggestion
i dont know whats down tfiere
but if you go i go t-oo  

  nom de dieu de nom de dieu de
nom de dieu he swore exultantly
and before i realized what he was
about he had flung his arms about my
neck and kissed me on both cheeks
onward then brave comrade he
cried this night we fight such a
fight as has not been waged since the
sainted george slew the monster  



d ound and round a steadily des-
iv cending spiral while i counted a
hundred and seventy steps we went
going deeper and deeper through inky
blackness finally when i had begun
to grow giddy with the endless cork-
screw turns we arrived at a steeply
sloping tunnel floored with smooth
black-and-white tiles down this we
hastened the pitch of the floor adding
to our speed until we had traversed
a distance of perhaps a hundred feet
then for a similar length we trod a
level path and at last began an ascent
as steep as the first decline had been

  careful-cautiously my friend
the frenchman warned in a whisper
as the darting beam of his searchlight
disclosed a heavy iron-bound door be-
fore us

  pausing a moment while he fum-
bled in the pocket of his jacket my
companion strode toward the barrier
and laid his left hand on its heavy
wrought-iron latch

  the portal swung back almost as he
touched it and

  qui va la challenged a voice
from the darkness

  de grandin threw the ray of his
torch across the doorway disclosing a
tall spare form in gleaming black
plate-armor over which was drawn the
brown-serge habit of a monk the
sentry wore his hair in a sort of bob


weird tales

approximating the haircut affected by
children today and on his sallow im-
mature face sprouted the rudiments
of a straggling beard it was a youth-
ful face and a weak one which de
grandins light disclosed but the face
of a youth already well schooled in
viciousness-such a face as i had seen
on juvenile gang-recruits during a
brief term of duty as relief to the
physician of our city prison

   qui vive the fellow called
doubtfully in a rather high effemi-
nate voice laying a hand on the hilt of
a heavy broadsword dangling from
the wide brass-studded baldric looped
over his cassock

  those on the service of the most
high god petit bete returned de
grandin drawing something a
pronged sprig of wood i thought
from his jacket pocket and thrusting
it toward the warders face

  ohe cried the other sharply
shrinking back as though from con-
tact with a white-hot iron touch
me not good messires i pray-i-

  ha-so de grandin gritted be-
tween his teeth and drew the
branched stick downward across the
sentrys face

  astonishingly the youth seemed to
shrink and shrivel in upon himself
trembling as though with an ague he
bent forward buckled at the knees
fell toavard the floor and-was gone
sword armor cassock and the man
who wore them dwindled to nothing-
ness before our sight like a fleck of
carbon dioxide snow melting away
and leaving neither smudge of damp-
ness nor grain of residue in the place
avhere it had been

  a hundred feet or so farther on
our way avas barred by another door
wider higher and heavier than the
first while no tiler guarded it it
was so firmly locked that all our ef-
forts were powerless to budge it

  friend trowbridge de grandin
announced it seems ave shall have to
pick this lock even as we did the
other do you keep watch through

yonder grille while i make the avay
open for us   reaching up he moated
aside a shutter covering a barred
peep-hole in the doors thick panels
then dropping to his knees dreav
forth his wires and began avorking at
the lock aarhieh held the barrier in
place

  gazing through the tiny avicket i
beheld a chapel-like room of circular
formation cunningly floored avith
slabs of polished yelloav stone inlaid
with occasional plaques of purple so
that the pavement appeared splashed
with coagulated blood

  by the gloav of a wavering vigil
lamp and the flicker of several gut-
tering ecclesiastical candles i saw the
place was roofed with a vaulted ceil-
ing supported by a number of con-
aerging arches and the pier of each
arch was supported by the carved im-
age of a huge human foot avhich rested
on the crown of a hideous half-human
head crushing it downward and caus-
ing it to grimace hellishly with min-
gled pain and fury

  beyond the yelloav sanctuary lamp
loomed the altar approached by three
ioav steps and on it avas a tall wooden
crucifix from avhich the corpus had
leen stripped and to which had been
nailed in obscure caricature a huge
black bat the staples fastening the
poor beast to the cross must have hurt
unmercifully for it strove hysteri-
cally to free itself fluttering its pin-
ioned avings and avhimpering and gib-
bering piteously

  almost sickened at the sight i de-
scribed the scene to de grandin as he
worked at the lock speaking in a
muted avhisper for though there was
no sign of living thing save the tor-
tured bat i felt instinctively that
there were listening ears coneealedin
the darkness beyond the violated
altar

  good-ires bon he grunted as
he hastened avith his task it may
be ave are yet in time good friend
even as he spoke there came a sharp
click and the doors heaay bolts
the chapel of mystic horror



slipped back under the pressure of his
improvised picklock

  slowly inch by careful inch lest
the squeak of an unoiled hinge betray
us we forced the great door back

  but even as we did so there came
from the rear of the circular chamber
the subdued measures of a softly in-
toned gregorian chant and some-
thing white moved forward through
the shadows

  it was a man arrayed in blaek-steel
armor over which was drawn a white
surtout emblazoned with a reversed
passion cross and in his hands he
bore a wide-mouthed brazen bowl like
an alms-basin in the tray rested a
wicked-looking curve-bladed knife

  with a mocking genuflection to the
altar he strode up the steps and
placed his burden on the second
tread then with a coarse guffaw he
spat upon the pinioned bat and
backed downward taking station to
the left of the sanctuary and looking
expectantly over his shoulder into the
shadows beyond

  as at a signal a double file of ar-
mored men came marching out of the
gloom ranged themselves in two
ranks one to right one to left of the
altar and whipped their long swords
from their sheaths clashing them to-
gether tip to tip forming an arcade
of flashing steel between them

  so softly that i felt rather than
heard him de grandin sighed in sup-
pressed fury as blade met blade and
two more men-at-arms each bearing a
smoking censer strode forward be-
neath the roof of steel the perfume
of the incense was strong acrid
sweet yet bitterly revolting at the
same time and it mounted to our
brains like the fumes of some accursed
oriental drug but even as we
sniffed its seductive scent our eyes
widened at sight of the form which
paced slowly behind the mailed aco-
lytes

  ceremoniously step by pausing
step she came like a bride marching
under the arbor of uplifted swords at

a military wedding and my eyes
fairly ached at the beauty of her
milk-white lissom and pliant as a
peeled willow wand clad only in the
jeweled loveliness of her own pearly
whiteness long bronze hair sweeping
in a cloven tide from her pale brow
and cataracting over her tapering
shoulders came dunroe shane
her eyes were closed as though in
sleep and on her red full lips lay
the yearning half-smile of the bride
who ascends the aisle to meet her
bridegroom or the novice who mounts
the altar steps to make her full pro-
fession and as she advanced her
supple long-fingered hands waved
slowly to and fro weaving fantastic
arabesques in the air like the sinuous
patterns woven out of nothingness by
eastern fakirs when they would lay
a charm on their beholders

  hail cytherea queen and priest-
ess and goddess hail she who con-
fers life and being on her serv-
ants came the full-throated saluta-
tion of the double row of armored
men as they clashed their blades to-
gether in martial salute then dropped
to one knee in greeting and adoration

  for a moment the undraped priest-
ess paused below the altar stairs
then as though forced downward by
invincible pressure she dropped and
we heard the smaeking impact of soft
white flesh against the stone floor as
she flung herself prostrate and beat
her brow and hands against the floor
in utter self-abasement before the
marble altar and its defiled calvary

  is all prepared the question
rang out sonorously as a cowled fig-
ure advanced from the shadows and
strode with a swaggering step to the
altar

  all is prepared the congrega-
tion answered with one voice

    then bring the paschal lamb even
the lamb without fleece the deep-
voiced eommand somehow sent shiv-
ers of horror racing down my spine

  tavo armored votaries slipped
quietly aavay returning in an instant


weird tales

with the struggling body of a little
boy between them-a chubby little
baby boy naked as when his mother
first saw him who fought and kicked
and offered such resistance as his
puny strength allowed while he called
aloud to mamma and grandma
to save him from his captors

  down against the altar steps the
butchers flung the little man then
one took his chubby dimpled hands
in relentless grip while the other drew
backward at his ankles suspending
him above the wide-mouthed brazen
bowl reposing on the second step

  take up the knife priestess and
queen of goodly salamis the hood-
ed master of ceremonies commanded
take up the sacrificial knife that
the red blood may flow to our god-
dess and we hold high wassail in her
honor  er land and sea o er burn-
ing desert and heaving billow have we

journeyed- 

     villains-assassins-renegades  
jules de grandin bounded from his
station in the shadow like a frenzied
cat springing to the attack and faced
them iij snarling defiance by the
blood of all the blessed martyrs you
have journeyed altogether too far
from hell your home

  ha interlopers rasped the
hooded man so be it three
hearts shall smoke upon our altar in-
stead of one 

  parbleu nothing shall smoke but
the fires of your endless torture as
your foul carcasses burn ceaselessly
in hell de grandin returned leap-
ing forward and drawing out the
forked stick with which he had struck
down the porter at the outer gate

  a burst of contemptuous laughter
greeted him thinkest thou to
overcome me with such a toy the
cowled one asked between shouts
my warder at the gate succumbed
to your charms-he was a poor weak-
ling unschooled in the service of the
olden ones him you have passed
but not me now die  

  from beneath his cassock he

snatched a long two-handed sword
whirled its blade aloft in a triple
flourish and struck directly at de
grandins head

  almost by a miracle it seemed the
frenchman avoided the blow dropped
his useless sprig of thornwood and
snatched a tiny quill-like object from
his pocket dodging the devastating
thrusts of the enemy with the nimble-
ness of a panther de grandin toyed
an instant with the capsule in his
hand unscrewed the cap from its end
and suddenly changing his tactics ad-
vanced directly on his foe

  ila monsieur from the fires here
is fire you know not of  he shouted
thrusting forward the queer-looking
rod and advancing fearlessly within
reach of the others flashing sword

  i stared in open-mouthed amaze-
ment poised for another slashing-
blow with his great sword the armed
man wavered momentarily while an
expression of astonishment bewilder-
ment finally craven fear overspread
his lean predatory features lower-
ing his sword he thrust feebly with
the point but there was no force be-
hind the stab the deadly steel seemed
to drop of its own weight in his hands
and fell with a jangling clatter to
the floor before he could drive
it into the little frenchmans breast

  the hooded man seemed growing
thinner his tall spare form which
had bulked a full head taller than de
grandin a moment before seemed
losing substance-growing gradually
transparent like an early-morning
fog slowly dissolving before the
strengthening rays of the rising sun
behind him through him i could
dimly espy the outlines of the violated
altar and the prostrate woman before
its steps now the objects in the
background became plainer and plain-
er the figure of the armored man
was no longer a thing of flesh and
blood and cold steel overspread with a
monks habit but an unsubstantial
phantom like an oddly shaped cloud
it was composed of trailing rolling
the chapel of mystic horror



clouds of luminous vapor which grad-
ually disintegrated into strands and
floating webs of phosphorescence and
these in turn gave way to scores of
little nebulae of light which glowed
like cigarette-ends of intense blue
radiance then where the nebulae
had been were only dancing shifting
specks of bright blue fire finally noth-
ing but a few pin-points of light then
-nothing

  like shadows thrown by forest
trees when the moon is at her zenith
the double row of men-at-arms stood
at ease while de grandin battled with
their champion now their leader
gone they turned with one accord and
scuttled in panic flight toward the
rearward shadows but jules de gran-
din was after them like a hawk harry-
ing a flight of sparrows 

  ha messieurs les eenegats he
called mockingly pressing closer and
closer you who steal away helpless
little boy-babics from the arms of
their g-randmeres and then would
sacrifice them on your altar do you
like the feast jules de grandin
brings you who would make was-
sail with the blood of babes-drink
the draft i have prepared fools
mockers at god where now is your
deity call on her-call on lyth-
erea pardieu i fear her not neither
iier nor the forsworn servants of the
lord avho kiss her feet in homage

  as it was with the master so it
was with the underlings closer and
closer de grandin pressed against the
struggling mass of demoralized men
and their very bodies seemed to melt
before his advance like ice when
pressed upon by red-hot iron one
moment they milled and struggled
shrieking and mouthing obscene
prayers for aid to some unelean deity
the next they were dissolved into
nebulous vapor drifting aimlessly a
moment in the still air of the chapel
then swept away to nothingness

  and so my friend that is done
announced de grandin matter-of-
factly as he might have mentioned the

ending of a meal there crouches
mademoiselle oshane friend trow-
bridge  come let us seek her clothes-
they should be somewhere here 

  behind the altar we found dun-
roes nightrobe and negligee lying in
a ring just as she had shrugged out
of them before taking up her march
between the upraised swords gently
as a nurse attending a babe the little
frenchman raised the swooning girl
from her groveling posture before the
altar draped her robes about her and
took her in his arms

  a availing cry rising gradually to
an incensed roar echoed and rever-
berated through the vaulted chamber
and de grandin thrust the uncon-
scious girl into my hands mon
dieu he exclaimed with a serio-
comic expression of dismay i did
forget le petit g argon

  crouched as close to the wall as he
could get ave found the little lad
tears of surprizing size streaming
doavn his fat cheeks as his little mouth
opened wide and emitted wail after
broken-hearted avail hold my
little cabbage mon brave soldat de
grandin soothed him stretehing out
his hands to the aveeping youngster
come avith me come we shall
clothe you warmly against the cold
and pop you into a bed of feathers
and tomorrow morning ere we return
you to your mothers arms we shall
fill your little belly to the bursting-
point with bonbons-may the devil
roast me on a spit if ave do not so 

tanting under my burden for she
- was no light aveight i bore dunroe
oshane up the long tortuous flight
of steps doavn which de grandin and
i had come a short half-hour before
pausing every now and again to re-
gain my breath

  morphine is indicated here if i
do not mistake de grandin re-
marked as we laid the girl on her bed
and dreav the covers up about her
chin

 but we havent any- i be-


weird tales

gan only to be checked by his grin

  oh but we have he contradict-
ed i foresaw something like this
was likely to come about and ab-
stracted a quantity of the drug to-
gether with a syringe from your sur-
gery before we left home  

  when we had administered the
narcotic we set out for our own cham-
ber the little boy warmly bundled
in blankets held tightly in de gran-
din s arms at a nod from the
frenchman we paused at dunroes
studio lighted several candles and in-
spected her work fairly spread upon
her drawing-board was a pretty little
scene-a dimpled little boy crowing
and smiling in his mothers lap a
proud and happy father leaning over
them and in the foreground a group
of rough bucolics kneeling in smiling
adoration why the influence
whatever it was seems to have left
her before we went down those secret
stairs i exclaimed looking admir-
ingly at the drawing

    do you say so   de grandin
asked in an odd voice as he bent closer
to inspect the picture look here
if you please my friend

  bringing my eyes within a few
inches of the board on which the
christmas scene was sketched i saw
so faint it was hardly to be found
unless the beholder looked for it
another picture lightly sketched in
jerky uneven lines depicting another
scene-a vaulted chapel with walls
lined by armed men two of whom
held a childs body horizontally be-
fore the altar while a woman clothed
only in her long trailing hair
plunged a wicked curve-bladed knife
into the little ones body piercing the
heart and the blood dripped into a
wide-mouthed brazen bowl beneath

  good lord i exclaimed start-
ing back in horror

  precisely agreed jules de gran-
din the good lord inspired talent
in the poor girls hand but the powers
of darkness dictated that sketch per-
haps-i can not say for sure-she

drew both the pictures we see here
and the good one was formexly the
faint one but when i overcame the
wicked ones the wicked scene faded
to insignificance and the pleasing one
became predominant it is possible
and-iom dun nom

 what now i demanded as he
turned a conscience-smitten face to-
ward me and thrust the sleeping child
into my arms

  la chaiwe-souris-the bat he
exclaimed i did forget the poor
ones sufferings in the stress of great-
er things take the little man to our
room and soothe him my friend me
i go down those ten-thousand-times-
damned stairs to that never-enough-
to-be-cursed chapel and put the poor
brute out of its misery  

  you mean youre actually going
into that horrible place again   i de-
manded incredulously

  eh bien why not he asked
  why - those terrible men -

those- i began but he stopped

me with praised hand

  my friend he asked as he ex-
tracted a cigarette from his dressing-
gown pocket and lighted it noncha-
lantly have you not yet learned that
when jules de grandin kills a thing
-be it man or be it devil-it is dead 
there is nothing there which could
harm a new-born fly i do solemnly
assure you



jules de grandin poured out a
couple of tablespoonfuls of bran-
dy into a wide-mouthed glass and
passed the goblet under his nose
sniffing appreciatively at the liquors
rich bouquet not at all cher ami
he denied with a wave of his slender
womanish hand from the first i
did suspect there was something not
altogether right about that house

to begin you will recall that on
the night monsieur van riper took
us from the station he told us his
progenitor had imported the house

in a momeat he came hurtling out again as though
thrown

the brandsted institute ex-
perts thought the fossilized
thigh-bone and skull to be
the remains of some enormous hith-
erto unknown ape that had lived in
the time of the dinosaur when life
was cast in a heroic mold the pro-
fessors of ambridge pointed out the
high dome of the cranium and the
unmistakably human tooth and in-
sisted that the creature had been a
full-fledged man possessed of nearly
as muoh intelligence as the lower
orders of present-day savages the
controversy that followed filled all
the sunday supplements and nearly
caused some dislocations in the scien-
tific world

in only one point were the debat-
ers agreed this was-the size in-

tricate calculations based on micro-
scopic examination of the fossil frag-
ments revealed that the creature
whether man or ape had stood near-
ly eleven feet high also the struc-
ture of the thigh-bone indicated im-
mense weight carried and enormous
muscular activity

  and so on the combined profes-
sorial canvas there grew into being
a shadowy picture of something that
had once walked on two legs like a
man that was stronger than any ten
men as we know them today and
that weighed between eight hundred
and eight hundred and fifty pounds

  shortly after the precious frag-
ments had been unearthed dr
wayne early took a train from the
city and went to the scene of the

                                  


weird tales

discovery dr early was not pre-
cisely a fossil expert his knowledge
of that fascinating subject was shal-
low indeed compared to the knowl-
edge of the brandsted and ambridge
authorities but he had an enthusi-
asm for poking about with a geolo-
gists hammer he needed a short
vacation anyway and the locality
sounded interesting the skull and
thigh-bone were under glass at the
brandsted institute of course so
there was nothing left to see at the
original pit unless-and at the
thought he was coldly excited-a pa-
tient searcher might unearth more
fragments   

  the owner of the land a prosper-
ous man who had several farm hold-
ings around the suddenly famous
village greeted the doctor with easy
hospitality and friendly respect at
his guests persistent failure to find
more fossils he wagged his head
sympathetically and when he ad-
vanced his unfortunate suggestion it
may have been that in addition to
hope of financial profit for himself
he honestly thought he might be
making up for the doctors disap-
pointment in past mysteries by of-
fering him one engendered in the
present

  anyway he began to tell him of
the adjoining farm which he owned
and was unable either to sell or lease
because of the reputation of the
farmhouse and the doctor a little
put out at his failure to find more
bones though he had been reason-
ably sure before he started that noth-
ing would have been overlooked by
the brandsted men answered him
rather bruskly

  but there really is something
wrong with the house the man in-
sisted

  the doctor smiled bleakly of
course theres something wrong
with all haunted houses-in peoples
minds at least

  but not in the mind of science

eh science doesnt approve of

ghosts

  there are no ghosts known to
science  

  nevertheless theres something
in that old house and i thought
you might enjoy a few hours of
scientific investigating  

  the doctor twiddled his fingers
remembered the kindness his host
had shown him and finally spoke
more patiently than he had at first
intended what do you think in-
habits the place-the usual spirit of
someone murdered there in the past
i suppose

  no nothing ordinary like that
its  human spirit at least not a
common one its something enor-
mous something no one has run up
against before that ive ever heard
of

  have you seen it

  no-but ive felt it

 and what was the experience
like prodded the doctor after a
long pause which the other seemed
reluctant to break

  it was like being mauled by a
giants hand whatever thing lives
there is enormous i tell you

  when i first came here with a
little money to invest and bought
this land i noticed the farm next
door it was abandoned the only
place around here that wasnt being
worked so i inquired at the bank
and found it was for sale the price
was so low that i got curious and
after i pressed him to it the cashier
explained that the house was sup-
posed to be haunted and that the
owner had left the country after
placing it in the banks hands to sell
at a low figure of course i bought
it the land was good and i didnt
take much stock in fairy-stories
where dollars and cents were con-
cerned

  afterward i walked over to in-
spect my new property it was in
broad daylight shortly after noon
without thinking much about the
beyond power of man



story of the cashier i climbed the
fence and jumped from the top rail
to the ground the moment my feet
hit the turf i was knocked flat  

  knocked you must have tripped
over something suggested the doc-
tor

  thats possible in fact thats
what i told myself at the time al-
though my chest hurt as though it
had been hit with a club anyway
i walked on toward the house as i
went i thought i felt a faint stir of
air as though somebody had brushed
rapidly past me intent on getting
into the place before i did however
that may have been the wind too
faint to wave the grass but strong
enough to be felt

 there was one window open-
the rest were closed with shutters-
and i walked toward this thinking
to enter the house that way i never
followed that plan just as i reached
the window i was knocked down
again there avas no mistake about
this no possible excuse i was
bowled over by a tangible force as
though hit by an immense hand
opened flat for a time i lost con-
sciousness when i came to i found
myself outside the fence avith my
right shoulder dislocated i dont
knoav whether this was from the fall
-i must have been thrown bodily
over the top rail-or avhether the
same hand that knocked me doavn
wrenched my shoulder afterward

  i had my shoulder set and went
to see the cashier and get the rest
of the story about my new house-
the story i hadnt bothered to listen
to before   

  up until a feav years before i
bought it the cashier knew nothing
definite except that it had been va-
cant beyond the memory of the old-
est resident then it had been pur-
chased by a city man who came
doavn for a visit and avas attracted
by the price he sent in to the city
for workmen-no one in the village
would go near the place-and gave

orders to tear the old building doavn
when they arrived ignorant of the
whole affair they avent carelessly in
and made ready for their wrecking
job the foreman knocked one of
the shutters in and climbed through
the avindoav

  in an instant he came hurtling
out again as though he had been
thrown the clothes were torn
nearly off his body and he was black
and blue from head to foot hetvas
so scared he couldnt say a word
just hurdled the fence and ran to-
avard the raihvay station avith his
men following more slowly but de-
termined never to touch the place
again and next day the oavner put
the property in the banks hands for
sale and went home

  the doctor lit a cigarette   prob-
ably some tramps have squatted
there and mean to frighten away
eareryone so theyll have a secure
home thats usually the way these
old houses are haunted

  perhaps shrugged his host
but you dont think so the
doctor laughed at his dubious tone
of voice

  no i dont i think its some-
thing more dangerous than any

tramp i think- for a moment

he hesitated as though he avere al-
most ashamed to say what he had in
mind then i think those old bones
the scientific men found on my prop-
erty here have something to do avith
it that big ape or missing link or
whatever it avas 

  the doctor stared well youre
making it good avhile you re at it 
he exclaimed a ghost half a mil-
lion years old really  

  it might be that and it might
not be was the stubborn answer
anyavay whatever is there is big-
ger than any man ever was

  with a yaavn the doctor hinted
that he was ready for bed very
interesting he said indifferently

  then vou dont care to investi-
gate


weird tales

  i think not the place is old
and probably damp and i dont feel
like risking a cold for so slight a
reason 

  the other looked specnlatively at
him its not so slight to me he
said im losing good money by
not being able to rent or sell and
id be willing to pay five hundred
dollars cash to anyone who can lay
my ghost but come to think of it
i dont believe youd be the right
one to tackle the job anyway youre
not very big and youre kind of
sensitive and high-strung   
the doctor was not so wealthy that
he could afford to refuse five hun-
dred dollars avithout thinking twice
about it also the reference to his
stature might have stung no small
man likes to be reminded of his size
so ho lost some of his indifference

  what would be necessary to con-
vince the country that the place isnt
haunted he asked

  oh spend a night there or a
day if you like no come to think
of it a night would be better
and i presume you want me to
enter just at midnight and carry
only a candle and all the rest of it
oh no go in at any time you
please and carry all the light you
can take theres no gas or electric-
ity there of course and id suggest
a lantern and my electric flashlight
a candle too no use running fool-
ish risks

  and for one night youll pay me
five hundred dollars

with the greatest of pleasure
for an instant the doctor lost some
of his chill air of professionalism and
almost grinned ill go tonight
he said now

  right agreed his host and the
bargain was sealed

  the rest of the story-some of it
almost too incoherent to be rendered
intelligible-was penned by the doc-
tors own hand the manuscript
was found in the big old tile stove
that had occupied a corner of the

ancient parlor these papers were
so charred that extreme care had to
be exercised in handling them but
they were found to be complete down
to the last word the doctor had writ-
ten how they came to be in the
stove is only one of the minor mys-
teiies of the case

  here is the doctors story

tmis is certainly a brainless un-
xlertaking i am a scientist with
acknowledged successes to my credit
in the fields of medicine biology and
psychology i am forty-two years
old and supposedly possessed of ma-
ture judgment i should know bet-
ter yet here i sit at  oclock at
night perched uncomfortably on a
rickety old stool writing on a bat-
tered table with only the light from
a very shaky and infirm lantern it
is ridiculous t only hope my friends
never hear of it

  the whole reason for my being
here of course is financial fancy
a man paying five hundred dollars
for one night spent in a vacant
house only a fool or a millionaire
would overlook a proposition like
that the simple-mindedness of the
fellow ghosts superstition haunt-
ed houses   

  i must confess that this particular
haunted house looks more convincing
than most it is old and very large
built i think by one of the first
plantation kings the thick walls
are of red brick that is porous and
crumbling the roof still fairly
sound has turned a dirty gray it
looks like something dead lying
about in the open sunlight almost
indecent a very little work would
make the place habitable though

  an old split-rail fence surrounds
the house and a plot several acres in
extent i think this was once a
lawn but it is now full of weeds and
underbrush the doors and win-
dows are nothing but holes in the
thick walls at some time or other
these were shut up with heavy wood-
beyond power of man



en slabs pounded into the brick
framework so solidly as to be almost
as immovable as the walls them-
selves only one window was open
the one i entered through here
the shutter had been knocked in-
by the former owner i think my
friend said if it was as solidly fit-
ted as the other slabs the man must
have used a battering-ram

  the house is depressing enough
certainly but for a sane and pros-
perous fellow to offer five hundred
dollars to be convinced that it isnt
haunted however that is his af-
fair in the meantime i have noth-
ing to do but sit here in his ridicu-
lous house and scribble anything that
comes to my mind like a silly school-
boy trying to pass the time away as
painlessly as possible

  about an hour has passed since i
swung myself into the open window
landing in this room where i now am
the first thing i did was to search
the place from top to bottom so
many of these houses are haunted
by nothing more supernatural than
tramps and i dont want to be
clubbed by any surprized knights of
the road but i need not have wor-
ried about that the dust would
keep a record of any occupancy and
the dust shows no footprints it does
not cover the floor in an even layer
however i suppose the wind coming
through the one open window has
stirred it up now and then also
there are practically no cobwebs in the
place either the walls- are too damp
to tempt the spiders or my friends
ghost is a clean-minded giant and
keeps them swept out or possibly he
is so tall that his head scrapes them
off the ceilings

  what rot the spirit of some big
two-legged thing that died and left
it-s bones to be dug up hundreds of
thousands of years later a sort of
fossil ghost i guess one would call it
what a riot that would cause at
brandsted institute here gentle-
men  is a little gift for you in re-

moving the thigh-bone and skull you
only took a part of the beast in the
interest of science i am now pleased
to present to you the creatures
spirit

  at the end of my little exploration
tour i dragged this stool up from the
cellar and placed it in front of this
equally ancient table i set the lan-
tern where it would give the most
light and prepared to make myself
as comfortable as possible for what
promises to be a most uncomfortable
night then i started to put into use
a fountain pen and a pad of paper i
brought along to amuse myself with
at different hours of the night i will
record my sensations if any later
when ive tired of writing i shall
read a book of fiction i have with me

  i should have brought along a pot
of coffee i am feeling rather sleepy
and i dont want to go to sleep id
be cramped into knots when i woke
and besides if our burly spirit is
obliging enough to give a demonstra-
tion of peevishness at having his
castle invaded i want to be awake to
observe it what nonsense   

first exciting event of the evening
just happened one leg of the old
stool i was sitting on came out and
i fell over backward in my effort to
save myself from falling i knocked
the lantern off the table result one
broken glass chimney and about a
pint of kerosene spilled out on the
floor then when i lit it again it
smoked unbearably without the glass
to protect the flame and when i
tried to regulate the wick i turned
it the wrong way im afraid im not
much of an expert with lanterns
however i have the candle and my
friends flashlight - which would
probably work if it had a new bat-
tery

  i suppose my uneasy land-owner
if he were here would insist that the
little episode was a ghostly manifesta-
tion he would say that a giants
hand had wrenched the leg from the


weird tales

stool thats the ridiculous part of
these old wives tales-natural hap-
penings are twisted into meaning
supernatural things the stool is old
and rotten i shifted my weight on it
and the leg came out iiow simple

  it is very uncomfortable in here
although i feel as though i must suf-
focate in the stagnant air there is a
chill that comes no doubt from the
moisture-soaked old walls the fumes
of the spilled kerosene are annoying
too but i dont feel like moving into
another room i would rather not
get too far away from that open win-
dow-it is the only ventilation the
house has

  i said awhile ago that my search
through the dark old building had
revealed  sign of life i was wrong
there is life here-a good deal of
it growing familiar with my pres-
ence several rats have made an ap-
pearance from holes in the floor
boarding they are sleek and con-
tented-looking one big fellow is
especially bold he looks at me with
the impudence of a street urchin
seems disposed to come closer and in-
vestigate ah the kerosene around
my chair stopped him its just as
well a rats bite can be painful
and these creatures seem as unafraid
of me as though theyd never seen a
human before one more reason for
not moving though the fumes of the
spilled oil are most uncomfortable
i feel half stupefied from them

  i can understand a womans fear
of mice and rats theres something
very disquieting and evil-appearing
about them i feel uneasy myself at
watching these rodents particularly
because-of a sudden-they dont
seem to be acting normally they act
like the laboratory rats when someone
comes to take them to the dissecting-
room-scenting danger at bay ready
to sink their teeth into the nearest
hand the big rat is the most excited
of all   

  now that is odd that is very odd
-what i just saw the big rat be-

gan to behave more strangely than
ever it stopped quivered and then
began to run around in circles the
circles got smaller and smaller until
the little animal seemed to spin in its
tracks then it stopped fell over-
and lay stone-dead i know it is
dead because i just got up and prod-
ded it with my foot all i can think
is that it was out foraging and ate
something poisoned but this doesnt
seem logical either all the other
rats have disappeared leaving the
stiff little body on the floor near my
table   

  another flurry to while away the
long night as i was looking at the
dead rat the candle went out it was
extinguished as suddenly as though
a hand had closed over it there was
no breeze from the open window no
air is stirring in the room nothing
it just-went out peculiar   

  for some little time i have seemed
to hear footsteps like someone walk-
ing about the house now loud and
again faint these have been muffled
more felt than heard as though some
heavy person were moving from room
to room it is more a succession of
faint tremors than anything else
probably some earth disturbances far
down under the surface baby earth-
quakes wish i had a seismograph
here but it really did sound like a
giant striding through the house of
course it is all imagination   

  during the last few moments there
has been no noise no more of the il-
lusion of footsteps the cellar stairs
creaked as though under a great
weight and then there was silence
if i only had some light more certain
than a candle i would go down to
the cellar just to set my mind at rest
that there is nothing there imagina-
tion should not be encouraged too
much when one is alone at night in a
deserted house it doesnt matter
how enlightened a man may be there
is some age-old sense of fear that
needs only such an opportunity to
swamp intelligence but what if i
beyond power of man



did go down there i would see
nothing of course when i heard the
footsteps or what sounded like foot-
steps right in this room-i could see
nothing just before the candle went
out just before i relighted it i could
see nothing there is nothing to see
nothing to see of course   

  the fakit tremors have started
again in regular succession it is odd
how much they sound like the foot-
falls of some incredibly heavy per-
son again the cellar stairs creak as
though carrying a weight that is more
than they were designed to hold
crack creak crack like marching
bare feet now the tremors are
strongest right in the room they
sound   

  my friend the land-owner has
just played a joke on me at least
i suppose he thinks it is a joke with-
out warning he jammed the heavy
shutters in place oyer the window i
came through the only opening in
the whole house he jammed it sol-
idly too i could hear the edges
splinter as they ground against the
thick walls of the embrasure hardly
a pleasant trick to play on a man
and it doesnt rieem to bear out his
statement that he is afraid to enter
the grounds ho must have sneaked
up very cautiously to the outside of
the window or i would have heard
him is this whole thing a sort of
practical joke he has engineered on
me but the offer of five hundred
dollars-that wasnt a joke

  i am walled in here as helplessly
as though i were in a barred prison
it is an unpleasant sensation   

i shall have to stop trying to fool
my own intelligence and admit that
the window couldnt possibly have
been shuttered by my host i cant
blind myself any more to the obvious
fact that the slab was jammed into
the window from the inside it was
lying on the floor in the room here
wrhere it no doubt fell when the
former owner knocked it in no one

could have reached in raised it at
arms length and pulled it into place
from the outside even assuming i
wouldnt have seen it the thing is
beyond mortal strength no one man
could have done it indeed one man
could hardly lift the shutter so mas-
sive is it think then of the force
necessary to raise it like a feather
and jam it so far into the tight fit
of the brickwork

  bah in a minute ill begin to
think there really is some gigantic
power in this house after all and that
it shut me in what strange delu-
sions enter a mans mind when he
is alone in an empty house i find
myself straining my ears and craning
my neck for sight or sound of-what-
ever there may be to see or hear
there is a little rustle and i am per-
suaded that it is an exclamation of
triumph half a snarl and half a
chuckle the stairs creak again and
i am nearly convinced that something
is going up to the top floor there
is an empty feeling in the room as
though a presence had been with-
drawn i argue to myself that there
really was something in the room-
that i heald it and felt it ridiculous

  i wonder how that man could have
shut the window up possibly he had
a rope attached to the shutter and
pulled it into place by hauling from
the outside but i should have seen
if a rope were attached i couldnt
have helped seeing it ill tell him
what i think of his joke in the morn-
ing

  the delusion of footsteps persists
it actually does sound like someone in
the garret if a giant over ten feet
tall with proportionate weight
should walk in the rooms above me-
he would make just such a noise the
footfalls ring out at the head of the
steps the stairs groan as under a
tremendous weight the sound comes
closer closer now the walls of the
room shake as the last step is trodden
on and cleared   


weird tales

 good god what ean be the
meaning of this

  there was a whir of air as though
someone had walked rapidly past me
from the direction of the stairs a
soft scrunch-and the body of the
dead rat was flattened out as though
a monstrous foot had been planted
squarely on it

  now there is no noise the foot-
falls sound out no more it is as
though whatever thing had made
them was crouched in the corner be-
hind me it is a very real hallucina-
tion-i can actually feel eyes burn-
ing into my back yet when i turn to
gaze into the darkness of the corner
isee nothing nothing

  but after all what c-ould i expect
to see  there is no one in this house
but me i searched it thoroughly i
am alone i know i am alone yet-

it is with a shock of surprize that
i discover myself to be still writ-
ing i havent glanced at the paper
before me for moments certainly i
have given it no attention my whole
conscious mind has been taken up with
disturbing thoughts subconscious
activity no doubt some obscure
brain center refuses to be disturbed
by the alarms about it and persists in
guiding my fingers over the unnotieed
paper a tiling to study over in the
morning

  and i wish that morning were here
i dont like this i dont like it at
all how explain away the manner
in which the dead rat was ground
down as though under a tremendous
heel there it is-the sleek little
body pressed flat by some heavy
weight right on the floor in front of
me i cant reason that out of exist-
ence

 and the way the candle went
out

 and how was that big shutter
smashed into place over the one exit
in the whole house no man would
have had the strength to do that it
would take a giants arm some-

thing more powerful than any man
i believe some unseen power did wall
me in here i believe-

  but this is absurd i am trembling
the palms of my hands are wet and
cold my heart hurts me it pounds
so i must straighten up get a grip
on my nerves wouldn t i look proud
if after all my talking and scoffing
i should clamor to leave this cursed
house before morning eame

  it seems that i am safe from that
disgrace in spite of myself just to
experiment i raised my voice as
loudly as i could and called for help
then i shouted again now at least
five minutes after there is no sound
apparently no one heard i am in-
deed alone

  of course i am alone why must
i repeat to myself that i searched the
house and found no living thing ex-
cept for the rats  i must argue with
myself it seems as though i were
two instead of one-a mature intelli-
gent man trying patiently to instruct
a scared small boy i repeat small
boy you are alone i will say it out
loud you are alone there is noth-
ing here but you nothing can hurt
you

  how odd my voice sounds in the
silence it doesnt sound like my
voice at all i suppose if anyone were
to hear me talking aloud that way
he would think my mind was a little
unhinged   

  why doesnt something happen
for half an hour ive crouched here
beside the table always seeming to
feel a presence behind me in the cor-
ner there is no noise even the rats
stay in their holes no sound i ean
hear my own breathing in the still-
ness of the room yet it seems as
though something squatted behind me
that is impossible of course it is
impossible careful dont lose your
grip

i think i shall tour the house again
anything to distract my mind pos-

uan li the mandarin leaned
back in his rosewood chair
it is written he said
softly that a good servant is a gift
of the gods whilst a bad one-

  the tall powerfully built man
standing humbly before the robed
figiire in the chair bowed thrice
hastily submissively

  fear glinted in his eye though he
was armed and moreover was ac-
counted a brave soldier he could
have broken the little smooth-faced
mandarin across his knee and
yet-

    ten thousand pardons beneficent
one he said i have done all-
having regard to your honorable or-
der to slay the man not nor do him
permanent injury-i have done all
that i can but-

   but he speaks not   murmured
the mandarin and you come to
me with a tale of failure i do not
like failures captain wang  

  the mandarin toyed with a little
paper-knife on the low table beside
him wang shuddered

  well no matter for this time
the mandarin said after a moment
wang breathed a sigh of most heart-
felt relief and the mandarin smiled
softly fleetingly still he went
on our task is yet to be accom-
plished we have the man-he has
the information we require surely
some way may be found the serv-
ant has failed now the master must
try his hand bring the man to
me

 wang bowed low and departed
with considerable haste

weird tales

  the mandarin sat silent for a mo-
ment looking across the wide sunlit
room at a pair of singing birds in a
wicker cage hanging in the farther
window presently he nodded-one
short satisfied nod-and struck a
little silver bell which stood on his
beautifully inlaid table

  instantly a white-robed silent-
footed servant entered and stood
with bowed head awaiting his mas-
ters pleasure to him yuan li gave
certain swift incisive orders

  the white-robed one had scarcely
departed when wang captain of the
mandarins guard re-entered the
spacious apartment

  the prisoner benevolent he
announced

  the mandarin made a slight mo-
tion with his slender hand wang
barked an order and there entered
between two heavily muscled half-
naked guardsmen a short sturdily
built man barefooted clad only in
a tattered shirt and khaki trousers
but with fearless blue eyes looking
straight at yuan li under the
tousled masses of his blond hair

  a white man

  ah said yuan li in his calm
way speaking faultless french
the excellent lieutenant fournet
still obstinate

  fournet cursed him earnestly in
french and three different chinese
dialects

  youll pay for this yuan li
he wound up dont think your
filthy brutes can try the knuckle-
torture and their other devils tricks
on a french officer and get away
with it 

  yuan li toyed with his paper-
knife smiling

 you threaten me lieutenant
fournet he answered yet your
threats are but as rose-petals wafted
away on the morning breeze-unless
you return to your post to make
your report

  why damn you answered the
prisoner you neednt try that

sort oi thing-you know better than
to kill me my commandant is per-
fectly aware of my movements-
he  be knocking on your door with
a company of the legion at his back
if i dont show up by tomorrow at
reveille  

  yuan li smiled again

  doubtless-and yet we still have
the better part of the day before
us he said much may be ac-
complished in an afternoon and eve-
ning

  fournet swore again

 you can torture me and be
damned he answered i know
and you know that you dont dare to
kill me or to injure me so that i cant
get back to fort deschamps for
the rest do your worst you yellow-
skinned brute  

  a challenge the mandarin ex-
claimed and i lieutenant four-
net pick up your glove look you
-what i require from you is the
strength and location of your out-
post on the mephong river so-

 so that your cursed bandits
whose murders and lootings keep
you here in luxury can rush the out-
post some dark night and open the
river route for their boats fournet
cut in i know you yuan li and
i know your trade-mandarin of
thieves the military governor of
tonkin sent a battalion of the for-
eign legion here to deal avith such
as you and to restore peace and or-
der on the frontier not to yield to
childish threats that is not the
legions way and you should knoav
it the best thing you can do is to
send in your submission or i can
assure you that within a fortnight
your head will be rotting oaer the
north gate of hanoi as a warning
to others avho might folloav your bad
example 

ti-ie mandarins smile never
altered though well he kneav that
this was no idle threat with
tonkinese tirailleurs even with
the copper bowl



colonial infantry he could make
some sort of headway but these
thrice-aecursed legionnaires were
devils from the very pit itself he-
yuan li who had ruled as king in
the valley of the mephong to whom
half a chinese province and many a
square mile of french tonkin had
paid tribute humbly-felt his throne
 of power tottering beneath him but
one hope remained down the river
beyond the french outposts were
boats filled with men and with the
loot of a dozen villages-the most
successful raiding-party he had ever
sent out let these boats come
through let him have back his men
and they were his best get his
hands on the loot and perhaps some-
thing might be done gold jewels
jade-and though the soldiers of
france were terrible there were in
hanoi certain civilian officials not
wholly indifferent to these things
but on the banks of mephong as
though they knew his hopes the for-
eign legion had established an out-
post-he must know exactly where
he must know exactly how strong
for till this river post was gone the
boats could never reach him

  and now lieutenant fournet
staff officer to the commandant had
fallen into his hands all night his
torturers had reasoned with the stub-
born young norman and all morn-
ing they had never left him for a
minute they had marked him in no
way nor broken bones nor so much
as cut or abraded the skin-yet there
are ways fournet shuddered all
over at the thought of what he had
gone through that age-long night
and morning

   to fournet his duty came first
 to yuan li it was life or death that
 fournet should speak and he had
 taken measures which now marched
 to their fulfilment

   he dared not go to extremes with
 fournet not yet could french jus-
 tice connect the mandarin yuan li
 with the bandits of the mephong

they might suspect but they could
not prove and an outrage such as
the killing or maiming of a french
officer in his own palace was more
than yuan li dared essay he
walked on thin ice indeed those sum-
mer days and walked warily

  yet-he had taken measures

  my head is still securely on my
shoulders   he replied to fournet   i
do not think it will decorate your
gate-spikes so yoii will not speak   

  certainly not

  lieutenant fournets words were
as firm as his jaw

    ah but you will wang   

    magnanimous   

 four more guards make the
prisoner secure

  wang clapped his hands

  instantly four additional half-
naked men sprang into the room
two falling on their knees seized
fournet round the legs another
threw his corded arms round the
lieutenants waist another stood by
club in hand as a reserve in case of
-what 

  the two original guards still re-
tained their grip on fournets arms

  now in the grip of those sinewy
hands he was held immovable utter-
ly helpless a living statue

  yuan li the mandarin smiled
again one who did not know him
would have thought his smile held
an infinite tenderness a divine com-
passion

  he touched the bell at his side

  instantly in the farther doorway
appeared two servants conducting a
veiled figure-a woman shrouded in
a dark drapery

 a word from yuan li-rough
hands tore the veil aside and there
stood drooping between the impas-
sive servants a vision of loveliness a
girl scarce out of her teens dark-
haired slender with the great ap-
pealing brown eyes of a fawn eyes
which widened suddenly as they
rested on lieutenant fournet


weird tales

  lily exclaimed fournet and
his five guards had their hands full
to hold him as he struggled to be
free

  you fiend he spat at yuan li
if a hair of this girls head is
touched by the holy virgin of yve-
tot i will roast you alive in the
flames of your own palace my god

lily how-

  quite simply my dear lieuten-
ant the mandarins silky voice in-
terrupted we knew of course-
every house-servant in north tonkin
is a spy of mine-that you had con-
ceived an affection for this woman
and when i heard you were proving
obdurate under the little attentions
of my men i thought it well to send
for her her fathers bungalow is
far from the post-indeed it is in
chinese and not french territory as
you know-and the task was not a

difficult one and now-

    andre andre   the girl was cry-
ing struggling in her turn with the
servants save me andre-these

beasts-

  have no fear lily andre
fournet replied they dare not
harm you any more than they dare

to kill me they are bluffing-

  but have you considered well
lieutenant asked the mandarin
gently you of course are a
french officer the arm of france-
and it is a long and unforgiving arm
-will be stretched out to seize your
murderers the gods forbid i should
set that arm reaching for me and
mine but this girl-ah that is
different

  different how is it different

the girl is a french citizen-

  i think not my good lieutenant
fournet she is three-quarters
french in blood true but her father
is half chinese and is a chinese sub-
ject she is a resident of china-i
think you will find that french jus-
tice will not be prepared to avenge
her death quite so readily as your

own at any rate it is a chance i
am prepared to take  

  fournets blood seemed to turn to
ice in his veins the smiling devil
was right lily-his lovely white
lily whose only mark of oriental
blood was the rather piquant slant
of her great eyes-was not entitled
to the protection of the tricolor

  god what a position either
betray his flag his regiment betray
his comrades to their deaths-or see
his lily butchered before his eyes

  so now lieutenant fournet we
understand each other yuan li
continued after a brief pause to let
the full horror of the situation grip
the others soul i think you will
be able to remember the location and
strength of that outpost for me-
now   

  fournet stared at the man in bit-
ter silence but the words had given
the quick-minded lly a key to the
situation which she had hardly
understood at first

  no no andre she cried do
not tell him better that i should
die than that you should be a
traitor see-i am ready  

  fournet threw back his head his
wavering resolution reincarnate

  the girl shames me he said
slay her if you must yuan li-
and if france will not avenge her
i will but traitor i will not be
i do not think that is your last
word lieutenant the mandarin
purred were i to strangle the
girl yes-perhaps but first she must
cry to you for help and when you
hear her screaming in agony the
woman you love perhaps then you
will forget these noble heroics  
again he clapped his hands and
again silent servants glided into the
room one bore a small brazier of
glowing charcoal a second had a
little cage of thick wire mesh inside
of which something moved horribly
a third bore a copper bowl with
handles on each side to which was at-
the copper bowl



tached a steel band that glittered in
the sunlight

the hair rose on the back of four-
nets neck what horror im-
pended now  deep within him some
instinct warned him that what was
now to follow would be fiendish be-
yond the mind of mortal man to con-
ceive the mandarins eyes seemed
suddenly to glow with infernal fires
was he in truth man-or demon

  a sharp word in some yunnan dia-
lect unknown to fournet-and the
servants had flung the girl upon her
back on the floor spread-eagled in
pitiful helplessness upon a magnif-
icent peacock rug

  another word from the mandarins
thin lips-and roughly they tore the
clothing from the upper half of the
girls body white and silent she lay
upon that splendid rug her eyes still
on fournets silent lest words of
hers should impair the resolution of
the man she loved

  fournet struggled furiously with
his guards but they were five strong
men and they held him fast

    remember yuan li  he panted
youll pay-damn your yellow
soul-

  the mandarin ignored the threat

  proceed he said to the serv-
ants note carefully monsieur le
lieutenant fournet what we are
doing first you will note the
girls wrists and ankles are lashed to
posts and to heavy articles of furni-
ture suitably placed so that she can
not move you wonder at the
strength of the rope the number of
turns we take to hold so frail a girl
i assure you they will be required
under the copper bowl i have seen
a feeble old man tear his wrist free
from an iron chain

  the mandarin paused the girl was
now bound so tightly that she could
scarce move a muscle of her body

 yuan li regarded the arrange-
ments

 well done he approved yet

if she tears any limb free the man
who bound that limb shall have an
hour under the bamboo rods now
-the bowl let me see it

  he held out a slender hand re-
spectfully a servant handed him the
bowl with its dangling band of flex-
ible steel fournet watching with
eyes full of dread saw that the band
was fitted with a lock adjustable to
various positions it was like a belt
a girdle

 very well the mandarin
nodded turning the thing over and
over in fingers that almost seemed
to caress it but i anticipate-per-
haps the lieutenant and the young
lady are not familiar with this little
device let me explain or rather
demonstrate put the bowl in place
kan-su no no-just the bowl this
time  

  another servant who had started
forward stepped back into his cor-
ner the man addressed as kan-su
took the bowl knelt at the side of
the girl passed the steel band under
her body and placed the bowl bot-
tom up on her naked abdomen tug-
ging at the girdle till the rim of the
bowl bit into the soft flesh then
he snapped the lock fast holding the
bowl thus firmly in place by the
locked steel belt attached to its two
handles and passing round the girls
waist he rose stood silent with
folded arms

  fournet felt his flesh crawling
with horror-and all this time lily
had said not one word though the
tight girdle the pressure of the cir-
cular rim of the bowl must have
been hurting her cruelly

  but now she spoke bravely

  do not give way andre she
said i can bear it-it does-it
does not hurt  

 god yelled andre fournet
still fighting vainly against those
clutching yellow hands

  it does uot hurt the mandarin
echoed the girls last avords well
perhaps not but ave will take it


weird tales

off notwithstanding we must be
merciful  

  at his order the servant removed
bowl and girdle an angry red cir-
cle showed on the white skin of the
girls abdomen where the rim had
rested

  and still i do not think you
understand mademoiselle and mon-
sieur  he went on for presently
we must apply the bowl again-and
when we do under it we will put-
this

 with a swift movement of his
arm he snatched from the servant in
the corner the wire cage and held it
up to the sunlight

  the eyes of fournet and lily fixed
themselves upon it in horror for
within plainly seen now moved a
great gray rat-a whiskered beady-
eyed restless scabrous rat its white
chisel-teeth shining through the
mesh

  dieu de dieu breathed four-
net his mind refused utterly to
grasp the full import of the dreadful
fate that was to be lilys he could
only stare at the unquiet rat-stare
-stare-

  you understand now i am sure
purred the mandarin the rat
under the bowl-observe the bottom
of the bowl note the little flange 
here we put the hot charcoal-the
copper becomes heated-the heat is
overpowering-the rat can not sup-
port it-he has but one means of
escape he gnaws his way out
through the ladys body and now
about that outpost lieutenant four-
net   

 no - no - no cried lily
they will not do it-they are try-
ing to frighten us-they are human
men can not do a thing like that-
be silent andre be silent whatever
happens dont let them beat you
dont let them make a traitor of
you ah-

  at a wave from the mandarin the
servant with the bowl again ap-
proached the half-naked girl but

this time the man with the cage

stepped forward also deftly he
thrust in a hand avoided the rats
teeth jerked the struggling vermin
out by the scruff of the neck

  the bowl was placed in position
fournet fought desperately for free-
dom-if only he could get one arm
clear snatch a weapon of some sort

  lily gave a sudden little choking
cry

  the rat had been thrust imder the
bowl

  click the steel girdle was made
-fast-and now they were piling the
red-hot charcoal on the upturned
bottom of the bowl while lily
writhed in her bonds as she felt the
wriggling pattering horror of the
rat on her bare skin under that bowl
of fiends

  one of the servants handed a tiny
object to the impassive mandarin

  yuan li held it up in one hand

   it was a little key

  this key lieutenant fournet
he said unlocks the steel girdle
which holds the bowl in place it is
yours-as a reward for the informa-
tion i require will you not be
reasonable  soon it will be too late  

fournet looked at lily the girl
was quiet now had ceased to
struggle her eyes were open or he
would have thought she had fainted

  the chareoal glowed redly on the
bottom of the copper bowl and be-
neath its carven surface fournet
could imagine the great gray rat
stirring restlessly turning around
and around seeking escape from the
growing heat at last sinking his
teeth in that soft white skin gnaw-
ing burrowing desperately   

  god

  his duty-his flag-his regiment-
france young sous-lieutenant
pierre desjardins - gay young
pierre and twenty men-to be sur-
prized and massacred horribly some
saved for the torture by an over-
whelming rush of bandit-devils
the copper bowl



through his treachery he knew in
his heart that he could not do it

 he must be strong-he must be
firm   

  if only he might suffer for lily-
gentle loving little lily brave little
lily who had never harmed a
soul   

  loud and clear through the room
rang a terrible scream

  andre turning in fascinated hor-
ror saw that lilys body straining
upward in an arc from the rug was
all but tearing asunder the bonds
which held it he saw what he had
not before noticed that a little nick
had been broken from one edge of
the bowl-and through this nick and
across the white surface of the girls
heaving body was running a tiny
trickle of blood

  the rat was at work

 then something snapped in
andres brain he went mad

  with the strength that is given to
madmen he tore loose his right arm
from the grip that held it-tore
loose and dashed his fist into the
face of the guard the man with the
club sprang forward unwarily the
next moment andre had the weapon
and was laying about him with ber-
serk fury three guards were down
before wang drew his sword and
leaped into the fray

 wang was a capable and well-
trained soldier it was cut thrust
and parry for a moment steel
against wood-then wang borne
back before that terrible rush had
the reward of his strategy

 the two remaining guards to
whom he had signaled and a couple
of the servants flung themselves to-
gether on fournets back and bore
him roaring to the floor

  the girl screamed again shatter-
ing the coarser sounds of battle

  fournet heard her-even in his
madness he heard her and as he
heard a knife hilt in a servants
girdle met his hand he caught at

it thrust upward savagely a man
howled the weight on fournets
back grew less blood gushed over
his neck and shoulders he thrust
again rolled clear of the press and
saw one man sobbing out his life
from a ripped-open throat while an-
other with both hands clasped over
his groin writhed in silent agony
upon the floor

  andre fournet gathering a knee
under him sprang like a panther
straight at the throat of wang the
captain

  down the two men went rolling
over and over on the floor wangs
weapons clashed and clattered-a
knife rose dripping blood and
plunged home   

  with a shout of triumph andre
fournet sprang to his feet his ter-
rible knife in one hand wangs
sword in the other

  screaming the remaining serv-
ants fled before that awful figure

 alone yuan li the mandarin
faced incarnate vengeance

  the key

  hoarsely fournet spat out his de-
mand his reeling brain had room
for but one thought

   the key you yellow demon  

  yuan li took a step backward into
the embrasured window through
which the jasmine-scented afternoon
breeze still floated sweetly

  the palace was built on the edge
of a cliff below that window-ledge
the precipice fell sheer fifty feet
down to the rocks and shallows of
the upper mephong

  yuan li smiled once more his
calm unruffled

  you have beaten me fournet
he said   yet i have beaten you too
i wish you joy of your victory here
is the key he held it up in his
hand and as andre sprang forward
with a shout yuan li turned took
one step to the window-ledge and
without another word was gone into
space taking the key with him


weird tales

 par below he crashed in red hor-
 ror on the rocks and the waters of
 the turbulent mephong closed for
 ever over the key to the copper bowl

back sprang andre-back to
lilys side the blood ran no more
from under the edge of the bowl
lily lay very still very cold   

god she wras dead

 her heart was silent in her tor-
 tured breast

 andre tore vainly at the bowl the
 steel girdle-tore with bleeding fin-
 gers with broken teeth- madly-in
 vain

 he could not move them

 and lily was dead

or was she what was that

in her side a pulse beat-beat
strongly and more strongly   

 was there still hope

the mad fournet began chafing
her body and arms

  could he revive her surely she
was not dead-could not be dead

  the pulse still beat-strange it
beat only in one place  her soft
white side down under her last
rib-

  he kissed her cold and unrespon-
sive lips

  when he raised his head the pulse
had ceased to beat where it had
been blood was flowing sluggishly-
dark venous blood flowing in purple
horror

  and from the midst of it out of
the girls side the gray pointed head
of the rat was thrust its muzzle
dripping gore its black eyes glitter-
ing beadily at the madman who gib-
bered and frothed above it

  so an hour later his comrades
found andre foumet and lily his
beloved-the tortured maniac keen-
ing over the tortured dead

  but the gray rat they never found

a short tragic tale is

the statement of
justin parker

    by august w derleth

my sole desire in writing
this is to place before the
public all that i know of the
singular facts attending the disap-
pearance of michael salisbury re-
tired from his home on salisbury
plain on the seventeenth day of de-
cember last

  michael salisbury and i had al-
ways been the best of friends since
childhood we were together always
until late in  when he went to
the african veldt to spend over
seven years there he had hardly re-
turned-as a matter of fact it was
on the train that i met him-before i
left for the veldt

  the incident is rather peculiar and
it may aid in a manner to throw light
on what followed i was on board a
train leaving london for liverpool
he had just come in from liverpool
he came rushing into my compart-
ment two bags in his hands looking
nervously to right and left sudden-
ly he saw me he stopped dropped
his bags and came over to sit down
beside me

  my sear justin think of seeing
you here it was obvious to me
from the beginning that the man
didnt have the least idea what he was
saying

  just returning from the veldt
michael i asked arent you 
the wrong train this one isnt going
anywhere near your home

  oh no right train all right

connections-everything tip-top liv-
erpool train isnt it

  yes said i didnt you just
come from there   

  to be sure but ive the right
train ill fool them

   fool them  i repeated aston-
ished whatever are you talking
about i began to think that the
veldt had seriously affected michael
salisbury

  my valet and housekeeper fool
them-came in on a different train
the prevarication was too obvious
all the while he was looking from the
car windows and staring up and down
the aisles at the people in the car
besides his valet had been with him
to the veldt of course he might have
returned before him    there was
that possibility

  we talked for some little time he
in the same disconnected manner
with his eyes on everything at once
especially the car windows the
moment the train stopped at the first
station outside london he jumped up
with his bags which some well-mean-
ing porter had a time before removed
from the aisle on the platform he
turned akd shouted

  right after all justin it is the
wrong train

  i went on to liverpool deeply con-
cerned over this strange and unac-
countable action on the part of
michael salisbury at liverpool i
took a boat for calais and three

                                  


weird tales

months later i was in the great veldt
which my friend had jnst left

  i returned from the veldt on the
fifth of december on the seventh i
received a short note from michael
salisbury it was somewhat discon-
nected but i gathered that he earnest-
ly wished me to come down to his
home some distance out on the plain
and spend a few days with him i
have given this note to the press and
i believe that it is now in the pos-
session of messrs montague and saun-
ders of chancery lane

   i arrived on the tenth of december
and i found a somewhat different
michael salisbury from the one i had
seen some years before his rooms
were hung in solid unrelieved black
he himself wore nothing but black
stalking around most of the time in a
heavy black dressing-gown his hair
looked as if it had never been combed
and it had begun to gray at the
temples he had grown a beard which
covered more than half his face he
wore a gold-rimmed pince-nez with
smoked glasses these melancholy con-
ditions were wholly contrary to
michael salisburys temperament and
you can imagine that i was not slow
in asking him what it all meant but
he ventured little by way of explana-
tion

  its hard to cast a shadow on
black justin he said an offering
which whetted my curiosity still more

  but why this aversion to shad-
ows i asked at once

  the angle at which a shadow is
cast determines for the distant ob-
server exactly the position of the ob-
ject casting it

  this answer puzzled me beyond
words surely you can not blame me
when i say that i began to cast side-
long glances at michael salisbury
fearing at first for his sanity i re-
monstrated with him

  never mind justin he said at
last tomorrow ill tell you all
about it then he laughed and said
and ill explain just how it hap-

pened that i of all people got the
wrong train at london a few years
ago  

  and with that he packed me off to
bed for it was already late at night
when i arrived it seemed to me a
good sign that he remembered as a
jest that adventure of four years be-
fore and i went to bed thoroughly
convinced that i was to hear some-
thing far out of the ordinary

  and i was not disappointed a
great majority of those who read this
will not attach a bit of significance or
truth to the strange narrative that
michael salisbury told me on the
morning of the eleventh of december
i admit that i myself doubted the tale
at first

tts rather an incredible tale jus-

  -min he began nevertheless ill
vouch for it when i came from the
veldt four years ago i had with me
a diamond which i had taken
from the domain of a certain pigmy
tribe in the veldt the diamond was
part of a makeshift idol worshiped
by these people these dark-skinned
pigmies strangely enough were not a
fraction as barbaric as their neigh-
bors on all sides their priests were
the educated men of the village three
of them could speak english having
learned it from an english explorer
some years before i came these three
priests were the historians of the vil-
lage the chief tradesmen and most
important the guardians of the idol
their people worshiped they were
robed in costumes decidedly similar
to those of the egyptian priests of
ra they wore ornaments of beaten
gold and silver and used great quan-
tities of beaten copper under their
leadership the pigmies had estab-
lished trade with more civilized colo-
nies along the coast

  the weapons these pigmies used
were a queer sort of blow-guns
through which they projected grayish
pellets-soft things composed of
thousands of minute microbes en-
the statement of justin parker



cysted covered by a skin of gelatin
as yet i have no knowledge of these
microbes save that they devour any-
thing they come to with the exception
of glass and metal when these pel-
lets are shot from the guns they
break upon impact and the microbes
emerge multiplying so rapidly as to
look like a puddle of gray water
spreading out on all sides i have
seen an entire tribe of savages wiped
out by this horror acid is the only
thing that will kill it i think that
there is only one other man that i
know of who has had experience with
these microbes that is dr maxwell
who terms it the gray death

  you can easily see that i had
plenty of reason to be frightened
when i got off the train in london
only to discover that i had been
trailed all the way from africa by
one of the pigmy priests who stood
not far behind me on the platform
on the verge of panic i dashed
through the crowd hoping to elude
him and at last i boarded the first
train that came to hand-the train on
which you were setting out for liv-
erpool when i saw you on the
train-you who knew that i was ar-
riving from the veldt that day-and
when i saw that you had already
seen me i had only one course to
take that was to make up something
to throw you off the track i wasnt
going to fill you full of silly fears un-
til i was positively sure of my pur-
suit-though god knows i was sure
only i hated to admit it to myself
then i told you on the spur of the
moment that i was playing some silly
prank upon my servants i knew the
tale was totally awry and almost
laughed at the expression on your
face but it was the best i could do
at the time

  i left the train when i was finally
sure that i had not been followed
and hired a car to drive me all the
way to my home here on the plain
i saw nothing of the pigmy priest for
over four years after

  then one day last october while
wandering about on the moor i
noticed someone in the ruined chapel
youve seen the chapel havent you
i thought you had at any rate i
thought nothing of the matter at the
moment thinking perhaps that some
children had wandered out here-
which is not so unusual as it sounds
but when i went eloser to look into
it i found on the ground near the
ruined structure an amulet of beaten
gold for a moment i was stunned
but i knew whom i had so fortu-
nately spied and i fled as fast as i
could go to the confines of my home  

  he stopped and pointed all around
him with his stick to the black hang-
ings and to his own black robe

  ive seen those pigmies strike an
object with their accursed pellets
when it was securely out of sight-
they judged its position exactly by
the angle at which its shadow was
thrown  

  as i said i didnt quite know how
to take this story at first i was all
for the theory that he had made a
mistake about being followed but he
would have none of it and actually
became angry when i persisted then
he showed me the diamond that he
had risked his life for and to do it
justice i must say that i thought it
well worth such a risk he had kept
the jewel hidden in a secret safe be-
hind his bookcases

  never for once did michael salis-
bury cease his vigilance he dressed
always in black and maintained a
constant watch on one occasion he
confided to me that there was nothing
he feared so much as the dreaded
lama sorcery a form of animal
magnetism practised by african
tribes and with which he was famil-
iar he never ventured to explain this
magnetism to me consequently i am
totally in the dark concerning it

tor five days nothing happened to
break the monotony of life out on
the plain on the sixth day decem-


weird tales

ber seventeenth michael salisbury
vanished he must have disappeared
in the early morning for we had been
having a lengthy conversation the
night before and neither of us had
retired before midnight his clothes
were all in his room with the excep-
tion of his black silk dressing-gown
and his slippers

  the first thing i did when i had
ascertained that michael salisbury
was nowhere about was to look for the
gem it avas gone as no one but
michael and myself knew the com-
bination and location of that safe
michael must have taken it but
where could the man have gone in his
dressing-gown for some time i was
more than confident that he would
turn up sometime during the day

  i dont know what possessed me to
go to the ruined chapel that after-
noon but i went crossing the moor
just as the sun began to sink below
the horizon the chapel was an ordi-
nary affair except that it avas antique
old stone broken panes of painted
glass-the usual thing its floor how-
-ever was unusual it was of earth
and the insidious adance of the wa-
ter under the earth had made it soggy

  i saav notliing unusual about the
structure when i approached it i
made a note of the fact that i would
have to hurry to get back to the house
before darkness settled over the moor
and began to wonder whether or not
michael avould have returned i en-

  tered the chapel pioceeding cautious-
ly over the wet miry soil but
abruptly i stopped in the mud be-
fore me lay a grayish bubble that con-
tracted and expanded in a sort of
rhythmic movement about something
that lay in its midst i bent closer
the better to see what it wasj as i did
so my handkerchief fell from my
coat pocket-fell directly into this
gray bubble more quickly than i can
tell the grayish mass had spread over
the cloth and devoured it again i
caught sight of the objeet in the midst
of it

  and in that moment i recognized it
it avas that recognition that made me
turn and run from the chapel-run
haphazardly across the moor and it
was that knowledge that sent me to
liverpool that same night to see
whether or not a small brown man
ansavering to the description of an
african pigmy from the veldt had
taken passage on any outgoing ship
as if in confirmation to my recogni-
tion of the thing in the chapel i
found that a man such as the one i
sought had taken passage bound for
calais and i have wired there to have
him seized on landing and searched
for the gem i know he has

  but i have some knoavledge of these
priests the gem vail not be found
yet it is the only thing i could have
done for the thing in the midst of
that seething bubble was the gold-
rimmed pince-nez that michael salis-
bury had worn when i last saw him
prologue

in the early summer of  the
steam yacht narcissus owned by
the scientist-inventor john mel-
ville shepard was lost in the pacific
ocean under particularly mysterious
circumstances

  when she disappeared the vessel
was en route to hawaii from san
francisco carrying on board mr
shepard and his family together with
jeremiah hillis who assisted mr
shepard in the operation of the deep-
sea diving-bell with which he had re-
cently equipped the ship for explor-
ing the depths of the pacific the
narcissus was captained by count
alexius karlak one-time officer in the
imperial russian navy the second

in command was rudolph brillitz
  w t-

also a naval officer during the im-
perial regime the crew with three
exceptions were russians all having
apparently been brought together
purposely at the instigation of the
captain and his second officer

  five days out of san francisco
mr shepard and his family together
with the three non-russian members
of the crew were turned adrift in one
of the yachts open boats hillis was
held captive aboard the narcissus
stood by at a distance of several miles
until the small boat was picked up by
the freighter bemis which had been
called to the scene by radio from the
narcissus intimating that the yacht
was in trouble

  the last seen of the yacht was by
the lookout of the freighter who re-
ported thai she steamed away due

the yacht should have been cut through from
rail to rail yet she steamed on unscathed

north as soon as the small boat had
been picked up the bemis immedi-
ately radioed the facts to the united
states naval authorities and three
destroyers were dispatched in pursuit
ten days later two of the flotilla con-
sisting of the preble and the ordway
sighted the narcissus steaming at full
speed in the general direction of ba-
kelief island one of the last of the
rocky protuberances which make up
the aleutian islands at this moment
the narcissus made the third point of
a triangle consisting of herself and
the two destroyers these last im-
mediately closed in forcing the yacht
to shift her course straight for ba-
kelief escape seemed impossible the
preble ordered the yacht to heave to
and on her failure to do so hurled a
three-inch shell across her bows at
this moment one of the dense fogs
so characteristic of these latitudes
blanketed the narcissus from view
when it lifted a few moments later
the yacht had disappeared

  the flotilla combed that section of
the north pacific for three succeeding
weeks although their search was so
thorough that scarcely a floating chip
could have escaped the narcissus had
vanished

  eighty-six years later on an after-
noon in may in the year  the
coast guard cutter sitka was steaming
eastward just south of bakelief island
there were fogs as usual suddenly
out of the murk to leeward in the pan
of gray sea which lay between the
sitka and bakelief island a ship ap-
peared so near avas she and so sud-
den her appearance that the startled
lookout in the cutters crows-nest was
too paralyzed with apprehension to
shout a warning the quartermaster
however saw the ship almost as soon
as did the lookout and jammed the
wheel hard down the sitka swerved
sharply to port hoping to avoid the
blow but the distance between the
two vessels was too short and the
sharp prow of the cutter tore into the
stranger

  and yet instead of the ripping
crash of rending plates and splinter-
ing timbers there came no sound save
the pulsing throb of the sitkas en-
gines the ship which should have
been rammed and sinking by that
time steamed on the officers on her
bridge apparently paying not the
least attention

  the sitka according to all the
known laws of distance should have
rammed her just abaft the funnels
and yet somehow in a way those on
the deck of the sitka could never ex-
plain the stranger pushed on and a
moment later was lost in the fog

 the incident was put down in
naval annals as a trick of the atmos-
phere visibility in those latitudes
often playing queer pranks on the
mariners and so it remained but
the man in the crows-nest and the
quartermaster at the wheel of the
sitka swore until their dying day that
as the phantom ship steamed out of
their path they read in plain gold
letters across her stern the name
narcissus and they maintained
too that looking back at the time
they saw no wake behind her but
the narcissus was never seen again

	dr traslc

in the year  exactly three days
before the incident of the sitka and
the phantom ship a man in his late
twenties going by the name of ralph
heame was riding in the lexington
avenue subway in new york city
the car was not so crowded at the
time but that he was able to hold his
newspaper unfolded before him as he
read and so in this manner his left
hand had come within the vision of
the traveler beside him this was a
heavily built man of middle age with
a long narrow face made longer by
a pointed gray imperial which in its
turn seemed to enhance the thin
aquiline nose and the curiously
shaped ears lobeless at the bottom and
running to a point at the top at
the isle of lost souls



this moment the older mans narrow-
set eyes had settled with a peculiar
gleam of satisfaction on the heavy
gold seal ring which adorned the fin-
ger of the young man-a ring so well
worn that the inscription embossed on
its surface had been all but obliter-
ated

  once or twice as if in fascination
the bearded mans hand had half
reached out to the ring only to be
withdrawn with obvious mental ef-
fort now he touched the young
mans arm pardon said he in
a heavy bass voice which went well
with his appearance you have a
very strange ring there may i ask
where you got it

  the younger man rather pale of
face and poor of dress and yet with
a certain distinction in his features
looked up from his paper plainly
more startled by the nearness of that
gruff voice to his ear than by the
strangeness of the question

  oh i cant tell you he an-
swered its a family heirloom it
was left to me-that is it was left
with me-bv my parents when they
died

  the older man nodded may i
examine it he asked

  the young man slipped it off and
passed it over to the other who seized
it eagerly between long powerful
fingers for a moment he examined
it closely turning it this way and that
to throw a better light on its yellow
surface finally he pulled out a small
magnifying glass continuing his
scrutiny even more carefully under
the lens from time to time during
the examination his eyes shifted to the
man beside him taking in with quick
understanding the worn yet neatly
mended clothing the patched shoes
and the general air of genteel poverty

  will you sell it he demanded
abruptly

  the young man shook his head i
couldnt said he

  were your people russian de-

manded his inquisitor handing back
the ring

  the young man flushed i dont
know   he replied in a voice so faint
that the bearded man bent closer
drinking in eagerly every word i
havent the faintest idea you see
i was-er-i was a foundling some-
body left me a three-weeks old baby
at the door of the seamans institute
here in new york city this ring
was tied about my neck by a bit of
string ive clung to it hoping that
some day i might-

  the bearded man interrupted lay-
ing a heavy hand on the speakers
arm listen he said i am a
physician with a more than ordinary
scientific turn of mind i dabble in
psychiatry and hypnotism and that
sort of thing it so happens that at
the present moment i am in need of
an assistant in my laboratory-some-
body wholl be willing to be the sub-
ject for a few harmless experiments
if you are willing to put yourself in
my hands i can pay you well you
will suffer no pain and there will be
no drawbacks whatsoever and the
work on the other hand will be more
than fascinating i can pay as high
as fifty dollars a week if you prove
satisfactory there may be more
later  

  the face of the younger man lit up
ill take it he said after a mo-
ments thought as a matter of fact
ive been looking for work all day
lost my job because i was too sleepy
after nights of study im hoping to
be a lawyer you see my names
heame-ralph hearne  

  the bearded man drew a card from

his pocket call at no - east

twenty-eighth street tomorrow aft-
ernoon at  oclock he directed
thats way over by the river but
you can find it all right heres my
station good-bye

ing noticed for the first time a faint

fringe of the gray imperial at the
corner of his mouth then glancing
down at the card he saw engraved
there

dr gregory trask
psychiatrist

	into the past

hearne went to the given address
the next day at the stipulated
hour and found himself iishered into
a small sitting-room by a young wo-
man whose pale almost emaciated
features had not entirely effaced a
certain elusive dark-eyed beauty
for a moment he paused on the
threshold startled by a vague fa-
miliarity which he imagined he saw
in her face and she too stared back
at him saying no word

  why-why he began it al-
most seems as though id seen you
somewhere before you-you-where
could it have been

  blood suddenly rushed into her wan
cheeks she closed the door behind
him and bade him pass on into the
corridor

  no she said almost inaudibly
its not possible

  but im almost sure he pro-
tested

  quick please she whispered
hes coming

  at that moment dr trask ap-
peared in the doorway hearne saw
a heavy flood of red pour into the
mephistophelian features of the scien-
tist ignoring hearne and walking
swiftly across the room the physician
seized the girl by the arm his power-
ful fingers sinking deep into the flesh
with that she gave a low cry of pain
and went whiter still

  what business is this he hissed
why do you delay here at the door
i told you to show him in promptly
go back to your room i will deal
with you later  

  i say its really my fault put
in hearne dismayed i-i thought

id met her somewhere before aw-
fully sorry to have delayed you

  dr trask turned to him the flick-
er of anger which still lingered in his
eyes belying the honeyed smoothness
of his voice it is nothing he re-
marked im a bit out of sorts to-
day and any delay annoys me greatly
kindly step into the laboratory and
we  get busy immediately  

  he led the way through an inter-
vening corridor into a spacious high-
ceiled room lit from the roof by a
series of skylights on the walls
were racks of test-tubes retorts and
glass jars while bits of intricate
electrical apparatus connecting with
a maze of colored wires were scattered
about on tables and benches at the
farther end a man was bending over
a microscope

  this is merwin my assistant
said dr trask beckoning to the other
hearne saw a tall rawboned indi-
vidual whose low beetle-brows match-
ing a thick unkempt thatch of black
hair and wide thin-lipped mouth
under an almost bridgeless nose indi-
cated a surly brutish nature

  trask offered hearne a chair and
then sat down beside him while mer-
win placed a small stand containing
a goblet a medicine dropper and a
small phial of colorless liquid at his
side

  as you perhaps remember from
our conversation of yesterday he
began i am a psychiatrist a doctor
of mental maladies unlike most of
those in my profession i also employ
medicines in the cure of my patients
as well as hypnosis and other forms
of mental suggestion being virtu-
ally new in this field i have been
obliged to develop my own compounds
-and in the course of my work i
have come upon drugs containing
properties hitherto unknown to man

  he pulled the small phial toward
him and tapped it with his forefinger
i have here an elixir of peculiar
properties which if used in conjunc-
tion with hypnosis and certain elee-

trieal agitation of the brain throws
the subject into a state from which
lie can view the events of a previous
existence you are not by the way
a believer in the theory of transmi-
gration of souls  no well no mat-
ter-whether you believe now or not
is a thing of small consequence for
i am quite convinced you will be a
ann believer before we are done with
our experiment

  suffice it-to say that the soul
which occupies the body of ralph
heame at this moment has existed in
other bodies since the beginning of
time what i do is only to cast the
soul back into a previous state your
body and your conscious will remain-
ing here with me however you are
able to tell me exactly what you are
doing at the period of time to which
your soul returns although you are
now ralph heame a simple ameri-
can citizen you have been in the past
a russian grand duke or a tsar or
perhaps only a poor mujik i make
the reference russian because of the
ring you wear although you may
not know it it is russian i have seen
many of them in russia being myself
of russian descent  

  i dont know that i understand
what you mean said heame dubi-
ously you say you wish to cast my
soul back into a previous life in order
that t may live through the events of
that life in my understanding the
word previous means something
which has gone before-something
which has been completed if per-
chance i had been a grand duke in
some past age as you say then the
body of that grand duke has by this
time turned to dust how would it
be possible for my soul to go back and
live in a body which has long since
crumbled in dust   

  there you are wrong answered
dr trask i used the word pre-
vious merely because i wished you
to understand better what i intended
to do with your soul you make the
common mistake of assuming that

these past lives of yours came before
this one in point of time but i tell
you they do not come before or after
but run co-existent with it  

 you mean demanded heame
incredulously that at this identical
moment my soul is occupying a body
not only in this world but in some
other world also

  precisely i might go even far-
ther than that i might say your soul
inhabits another body on this very
same planet earth it would how-
ever be in a different dimension from
the one in which you now are it is
theoretically possible that your soul
inhabits not only the body of ralph
heame here  this floor in this room
but also another body on this floor in
this room the body of ralph heame
would be unaware of the other body
because the other body would be in
another dimension of space

  let me make an analogy for you
continued dr trask seeing the
puzzled look in hearnes eyes we
will first begin with the old theory
of the transmigration of souls which
has nothing to do with the dimensions
of space imagine a series of iron
tubes-say six-placed side by side
imagine that when a person is bom
he begins life at one end of one of
these tubes and progresses through
this tube until death releases him at
the other end eaeh tube therefore
represents the course of a lifetime

  now imagine that these tubes are
numbered from left to right beginning
with no  at the left and ending with
no  at the right imagine that tube
 encloses the life of a person bom
in the year  and dying in the
year  tube five encloses the life
of a person bom in  and dying in
 tube  encloses a life born in
 and dying in  tube  en-
closes the life of ralph ilearne born
let us say in the year  and dying
in the year  and so on with the
other two tubes

  now according to the old theory
of the transmigration of souls a soul


weird tales

may be bom into the body of john
smith who goes through life in tube
 that is he lives from the year 
to the year  on the death of
john smith this same soul goes into
the body of frank jones who lives
through tube  that is from  to
 on the death of frank jones
this soul enters the new-born body of
thomas atkins in tube  once the
life span of atkins is completed this
same soul enters into the new-born
body of ralph hearne from hearne
it will go to another body in the next
tube and so on in other words the
soul now living in the body of ralph
hearne also lived in other bodies in
ages past is that clear

  perfectly

  that is the old theory of the
transmigration of souls-or at any
rate that part of the theory which con-
cerns my argument the new theory
-my theory-is a far better one be-
cause it explains much in the universe
which has hitherto remained inexpli-
cable now according to my theory
there is no such thing as time in the
sense of a past a present and a fu-
ture i hold that all is in the present
there is no past no future our
sense of a past and a future that is
our sense of the passing of time comes
merely from the fact that our puny
brain being totally unaware of the
stupendousness of the universe can
comprehend the universe only with re-
lation to itself the human brain can
take in and understand only an in-
finitesimal fraction of the universe at
one time hence there arises a neces-
sity for it to measure and compare one
thing jvith another and everything
with itself that gives us our sense
of the passage of time that gives us
our sense of a beginning and an end
whereas there is really no beginning
and no end to anything

  now let us go back to our six
tubes according to the old theory
of the transmigration of souls the
soul now residing in the body of
ralph hearne has come up through

the ages born into a body at birth
living in it until death then going on
to another new-born body and so on
but if you accept the new theory-
the theory that there is no past and
no future-you must assume that the
soul now in the body of ralph hearne
lives also at this moment in countless
other bodies throughout the universe
these bodies being separated from one
another by the innumerable dimen-
sions of space with which the uni-
verse is made up coming back to
our tubes the same soul-the ralph
hearne soul let us call it-living in
tube  lives also at the same moment
in all the other tubes

  i wish to go a little farther with
our tube analogy imagine that a
single strand of wire is strung over
these six tubes from left to right
imagine that at various intervals
along this wire six other wires are
attached each wire dropping down
into a small hole in each one of the
six tubes imagine an electric cur-
rent generated through this wire
then if there were a small engine in
each tube connected up with each
wire that engine could be run could
it not well if you imagine that
each of these small engines in each
tube is a human soul you would say
that all of the souls were connected
together and all ran simultaneously
and that is precisely the case with the
human soul in the universe it is
like the current in that wire it runs
all the little engines at once and the
current in one engine is not one whit
different from the current in another
you might say that the current is the
universal soul and that this universal
soul has offshoots into each tube where
it becomes an individual soul the
soul of ralph hearne is merely the
individual soul an offshoot as it were
of a universal soul the soul of dr
trask is merely an individual soul
an offshoot of another universal soul
the universe is teeming with uni-
versal souls which are in turn subdi-
vided into countless individual souls
the isle of lost souls



when the body dies as we say the
individual soul is merely absorbed
back into its parent or universal
soul

  but how is it if these individual
souls are all connected up with each
other through their universal soul
one soul is not conscious of the
other put in hearne

    i am coming to that now neither
you nor i nor the vast majority of
persons are conscious of our other
souls because of the physical limita-
tions of the brain your brain stands
between your soul and your mind
your consciousness every pulsation
that comes from one soul to another
must pass through the brain before
the individual mind is aware of it
but the human brain is so atrophied
by disuse that it can no longer receive
and transmit these faint pulsations
hence you are oblivious of any other
being than your own there are some
exceptions to this rule in the case of
people called spirit mediums their
brains are so constructed that they
may receive and transmit to the inner
consciousness these soul pulsations
mediums are generally born with this
ability but it is also possible by ter-
rific mental exertion to revive the
atrophied portion of the brain to a
point where it will receive and trans-
mit soul pulsations however the
task is- a tremendous one and none
but the brahmins of india and simi-
lar cults have the time and patience to
keep up with it

  now what i propose to do with
you is this i propose to give yon cer-
tain stimulants certain drugs whieh
in conjunction with electrical agita-
tion of the brain will awaken its dor-
mant part to a point where it will
receive and transmit soul pulsations
from some other body with which your
soul is connected in that condition
you will be able to sit here and tell
me precisely what your soul or your
spirit-whichever you choose to call
it-is doing at this moment in another
body

  it so happens that i am making
an intensive study of the events which
occurred around the year  but
luifortunately i have not been able to
perfect my apparatus to a point where
i ean cause you at the- first attempt to
receive soul pulsations from the body
in which your soul is at that period
located i shall have to experiment a
bit by receiving pulsations from first
one body and then another until we
come to the body in which i am in-
terested because of the delicacy of
my apparatus i can not run it back-
ward  so to make sure i shall try first
a very early period working up
through the centuries until we re-
ceive pulsations from your  soul
as it were of course i am using the
terms early and centuries merely
to make it clearer to you your other
bodies as i have just pointed out are
not living before your own body in
point of time but are living concur-
rently with it and in a different di-
mension of space

  i dont quite understand what
you mean by the other dimensions of
space put in hearne can you
make that clearer

  only by a crude analogy re-
plied ir trask our minds being
three-dimensional minds can not com-
prehend a fourth dimension except in
theory much less a fifth or a sixth
or seventh you and i are conscious
of three dimensions in space-length
breadth and thickness put one of us
in an air-tight iron box and we would
not get out because all of the sides-
all three dimensions-would be barred
to us but put a man whose brain
comprehended four dimensions in that
same iron box and he would immedi-
ately see one dimension-one side-
which we had not stopped up and
hence he could step out and be free-
one side we did not close to him when
we made the box  

  hearne leaned back in inis chair
i really cant believe youll be able
to do it he said but go ahead


weird tales

tvferwin placed two copper elec-
-l  j trodes attached to wire from the
apparatus on the table in heames
hands while dr trask put three drops
of the colorless liquid from the phial
into the goblet of water then stand-
ing over heame so that he could look
him steadily in the eyes the psychia-
trist bade him drink

  scarcely had the last of the water
drained into heames throat than his
body stiffened his eyes closed and
with a long heavy sigh he lapsed into
unconsciousness trask immediately
seized his pulse counting the beats
until they gradually died away to a
flutter and then ceased altogether

  apparently satisfied at the young
mans condition dr trask turned his
attention immediately to the ring on
his hand pulling it easily from his
finger while the giant merwin peered
over his shoulder his small pig-eyes
full of curiosity do you think its
the one sure enough   he demanded

  of course snapped dr trask
theres only one in existence i
recognized it immediately i saw it
the question now is are the pellets
still there as the manuscript says

  with these words he began twisting
at the seal with his lean powerful
fingers for a moment it withstood
the pressure and he tapped it impa-
tiently against tho arm of the chair
then he twisted again and the seal
came loose in his hand glancing at
the back of it he saw there held in
place by a film of transparent gut
two tiny tablets pale green in color

   there they are   he exclaimed ex-
citedly i knew i couldnt be mis-
taken

  well then there aint no need of
us going any further with this chap
is there demanded merwin we
can have another made like it and
change them while hes in one of the
trances or maybe it would be easier
to finish him off and be done with it
nobody knows him in this town we
could burn his carcass to nothin  with
acids theyd never get us what

say-shall i give him a dose of car-
bolic   

  no you fool dont you realize
well need him when we make our
final attempt the more people we
take back with us the more chance
well have of breaking the train of
events as it was then and if we
dont break it sufficiently things will
happen as they did before and you
and i will come out of it with no more
knowledge of where the jewels lie than
we have now besides we are by no
means sure hes the man but well
know in a minute throw in the
switch ive only fixed the pointer
on the dial by guesswork well have
to work up to it going by what he
tells us

  merwin stepped to the wall and
threw a small switch while dr trask
slipped the ring back upon the re-
cumbent heames finger at that in-
stant a subdued humming filled the
room and the psychiatrist holding the
subjects pulse felt an awakening
flutter there

  tell me what you are doing he
said speaking directly to the uncon-
scious heame

  for a moment hearnes lips moved
without sound but presently words
poured forth in a dull monotone i
am walking over a wide yellow
plain he began i am leading a
small shaggy pony toward some small
huts near the foot of the low rolling
hills in the distance i am carrying
in my right hand a long heavy stick
to which there is attached a sharpened
stone-

  dr trask raised his hand and mer-
win snapped off the switch too
early   said he  almost prehistoric
i should say  

  he adjusted the pointers on a series
of small dials beside the switch
again merwin threw it in again the
subdued humming

  tell me what you are doing
commanded dr trask standing over
heame once more
the isle of lost souls



  i am riding a small shaggy pony
saddled and bridled and i am urging
him on with spurs at my heels i am
one of a great group of men who ride
behind me mounted as i am in my
hand i am waving aloft a short
curved sword and they come shouting
after me we are running toward a
line of men kneeling in the snow and
pointing rifles at us there is a flash
through the dusk and a crashing re-
port some of those behind me fall
but i press on i see the men with
rifles closer now they are in uni-
forms-ragged and tom uniforms-
and their faces are drawn with fa-
tigue and pinched with hunger
through the snow with a shift of the
wind i see a man on horseback stand-
ing on a knoll about him are other
men in uniforms to whom he is giv-
ing directions he is short and heavy-
set with a plain black hat turned up
over his face in front one arm he
holds crossed before his breast the
hand buried in his tunic-

  merwin again snapped off the cur-
rent at a sign from dr trask a
cossack charge against french grena-
diers   muttered the physician re-
treat from moscow probably that
must have been napoleon again he
adjusted the dials and again the
monotone from the young man in the
chair

  i am one of a brilliant group of
people in a vast hall shining with a
thousand brilliant lights about me
on all sides are men and women re-
splendent in brilliant costume some
are talking-others dancing in the
distance on a raised dais at the end of
the room with a group of uniformed
men about her is seated a handsome
woman of middle age-a woman of
regal aspect-beautiful very beauti-
ful she smiles and taps one of the
courtiers with her fan-

  the court of catherine growled
dr trask signing merwin to throw
the switch were getting nearer
he remarked shifting the dial point-

ers again another century or two
-all right go ahead merwin

 t am walking through the streets
of a small siberian town began
the monotone once more i am
ragged unkempt and dirty i pause
now before a house surrounded by a
high stockade about it sentries are
pacing to and fro peering through
an opening between the boards i see
a yard with a great house before
the door and pointing into it is a
machine-gun and here there are
other sentries out of a side door
comes a bearded man of medium sta-
ture leading a small boy by the hand
he is followed by two sentries who
walk close behind him always with
their bayonets fixed and ready i-
but the sentry outside the stockade

drives me away with an oath-

  ekaterinburg where the last of
the tsars was put to death cried
dr trask jumping to his feet
were only a few days from it
now  

  he moved the dials the smallest
fraction of an inch hearnes voice
slurred to an indistinguishable mur-
mur and then took on new volume

  i am riding in the night began
the voice trask pushed the dials
once more this time barely the
breadth of a hair and the voicfe
slurred again

  i am seated at a table in a peas-
ants hut  went on the voice across
the table opposite me is another who
holds a pistol pointed at my breast

in his other hand he has a paper-

  describe that paper directed
trask his face now gone white his
voice hoarse with emotion

  it is yellow in color and covered
with lines and figures-but he holds
it away from me so that i can not
see it clearly it-it looks like a map

or perhaps-

  yes yes go on cried dr trask
hoarsely


weird tales

  merwin had abandoned his post at
the switch and now the two stood over
the young man in the chair their eyes
avid with expectancy describe it
you fool describe the paper dr
trask almost shouted a map-but
a map of what	

  i can not see but i seem to know
that it is the map of-of an island-
an island in the pacific-but the man
opposite me occupies all my attention
for the moment he is big and beard-
ed with a heavy aquiline nose and
there is a sear a saber scar livid
white running from the corner of his
left eye down across his cheek  

  dr trask s hand went unconscious-
ly to his face where the birthmark
reddish-purple in color extended
from the comer of his left eye across
his cheek to disappear in the fringe
of the gray imperial at the comer of
his mouth

  if thats you began merwin
he may recognize you when he

comes out of it and-

  nonsense his spirit is not yet
completely transposed he is merely
receiving pulsations it will be all
dim like a dream to him  

    the room is lit by a candle on the
table between us heame was say-
ing the light is bad-wrorse be-
cause the gray of dawn is breaking
through an opening in the roof ah
yes there is the faint sound of sob-
bing  yes there is a boy at the farther
end of the rcom half crouched in a
comer no it is not a boy it is a
young woman

  this is the moment-this is the
moment breathed dr trask

  i am quarreling with the man
across the table went on hearne
we are disputing what is to be done
concerning the map and the woman
the big man has just made a sug- j
gestion which angers me i spring
from my chair but he raises the pis-
tol and points it at me you are a
fool boris to think i would enter
into any such treacherous scheme
he is saying as you say there are

millions to be had by this paper-
even billions-all the crown jewels
but even that would not tempt me to
betray my trust

   you blackguard i cry out
what filthy scheme of yours is this
now it was your suggestion that
we do that foul thing the refusal
was mine who spoke first of be-
traying the trust- you who re-
fused i are you trying to reverse
the roles  what trick is this birsk  
 who speaks of trickery says
my companion  oh it is useless for
me to try and convince you by peace-
ful means what say you boris
that we fight it out with sabers he
who survives takes all  

   it is a bargain i cry out i
will fight you

  the big man gets to his feet we
remove our heavy coats we each
draw the heavy sabers at our sides
we are going to fight it out here by
the light of the candle but the girl
protests she dops not want me to fight
she fears the big man but i have
said that i shall fight and fight we
shall she tells me he was the best
saber in the siberian army but my
purpose is set seeing her plea use-
less she pulls a ring from her finger
and gives it to me as a talisman
against danger it is a ring of heavy

beaten gold-

    by all the gods-by all the gods-
he is most surely the man we are
seeking muttered dr trask

  we agree the big man and i
continued heames voice that the
girl shall mount the table at one side
of the room and there hold the candle
to give us light now we remove our
boots he and i he strips down to
his great hairy chest and i see there
the bunched and corded muscles
which tell me his strength is twice
my own

  we begin under the light of the
candle with that pale lovely face look-
ing down upon us our heavy weap-
ons meeting for the first time strike
fire now we cut and slash now we
the isle of lost souls



circle warily each seeking to put the
candle-light in the eyes of the other
around once more we go he drives
in and i parry this is the sixth time
he has tried and lost i feel that i
am getting the better of it now i
drive my blade in under his guard
there comes a widening smudge of
red on his chest and presently there
is blood dripping down to mingle
with the matted hair on his sweating
body

  the big man has been panting in
hoarse gasps for a long time now he
surely can not last he has found
his match but he is clever and
strong withal he falls-by god-
no it is only a ruse for he is up
again this time his point under my
guard his blade glistens as he whirls
it upward but i turn quickly out of
its path now i slip-i am down-
no it is but a feint-i am up again
pushing him back-back to the wall
ah now the light is full in his eyes
from between his clenched teeth come
flecks of foam dropping to his breast
and whitening the bloody stain under
the matted hair i cut him again-
and again it is only a flesh wound
but a deeper avound this time more
blood in a steady stream this avill
surely finish him the fight is mine

  but there is a strange light in
his eyes it is not the light of battle
it is crafty and cunning he is uoav
the fox no more the warrior he
manages to pull himself out of the
comer and circles warily no longer
on the offensive is he saving his
strength for what

  i push him back back-back to
the table with the candle above him
i shall bring this to a close avith a
slashing side-cut-

 my god he has kicked back-
ward avith his foot against the table
leg it snaps the girl screams and
the table totters she falls and the
candle sputters out darkness we
are doavn on the floor he and i aarith
my hand at his throat for i had
jumped at him pushing aside his

blade as the light vanished now we
are up again-noav on our knees-
uoav doavn once more the gray light
of daavn sifting through the aperture
overhead shoavs me his features gray-
er still under my grasp at his throat
now he drops his head on my throat
and readies behind him it is his
pistol i try to block him but he
avorms out of my grasp and whirls
the butt upward bringing it down
across my skull-once twice thrice
a blistering stinging glare of fire in
my brain-a groan-and i sink to the
floor the gray about us deepens to
midnight

   the struggle is over the big man
rises the girl crawls across the floor
to my body and throws herself upon
it she calls my name and i can al-
most read it on her lips in the avan
light of day

  there is the beat of hoofs on the
road outside the big man staggers
to the door there are horsemen there
on foaming mounts he hails them
joyfully he points into the hut and
smiles sardonically they dismount
and enter one of them helps the girl
to her feet but i do not move there
on the floor i am limp-lifeless
they begin to laugh-

npiie voice began to avaver hearnes
hands released the electrodes and
they rolled across his knees to the
floor at the same moment his eyes
fluttered and then opened a vide now
he stirred and pulled himself slowly
to his feet facing the other two

  dr trask cursed under his breath
you feel no bad effects lie asked
returning to his smooth manner

  none said hearne rubbing his
eyes nothing but a slight dizziness
in the head   i had a terrible dream
-a terrible dream

  yes the effect avould be to you
the same as a dream iioavever it was
stark reality and no dream at all-
every bit of it but unfortunately
the spell did not last as long as i
should have liked just as we were


weird tales

getting to the crucial moment the elix-
ir lost its hold on you and you came
to i should have given you a strong-
er dose  

  i dont feel equal to it today
no we had best wait until you
have rested a bit tomorrow yoxi will
go back into that world and we shall
see further what comes of it have
a good nights sleep and be ready
here at the same time tomorrow after-
noon

  dr trask led hearne to the door
and a moment later he was on his
way down the stairs as he came to
the outside entrance-it was one of
the old brownstone residences in the
east twenties-a woman stepped out
of the shadows touching him on the
arm at first startled by her sud-
den appearance he did not recognize
her but a second glance told him
she was the girl who had met him at
the door of the trask apartment-
mrs trask her features were paler
than before and the small hand on
hearnes arm trembled visibly again
he sensed rather than felt that same
vague familiarity he had remarked
on his first meeting with her

  what did you see she asked
breathlessly what did you see-
in the experiment i mean

    why-er-there were several
dreams he stumbled but the last
was longer i was fighting a man in

a small hut-

  you were fighting him she ex-
claimed   with a saber   

  yes yes he replied gazing
down at her with renewed wonder
and why-it seems to me you were
there too standing on a table holding
a candle-but its all vague like

fading dreams you-

  oh my god she exclaimed as
though in horror then it is you
only a dream he repeated
why are you alarmed

  tell me she broke in did he-
did my husband bid you come again
tomorrow

  yes

  she seized his arm anew then if
you love life do not come she whis-
pered tensely go far away where
he can never find you-out of the city

-anywhere- 

  no no i cant do that now he
replied he-the doctor-said this
was no dream but reality and so i
must go back seeking her-through
the ages

 she broke away from him with a
low cry of fright and ran toward the
stairs following her with his eyes
he spied dr trask standing on one
of the lower steps his saturnine fea-
tures blazing down angrily upon his
wife reaching out with one of his
enormous hands he seized the cring-
ing woman by the arm and dragged
her beliind him up the stairs hearne
heard words then-angry words and
the sound of a blow and a cry of pain

	merwin objects

an hour before hearne was to call
the next day a strange scene was
being enacted in dr trasks labora-
tory-a scene which the young man
would have done well to have wit-
nessed the raw-boned merwin had
that morning assumed an unwonted
truculence toward dr trask and
now that the time for further experi-
mentations drew near he suddenly
laid down his instruments and planted
himself in front of the psychiatrist

    see here trask   he snarled  im
gonna know just what we re doin  be-
fore i go any further with this little
thing you been mighty fine ex-
plainin all that stuff to this young
fool hearne and so long as you con-
trol his mind you can bring him back
but when you and me and her and him
all go back into that other world-
thats another thing we aint gonna
have no control here and so howre
we gonna get back is what i want to
know  

  the two men glowered at each other
for several seconds dr trasks
hand played idly with a silver bod-
the isle of lost souls



kin which he had just dipped into a
liquid at his side merwin noticing
the bodkin suddenly shot his hand to
his hip none o that he mur-
mured if you get funny with me
trask ill plug you right here and
now no fancy tricks on me with
them drugs of youm  

  dr trask reddened and an angry
light leaped into his eyes belying the
honeyed suavity of his voice really
my dear merwin he murmured
this outburst is most unexpected
and unwarranted i thought i had
explained all of this to you most care-
fully  

  you aint explained too much of
it if im goin  to be foolin  round in
that other life as you call it i wanna
know just where im goin and whats
goin to happen and when im goin
to get back you know damn well
trask that when all four of us go
into that other dimension there aint
goin  to be anybody here to bring us
back where we belong  

  my dear fellow trask purred
softly that is what those pellets in
the ring are for those are to re-
place our earthly control when we
have found out that which we wtish
to find out then we shall each swal-
low one of those pellets and presto-
we shall be back here again safe and
sound  

  yeh but theres only two pills
and therell be four of us

  yes but twos enough isnt it im-
becile one for you and one for me
we leave him and her back there
where they will not be in a position
to interfere with us again dr trask
laughed sardonically

  well why dont we swipe the
pills now demanded meiwin
you can give me one and then ill
feel safe i aint trustin you none
trask  

  you simple fool snapped trask
impatiently heame will have the
ring in that life as well as in this
we know that by what we heard yes-
terday we ean not carry it with us

from this life to that because only
our souls migrate and when the
crucial moment arrives in that life i
shall have that ring of his

  well if thats the case con-
tinued merwin im gonna know
whats goin to happen and in order
to understand whats goin to happen
i gotta know what has happened i
got to know trask and any time you
dont do just what you tell me you re
plannin  to do then i wanta know the
reason why and if you dont explain
it mighty quick ill bump you off and
help myself to the ring get that 
now lets hear what all this is about  

  trask shrugged his shoulders in
resignation you understand what
i did yesterday dont you merwin
remember my analogy of the six
tubes well the first time i tried
him he was too far out in the dimen-
sions or too far back in time accord-
ing to which way you look at it i
worked bade through the other dimen-
sions until i got pulsations from the
fourth you might say that id con-
nected him up with his life in tube 
when we reached the fourth i found
by what he was telling me that his
is the spirit weve been looking for
so long ralph heame is the rein-
carnation of boris saranoff there can
be no more doubt of that saranoff
was the man who was fighting the big
fellow birsk in that hut on the
markinoff road in siberia i have al-
ready established to my satisfaction
that i am the reincarnation of greg-
ory birsk i saw that same identical
scene when i used you as a control
and went back myself into birsks
body

  now i have established pretty
clearly what happened between those
two men saranoff and birsk they
wene spies sent by the allies in ll
into siberia to effect the escape of the
imperial russian family which at
that time was imprisoned by the
bolsheviki in the town of ekaterin-
burg they were only partly suc-
cessful for they escaped with but one


weird tales

of the family-the grand duchess
tatiana the rest of the family was
executed as history will tell you in
addition to the grand duchess these
two men were bringing out of russia
a map containing information as to
the whereabouts of the imperial crown
jewels which were taken out of the
country and hidden on bakelief is-
land at the outbreak of the russian
revolution bakelief is the western-
most of the islands in the aleutian
chain which stretches between alaska
and the siberian coast

  now birsk conceived the idea of
withholding this map from the knowl-
edge of the allies so that in time he
and saranoff might go to the island
and help themselves to this vast
treasure to do this however it
would be necessary to dispose of the
grand duchess who knew they had
been given the map by the tsar and
so would of course tell of it should
she ever come out of siberia alive
birsk proposed to saranoff just before
they got out of russia that they
should murder her and say nothing
about the map on their return giv-
ing out word that she had perished
with the other members of her family
this scheme of birsks was unknown
to the grand duchess and saranoff
did not tell her as he did not wish to
add any more to her misery than she
was already bearing

  birsk was by no means dis-
couraged by saranoffs refusal in
fact he was rather glad of it it
would have been easier for him if
saranoff had agreed to sacrifice the
girl but since he would not birsk de-
cided to do the next best thing which
was more in keeping with his desires
though it was more difficult and far
more dangerous he planned to get
rid of saranoff instead of the irl
so he provoked saranoff to a quarrel
in the girls presence hurling accusa-
tions at saranoff that saranoff had
planned to betray them these ac-
cusations were veiled in such a way

that the girl would see they wcic dis-
cussing something which had been
discussed before-something to which
saranoff had been a party birsks
plan was to kill saranoff in a duel
afterward telling the grand duchess
that saranoff had approached him
with a plan for murdering her and
keeping silent on the question of the
jewels he would then secure her si-
lence by telling her that the allies
were not interested in restoring the
imperial regime but only in getting
their hands on the russian crown
jewels in payment for the funds they
had already squandered in the rus-
sian debacle having sealed her lips
until he got her out of russia and
away from the allies he would then
deal with her as he saw fit for he
was madly in love with her though he
would not have hesitated to murder
her if she stood in the way of his get-
ting the treasure

  the girls obvious love for sa-
ranoff further whetted birsks desire
to kill him birsk was a russian duke
and had the reputation of being the
best saber in the imperial armies
whereas saranoff was only an obscure
captain of artillery so birsk was con-
fident the duel would have but a single
outcome he went into it with this
idea only to learn that he was sadly
mistaken that he had an antagonist
whose skill was far superior to his
own to save his own skin he had
to win by a trick you were here
listening to hearne yesterday so you
know what that trick was

  birsk bad acted none too quickly
in his own interests for the duel was
hardly ended when a rescue party
found them at their hut at some
time during the journey to the rescue
ship on the black sea birsk managed
to convince the grand duchess that
saranoff had intended treachery and
that he had been obliged to kill him
for that reason and that she must not
reveal their knowledge of the jewels
the isle of lost souls



ktow after the war was over and
things settled down a bit birsk
got a number of russians together
and they all went to bakelief island
where they established counter-revolu-
tionary headquarters with the grand
duchess at their head-or ostensibly
at the head though she was in reality
only a pawn in birsks game he had
expected to do all this alone but he
had discovered that the two chests
containing the crown jewels had been
sunk hi a central basin on bakelief
island to such a depth that there was
 hope of raising them except by
some extraordinary means  

  hell what a lot of work put in
merwin gloomily

    remember he was playing a game
for millions-or billions said dr
trask and then he continued he
got together quite a group of im-
perialists on bakelief among them
was count alexius karlak an ad-
miral in the imperial regime birsk
had to have karlaks advice as to how
to raise the chests but karlak could
think of  way they could get down
to where the jewels were it seems
that bakelief was of volcanic forma-
tion in prehistoric times but the sea
finally cutting its way into it had
been condensed to steam by the heat
and then blew the whole top of the
island into the heavens the jewels
were sunk in the inner basin which
was really the old crater of the vol-
cano and hence of great depth the
pressure at such a depth avould be
too great for any diving-engine then
known to science

    for the time being they were
helpless to do anything toward raising
the chests and perhaps the story
would have ended then and there had
it not been for karlak karlak and
perhaps two others on the island were
the only ones sincere in their desire to
raise the jewels and finance a counter-
revolution the rest of them were a
crowd of blacklegs who were in it for
what they could get-but you may

guess that birsk had no intention they
should get very much

  about that time the inventor
shepard-john shepard-had invent-
ed an undersea engine capable of
withstanding terrific depth pressures
shepard was a naturalist as well as
an inventor and he had designed his
engine for studying undersea life
birsk tried to interest him in the proj-
ect of raising the jewels but shep-
ard who had so much money he could
afford to be eccentric contended that
there was enough gold in the world
already to keep the nations continu-
ally at bloodshed so he would do
nothing to add to the hoard

  nothing they could do would en-
list his sympathies so karlak who
was really a fanatic and would stop
at nothing in his desire to re-establish
tsarism in russia conceived the idea
of stealing the engine or diving-bell
or whatever it was this was fairly
easy for a bold man karlak as a
former naval officer secured the
berth of captain on shepards yacht
the narcissus which had been
equipped with the diving-bell one
by one as he could karlak replaced
the american crew of the narcissus
with men of his own choosing-men
from bakelief of course

    but where does this saranoff come
in demanded merwin impatiently
was he killed in that duel along
the markinoff road or- 

  i am coming to that now said
trask saranoff was not killed as
you may have guessed he was left
for dead however he came to some
time later but that blow on the head
had deprived him of his memory
years later he drifted to america and
finally to san francisco there he
was seen and recognized by karlak
avho was preparing the narcissus for
that last voyage of hers avhen they
intended to steal her karlak had by
that time come to doubt birsks sin-
cerity but since the secret of what
had really happened on the markin-


weird tales

off road was locked up in saranoffs
brain there was nothing to be done
about it then so he shipped saranoff
on the narcissus as a steward blindly
hoping that some day he might find
the key which would turn the secret
clear to the light of day naturally
he iniew he must keep saranoff out of
birsks sight for birsk would surely
recognize him

  now what happened after that
was this they stole the narcissus as
they had planned they went to the
island gained the inner basin by a
concealed channel and hid the yacht
there safe from pursuit

  it is at about this point in their
history that i want to get hearnes
soul back into the body of saranoff-
and leave it there also my soul will
go back into the body of birsk yours
into the body of metkanoff who was
birsks lieutenant on bakelief island
and my wifes back into the grand
duchess tatiana romanoff you and
i by aid of those pellets in the ring
will return here to our proper bodies
when we have learned the exact where-
abouts of the jewels-on bakelief we
will leave the other two there they
will be well disposed of

 but what of the two empty
bodies here demanded merwin
what we gonna tell the police

  thats easy we will simply say
they died from causes unknown to us
an autopsy will fail to reveal the
slightest trace of foul play we-you
and i-will be absolved from all
blame

  all the same objected merwin
uneasily i dont see yet why we
have to go through all this rigmarole
now that we know you can get the
ring back there in the other life all
you have to do is to go back there
yourself using me for a control like
you did in that other experiment last
year and then hunt around for the
chests until you find them

  thats about the way youd try to
do it sneered dr trask and a lot
youd learn

  well whats the matter with the

idea then

   just this saranoff as steward of
the narcissus was brought secretly to
bakelief and there in the course of
time he got into a duel with birsk
in the middle of the duel he regained
his memory recognized birsk and by
superior swordsmanship killed him
of course when birsk was killed his
soul was released and i ceased getting
any more pulsations from it that
ended it so far as i was concerned

  then as youll remember i tried
you you were getting pulsations
from metkanoffs soul but he was
killed too and so that ended your
usefulness  

  well then how about the wo-
man said merwin jerking his
thumb back toward the rest of the
house

  all said dr trask thats just
it she was getting pulsations from
tatiana romanoff tatiana found the
jewels she and saranoff were together
when she found them but that was
just before they died she and sa-
ranoff were together in some sort of a
cavern on bakelief-it was all dark
so my wife couldnt tell me much
about it but as near as i could make
out they were trapped in this cavern
by the tide and then were sitting on
the chest-sitting on it merwin ye
gods but they were drowned and
that ended it of course  

  how about karlak and the rest
of em on bakelief

  all killed-every mothers son of
em there was some sort of a fight
after the duel karlak was killed on
the yacht and the rest of the crowd
were caught in some sort of a land-
slide in one of the island caverns i
figured it out that perhaps they were
chasing saranoff and tatiana but
i couldnt get much out of my wife
then when she learned that i was
birsk she got antagonistic and when
the subject is antagonistic to the con-
trol the pulsations are very faint
she hates me now-but ill fix her
the isle of lost souls



merwin stared moodily at the ceil-
ing for a moment see here
trask he exclaimed at last i dont
yet see why we all have to go back
and live through those events once
more thats mighty ticklish busi-
ness to my way of thinkin  sup-
posin something went wrong and we
couldnt get back to our own bodies-
wed be wanderin souls then-lost
souls awful now why cant you
get another man to go back there
while you act as his control maybe
you could find one whod know where
the jewels were if he was sent back
into the body of one of them russians
on that island

  no imbecile snapped dr
trask didnt i tell you every one
of them was killed  i got as near to
the jewels as i could with my wife
theyre concealed in some subter-
ranean cavern on bakelief it is
necessary that all four of us go back
for this reason the events of birsks
life tatiana romanoffs life met-
kan offs life and saranoffs life out
there in the other dimension are as
they are not one of those persons
has the power to change them but
we have one of us alone couldnt
do it but all four together can our
ability to do so arises from what is
called our psychic power there is a
certain force or power called psychic
power which surrounds the soul of
each and every human being it is a
power which is rarely almost never
used except by mediums and persons
endowed with occult powers now
when my soul goes back into birsks
body this psychic power goes along
with it i have an unusually large
amount of it because i have realized
its value and so have developed it
but you also have it my wife has it
and hearne has it though you three
have it in lesser degree than i

    this psychic power is a free
agent it is the only thing in the
universe which is not subject to the
dictates of what we call fate when
our souls are near together in space-

as they will be sometime after we go
back into those other bodies-this
psychic power intermingles it is
pooled so to speak being a free
agent it has a very decided effect on
the space laws of the universe if
there is enough of it these laws may
be temporarily suspended in its pres-
ence once back in the bodies of
these russians we shall find ourselves
very much hampered in what we wish
to do by the laws of space for in-
stance if you wished to seize a pistol
and kill somebody at a certain mo-
ment you might not be able to do it
because of the laws of space there
might be a dimension between you
and the pistol or between you and the
man you wished to kill your bullet
could not transcend this dimension
hence you could not kill this person
even though he were in plain sight to
you you must remember that when
we are back there in the bodies of
those russians a very different set of
space laws will govern our actions it
will not be the same set of laws which
governs our actions here nor the same
set which governs their actions there
we shall be between the two as it
were but in the presence of this
reservoir of psychic power which will
be at hand when all four of us are
in close proximity we can suspend
these space laws for the time being and
do what we will we shall be able to
kill whom we will when wre will and
where we will regardless of the dif-
ferent dimensions of space thus it
is my plan when we get to the point
where saranoff kills birsk to reverse
matters and have birsk kill saranoff
in that way i shall prolong birsks
life enabling my own soul to remain
in his body until i have discovered
the whereabouts of the jewels then
by aid of the pellets in the ring you
and i shall return here enter into our
own bodies and then go back to ba-
kelief island in an ordinary way and
help ourselves to the jewels wherever
they are therein lies my reason for
wanting you and the others back in


weird tales

their bodies i have need of the addi-
tional psychic power which accrues to
your souls is that clear   

  at that moment the bell rang from
the hallway and the two men arose

  merwin leaned over and touched
di trask on the arm im with
you trask he muttered but see
to it that you dont try no monkey

business with me or-

  the dark menace in his face served
better than words for the remainder
of the sentence

	the second experiment

contrary to dr trasks advice
ralph heame had slept but little
that night haunting him constantly
was that still pale face etched on the
wall by the wan moonlight sifting
through the window in his tiny bed-
chamber the next day pale and
haggard he presented himself at the
house of dr trask where he was met
at the door by the psychiatrist himself
there was no sign of mrs trask about-
the house hearne did not wait for
directions this time but threw him-
self into the laboratory chair with a
willingness that brought sardonic
smiles to the lips of trask and the
burly merwin

  this time said dr trask draw-
ing forth the phial i shall give you
a heavier dose than usual because you
must remain under the spell for a
long time ready now  

  he poured the contents of the gob-
let into the young mans mouth and
watched him closely as he sank with
a sigh into the trancelike sleep at a
sign from trasks hand merwin
threw in the switch

  tell me what you are doing di-
rected dr trask peering into
hearnes half-closed eyes

    i am on a ship-a yacht steaming
through sunlit seas i am carrying a
tray with food down a narrow com-
panionway- 

  the name of the ship demand-
ed dr trask his voice tense

  narcissus

  dr trask signed for merwin to
throw off the current everything
is well set he gloated rubbing his
hands ill move the dials up a bit
-and then for the rest of us  

  merwin went to a closet from which
he pulled forth three other chairs rep-
licas of the one in which the un-
conscious hearne was seated all of
these he placed side by side connect-
ing them up with wires from the glass-
enclosed apparatus on the bench be-
hind them dr trask hurried out of
the room to appear a moment later
carrying in his arms the limp form of
a woman it was mrs trask breath-
ing heavily her body rank with the
sickish odor of chloroform trask
placed her in the chair next to
hearne forced water from a tumbler
between her lips and placed two
electrodes in her hands this done he
signed to merwin to throw home the
switch

  tell me what you are doing he
commanded the somnolent form of
the woman

  i am seated in a small room with
log walls hewn green from the trees
there is an old woman standing by
handing me food on a rough wooden
platter through an open window at
my side i gaze out to foggy wind-
swept space we are hi the air-no
we are in a small cabin on a high
rocky cliff below is the sea-gray

  bakelief island muttered trask
signing merwin to throw the switch
and now for ourselves merwin
they seated themselves in the chairs
beside hearne and mrs trask grip-
ping copper electrodes between their
fingers each held before his lips a
glass full of water

  now said dr trask

  they tossed the liquid into their
mouths and as they sank back dr
trask kicked a small lever with his
foot immediately the room was
filled with a loud humming as the
current passed through the four un-
the isle of lost souls



conscious bodies in the chairs four
long sighs escaped as from one mouth
then silence save for the subdued
hum of the current and the steady
tick-toek of the clock on the wall

	phantom ships

ralph hearne stood on the deck of
the narcissus as she fled north-
ward a swift silent greyhound
matching her dun flanks with the
darkening gray of sea and sky until
now he had seen everything as through
a thin veil of mist-a swift kaleid-
oscope of events in which he seemed
to have no part there had been a
mutiny he had seen a yacht stolen
from her owner on the high seas and
that owner turned adrift in an open
boat with his wife and children then
there had come a searing blinding
flash in his brain followed by swift
rushing blackness which in turn
gave way to the open day once more
but now it was different whereas
before he had felt everything seen
everything but vaguely now all was
clear distinct and sharply defined
against the inner retina of his con-
sciousness before it might have been
a moving picture in soft focus-a pic-
ture in which he moved and took part
like the others hearing voices afar off
and moving without volition of his
own in that picture he might have
been a phantom on a phantom ship
manned by phantom sailors running
in a phantom sea but now he felt
the wind keen and real against his
brow and the water swished and
hissed under the drive of the ships
propellers in a way that was very
real indeed he stamped his foot
feeling the solid unyielding deck be-
neath him heard the thump of his
soles on the heavy planking

  the downward glance brought his
feet within his vision he noticed
they were encased in heavy footgear
unfamiliar to him and his trousers
they were dark blue whereas he had
been wearing gray what could it

all mean  and then it came to him-
dr trask of course the psychia-
trist had said he must give him a
heavier dose of the drug than before
doubtless that was why everything
seemed so much clearer

  and then a vague uneasiness stole
over him he became conscious of
what he had not been conscious of be-
fore in that soft-focus picture he was
not aware before that his clothing-
his body-was any other than his own
but now-and it dawned on him in a
sudden flash-this was not his body
it moved about the decks in a way
that confused and sickened him
without any volition from him it
went into the companionway and
down the ladder he felt its lips
moving heard it talking with these
others they called him steward
and they talked to him in a language
which was not english and yet when
he eased up a bit-became less tense
-he understood russian of course
then he observed bit by bit that when
he lay back took things more easily
allowed himself to go hither and yon
at the will of this other mans body
he felt more at ease there was less
of a strain and the sickening sensa-
tion faded when he let himself
go altogether it faded entirely
obviously the thing to do was to
fall in with this fellows wishes-to
lend himself completely to this fel-
lows will

 it was boris saranoffs body of
course it all came back to hearne
bit by bit no cause for alarm trask
had merely given him a heavier dose
than usual still it was uncanny
before in the soft picture he hadnt
been conscious of ralph hearne-he
had felt himself all saranoff though
these feelings had been faint now he
felt himself hearne separated by a
wide gulf from saranoff and yet in
saranoffs body what had hap-
pened had something gone wrong
when would the experiment end
perhaps somebody else could tell him
something about it none of these fel-


weird tales

lows-but there was that man on the
bridge-karlak the captain lie
would go and ask karlak

  he started forward felt suddenly
a blinding stab of pain and then that
same sickening sensation and then
without just knowing how he got
there he found himself side by side
with karlak

  sir said he i didnt realize
you were so near will you tell me
what has happened-why i am here
on this ship   

  karlak smiled oh said he it
is a simple matter the spirit-the
soul of ralph hearne has been cast
out of its own body and back into the
body of boris saranoff there are
two souls now in saranoffs body
yours and his you are conscious of
his but he is unconscious of yours
see he walks about the deck over
there quite oblivious of what has hap-
pened  

  hearne turned and to his amaze-
ment saw the body of saranoff walk-
ing about the deck several yards away
and then looking down at his own
feet he saw that he was still in sa-
ranoff s body how could that be
were there two saranoffs

  karlak laughed dont get con-
fused said he fate has ordained
what saranoff shall do-even down to
the slightest step about the deck of
this ship naturally when the soul
of ralph hearne seeks to do some-
thing which is not ordained for the
body of boris saranoff then hearnes
soul breaks loose from saranoffs
body but inasmuch as no soul may
wander about the universe free of a
body then saranoffs body splits
across the dimension you have it
and so does he though you may be
separated by many yards it is the
result of a conscious effort of your
will you feel already a great pain
and fatigue do you not that is be-
cause the cosmic forces of the universe
tend to draw you back into saranoffs
body these forces are like elastic
bands-pulling pulling always pull-

ing toward what has been ordained by
fate when you yield to them and
allow your will to be subservient to
them then your soul goes back into
his body and the strain ceases the
only reason why you are able to
break loose at all is that you are en-
dowed with certain psychic force-it
is greater in some individuals than in
others-and this psychic power is the
only thing in the universe which is
not subservient to fate every hu-
man soul is born with a certain
amount of this power it may be
greater or less  

  you must be another dr trask
to know and understand all this
said hearne marveling

  oh dont confuse me with the
karlak up there on the bridge see
karlak himself is still up there
hearne glancing up toward the
bridge saw that he was not talking to
the man he supposed though the be-
ing opposite him seemed to be an
exact copy   i am the spirit karlak
as distinguished from the karlak on
the bridge to whom you thought you
were speaking i am karlaks uni-
versal soul while karlak himself is
an offshoot from me-an individual
soul so to speak

  but why are you here demand-
ed hearne puzzled

  well it is ordained by fate that
certain things shall happen on this
vessel it has all been ordered down
to the slightest movement that any of
these men shall make no allowance
was made by fate for the coming of
a second soul into saranoffs body
so when that second soul which is
you try to do something-try to go
somewhere-take steps not ordained
by fate for saranoff-then something
must happen you project yourself
out of saranoffs true body and you
desire to speak to karlak there on the
bridge but it is not ordained that
he shall talk with you or with saran-
off at this moment so something else
must happen you can not speak to
karlak because a dimension of space
the isle of lost souls



lies between you and him-he could
not hear you though you can hear
him although your soul has been
thrown back into saranoffs body you
are not fully in the same dimension
as he you are in what is called the
interspace dimension-which is a di-
mension-a sub-dimension if you will
-lying between your own world-
the world which you just left-and
saranoffs world this inter-space
dimension is what you in your world
call the fourth dimension

  now in the fourth dimension the
will of the individual plays a much
more important part than it does in
the three-dimension worlds hence
when you exert your will to speak
with karlak you can not speak with
the individual karlak who is sep-
arated from you by a dimension but
you can speak with that part of him
which is in every dimension and that
part is his universal soul hence your
will to talk with me summons me to
your side for i am karlaks uni-
versal soul i am what might be
called a true spirit i am the spirit
karlak you might say

  blit why do you come in kar-
laks form asked heame

  because you willed it so when
you thought of speaking to karlak
you had a picture of him in your
minds eye hence you see me as he
is and fuxthermore it is a law of the
universe that no soul shall go about
space without being clothed in some
form or other that does not apply
to lost souls-they lose all form and
wander through eternity subject to
no law save the law of pain and suf-
fering  

    i begin to understand it all now 
said heame with a sigh of relief   i
was beginning to worry i thought
something might have gone wrong
with our experiment back there in my
own world i was afraid i might not
be able to get back to my own world
my own body

  the face of the spirit karlak went
suddenly very grave you have a

great deal to worry about he said
as a matter of fact you are in a
very dangerous situation if i were
you i should seize upon the first op-
portunity to get back to my proper
body in my proper dimension
why is that asked hearne
just this my friend your soul
came into this dimension by means of
the individual soul of boris saranoff
but should saranoff die as i know he
will very soon and you are not yet
returned to ralph hearnes body
then there will be no way for you to
return you will be a lost soul wan-
dering without form through space
and subject to great mental agony and
torture because you will be out of
harmony with the universe and hence
will have no place in it it is the real
hell go i say make haste-return
before it is too late  

 but dr trask can bring me
back he is my control

  dr trask can no longer do so
he has himself come into the fourth
dimension to occupy the body of
gregory birsk of which his own body
is the reincarnation he has brought
two others with him he can not
and will not bring you back

  cant you advise me-cant you
tell me what to do-cant you see
what is to happen demanded
heame in a panic

    i can foresee for the others on this
ship said the spirit karlak but
for you the future is veiled to me i
can tell you only what has already
happened to you and those others of
your party i can tell you that they
are here in this world with you and
they mean you no good-at least two
of them do not with the woman it
is different  

  mrs trask demanded heame
horrified

  yes she is here-against her will
however there is a way out of it
for you you see that ring  your
finger on saranoffs finger ages
ago as you would say in the three-
dimension world there was a russian


weird tales

astrologer who worked out the true
theory of the fourth dimension and
the transmigration of souls just as
dr trask has done as a matter of
fact he was a previous reincarnation
of dr trask but he went farther
than dr trask in that he hit upon a
drug which enabled him to dispense
with earthly control when he went
out into another dimension he made
this drug into greenish pellets and
concealed them in a ring so that it
should ahvays be with him he died
in time and only two of the pellets
were left before his death how-
ever he had written up his experi-
ments and left them in the archives
of the kremlin at moscow dr trask
discovered them meanwhile the ring
containing the pellets had fallen into
other hands its true meaning was
unknown but because of its peculiar
workmanship it came to be a russian
imperial heirloom supposed to be a
talisman against danger it was giv-
en to saranoff by tatiana romanoff
he now wears it take one of the
pills my friend and be off with you
ere it is too late  

  but mrs trask hearne cried
what of her by god man i will
not go back and leave her here to
face it alone  

  the spirit karlak shrugged his
shoulders be it on your own head
then   he murmured   i have
warned you i can do no more 

    is there no way i can control dr
trasks action asked heame in
desperation

the spirit karlak nodded thought-
fully remember what i have
told you about the free psychic force
which gathers about every soul in
its presence the events which fate
has ordained may be broken you
could not do it alone-your psychic
power is not sufficient-but when you
and dr trask and his lieutenant
metkanoff and mrs trask are all
together near each other this same
psychic power is pooled ready to the

hand of whoever uses it first all to-
gether you might break through and
change fate but remember one
thing-although you may break the
course of events substitute events of
your own making-the tendency al-
ways is for events to snap back into
place as fate ordained therefore
if by the pooling of your several
psychic powers you are able to pro-
long the life of boris saranoff beyond
the point where it has been ordained
he shall die then you must watch out
for it has been ordained he shall die
therefore fate will see to it that he is
killed at the first favorable opportun-
ity for example you might be-
cause of your psvehic power prevent
his being drowned-as it has been or-
dained-but at the very moment of
his getting out of the water in safety
a rock might fall off the cliff and kill
him do you understand  his death
having been ordained would be
brought about at the very next fa-
vorable combination of circum-
stances  

  i think i understand now said
heame during the first experi-
ment by dr trask i was only re-
ceiving pulsations from saranoffs
soul while my own soul remained in
its proper body but now for some
reason dr trask has thrown my soul
out of my own body into the body of
boris saranoff so that i am completely
cut off from my own body i foresee
that i shall have trouble with dr
trask in this world could i do any-
thing against him physically could
i disable him kill him would he be
immune to a bullet for example
could i take a pistol from saranoffs
world and kill trask who comes from
another world   

  you could subject to certain laws
of space replied the spirit karlak
but everything must come to you
through the hands of boris saranoffs
true body for instance you couldnt
project yourself from saranoffs body
and go down to the gun-rack in the
cabin and take one of the rifles there
the isle of lost souls



you couldnt touch that rifle because
you would be separated from it by a
dimension of space but if saranoff
himself went down and got the rifle
then that rifle would be available to
you so long as it remained in his
hands you could do what you want-
ed to do with that rifle regardless of
what he did with it so long as it re-
mained in his hands

  the situation is this when your
soul came into the body of boris sar-
anoff every atom in his body split
malting two bodies where there was
but one before in one of these bodies
his soul lives in the other is yours
the two bodies arc identical even to
the clothing and the articles in the
pockets it was this second body
which housed your soul when you
thrust yourself forward to speak to
me it will continue to house your
soul until either you are killed or
saranoff is killed-and then it will be
destroyed if you return to your own
body it will be reabsorbed into saran-
off s body without being destroyed
the atoms will reunite and there will
be but one body once more you
might call the body which houses
saranoffs soul his true body but that
does not mean that the one which
houses your soul is by any means a
false one in your sense of the term
though well call it that for the sake
of clarity

  now as i have already intimated
saranoffs true body and his false
body are identical in every respect
even down to the contents of the
pockets and the clothing but you
must remember that you are in one di-
mension whereas he is in another
hence a dimension separates these two
bodies that is why you in the false
body can not reach across the dimen-
sion and take the rifle which is in the
rack below decks you might pro-
ject yourself down there but you
could not touch the rifle nor anything
in the room

  now as soon as saranoff touches
the rifle and so long as he is touching

it the atoms which make up that rifle
split as did his own body and there
comes to be not only one rifle for him
but also one for you saranoff might
be standing with his rifle on his
shoulder but you would not be bound
by what he was doing with it so long
as some of his body was touching it
you might take it and shoot it at
avliat you would though he stood mo-
tionless with his  

    could i shoot anything i liked   
asked hearne

  no the bullet you fired would
naturally be subject to the same space
laws as the body in which you are
you might fire point-blank at karlak
up there on the bridge or any of the
others on this ship but you couldnt
hit them they wouldn t know it
but you could hit persons avho are
moving in the same dimension as you
are hoav you could hit dr trask
for example trask is noav in birsks
body on bakelief island supposing
you came upon birsk avhile the rifle
was in your hands you could shoot
at birsk and the bullet avould kill
trask though birsk avould knoav
nothing of avliat had happened and
if trask had projected himself out of
birsks body you could fire at birsks
false body in avhich trask avas and
kill trask by the same token boris
saranoff could take the true rifle and
shoot at birsk and kill him but in
that case it would be arery bad for
trask because birsks soul being re-
leased from his body there would be
no way for trask to get back to his
oavn avorld his avould be a lost soul
-a possibility i have just avamed you
against  

  i see said hearne anything
we in the fourth dimension do does
not affect them but everything they
do affects us

  exactly but i must tell you one
thing more dont think that so long
as saranoff has the rifle in his hand
there is a limitless supply of rifles
available to you should you lose
your rifle you can not still have it


weird tales

just beeause he hasnt lost his but
on the other hand if lie loses his then
yours is lost also it doesnt work
both ways you see therefore i warn
you not to lose the ring there are
really two rings now-one for you and
one for him but if you lose yours
you can not help yourself to his but
if he loses his then yours is lost with
it

  dr trask is subject to these same
laws i cant see that he has any ad-
vantage over me 

  ah yes but remember that
trask understands this thing far bet-
ter than you do he will not make
the mistakes that you will make and
furthermore he has a much greater
f-syehic power than yours and hence
he can project himself out of birsks
body over greater distances he will
have more freedom of motion beyond
birsks body than you will have be-
yond saranoffs you can not go
much more than a few yards out of
saranoffs body without suffering
tremendous strain trask could go
much farther before he would be
obliged to relax baek into the body of
birsk and rest and he understands
pretty thoroughly the value of the
psychic power he has developed his
own psychic power about to the limit
for a person who has little but hatred
in his nature if his were a loving
nature he could go much farther in
that ease he might almost be able to
change fate unaided by the psychie
powers of other persons love is the
greatest dynamo oi psychic power

  i dont see how he or anybody
else could alter fate without breaking
down the laws of the universe-the
laws of space that you have just de-
scribed to me put in heame

  of course not my friend but
that is precisely what can happen in
the presence of sufficient psychic
power the laws of the universe-the
laws of space-may be suspended
elms if other earthling souls like
yours were on this ship in close prox-
imity to each other and the pool of

psychic power were sufficiently great
then you could do almost what you
wished you could for instance go
down into the cabin seize a pistol and
come up here and shoot any one of
the men on these decks whether they
were from your world or not the
psychie power transcends space it is
the only thing in the universe which
is not subject to immutable law more
than that it can temporarily at least
suspend immutable space law

   but i see now that you are suf-
fering intensely from ithe mental
strain of projecting your soul out of
saranoffs real body you had best
go back and rest there you can call
on me again when you please  

  i think i shall do so said
heame

  the spirit karlak raised a warning
finger remember you can not wait
too long your road back to your
own world lies through the soul of
saranoff and that soul is soon to de-
part for he is doomed  

hearne relaxing with a sigh of re-
lief found himself once more in
the body of saranoff he looked
around but the spirit karlak had
vanished the narcissus had been
running since daybreak through
thick blankets of fog which lifted oc-
casionally to show the sea dancing in
the sunlight but came down again
soon as though loth to allow them a
full hour of clear weather saranoff
was going forward and so heame re-
laxed fully permitting his mind to
be carried wherever the russian
willed saranoff was on the bridge
now but karlak and another officer
brillitz the second in command paid
no attention to him being absorbed
in working the vessel through the
murk aheaid there was another here
too an american whom heame
through saranoffs mind knew as
ilillis hillis as he remembered it
now was an employee of shepard the
owner of the narcissus and had been
kidnaped with her doubtless to be em-
the isle of lost souls



ployed in the working of the diving-
bell with which the yacht was
equipped it came to heame then
for the first time that all saranoffs
knowledge was his own he had even
talked to the spirit karl ale in rus-
sian though that tongue was unknown
to ralph heame doubtless they
might have spoken in english for the
spirit karlak being for the most part
omniscient would understand that
tongue too

  the thick gray mist which en-
shrouded the narcissus was rolling
upward once more and heame heard
karlak tell brillitz that bakelief
island should not be more than an
hours steaming ahead just then the
wireless operator stepped out of his
cabin abaft the bridge and hurried
up to karlak

  weve been sighted sir by two
united states destroyers they order
you to heave to sir  

  karlak shrugged his shoulders
brillitz said he tell them to give
her full speed ahead  

  the fog now spun high leaving the
yacht in the brilliant clearness of the
sunshine following karlaks glance
astern hearne saw two smudges of
smoke on the horizon a half-hour
later their funnels appeared above the
oceans rim pouring forth great
clouds of smoke

  land ho came a cry from the
lookout in the crows-nest of the nar-
cissus

  bakelief muttered karlak

  give us the fog again and we shall
lose them easily

  at that instant there was a puff
of white vapor from one of the des-
troyers and a shell shrieked across the
bow of the narcissus plunging into
the sea with a slender geyser of water
shot heavenward to mark the spot
directly in her course the fog was
now settling down once more like a
thick gray curtain shutting out the
small blot on the horizon which
marked the headlands of bakelief
island into this blanket of swirling

grayness they plunged at full speed
the curtain draping down about the
wake of the yacht and leaving her
alone on the ocean once more as
karlak had hoped the fog had
blanketed them from the view of their
pursuers

  at that instant out of the murk to
starboard rushing like a great lion
from its cave came a ship under full
steam the narcissus lay directly in
her path heame saw that less than
fifty yards of sea parted the two ves-
sels a crash was inevitable sara-
noff however was standing there
gazing at it without a flicker of emo-
tion so heame thinking the rus-
sian had suddenly fallen asleep in his
tracks shouted a warning to karlak
but that grizzled mariner paid not the
slightest attention his eyes still rivet-
ed on the swirling mass over-the nar-
cissus bows

  heame saw the men on the decks
of the approaching vessel run for-
ward heard faint cries of consterna-
tion and an instant later her siren
gave a faint blast-so very faint that
heame could scarcely hear it her
helmsman had obviously jammed her
wheel hard down for she began to
swerve sharply but the intervening
distance was too short the nar-
cissus lay full in her path

  heame screamed another warning
to karlak and then threw himself
flat on the bridge deck awaiting the
crash

  it never came gazing up in stupe-
faction he saw the onrushing vessel
pass completely through the nar-
cissus just abaft the funnels not a
creak not a shiver from the yacht
not a sound save the throb of the
narcissus engines the yacht as it
seemed to hearne should have been
cut through from rail to rail and yet
she steamed on quite unscathed

  glancing about him heame saw
that he was once again out of the body
of saranoff and that while he lay on
the deck saranoff stood above him
paying not the slightest heed and


weird tales

then he realized he had done some-
thing which saranoff was not to do
hence he had projected his soul in the
counterpart of saranoffs time body
he thought of the spirit karlak and
in that instant he saw the spirit kar-
lak standing beside him he got up
bewildered

 did you see that gasped
hearne

  oh that coast guard cutter yes
i saw her  

 but-but what happened they
rammed us

  nothing happened my friend
you see were moving in the fourth
dimension and they in the third di-
mension and so they couldnt possibly
hit us to make the matter clearer to
you ill say that some eighty odd
years intervened between the moment
when the narcissus crossed this spot
and when that cutter crossed it so
you see were well out of their
reach  

    but they saw us they swerved  
no they didnt see us exaetly
you see this ship is separated from
them by the fourth dimension but
the presence of your soul with your
free psychic power on board has af-
fected the entire ship to some extent
the narcissus has been given a kind
of vague outline a sort of earthly
nimbus which makes us partially vis-
ible to their eyes naturally because
of the fog they thought we were real

so they tried to avoid a collision
they ll go back now and ieport that
they sighted a phantom ship that
ship was in your own world

    then that explains why people in
my world sometimes see ghosts   said
hearne

    exactly some disturbance of the
ether or a great increase in the psychic
power of some soul loitering in the
fourth dimension gives visible form
to them and then your eyes see of
course saranoff and karlak and the
rest of them on board here saw noth-
ing that ship didnt exist so far as
they are concerned

    now if one of those shells from
that destroyer hit us would that go
through us without harm asked
hearne

  no indeed those destroyers are
moving in the same dimension as the
narcissus they could sink her if
they got near enough but they will
not we are very close to bakelief
now and within the hour we shall
have entered the passage between the
cliffs this passage is concealed from
the sea it leads into the inner basin
which was the crater of bakelief when
the island was a volcano once we
are in there the whole united states
navy could not find the narcissus un-
less they used airplanes and even then
it would be doubtful because flying
in these latitudes is extremely danger-
ous  

the thrilling events at bakelief island and the efforts
of dr trask to change the coarse of fate
will be narrated in weird

weird tales

court and then like the ever-widen-
ing rings in a pool where a stone is
cast softly died away

  from inside the door came a noise
of dropping of chains the house
itself was as dark and dead as ever
not a light appeared at any of
the blank paneless windows that
frowned out into the street how-
ever the door opened a crack and
the old man skulked through be-
hind him the door closed softly and
outside was nothing but stillness and
decay and the softly falling flakes of
heavy snow

  the interior of the house was both
dark and still but the old man hug-
ging the wall kept forward there
was no sign of the person who had
opened the door the hall was black
and silent and as cold as the street
outside

  following the winding corridor
now this way now that now climb-
ing stairs now descending flights of
steps the old man made his way
constantly keeping as close to the
wall as possible limping slowly
painfully but always certainly for-
ward

  the twisting hall finally ended be-
fore a blank white wall that seemed
almost to glow in the darkness soft-
ly the old man ran a long-fingered
bony hand over the walls surface
and suddenly avith noiseless pre-
cision it divided in the middle he
hurried through and the door closed
silently behind him

  this second corridor was dimly
lighted it was straight but long
stretching away and growing almost
invisible in the deep shadows the
old man with the crippled leg 
longer hugged the avail but walked
jerkily doavn the center at the end
of this corridor was a avail similar to
the first this too opened and
closed without a sound after he had
passed

  this second hidden door opened
into a room-a huge chamber floored
in black and yelloav marble in

strange design there were no win-
dows visible and the avails from
ceiling to floor avere hung avith black
and yelloav velvet curtains in one
corner giving the only illumination
avas a huge gold lamp on a dull
black pedestal in the center of the
room was a large black screen on
avhich designs avere draavn in gold
save for the screen and lamp no
furniture was visible and no one avas
in this silent place of black and gold
the old man avas indeed an incon-
gruous figure amid this somber rich-
ness with his shabby clothes his
frayed linen and broken boots and
his scraggly whiskers avet from
melted snoav

  he clapped his hands together
sharply tavice one of the yelloav
curtains was pushed aside and a
huge negro all of seven feet tall
entered folded his hands across his
breast and avith bowed head stood
avaiting the old man avithout turn-
ing spoke i am to have a visitor
tonight ki you will meet him at
the outer door and bring hint here
number one already has his instruc-
tions and remember little one keep
close to the wall beyond the third
door  

  apparently this amused him for
he cackled hoarsely-a peculiar
coughing laugh

  and remember behind the ear-
behind the ear begone uoav for he
comes soon

  the negro boaved and avas gone

 the old man still chuckling
hoarsely to himself limped sloavly
across the room and vanished
through another curtain leaving the
yelloav lamp to glow evilly in the noav
deserted room

np he empty and decayed houses
- frightened the well groomed
young man avho hurried along carry-
ing a heavy traveling-bag the place
was so old so lonely the dim
flickering of old gas lamps here and
there only accentuated the darkness
the soul tube



between them the old houses with
their broken windows and gaping
doors their flapping shutters and
tumbled-down chimneys were both
desolate and grimly terrifying he
paused irresolutely about to turn
back but he had given his word and
had been promised something in re-
turn and this fact drove him on he
knew that the city was very old and
that parts of it had fallen into disuse
and had been allowed to rot and de-
cay but he had never realized until
now how badly the years had treated
this section of the old town

  from the warm south had he come
some months before now he longed
to hear the murmur of the wind in
the palms the soft lapping of the
water on the beaches how he had
swum and played all through those
lazy happy years but how cold it
was now  the wind bit even through
his heavy ulster damn this coun-
try anyway but he had no one to
blame but himself for being here
he had always longed to see this
town so he had come job after job
he had held only to lose them the
north had no placo for a lazy south-
erner who wished to take his time in
all matters only this afternoon he
had been given the blue envelope
after his rent was paid he had only
a few small coins to jingle disconso-
lately in his pockets he had been
wandering along wondering what
he was going to do when a hand
touched him on the shoulder turn-
ing he saw a little crippled old man
hobbling along beside him

 whats the matter son you
look discouraged

  for some reason the younger man
found himself drawn to this little
old man and was soon pouring out
his story of his failure to hold work
of his homesickness and all the other
matters that troubled him

 and you havent been here
long

 no i havent about three
months  

 and you dont know anyone
here

  no sir i havent had time or
money enough to make friends
too bad that too bad you
have a fine figure my boy some-
thing of an athletfe i suppose able
to take care of yourself in any kind
of trouble

  well i played football in col-
lege and i can ride and swim was
intercollegiate fencing champ also
well now thats fine you dont
dissipate do you-drink or such
like

  not much puts you in bad con-
dition  

    fine fine  and you havent any
work what a pity and you
dont know anyone here and dont
want to stay here fine fine  
chortled the old man rubbing his
hands how would you like to
have a position taking care of an
old man-a sort of nurse companion 
pay you well and you would go
south for the winter

  the young man was taken aback
at such an offer either this ragged
old man was crazy or he himself
was demented such offers were not
made upon a city street the old
man looking slyly up at him seemed
to see the thoughts in his mind
no i am not crazy the man who
employs me is to say the least a
bit eccentric and it was his idea
that i should do this go out upon
the city streets until i met a young
man friendless and jobless-a young
man who needed help-one who had
no bad habits and the airs of a gen-
tleman with the body of an athlete
you have fulfilled all these qualifica-
tions save one which i have not
mentioned the man must be fear-
less and able to face danger without
flinching can you face death-
even be prepared to meet trouble
more than half-way my employer
is always in danger of attack he is
very wealthy veiy sick and very


weird tales

much afraid what he needs is a
man who can protect him

  the young man laughed here at
last was what he had come to this
city to see and that was excitement
turning to the cripple he said i
am sure i can fill the position not
that i am particularly brave but i
have never been called a coward  
good good said the cripple
and from some hidden place in his
clothes brought forth a dirty card
here is my employers name and
address be there tonight at 
oclock sharp and here is some-
thing to buy you some decent
clothes buy the best and have
yourself carefully barbered buy a
bag with some extra clothes for
travel look well and i am sure the
place will be yours  

  from another pocket he extracted
a wad of bills these he pressed into
the others hand i will see you
later my young friend and until
then good-bye

  it seemed that he melted away
into the crowd-here for a moment
and then gone leaving the other with
a dirty card and a handful of money

 the young man looked on the
card and on it was written asa
cheeney  fish court   count-
ing the money he found that it
amounted to almost five hundred
dollars surely this mysterious mr
cheeney must be eccentric indeed to
employ such a ragged ambassador
who gave so much money and asked
such queer questions well he
would play the game to the end no
matter what might befall him

  after a visit to a barber and a
haberdasher he once more made his
appearance but with what a differ-
ence  for a moment he stopped to
admire himself in a huge mirror it
had indeed been a long time since he
had dressed like this

  he glanced at the new watch on
his wrist it was nearly  oclock
he would have time for dinner and

a show afterward and then on to
fish court

  he chose for his dinner one of the
most elaborate of the many res-
taurants in the heart of the city
the dining-room with its low lights
soft music glitter of silver glow of
glass and shining expanse of white
linen seemed wonderful to him after
months of dirty lunchrooms or noisy
automats the well groomed men
and women around him were vitally
interesting here was a world with
which he had lost touch-that pleas-
ure-loving careless world and he
was once more about to become a
part of it

  with his after-dinner coffee he fell
to thinking about the position he was
to take this mr cheeney who needed
a brave man afraid of nothing-who
were the people he feared who made
his life dangerous who was he
what had he done  what did he look
like would he himself be un-
afraid would he pass the approval
of the man and where was fish
court-down near the waterfront
somewhere a queer neighborhood
for a rich man but then a man who
hired crippled and ragged old men
and went about his work so mysteri-
ously was not accountable

  outside the snow was whirling
about now and then a gust of wind
rattled the heavily leaded panes he
shivered how he hated this snow-
bound wind-racked country but
soon he was going soiith and would
leave behind all the things he hated
here for some reason he felt sure
he would satisfy the queer old mans
qualifications

the yellow lamp in the room be-
hind the third door glowed
brighter for a moment then winked
out only to shine softly once more
the flickering and dying out of the
lamp was as if some current had
been snapped on and off mo-
mentarily from behind one of the
black curtains came a strange sound
the soul tube



-a metallic clicking and purring
with now and then a sharp staccato
beat in the midst of its whining
and singing the hidden machinery
ceased and a bent little figure scur-
ried into the room wheeling before
it a table on which were odd-shaped
metal rings at each of its four cor-
ners this table was placed behind
the screen next a chair was placed
near it and the screen was re-
arranged to hide them both from
a hidden recess a huge leather arm-
chair was drawn close to the screen
and arranged so that anyone using
the chair might be seen and heard by
one behind the screen

  next the bent little old man lifted
from the wall one of the heavy cur-
tains as he pulled it back there was
revealed a huge masldike carving of a
faec with great flapping ears more
than six feet long and three feet
wide this huge image covered the
entire side of one wall he pressed
a concealed button the closed eyes
of the idol opened and green rays of
light shot across the room satisfied
with his inspection the bent little
man closcly examined the yellow
lamp and in its rays he was shown
to be a wizened mongolian with a
dried parchmentlike face so lined
that save for an eaglelike nose no
one feature was prominent

  after touching the lamp here and
there he dropped behind the black
eurtain from which he came the
hidden machinery started once more
and again died down into stillness

hphe snow was still falling in eddy-
ing swirls as the young man left
the restaurant carrying the heavy
traveling-bag he had been instructed
to bring the doorman called a taxi
for him

  drive me to y fish court and
hurry please   said the young man

  the taxi chugged off on and on
through the city went the cab
passing from the brightly lighted sec-
tion to a place where dim street

lights were few and far between
farther and farther it went toward
the oldest section of the city and
finally stopped the driver hopped
out and opened the door

  this is as far as i can go sir
he said beyond here it is too nar-
row for a car to pass fish court is
about three blocks straight down
this street id be careful if i were
you sir down a short way its
supposed to be deserted and no one
hardly ever goes there but ive
heard of strange goings-on you see
most people reckon theres a hidden
arm of the river running through
that district lots of houses have
tumbled down for no reason and
most people are afraid to live there
too its awful old-three hundred
years and more perhaps i shouldnt
say it sir but i dont fancy to have
you go there fish court is no safe
place after dark better go back
with me

  the young man stepped out of the
cab paid his fare and tipped the
driver generously well anyway
sir i  wait here a while for you be-
cause you may come back
thanks my friend but that
wont be necessary i am expected
here good-night

 as he started down the dark
street the departing chug-chug of
the taxi rather annoyed him it was
as if he had cut his last bonds of
kinship with the world despite his
brave front the darkness dinginess
and desertion of the place got on his
nerves the whiteness of the snow
only intensified the grimness and
solitude of this section of the city

  fish court was at the very end of
the street an alleylike cul-de-sac it
was a semicircle of old houses that
towered black and dreary above his
head a battered street sign hang-
ing on an old post showed him he
had reached his destination in none
of the houses were lights visible and
he did not know how he was to see
the number of the place he was seek-


weird tales

ing one after another of them he
tried by the aid of a flickering
match but they showed no number
house after house he tried in this
great semicircle of desolation final-
ly with his matches almost exhaust-
ed he came to the largest and
shabbiest house of all

  walking up the rickety porch he
struck a match over a huge brass
knocker which seemed to grin evilly
at him in the flickering light it was
a devils face the horns and droop-
ing eyes and pointed chin were rare-
ly done

  from a window inside the house
at  fish court two pairs of eyes
that gleamed in the dark watched
his hesitating progress a voice
high and nasal whined through the
dark in some strange tongue there
was no reply but the voice ceased as
though it had been understood

 the booming of the knocker
against the door startled the young
man for the noise though expected
was at variance with the deep still-
ness of the court hardly had the
knocker fallen than the door was
opened and from the darkness came
a high-pitched voice the english
was perfect but with a peculiar
aspirate sound that denoted a per-
son not born to the tongue

  come in sir the master is await-
ing you

  the man outside stepped through
the half-opened door which closed
with a dull sound then came the
rattle of chains and the noise of a
bolt being hastily pushed home the
young man found himself in total
darkness so black and thick that it
seemed as though he could cut it
with a knife from out of the dark-
ness two pairs of eyes like those of
animals glared at him then the
voice spoke again

  the master wishes you to pardon
the lack of lights but he does not
want his living here to be known so
we must live in darkness please

follow this man here he will take
you to our master

  suddenly he spoke in a quavering
singsong voice in a language the
other had never heard then in
english the unseen one spoke again

  you oh ki will conduct our
guest here sir take hold of his
girdle and follow him and remem-
ber keep your shoulder to the wall
as you go down the corridor re-
member keep your shoulder to the
wall the voice of the unseen
speaker stopped in a ghastly chok-
ing laugh keep close to the wall
and follow ki  

  as they proceeded down the inky
black hall the young mans eyes
grew more accustomed to the dark-
ness and he could make out the
shadowy figure of a giant of a man
whose girdle-ends he held firmly in
one hand in the other hand he held
the heavy traveling-bag he had been
asked to bring but as far as seeing
his path was concerned he was as
blind as the proverbial bat he only
knew that his shoulder constantly
rubbed a rough wall and that he
and his silent guide climbed up and
down an innumerable number of
steps however it seemed to him as
if they were maiding steady progress
forward now they twisted in one
direction then suddenly twisted off
into another he soon lost all sense
of direction and followed blindly
after his hurrying guide once he
stumbled over something that lay
in his path and only his tight clutch
on the others girdle kept him from
falling he lost his hold on his bag
and heard a dull splash as if it had
fallen into water he tried to stoop
to recover it but his silent guide did
not pause and perforce he had to
follow

  far down the length of the cor-
ridor he saw a gleam of white and
soon they brought up short before
an unbroken expanse of white wall
that shimmered in the darkness his
almost invisible companion ran a
the soul tube



huge hand over this wall and silent-
ly it divided in half to let them
through as he stepped through the
door in the wall he heard it slide
noiselessly back into place behind
this door was another corridor not
dark like the others but dimly
lighted where the light came from
he had no idea for there were no
globes visible the light although
dim illuminated the hall as far as he
could see

  for the first time he had the op-
portunity to see his strange guide
and strange he was indeed-a huge
negro dressed in a long yellow robe
with a hood that hid his features
without a word the negro hurried
down the hall no longer keeping to
the wall as he had done previously
the man called after him where
are we and where are we going
but the other made no reply so
shrugging his shoulders the young
man followed

  it seemed to him that this second
corridor was longer than the first
he had no idea of the distance they
had tiaveled but he did know it had
taken quite a considerable amount of
time this corridor too ended
abruptly before the same kind of
blank wall and it too parted to let
them enter

  now the man found himself in a
room lighted only by a huge golden
yellow lamp in a far corner

  in the room no furniture was
visible except a huge leather arm-
chair facing a black and gold
screen this color design was car-
ried out all over the room-on the
floor the hangings and even the
ceiling the hangings were of heavy
velvet and masked the apparently
windowless walls

t tis silent and mysterious guide re-
lieved him of his hat and over-
coat but for some reason would not
take his walking-stick without a
word the negro vanished behind one

 of the yellow curtains leaving the
 other alone in the room

   he studied the place curiously
 surely this man cheeney must be
 very peculiar never had he seen a
 room so furnished in some way it
  reminded him of pictures he had seen
 of oriental palaces the absence of
 windows and doors puzzled him
 surely there must le other rooms be-
 hind those heavy draperies why
 such lavish and barbaric display in
 this most western of cities evi-
 dently cheeney had lived for many
 years in the east the whole ar-
 rangement of this room his peculiar
 servants-all fitted into this idea
 all save the ragged old man he had
 met on the street this was another
 puzzle where in all this somber
 richness did the old man have his
 place where in this home straight
 from the arabian nights with its
 secret doors and dark tunnels did
 this very old and very commonplace
 man enter what was his position
 what position could he possibly fill 

   in thinking of the old man he
 wondered about himself a nurse
 companion the old man had said
 one who could face danger unafraid
 it must be from the east that the
 danger cheeney feared would come
 -a vital and real danger for other-
 wise there could be no sense in such
 mummery

   without warning the room was
 plunged in darkness from the
 blackness shot out two beams of
 green light turning to face them
 he saw one of the most ghastly
 things he had ever seen across one
 wall was a huge face-a cruel gap-
 ing mouth and great ears that
 flapped back and forth its two
 great green eyes glared almost
 directly upon him as he stared at
 the thing from behind one of the
 huge ears ran a dark figure which
 in the green light he saw to be a
 man clad only in a golden loin-
 cloth and brandishing a curved


weird tales

sword this man sprang directly at
him almost unconsciously he swung
his stick to guard the blow and with
a clever fencers trick sent the simi-
tar flying disarmed the other
turned and ran back toward the wall
and disappeared

  as suddenly as it had gone out the
light in the yellow lamp came on
brighter than ever still grasping
his stick he looked around there
was no mask with flashing eyes
there was nothing but curtained
wall all was as before and he was
alone in this room of black and gold

  that was very nicely done my
friend you are a very clever
swordsman the voice came from
behind the screen-a cool rather
amused voice with a timbre in it
that sounded vaguely familiar the
hidden speaker went on you must
pardon my little trick it was just
the final test to see your fitness to
fulfil the position of my companion
you will forgive me if i do not come
out to greet you but for the present
it will be impossible sit down
please

  behind the screen the hidden man
clapped his hands thrice and from
behind one of the black curtains
there came a little old chinaman
who with head bowed stood silently
awaiting his orders

  bring wine and cigars chu and
see that our guest is made comfort-
able

 without a word the old man
bowed low and withdrew

 now my dear fellow i am
cheeney-asa cheeney and you
seem to be just the sort of person
for whom i have been looking-
young brave and as far as i can see
nearly physically perfect you have
i understand no family ties no
friends and you wish to leave this
part of the country

  now a word concerning myself
i am very old very feeble and in
great danger so do not think your
position will be an easy one what

the danger to me is you will learn
later ah here is chu with the wine
and cigars i hope you will like the
wine it is very old and very rare
chinese glance at it-green as jade
smell of it-sweet as jasmine drink
of it-tart but wondrous  

  the young man took one of the
tiny cups-queer square little
things slightly larger than a thimble
-and also a very thin very black
cigar

  the voice behind the screen re-
sumed speaking judge not the
wines quality by its quantity
emperors have paid with their heads
for but one drink of it never be-
fore has it been out of the far east
never even been out of a certain
abbey hidden high in the himalaya
mountains many years i spent
there among the priests who know
many things i learned many secrets
-too great a number perhaps for
one man that is why i am hiding
here in this hole in the ground
rather neat though dont you
think there is more that i will
show you later

  how goes the wine such clar-
ity such fragrance oh my friend
it is the very wine of life and the
cigar-do you like it my own
brand is it not fine also black as
night strong as death sweet as love
all this should go into the making
of a fine cigar  

  the young man sipped his wine
how cool it was how green like a
piece of jade just as cheeney had
said it was cool yet it seemed to
flow all over his body almost numb-
ing his hands and feet yet leaving
his brain as clear and bright as
usual the cigar was the best he had
ever smoked what was it the man
had said about it clever that he
must remember it the wine was
now numbing his entire body he
was afraid he was getting drunk-
but why did his head stay so clear
usually it was affected first he
tried to straighten up in his chair
the soul tube



and found he could not it was as if
he were held in a vise he tried to
move a hand and it would not fol-
low the direction of his brain from
behind the screen came a rasping
laugh half chuckle half cough

  the wine is working my young
friend said i not that emperors
had paid with their heads for one
drink of it it is a secret compound
that deadens the motor nerves of the
brain yet leaves the rest of the
brain clear even more active than
ever now we wrill come to business
and so you will see mo but not for
the first time

  there was a dragging noise from
behind the screen and from around
it came an old man who dragged
one twisted foot so that wras where
the ragged old man fitted into this
place but he was no longer pitiful
or shabby he was dressed in a
long chinese lobe of black silk
heavily embroidered in gold the
scraggly beard was gone the cring-
ing air was gone instead there was
now an air of mastery and purpose
the eyes almost flamed with hidden
lights the pupils were pin-points of
command

  so we meet again and i hope in
more pleasant surroundings and in
a moment you will know why you
were asked here  

  again he clapped his hands twice
sharply from behind the curtains
stepped the great negro who had acted
as the younger mans guide

    prepare our guest oh ki for
what is expccted of him

silently as ever the negro rolled
from behind the screen a long
table on which rings were fastened
in each of the four corners upon
this he lifted the motionless young
man and with a few motions placed
the rings about his wrists and ankles
the crippled old man rubbed his
hands together

  ki is a marvelous servant dumb
but hears every word i speak  

 the negro laughed a gurgling
laugh and opened a cavern of a
mouth in which there was no tongue

  from behind the curtained walls
came a queer purring noise with
now and then a metallic tinkle the
lamp in the room glowed low and
then flamed brightly

  before you see what is prepared
for you went on the old man i
want to tell you a story years ago
as a young man i went into asia to
tibet i dont suppose you have
ever been to that devil-ridden coun-
try perched high among the snow-
capped mountains why i went
there we will not mention how-
ever for years i lived in a buddhist
lamasery and i learned many things
-some good and many very evil it
is indeed a very secret land a place
forbidden those old yellow priests
know secrets best left unrevealed
things that we in the west are just
now discovering as i learned more
and more so was i kept more and
more a prisoner but one day i
managed to escape for days i wan-
dered over the snow hungry tired
more dead than alive but those
silent yellow men caught me and
gave me this and cheeney stuck
out the tvisted foot

  you know they have a nice little
pastime of cutting off the soles of
your feet very delicately very
gently so finely that the very re-
finement of it makes the pain worse
a thousandfold they did other
things-tilings which i can not even
bear to remember

  but later i escaped again by
that time i had learned the language
perfectly disguised as one of their
begging friars taking with me only
the old chinaman chu whom you
have seen i made my way into india
where i found ki very sick with a
disease no one there could cure at
one time my friend i was a doctor
and if i do say it myself rather
more than an expert surgeon i
cured ki and he has since that day


weird tales

become my shadow at one time he
was in the sultans palace but being
indiscreet he lost his tongue

  go where i might i have been
constantly followed since then
always shadowed so far i have
escaped death by hiding here in this
section of the city here have i
made a wonderful home for i have
become rich through what i brought
back from the east but i am tired
of hiding like a rat in a hole i
want to go out into the world un-
afraid with the fear of death not
always clogging my footsteps and
thats where you come in my dear
boy

  no one could ever find me here
and if anyone did find me he would
die you remember that after you
entered my door you were made to
hug close to the wall well that is
because the center of that hall is a
river a long-forgotten one and a
false step or an ignorant one would
mean death you are now several
blocks from where you entered and
far below the ground and the way
you came is the only exit or entrance

  i choose you to help me for these
reasons first that you are young
and strong and clean second that
you are alone and friendless and no
one would miss you if you disap-
peared and my friend you are
going to disappear  

  the old man laughed that rasping
half cough half laugh he motioned
the negro to take the table away

  take our guest to the appointed
place i will join you in a moment  

  the negro wheeled the imprisoned
man through one of the curtains in
the wall the old man left alone
hobbled chuckling to himself in the
opposite direction and he too dis-
appeared behind the curtains

 as he was wheeled along down
another corridor the young man
heard the purring and whining of
the machinery growing louder there
was now distinguishable a hissing
sound as if some current were sud-

denly switched on and off a door

was opened by the bent old china-
man and he was pushed into a room
that reminded him unpleasantly of
a hospital and yet was different it
was all of white tile with huge
shaded electric lamps two oper-
ating-tables stood side by side they
were connected by many small fine
wires that completely covered each
one at the front of each table was
an upright post of peculiar greenish
gray metal into which ran all the
many wires connecting these two
posts was a hollow glass tube of a
deep purple color that glowed deep-
ly now and then and from which
the hissing noises came in the cor-
ner of the room was a motor with a
number of dials and buttons on the
face not unlike a high-powered
radio receiver

the young man was lifted from
his carrier and placed upon one
of the tables over his mouth was
strapped a metal disk similar to that
which held the glass tube other
plates of the same metal were
strapped to his left arm and over
his heart a metal cap was placed on
his head during all this time he
could not move a muscle the effect
of the wine was still strong upon him
but he could see and hear as clearly
as ever strangest of all he was not
frightened for some reason while
he did not know what was going to
happen he did not care he was
undoubtedly in the hands of some
wealthy madman and nothing could
save him but at least he had had a
few hours of pleasure some enter-
tainment and had been granted
what he was always seeking-adven-
ture mystery and excitement

  the crippled old man now made
his appearance and was bending
over him the old man had taken
off his golden robe and was garbed
in the frayed and dirty garments
and cracked boots of their first meet-
ing he was speaking
the soul tube



  now for the final step up there
in tibet they have learned how to
interchange bodies that is the soul
or mind call it what you will can
cast off its own body and enter that
of another i learned the trick of
it and that is one reason why my
life is in danger but their method
has one drawback the change of
soul from body to body is not perma-
nent it lasts for less than an hour
and upon the return to its original
body sickness and near death is a
sure result however i have dis-
covered a avay to make this change
permanent-not through will power
as they do but through the greatest
force in the world-electricity com-
bined with certain light rays i have
found out how to release the soul
and transform it into anothers body
i will not bore you with a recital of
the experiments i made the years it
took me to perfect my invention
but now i am certain-nay positive
-it will succeed you are there on
one table i will be placed on the
other our left hands will be fastened
together the metal will be placed
over my lips as it is over yours by
the way this is the most cuiious of
metals it is only found in a certain
part of the world and contains the
elements of all metals in one now
observe the glass tube see how the
sparks in it are white and cross and
recross each other but never blend
you have a chance no other man has
had-that of seeing your soul leave
your body when the tube beeomes
a smoky gray and the sparks change
from white to red and fuse into one
instead of crossing and recrossing
then your soul and mine will be in
that little glass tube you will see
the tube bend and twist as though
alive as the souls interchange their
places that is all you will see
later you will awaken as an old man
avith shabby clothes and a twisted
foot and i will be strong and young
and well dressed but my mind will
be my own clear and keen and

keeping all the knowledge i have
ever learned only my body will be
changed  

  turning to the negro he said
come place me on the table ki
and you chu-speaking to the
chinese-to the dials as i have in-
structed you noav my friend there
is only one danger if the tube
should break our souls would escape
from the tube and as they are unable
to enter our bodies we should bo
dead remember it is better to be an
old man alive than a young man
dead  

the old man climbed on the table
and was fastened down and the
wires avere attached the arms were
fastened together the humming of
the motor took on a lighter note the
lights in the purple tube savayed and
tavisted the young man lay look-
ing at the tube he had no sense of
being it avas as though he avere out-
side himself watching these strange
rites the purple tube grew smoky
the sparks turned to red the tube
twisted and bent but noav he could
no longer see

 from his bent position the
avrinkled yellow man rose and went
over to the tables watching the
graying tube with a gesture of his
hand he sent the negro from the
room for some time he stood si-
lent and then in a curiously clipped
but correct english he began to
speak

  you can hear me oh master of a
thousand devils so hear what i
have to say for years i have
awaited this moment yea for
years i have been the dust beneath
your sandals but noav do you re-
member when i begged you to take
me from the monastery oh blind
son of a pig you did not knoav that
i had been instructed from the broth-
ers to follow you and bide my time
before i paid you for the insults that
you offered us knoav iioav-and see
if you can laugh-that never have


weird tales

you been followed that all this hid-
ing like a rat in a hole has been my
scheming that i and i alone have
held your payment in my hands and
now you pay you who would de-
base our secrets for your ends learn
now that we never forgive or for-
get

  from his waist he drew one of the
huge wooden rosaries used by the
lama priests swinging this high
over his head he brought it down on

the hollow tube there was a burst
of flame a strangled muffled cry
and from the ends of the broken tube
two clouds of grayish vapor poured
out

  the wrinkled old yellow man with
shuffling feet and head bent down
clicking his rosary as he went
opened the door and passed through
gently he closed it behind him leav-
ing the two still figures alone in the
white-tiled room

dr glazebrook came back
into the room where i had
been waiting for his analysis
of the small bottles contents his
comment while it did not altogether
surprize me was revealing

  who is your enemy mr carey
there was a grave background to the
slight smile whieh accompanied this
question

    it was poisonous then   

 rather why theres enough
vegetable alkaloid in these four ounces
of yellowish fluid to ruin a pair of
mastodons  

  i had it appeared acquired an
enemy it seemed extraordinary for
i had only seen the little bearded man

twice and our conversation had been
merely businesslike the first time
had been when i picked up his brass
key the second when i had asked
him about my winter cold perhaps
i had better begin at the beginning

  that beginning had been common-
place enough my cousin peter
ellis had gone to california for the
winter peter is a bond broker and
can manage trips to california he
had loaned me his new york city
apartment on waverly place and i
had been getting in some hard licks
at a story about ships for the day-
star the story took me frequently
among the wharves and shipping and
that was why i happened to be walk-

                                   


weird tales

ing along west street the time i
first saw the little bearded man he
came rushing around a corner his
ridiculous little bandy legs fairly fly-
ing he just avoided a collision with
me ducked past and skipped across
a side street like a lamplighter

  just as he dodged a heavy motor
truck he dropped something that
sparkled i picked it up as the
trucks swearing driver rattled past
and hurried after the little man to
give it back it was a small brass
key such as might be used to lock a
valise he was taking five steps to
my longer-legged two and i had to
run to catch him in the middle
of the block i tapped his shoulder
and he shrank away from my hand
presenting a face pallid with appre-
hension i held out the key to him
and he snatched it and dodged ahead
before my words is this yours
sir were out of my mouth giving
me such an ugly look that i regretted
the trouble i had taken with his key

  it was raining a february drizzle
and i charitably attributed his bad
temper to the weather it had a
worse effect on me for that night i
was coughing and sneezing and after
a restless night i decided to see a
physician and get myself vaccinated
for eolds there was i remembered
a doctors sign bernard bruso
m d in the window of a small old-
fashioned house which i passed daily
on my way to west street and its
shipping next morning i rang the
bell of this house

  a colorless old-fashioned house-
maid admitted me and showed me
into a dingy first-floor waiting-room
where i had barely time to take in
my surroundings before the double
doqrs leading to the room in the rear
were pushed apart and yesterdays
little bearded man stood in the open-
ing

  we stared at each other in the dim
ight of a dull day coming through
dirty window-panes and i was sure
i could detect some shadow of that

apprehension which had answered my
shoulder-tapping of the day before

  the doctor shook his head at my
suggestion that i be vaccinated he
dissuaded me in a slightly foreign
voice

  that said he may be under-
taken a little later it requires a day
to procure the coryza serum mean-
while i will make you up a mixture
which will relieve your cold oh yes
it will relieve it

  he looked at me so maliciously as he
said this that i immediately thought
of poison the double meaning of
his words pressed home upon my
mind i put the idea away from me
it was an absurdity of course an
outrageous thought

  when the little doctor disappeared
into his surgery through the double
doors i could just see him through
their crack in the surgery on a
center table stood a case about the
size of a typewriter cover with
what looked like the same little brass
key i had returned to him he un-
locked this removed the top and
there stood an old brownish skull a
skull is not of course unusual in the
office of a physician but it struck me
as unusual that he should uncover
such a trophy at this moment then
a spasm of coughing seized me and
when i looked back again through
the aperture between the folding-
doors i was seriously surprized

  for the little man of the brass key
with the queer beard and the bandy
legs was actually kneeling on the
floor of that surgery in front of the
brown skull and making obeisance to
it with his high-domed forehead
knocking against the edge of the
table as a savage might salute his
totem

  what strange rite had i stumbled
upon i wondered i applied my eye
to the crack where i could get a
closer view of what was going on in
theie it came over me that i had
blundered into something devilish
something uneanny i could feel one
the cult of the skull



of those uncomfortable chills of con-
tact with the unexpected run up my
spine and down again a moment
later he rose and busied himself fill-
ing a four-ounce bottle from several
larger ones which stood in great
numbers along shelves in the farther
end of the surgery when he re
turned to the front room i was idly
looking out of the window at a wet
and dismal street

  i turned at his arrival and he
handed me the bottle he gave
directions

  take the half of this tonight in
an equal quantity of water upon
retiring preferably after you are in
bed and well covered you will then
-sleep should not your cold be
cured in the morning you repeat
with the remaining half you
understand  

  i nodded and handed him a five-
dollar bill he returned me three
ones his charging me the usual
office fee somewhat modified the sec-
ond double meaning of those direc-
tions you will then-sleep  
somehow it had a sinister sound
which stuck in my mind he showed
me out without another word and
slammed the front door behind me

 walked over and took the el-
evated uptown to eighth street
i like the elevated it is one of the
few remaining features of new york
city which is old-fashioned and still
in use back in the apartment be-
tween coughing spells i cogitated
this avas a mighty curious business
putting it all together it seemed to
me the little doctor was plainly
an eccentric but absurd as it
seemed i could not rid my mind of
the idea of poison

  at last telephone-book in hand i
looked up an analytical chemist
there was one hugh glazebrook
d phar on bleecker street telling
myself meanwhile that i would do
much better to stay where i avas in
the steam heat i struggled into my

hat and ulster once more and took a
taxi to bleecker street i handed
over the little bottle and asked for an
immediate analysis

  i avent out of the laboratory with
that phrase of dr glazebrooks ring-
ing in my ears i had an enemy
why i wondered what had i done
to incur the enmity of the little
bandy-legged doctor nothing so
far as i could see

  i returned to my cousin peters
apartment and my cough was so
annoying that i gave up the idea of
any work for the day and made my-
self comfortable in the largest arm-
chair near a sizzling radiator with a
glass of peters pre-war cold medi-
cine while i absorbed my hot toddy
i turned my mind to finding some
solution for this eery mystery into
avhich unwittingly i had managed
to step one thing was plain since
i could not guess at any solution in-
vestigation avas clearly indicated
tomorroav my story for the daystar
avould have to avait i aras going to
run this thing down to its roots

 the next morning my cold was
broken besides the sun though
rather a avatery sun was shining
once more as i was dressing an
idea occurred to me i carried the
bottle avith enough vegetable alka-
loid to ruin a pair of mastodons  into
the bathroom and poured out half
its contents i had determined to go
straight to the doctors office if he
had meant to poison me i would
mystify him by pretending i had
taken half the bottle as directed i
grinned to myself over this strata-
gem

 arrived about  oclock and was
a again shown into the waiting-
room after a brief avait the folding
doors opened the same as yesterday
and dr bruso looked through when
he saw me his face went a dead white
and he clutched the edges of the old
avalnut doors for support appar-
ently he had not expected to see me


weird tales

again i took the half-empty bottle
out of my pocket and held it out to-
ward him

  good morning doctor said i
cheerfully you see i didnt need
the second half of the medicine but
i thought i might as well come in
and let you look me over again  

  the color began to come back into
his drained face he swallowed sev-
eral times making a great effort to
compose himself when he spoke at
last his harsh voice was trembling
guttural   give me the bottle  

  i handed it to him and he looked
at it curiously then again at me
you seem-better he added

  x am much better thank you
doetor  

  he looked at me cannily

  you will however be needing a
tonic no

    i am in your hands doctor make
it a tonic by all means  

  he peered at me as though he
found it hard to realize that it could
really be i his heavy brows puckered
into a puzzled frown it was evident
that he did not know what to make
of me

  i think a tonic would be a good
idea   said i encouragingly

  he turned back into his surgery
without another word slamming the
doors so hard that they rebounded
making a wide aperture for me to
look through he went straight to
the bottle-shelves ignoring the skull
this time and uncorked and sniffed
gingerly at my bottle shaking his
head he poured out what was left
into a slate sink rinsed the bottle
from a faucet and dried it after
shaking out the drops then he
selected a new bottle from his
shelves and filled the bottle once
more

  just as he was sitting down at the
center table to write something on
the label the house-bell rang and the
dilapidated maid showed in a young
irl of about eighteen accompanied
by an older woman apparently her

mother apparently dr bruso had
other patients besides my casual self
the two women sat down near the
window and conversed in low tones

  i gathered from snatches of the
conversation that the girl had been
here before and from the mothers
tone that she was reassuring her con-
cerning some kind of an ordeal which
was before her today i determined
to make their presence the occasion
of a little preliminary investigation
and half formulated a plan which 
was later able to put into execution
as it happened

  when bruso returned as he did
shortly and gruffly refused any fur-
ther payment being plainly anxious
to get rid of me i said that i would
let myself out and went straight out
of the room and through the hallway
populated with ghosts of generations
of corned beef and cabbage i slipped
the cateh of the front door slammed
it behind me and then to make my
departure unmistakable turned to
the left instead of to the right and
walked slowly past the waiting-room
window i even thought i could see
bruso glancing out at me out of the
corner of my eyes but could not be
sure as i did not want to look up
as soon as i was safely around the
corner i paused fumbled through
several pockets as though i had for-
gotten something turned and re-
traced my steps

  i opened the front door replaced
the catch closed it noiselessly behind
me and stepped carefully along the
hallway to the waiting-room door
there i paused listening i could
just catch the gruff voice of bruso
slightly lowered- there is no need
for you to remain he was saying

  not an instant too soon i slipped
around the rear corner of the hallway
and stood on the landing of the steps
leading below to the basement nearly
choking with the odors of ancient
cooking in that stuffy place

  i was hardly in my hiding-place
before the door to the waiting-room
the cult of the skull



opened and the doctor showed the
older woman to the front door which
he shut after her and almost ran
with those absurd little rapid steps
of his back into the waiting-room i
stepped warily out of my refuge and
resumed my former position by its
door i determined in case anyone
came along to be just leaving the
doctor s and so felt safe enough no
one did come in the door or along
the hallway however i listened
closely and was rewarded by hearing
bruso tell the girl to follow him
and a moment later the bang of the
double doors

  the door opened silently under my
pressure i stood in the waiting-room
only my instinct justified this intru-
sion but i was morally certain he
meant some kind of harm to this
young girl he had tried deliber-
ately to poison me i could perhaps
say i had come back to ask directions
about the tonic if i were dis-
covered now i felt reassuringly
the small flat automatic pistol in my
pocket a weapon which i had been
licensed to carry ever since my
reportorial days with it and my
acquaintance at police headquarters
and what i already had to go on in
brusos case i should not hesitate to
deal adequately with bruso if the
occasion should arise

  once more my good fortune held
those folding doors stood once more
slightly ajar i approached them si-
lently and peered through

rphe little doctor was standing with
his back to the center table and
close against it both hands were
behind his back and with the left
which was nearer to me he was
twisting the small brass key in the
lock of the skull case he turned it
at last and withdrew the key which
he dropped into the pocket of his
coat it was only then when he
shifted his body slightly to speak to
the girl standing between him and
the shelves of bottles that i noticed

his right hand this clutched a long
cruel -looking knife which lay on the
table behind him and as he called
the girl to him i swear i saw his
height increase before my eyes
although this was probably nothing
more than his act of rising on his toes
to get a greater physical purchase
for some act about to be performed

  as the girl approached him he
flung off the cover of the case and
stepping aside and so exposing the
skull to her gaze cried out

  behold

  the girl looked at the ghastly
thing her eyes widening and then
at once brandishing his knife the
little fiend was upon her using
only his free left hand he seized and
somehow twisted her in that malig-
nant grip until she was on her knees
before the grinning brown thing
he had the knife raised in an unmis-
takable gesture before i had flung
one of the heavy sliding doors wide
stepped into the surgery and held
him covered with my pistol

  drop that you damned rat i
shouted and the knife rattled on the
old brown hardwood floor

  he crouehed and leered at me his
bearded lips drawn back in a kind of
animal snarl

 seeing him thus disarmed i
dropped the automatic pistol back
into my coat pocket and reached for
him with my gloved hands he bit
at my wrist and i struck him heavily
across the lower jaw with the back
of my fairly heavy hand then i
took him by the neck in both hands
and lifting him bodily shook him ac-
cording to the name which had leaped
to my lips-like a rat

 suddenly he went limp in my
hands and i dropped him in a heap
and turned to the girl who was still
on her knees my attack having occu-
pied no more than a few seconds i
raised her to her feet and seated her
in the nearest chair then i turned
back to bruso now dragging himself
to his feet and a new idea occurred


weird tales

to me i would try now in the thick
of this sordid adventure to get at the
heart of the mystery back of these
insane performances i reached out
and picked up the skull holding it
a thumb in the eye-socket as one
holds a bowling ball

  it was surprizingly heavy far
heavier than i had imagined evi-
dently there was something inside it
well it would answer my purpose
the better for a little extra weight
i poised it aloft

  as i did so i had a glimpse of a
horrified distorted face twisted into
an agony of protest and then dr
bruso literally fell prone upon the
floor and groveled at my feet abject-
ly a thin sigh came from the young
girl and her head drooped forward
upon her breast she had fainted

  i stood there in that position for an
instant so surprized that i did not
know what to do the girl was out
of the proceedings now for the time
being that horrible little beast was
brushing the dusty floor with his
scraggly beard and i was holding an
old brown skull aloft ready to hurl
it i pulled my ideas together my
ruse had worked more rapidly than
i had expected

  get up i thundered and sit
in that chair beside you and answer
what i ask yon  

  bruso scrambled to his feet with-
out a word his face dead-white and
sat on the edge of the chair

  attend to her first said i and
then send her away  

  he nodded comprehendingly rose
bent over the young girl i stood
watching them the skull still ready
to hurl the girls eyelids fluttered
under brusos ministrations in a
few moments she was awake and look-
ing about her with a terrified expres-
sion bruso led her into the waiting-
room i watching them narrowly
he helped her on with her cloak and
took her to the door into tle hall-
way she went out and he came back

obediently it was evident to me that
holding the skull i held a very
effectual whip-hand over him

  she is gone he muttered
there was a cab in front of the
house and i told her to take it

  i motioned to the chair and he sat
down

  now said i you have con-
siderable to explain do you expect
any more patients

  he shook his head i closed the
double doors and faced him

  now tell me exactly what you are
up to and tell it straight other-
wise-i drew the tonic bottle
out of my pocket with my free hand
and set it on the table-otherwise
this will go down your throat and not
mine and well see what effect it will
have  

  i will tell you all-all he pro-
tested earnestly i tried of course
to kill you there is too much at
stake to risk allowing you to live i
knew your picking up the key was
not mere chance that disturbed me
much when you came here with
your cold the next morning-then i
was certain  

  certain of what i interrupted

  that i was discovered he re-
plied simply

  the purely unconscious touch of
melodrama about this word dis-
covered gave me a hint how to carry
on my inquisition i laughed-a dry
hard successful villains laugh

  you were said i he nodded
dismally

  yes it was plain to me from the
first your appearance here this
morning proved it i saw that i
must work very quickly to accom-
plish- he paused and looked at

me haggardly

  yes i encouraged his recital

  you will observe he resumed
leaning forward in his chair very
earnestly and moistening his lips
that the-skull-has no teeth-
yes   
the cult of the skull



  i had not observed it but i nodded
nevertheless his earnestness ap-
peared to increase

  the teeth-are inside he had
all his own teeth because he died
young he was twenty-five wilkes
booths teeth also are there and
those of the poet keats those of the
young king edward sixth of en-
gland-they too are there they
were drawn the night before the bur-
ial by his uncle seymour who was of
the cult and handed on secretly from
hand to hand until they came to
myles warrington of devonshire who
was then the keeper of the skull
the teeth of edgar allan poe are
there-it was he who wrote the
strange tale of the thirty-two teeth
which is the clue and which all save
those of the cult have supposed to
be the work of a clever madman
no they could not penetrate the
clue

rto say that i was astonished would
- be to put it very mildly i was
simply taken off my feet with this
extraordinary rigmarole teeth the
teeth of poe of that young son of
henry the eighth who died of a
consumption at fifteen wilkes
booth murderer of the martyr lin-
coln  but if it put my brains in a
whirl i kept a good control of my-
self for this as it happened avas not
the first strange tale of mortal queer-
ness that had come to my ears so i
merely nodded at this apparent mad-
man as though such matters as these
were everyday affairs to me

  bruso resumed at weimar the
skull rested for many years in the
studio of the abbe liszt that great
master of the pianoforte i had it
myself from rasputin it was he
avho placed within it the teeth of the
young rabbi elias of minsk known
as the worker of wonders the
skull is nearly full noav the time
is almost at hand

  he paused almost dreamily car-
ried away avith his narrative his

eyes on the ground his body relaxed

  the time for avhat i enquired
he roused himself

for the avorld-revolution said
he and fell silent again broodingly

  but-but said i what in the
name of common sense haare these
teeth to do with your  world-revolu-
tion

  they have everything to do with
it they are its symbol the world-
revolution can not come to pass be-
fore the skull is filled

  i was by now convinced that i had
to deal with a plain madman he
seemed at this moment to be in a
quiescent mood insanity is like that
periodical as i understand the mat-
ter

 and what please i asked
quietly has that young avoman to
do avith it all just iioav is she
connected avith the  avorld-revolu-
tion   

    i avas about to initiate her into
the cult of the skull replied bruso
simply her sympathies avere with
us she has been here often she
was in no danger i avould only
have offered her blood to the skull-
a mere ceremony i underwent it
myself many years ago it is our
requirement for all initiates

  but yet i do not understand hoav
this skull-these teeth avhich you say
are inside it-has everything to do
with this avorld-revolution can you
not explain that

  it is replied bruso the skull
of perkin warbeck the patron of
avorld-revolution of him avhose spirit
animates us avho are of the cult our
master warbeck was hanged in
november in the last year of the

weird tales

tion such as no man had before con-
ceived

     then   said i   this world-revolu-
tion you speak of can not take place
until this skull is full of teeth do i
understand you correctly

  you understand it aright an-
swered bruso nodding his high-
domed head in my direction

  well then i fairly shouted
there will be no world-revolution
my queer friend i raised high
above my head the ugly thing to
which all this time i had been hang-
ing on and hurled it down with all
my strength on the hardwood floor of
the surgery it smashed into frag-
ments at that impact and about the
room in every direction flew-teeth
not so jewels jewels of every size
kind and description they must
bave been packed into the ancient
skull with extraordinary care there
had been no rattling within the skull
and i had held it in my hand for per-
haps ten long minutes while i listened
to brusos queer rigmarole

  when he saw what i had done the
doctor uttered a dismal shriek i
saw his face distorted like a greek
mask with despairing rage and hor-
ror he leaped toward me and i
covered him with my pistol i was
taking no chances with this extraor-
dinary madman but although for
an instant i hesitated over the ques-
tion of dropping him in his tracks it
was not at me that he had launched
himself in that desperate plunge no
-his objective was my tonic
bottle even as i stepped aside my
instinct telling me to hold steady and
wait he had seized the little bottle
uncorked it with the speed of thought
and emptied its contents into his
mouth

  at once he collapsed to the floor
writhed once beside the table while
i looked down on him horrified bent
himself spasmodically backward and
then lay quite still

  this was all so sudden so gro-

tesquely strange that i found my-
self seconds later holding my weap-
on so tightly that my knuckles were
white and aching when i realized
what had actually happened i
dropped the pistol back into my
pocket leaned over and felt his face
he was unmistakably dead

  there was not the suggestion of a
sound in the house the surgery was
as silent as a tomb there scattered
all about the floor were the many
fragments of the old and brittle
skull and everywhere were jewels
a kings-an emperors-ransom i
wondered momentarily if the wild
tale of the skull were not impossible
as it seemed substantially true or
was it a very clever ruse intended to
disguise the late doctors activities
as a fence i mean of course
true in its main details the jewels
which he had called teeth the
sinews of war for some actually
planned world-revolution the young
girl possibly the emissary of some
local red society bearing another
jewel to be added to that grim collec-
tion well i should never know

  i was down on my hands and knees
in that silent room gathering and
depositing in the surgeons black
leather bag which had stood all this
time on the tables edge handfuls of
diamonds rubies emeralds sap-
phires   

  i am reasonably certain that i got
them all i spent a feverish quarter
of an hour over this work of salvage
these stones would never finance any
red revohition if edward carey
could help it

  i finished so far as i could see i
stood up again and hefted the black
bag only fragments of the skull
and brusos distorted body remained
on the floor there was nothing fur-
ther for me to do it seemed

  i stepped out through the folding
doors shutting them quietly behind
me i left the house without seeing
the cult of the skull



a soul closed the street door turned
to the right and walked to the el-
evated station

  the cult of the skull was ended
finished there would be certainly
no world-revolution this it seemed
to me carrying that innocent-looking
black leather handbag was the best
of all possible worlds just as it was

isat a little later in my cousin
peters apartment trying to esti-
mate how much i was worth it was
hard to say i was no jewel expert
the only fly in my ointment was-
well olfactory it takes a long time
for the ghost of the black leather
handbag i learned to dissipate it-
self after the bag itself has been
burned in a grate fire i had raked

out the metal fittings the lock and
hasps and the steel forms which had
braced the edges those i designed
for permanent residence in the hud-
son river the next morning off the
deck of a ferryboat and that is
where they went in due time

  the next days papers carried a
brief notice of what had happened in
the surgery a dr bruso it ap-
peared had poisoned himself the
post-mortem was conclusive upon
that point the dingy servant had
discovered the body about  p m

 there was no mention of any
ancient broken fragments of bone on
the floor probably the housemaid
had swept up that litter as a matter
of course she seemed an unimagina-
tive person that housemaid

           the head

 the head most strangely seemed like one i knew

 it rolled and spun and stopjed in front of me

 and then lay grinning up so cheerfully

 i wondered what it wanted me to do

 i did not like its awful deathly hue

 nor yet the ligaments that seemed to be
 bloodless nor those white eyes that still could see

 nor that wide mouth whence blood came dripping through

 and now i think i surely must have dreamed

 such hideous things in life are rarely found

    they savor of the nethermost black pit

 for all at once in agony i screamed-

 the head leaped upward in one frightful bound

    and dropping straight in front of me it split
li kan was a very rich man
yet he kept a small hotel in
liankow and had the simplest
of tastes nothing aroused his an-
ger nothing aroused his enthusi-
asm he viewed life in a very im-
personal manner it interested him
all sorts and conditions of people
came to his house poor and rich
alike wanderers who anchored like
ships for a moment at his wharf and
then drifted on

  whence did they come whither
were they going these were the
questions li kan liked to ponder as
he smoked a long bamboo pipe of
vile tobacco for hours he would
sit in a corner of his tea room en-
grossed in his own meditations he

seemed to live in a perpetual dream

    

  one night as he slept he heard the
tinkle of a camels bell a camel that
was doubtless part of a caravan
headed for the north a caravan
trading in adventure

 why should i not journey
abroad he mused i am rich
perhaps i would have adventures as
boundless as the sea

  the tinkle of the camels bell con-
tinued it was a lure beckoning
him onward into unknown lands
throughout the night he lay sleep-
less his brain bursting with plans
and ambitions he would set out on
a mission of drollery to see life to
be amused and if possible to bestow
a bit of philosophy upon those who
chanced to come within the radius
of his charm

her eyes glistened like black opals ia
the mellow orange light
the tinkle of the camels bell



  he left his hotel on a certain day
when the air was fragrant with the
aroma of spices a day when cara-
vans were passing laden with silks
and perfumes and fine porcelains it
seemed to him to forebode a mysteri-
ously pleasant journey all that he
carried with him was bound up in a
small rug about his person was
disposed a generous sum of money
but the costume he wore was the
costume of a poor man it was of
blue silk but faded and slightly
frayed with age

  li kan breathed deeply of the air
in which ten thousand eery odors
blended

  the first night of his pilgrimage
found him far off in the mountain
fastnesses where habitations were
few he had not provided himself
with charts or maps because he imag-
ined such a procedure would sap
much of the glamor from his enter-
prise thus it was that the night
shadows creeping down like serpents
from the bleak mountains found him
rather at a loss for a roof night at
best is a dismal thing suggesting
sleep which is a period of insensibili-
ty wherein a mans soul escapes to
realms the location of which no hu-
man writer has ever been able to
explain 

  and it so happened that in his di-
lemma li kan chanced upon a filthy
hostelry that was so vile it was nau-
seous li kan was one of the fewt
chinamen who appreciated the gift
of cleanliness nevertheless he pre-
ferred the hovel to the wind-swept
mountain passes

  the keeper of the inn was ts ah-
nyi once a famous outlaw who had
quit the main roads of travel because
there was a price upon his head suf-
ficiently large to make his death a
thing to be desired he was a short
squat expressionless yellow-man
greasy and unkempt who exhaled a
loathsome odor that was stifling he
eyed li kan shrewdly suspiciously

  but he did not deny him a place
wherein to sleep

  until late into the night the two
sat together drinking samshu and
talking garrulously after awhile
ts ah-nyi commenced to grow intox-
icated not excessively so but suffi-
ciently for him to become confidential
from a concealed pocket in his
sleeve he drew a huge opal it shim-
mered and gleamed in the feeble
lantern-light like a tiny ball of fire

  have you ever seen anything like
it he demanded in a guttural voice

 li kan yawned from his own
pocket he drew a mighty emerald
it was as green as field-grass in mid-
summer

  naught but this he replied
in all the world no other such em-
erald exists it makes a pauper of
me so great is its power because
i am afraid to appear affluent else i
might be robbed of it i remain in
poverty to protect this perfect
jewel

  at sunrise li kan continued on-
ward down the road of the length of
which he had no knowledge to
where it led or for what purpose
were enigmas toward noon he
stopped by the wayside to eat a few
nuts and to nibble a bit of cold tur-
nip and as he rested he reached
into his pocket for the emerald it
was gone he yawned slightly
after all perhaps it was as well that
his tale of its marvelous worth had
been a fabrication by lantern-light
the green glass certainly resembled
a fine jewel again he yawned from
the rug in which his rarest treasures
were bidden he drew an opal the
gorgeous opal which ts ah-nyi had
gloated over in this vast world of
deceit and treachery that at least
was true was real in the sunlight
it flashed more dazzlingly than by
dim lantern-light

  li kan rose to his feet as he
pushed onward he mused   i wonder
if one can be called a robber simply
because one robs a robber  


weird tales

  he finished eating his almonds and
the cold turnip the almonds were
very good the turnip was very good
life was very good

tany and interesting were the
adventures which li kan ex-
perienced during the next few
weeks drolleries galore passed be-
fore his comprehension he laughed
much though there were times when
he was greatly saddened by the pov-
erty of the dwellers in the bleak
desolate country through which he
was passing only auniversalist can
have any perspective can appreciate
his own comparative lack of impor-
tance as compared with the immen-
sity of existing things

  one day on the fringe of a strange
city he chanced upon an open gate
leading to a great garden there
was no one about the place seemed
deserted he realized that he was
trespassing but he ventured in the
white walks were deserted in among
the oaks and willows he wandered
past gorgeous flower-beds of wisteria
and peonies the scent of peach-
blossoms was in the air but there
was  one about the garden was
beautifully cultivated but deserted

  as he walked deeper into the gar-
den he approached a long low ram-
bling house with a red roof at the
corners were fantastic designs and
carved figures the entranee-door
was open he stood before it not
knowing how to proceed but the
strange house beckoned so he en-
tered what a profusion of beauty
and charm greeted his eyes the
sudden change from bright sunshine
to the soft-lighted rooms dimmed his
vision for a moment but as it cleared
he gasped at the wondrous tapes-
tries the silken hangings the gor-
geous rugs of velvet softness the
marvelously carved vases and urns
never he thought had such a dis-
play of splendor been spread out
before him on the air floated a
suggestion of musk and old roses

  perfume of magic that struck him
like a drug until his senses reeled
through room after room he passed
each more beauteous than the last
all hung in riotous colors reflecting
from the silk draperies but nowhere
was there a sound not a footfall
disturbed the tranquillity still here
and there were lanterns burning so
the place could not have been long
deserted

  at last he came to a room larger
than all others it was of immense
length and completely draped in
what appeared to be soft dark car-
pet and a thronelike structure at the
far end above it hung a cluster of
soft-toned orange lanterns upon
the throne a lovely woman was seat-
ed she too was dressed all in
black black that blended into the
draperies until it appeared as though
she had no body just a white face
and hands heavily bejeweled

  li kan gasped as he gazed upon
her she seemed very young and
yet there was a suggestion of age
about her her pungent lips were as
fragrant as honey her eyes were
somber dreamful and dark as the
velvet draperies they glistened
like black opals in the mellow orange
light her hair was smooth and
clung close to her cheeks even with
the severity of its arrangement she
was marvelously beautiful behind
one ear she wore a small orange
chrysanthemum

  at li kans approach she rose to
her feet

  welcome she said in a voice
that was like hushed music it is
lonely in this great house and i am
indeed gratified when chance passers-
by are able to tarry here awhile
life is a great wide road to attain
complete harmony and peace one
should pause at intervals by the
wayside come talk with me i
have almost lost the power of speech
so long it is since i have been hon-
ored by conversing with a stranger
the tinkle of the camels bell



  as she spoke she led the way into
one of the other rooms a room far
less severe than that room of cling-
ing blackness here were charm and
beauty the hanging draperies were
tapestries depicting flower gardens
and children romping about in front
of colorful temples there were nu-
merous teakwood chairs inlaid with
ebony and mother-of-pearl disposed
about the room in charming negli-
gence tables bearing lighted lamps
lamps of blended restful intensity
added to the attraction on the air
floated an exotic perfume that made
li kan drowsy as he inhaled it

  in the lighted room he had oppor-
tunity to survey more fully his com-
panion she was tall and slender
she glided about with snakelike ease
softly serenely soundlessly the
severity of her black costume was
startling it emphasized the ivory
whiteness of her face and the vivid
red splash of her lips li kan se-
lected a chair beside a table

 she waved a listless hand
drink said she and forget

  on the table beside him was a jug
and several cups he poured the gay
amber liquor into the vessels it
looked like liquid gold then prof-
fering one to her he raised the other
to his lips the taste of that liquid
was peculiar to an extreme it caused
his entire body to glow it fired his
blood it made him forget the past
faded off into fog again he drank
and nothing remained in his memory
but the grace and charm of his love-
ly hostess she sat opposite him
singing softly to herself the songs
she sang were softly plaintive for
some unaccountable reason li kan
shuddered he was supremely con-
tented his will had been subjected
to hers she swayed him utterly
poor li kan at one sweep his soul
had been captured by the unknown

  drink she whispered softly
pausing in her singing

  li kan drank as directed it was

pleasant to permit her to think for
him

  never in his life he mused had
he beheld a woman so superbly beau-
tiful as this strange singer who sat
so calmly before him her white
face fairly glowed her beauty was
dazzling suddenly an intense de-
sire overcame him to bestow some
treasure upon her at once he be-
thought himself of the wondrous
opal which he had stolen from ts
ah-nyi he fumbled about in his
garments until he located it it
gleamed like a bit of glowing metal
as he held it out to her she ejacu-
lated a strange little cry as she put
out her hand to seize it it glowed
gloriously until her hand closed upon
it then instantly an odd change
came over it it ceased to glitter
the fire went out it grew cold she
shuddered as she released it from her
grasp it fell to the floor a cold
dead thing li kan gazed at it fas-
cinated what had happened to this
perfect stone what was there in
the touch of this lovely woman that
deadened the fire in the opal

  meanwhile the woman seemed
slightly ill at ease for the first
time her wondrous poise forsook her
she seemed agitated although at the
same time she seemed more beautiful
than ever she walked nervously to
where a vase of chrysanthemums
stood upon a table they were gor-
geous yellow in the pungent light
softly she drew one from the vase
and pressed it to her lips it with-
ered at once and fell to the floor like
a flower that had been parched and
burned by the sun li kan turned
his head he pretended that he had
not witnessed the strange sight the
woman returned to her seat beside
the table she sighed softly but she
did not sing again

that night li kan slept in a lav-
ish chamber at the far end of
the house there were cushions and


weird tales

coverlets in profusion to comfort his
rest but he could not sleep fear
gripped his heart it made of him a
pitiful thing a shaking cringing
fawning thing that jumped at every
shadow

  after he turned out the lamps
which had added a bit of cheer to the
room it was as though reality van-
ished utterly he wras in a strange
region of legends and odd beliefs
the blackness bore down upon him
with frightful weight it seemed to
have texture like the black velvet
draperies in the throneroom and in
the blackness he imagined he could
dimly make out wraiths forms odd
figments of his distorted imagination
utter silence reigned its pitch wras
deafening almost bursting his ear-
drums it seemed as if numerous
voices were whispering far in the
distance they were forever whisper-
ing sighing and whispering moan-
ing and whispering sobbing and
whispering the pressure of the
blackness increased he was suffo-
cating buried alive engulfed in a
jet pit of fear

  yet naught had he beheld at the
great house but beauty the woman
was more glorious than sunrise over
the yellow sea than moonlight on a
pink coral beach than fronds of palm
trees silhouetted against a deep blue
starlit sky the furnishings of the
house were of immense worth the
tapestries were masterpieces the
vases were as wondrous as any ever
turned out by the greatest ceramic
artists of king-teh-chen the floor
coverings were as soft and rich as
fine grass nothing had been singu-
lar except that the light of the opal
had died when the lady had touched
it and a flower had withered that
she had lifted to her soft red lips
truly this was little whereof to
weave such stark horror yet horror
had taken root in his mind he
could not banish it it wras as unes-
capable as the pressing blackness
that bore down upon his chest

  with great effort he rose from his
couch and strode over to the tiny
aperture that served as a window
it was no wider than the palm of his
hand not even a dog could have
pressed his way through it he
gazed beyond it eagerly a bit of
the moon was visible and one bright
star constantly they disappeared
as scurrying clouds drifted by then
the jclouds thickened and the star
vanished utterly leaving the dark-
ness more pronounced than ever

  in a frenzy of fear li kan relight-
ed the lamps

  the room once more assumed an
air of naturalness the varicolored
silk cushions the rich coverlets the
carved teakwood pedestals on which
rare porcelains stood all served to
draw him back to a state of repose
but the horror of his thoughts con-
tinued the presentiment of impend-
ing calamity for the rest of the
night he slept not nor did he permit
the lamps to expire

  the ensuing days passed like a
weird fantasmagoria li kan wished
to leave that gorgeous house but he
could not whenever he attempted
to steal out into the sunlit garden he
found the doors barred it is a pe-
culiar fact that he never told the
lovely lady of his desire to leave he
believed that to do so would have
been futile more it would have been
highly dangerous there was a men-
ace constantly hanging over him he
felt it in every fiber of his body it
was as though a keen two-edged
sword hung suspended above him by
a thread the trembling of a flower
might cause it to fall

  as time wore on there were mo-
ments when he was madly in love
with the beauteous lady these were
the periods when he had drunk
much of the amber liquor and his
blood wras a surging fire the liquor
created a tumult within him he
longed to take her into his arms to
press his lips to hers to take the
present and let the future go then
the tinkle of the camels bell



remembrance of the opal that had
lost its fire and the chrysanthemum
that had been withered by the touch
of her lips assailed him what would
happen to him if he took her into
his arms he was careful in all
their moments together never to
even touch her hand he avoided
her as though she had been a caul-
dron of molten metal

  he was permitted to wander prac-
tically at will throughout the house
though once as he entered the library
there happened that which reawak-
ened all his fears the room was of
enormous size and there were thou-
sands upon thousands of volumes
upon the shelves he browsed
around examining a volume here
and there as whim directed the
volumes were all musty and worn as
though they had weathered the vicis-
situdes of ages li kan was a con-
noisseur where fine books were con-
cerned and he became so deeply ab-
sorbed in the choice volumes that he
forgot momentarily that he was vir-
tually a prisoner in this peculiar
house a house in which he never saw
a soul but the strange woman and
yet where every bit of work was
done as though it were cared for by
a dozen servants the meals were
always laid in one of the rooms when
they entered all the viands and
dishes were ready on the table
when the repast was over they left
the room it was as though spirits
of some forgotten world were serv-
ants in that house once in the night
as he slept li kan had distinctly felt
cold bony fingers on his forehead
he shrieked wildly and sprang from
his couch when the lamps were
lighted there was no one in the room
but it could not have been imagina-
tion for there were other nights
when he felt the bony fingers and on
one particular occasion they fas-
tened upon his throat like talons and
dragged him to the floor he had
fought like a fury choking gasping
cold perspiration cloyed his brow

his temples were bursting his eye-
balls bulging from their sockets in
the end he succeeded in beating off
the fingers that were striving so in-
defatigably to destroy him so far
his own will was stronger than that
of the mind beyond those bony fin-
gers what would happen when
weakness overcame him he dreaded
to think

  but now all these things were for-
gotten as li kan passed his hands
reverently over the volumes pres-
ently he drew from its place one that
was yellow with age the dust was
thick upon it he turned to the title
page and read

some account of the sweet lady chin chn
who bartered her soul for immortality
she gave her life to escape death

eons and eons shall she live
though without possessing any life of her
own

all life shall be drawn from everything she
      touches

but of her own life there shall be none
she shall live endlessly until some mortal
discovers her secret

  li kan was interrupted in his mus-
ings by a frightful shriek the room
was plunged into utter darkness
the shrieks continued the intensity
was frightful li kan could feel
bony fingers crawling over his face
his own hands shot up spasmodical-
ly caught the crawling fingers and
held then mercilessly pitilessly he
bent them back bent them back un-
til the cold bare bones cracked the
shrieks were diabolical but his ears
avere deadened then came a flash
a flash as viadd as though the very
sun had burst the thread that held
the two-edged sword snapped it
fell doavn upon him carrying him
down doavn down into an endless
pit of unconsciousness

when he again opened his eyes
he was lying a crushed figure
by the side of the road the road
upon which he had been journeying
when he turned off to enter the gar-


weird tales

den he looked about him there
was no sign of house of garden of
habitation anywhere in sight what
had happened he neither knew
nor cared his body felt as though
it had been crushed broken his
pain was great but he heeded it not
he was free once more back upon
the road back into the sunlight
back into the clear crisp air of the
mountains far in the distance he
could hear the tinkle of a camels
bell it was the bell of the leader
of a camel train winding slowly back
toward hankow it was going home
in that moment a great longing for
his little hotel took root in the mind
of li kan henceforth his traveling
would be done in his own tea room
he would travel by listening to the
adventures of other people

 he rose to his feet his bones
ached but he was able to walk he
shuddered as he thought what might
have become of him if he had kissed
the soft red lips of chin chu it was
a foolish thought but he almost re-

gretted that he had not risked ail
for that one sublime moment of
rhapsody

  during the ensuing years li kan
sat in his hotel over and over again
he told and retold of his adventures
many believed and went on their
way marveling others seoffed
they could not understand what had
happened to the magnificent house
the lovely lady and the garden
many shook their heads they re-
fused to believe they credited the
strange story to the vapors of sam-
shu or opium but li kan smiled
he was a philosopher after all a
story was a story he did not bother
showing them the opal of ts ah-nyi
which he still possessed the opal
which had glistened and glowed with
a wondrous fire but which was now
dead as dead and cold as the bones
of old prophets

  a man may lie mused li kan
  but a rare jewel never does   and
he drew loudly and long at his old
bamboo pipe of vile tobacco

easter island

           by robert e howard

           how many weary centuries have flown

            since strange-eyed beings walked this ancient shore

            hearing as we the green pacifics roar

            hewing fantastic gods from sullen stone

            the sands are bare the idols stand alone

            impotent gainst the years was all their lore

           they are forgot in ages dim and hoar

             yet still as then the long tide-surges drone

            what dreams had they that shaped these uneouth things
            before these gods what victims bled and died

            what purple galleys swept along the strand
            that bore the tribute of what dim sea-kings

             but now they reign o er a forgotten land

            gaeing forever out beyond the tide
the story thus far

vga bhenryk the daughter of wladislaw brenryk
of ponkert who had been put to death as 
werewolf is suspected of being a witch the
villagers of ponkert are roused to fury by finding
a woodchopper dead in the forest frightfully
mangled by wolves and ivga as the werewolfs
daughter is held to be the cause of his death
she is taken from her foster-father dmitri with
the paralyzed legs and tied to a post on the gal-
lows in the village square subjected to the tor-
ments of the villagers she is to be burned at the
stake on the morrow meanwhile hugo gunnar a
young frenchman who is in love with her returns
to the village with horses to carry himself and
ivga and her foster-father to france learning
what has happened to the girl he rescues her at
dead of night killing the sentry and flees with
her up the mountain as the village awakes in
uproar and starts pursuit meantime dmitri
having recovered the use of his legs approaches
the village to rescue ivga carrying his great
two-handed sword gate-opener

  	dmitri holds the narroiv way

behind them a man bearing
a mighty sword had just
reached the corpse of the spy
hugo had silenced at his back
skulked a double shadow-his own
and a second beside it yet only one
man was visible in the moonlight

 the man bent over the body
nodded admiringly as he saw the
hole skilfully placed beneath the
third rib and passed on upon weak
and tottering limbs chuekling to
himself it had been a neat death
and he recognized that the cause of

this story began in weird taxes for october



 the dead man seemed to speak in coughing
 liquid grunts


weird tales

it had been the same weapon that
laid low the sentry by the scaffold

  also he had more than a suspicion
that he knew who bore the weapon
whose like had never been seen be-
fore in ponkert and who had cut the
bonds of that prisoner the sentry
guarded

  he hobbled around the comer of
the building a long way off he saw
two people running across the fields
toward tlje mountain

  he shouted but they were too far
away to hear using gate-opener as
a crutch he followed

  beside him if he had turned his
head he might have seen two shad-
ows slip over the ground

  back in the village lights were
beginning to show in houses and
torches to wave in the streets as the
crowd gathered about the scaffold
in the square all confusion and
shouting scurrying madly about in
search of the fugitives each one look-
ing carefully where he thought he
would be least likely to find the were-
wolf there was much crowding to-
gether

    safety in numbers  the were-
wolfs daughter is loose they
went that way   and off they would
pour in another direction howling
like madmen

  there was soon a great deal of de-
serting from the ranks as the most
lukewarm and half-hearted members
decided that the night was too chill
for delicate lungs and it would be as
well to wait until morning

  thus it was twenty minutes before
the body of the watchman was dis-
covered sprawling in a dark alley
and the two who fled had climbed
the mountain

  dmitri had just reached its base
when lights began to wink and flare
across the fields-lights that were
not needed for illumination on the
moonlight-bathed paths but which
were brought because it was well
known that a werewolf feared arti-
ficial light

now the road over the mountain is
not a fair level causeway but a
steep declivity crusted with loose
rock and round pebbles until one
reaches the very top where the sum-
mit is notched grooved pinnacles on
either hand forty feet or more of
black rock clothed in summer by
dainty flowers that no hand will ever
pluck or nostrils smell

  at the bottom of this tremendous
groove two figures lay panting after
the tedious struggle up the shifting
slope stones still clattered down
knooking dryly together in rush and
chattering hurry the excited babble
of their going droning up to the two
in a murmur of sound and though
the rolling pebbles gathered others
with them becoming a tiny landslide
as they poured into the valley the
roar of their final plunge cam up to
the twin peaks as a faint and airy
whisper so remote were they in
their awful majesty from the pas-
sions of men

  the boy and girl rested they had
climbed the slope and had arrived at
steps cut in the solid rock carved
by hands that were long since dust
to make a watch-tower for the castle
that lay ruined far away its owners
dead and its past forgotten

  up the steps and along a danger-
ous path hanging over a straight
drop of a hundred feet they had
passed and up other steps at its end
around a boulder and then a steep
olimb over the lip of the cliff directly
above the giddy drop where one
false step meant death

  i can see now why this is a short
cut panted the boy this place
was made for goats and children no
one else would be fool enough to
come here

  a roguish quirk twitched the girls
cheek

  so you think i am a child do
you i am seventeen if your might-
iness cares to know

 very old indeed grandma
the werewolfs daughter



grinned the boy   but i didn t mean
you were a child

  o-oh a goat then she gasped
apparently horrified i am going
back i didnt climb way np here to
be called a goat go away i hate
you and she indignantly turned
her back to him

  he laid his hands upon her shoul-
ders ivga look at me dont be
silly why do you tease me so when
i love you so much

  go away from me she snapped
what do you care about goats
some of them are useful when
they are trained right they can car-
ry loads or pull little carts or-

  will you be quiet i dont like
you any more   she stamped her
little foot and twisted free scornful-
ly eyeing him a bewitching mock
fury with her thick hair streaming
out in the wind and the wild moon
glint in her eyes

 -or make cunning pets when

they are tamed he went on as
though no interruption had occurred
but when they are stubborn they
should really be beaten

  beaten let me see you try it
she began but a sudden noise from
far below a tinkling of stones set in
motion cut her tirade short

  her pretended anger disappeared
in an instant and she changed from
a seeming virago to a very fright-
ened little girl crying oh they
have found us they are coming to
kill me save me hugo i love
  

  then all cuddles and kisses and
quick hugs fierceness vanished trust
and confidence in his strength to pro-
tect now in its place until the world
spun around him and he was dizzy
with surprize at such a sudden
change

  he tore himself free from her em-
brace and sprang to the edge of the
cliff far beneath a black indistinct
figure moved up the treacherous
gravel slope an object which climbed
slowly and stopped often as though

the road was hard yet steadily pro-
gressed higher and nearer while he
watched

 a long way back the fields
gleamed and twinkled with many
flecks of dancing light which drifted
toward the mountain like fireflies
in interweaving love-danee over a
marsh farther to the rear ponkert
was ablaze with lights and hugo
heard a thin faded murmur like dis-
tant rapids far off where in mad
hubbub and howling rout the people
surged about an immense bonfire in
the square	- 

  hugo swore softly to hifnself and
moved back upon the cliff with
both hands he was struggling with
a loose rock to roll down upon the
climber when the girl who had also
looked over the edge prevented his
design

  quick she whispered fearfully
let us go to the boat he is still
far away and when he reaches here
we will be gone and he will not know
where we went

  her logic was indisputable as she
went on saying that a falling stone
would betray their presence upon
the mountain even if this man were
killed for he would be discovered
by the others and then if they were
not away by the time the pursuers
came up a bombardment of stones
that might sink their little boat
would surely follow

  so against his desire lie reluctant-
ly allowed himself to be drawn along
the cleft in the mountain without
another downward glance had
cither looked again they could hard-
ly have failed by this time to recog-
nize the massive sword which swung
sometimes when the climber stag-
gered on the dangerous path along
its five-foot length it flamed in the
moonlight like the demon-forged
sword of ibn asad iraf which the
genii formed of the white ash of
thunderbolts

  he had passed the gravel slide and
was half-way up the mountain when


weird tales

hugo and the girl commenced the
descent of the other side here it
was less precipitous but more dan-
gerous than the upward climb for
the moon did not light this side and
here too the path was narrow and
steep

  down slippery steps they stum-
bled along crumbling rotten ledges
drowned in shadow crashing
through bushes and feeling their way
about in the dark they tottered pre-
cariously on the edge of destruction

  and from below it seemed that the
river slowly came up to meet them
and the girl could see the little boat
rocking by its secret wharf hidden
in the reeds the dampness and chill
of the river fog was rising about
them when the mob commenced to
climb the gravel slide

t tigh above them on the path be-
low the cliff rim dmitri leaned
on gate-opener and rested

  the struggle had been hard and
long for his feeble limbs and only
the deathly fear of being too late to
help his loved one had kept him mov-
ing burdened by the heavy sword
it seemed a miracle to him that the
climb had been accomplished but
the worst was over only a few steps
separated him now from the girl he
worshiped and knowing that once
upon the mountain the three could
hold off an army he rejoiced

  and the torches below mounted
higher relentlessly nearer the
shouts of their bearers now quite
clear

 wearily he walked toward the
steps that led up to the cleft above
almost overbalanced by the great
broadsword 

   ivga  he called when he topped
the cliffs edge and then as no an-
swer came again he cried loudly
forgetting caution hugo where
are you it is dmitri

  still no sound but the whistle of
the wind through the mountain-top
ravine and the dry whisper of peb-

bles a-rattle far below upon the
slope set in motion by many feet

  then gripping his heart with a
chill of foreboding came the memory
of the boat upon the river and he
began to run along the bottom of the
little gorge perhaps he was too
late

  and looking over the edge of the
opposite cliff he saw them half lost
in the fog that streamed about them
and neaily to the river

  so it came about that knowing he
could not reach them in time to save
himself and realizing that if they
knew he was left alone behind them
they would return to rescue or die
with him he forbore to speak and
watched silently while they dropped
lower into the fog save when once
he whispered with lips that trem-
bled good-bye sweetheart good-
bye

  for a long time he lay watching
them as they clambered down the
cliff until his eyes blurred so that
he could see them no longer angri-
ly he dashed away the tears denying
even to himself that he was sad

  i am not sad he cried to the
stars i am happy brenryk hap-
py can you hear wherever they
may go whatever they may do it
will be i that has made it possible
i promised you oh tragic soul that
i would guard her with my life
watch me if you can and see how a
helgar keeps an oath with my
blood i buy her happiness and she
will be happy because of me and 
will be happy because she will never
know i died to save her oh bren-
ryk i am glad glad that i am here
tonight not everyone can die for
the one he loves best in all the
world

  trailing the immense sword be-
hind him he ran back and in the
center of the pass chose his position
with care selecting a spot where the
two sides of the notch came closest
like the narrow point of the letter
m and of the m each angle was a
the werewolfs daughter



pinnacle of rock forty feet in height

  there was only one spectator the
shadow that had accompanied dmitri
thus far now disengaged itself from
his shadow and rose like a wisp of
fog along the cliff until it reached
the top of the left-hand pinnacle
where it stopped and became one
with the other shadows on the wall
but two spots of light glistened
where it had paused like moonlight
reflected from moist shiny eyeballs

  below in the bottom of the ravine
dmitri made ready the floor was
not level except in the spot where he
stood but sloped in a gentle descent
in the direction of the river and more
steeply toward the other cliff it was
strewn with rocks that had fallen
from the twin pinnacles

  these dmitri cleared from his plat-
form casting them in the path up
which his attackers would soon
climb he could hear them toiling
up the loose gravel as he dislodged
the last movable stone and rolled it
down the cursing and the rattling
of stones were very near

  a lurid smoky glare rose over the
edge of the cliff a heavy thump
followed by a chorus of jeers and
coarse laughter he ran back to the
center of the pass and waited in a
niche in the wall

  the murky smoke and glare of the
torches shining on the rock were like
the sun rising over the lip of the
ledge then three bright flames
burst into sight together and the old
man crouched closer in his niche
where the light would not find him
whispering to his sword soon
soon dost thou hunger patience
but a little longer

  while he patted gate-openers
hilt and crooned to it the people
were gathering on the ledge

  up they came breathing hard and
sweating from the climb looking
about with curiosity although the
mountain was so near home many
had never climbed it since they were

children and the surroundings were
strange

  well content to rest those fore-
most waited until all had come be-
fore essaying the next climb when
the troop were gathered dmitri saw
that they numbered perhaps a rough
two-score persons and he chuckled
to himself stroking the smooth
blade

  only forty gate-opener only
forty how many will there be after
they have played with thee sweet
chum   

 the mass began to move one
hundred feet away seventy feet
forty-five    dmitri cast one last
look around him saw that only three
could approach him at once by rea-
son of the narrow passage took a
deep breath-thirty feet now-and
sprang into the open his back
against a large boulder immovably
imbedded in the rock

  none saw his leap one second he
was not the next-there he stood
leaning on the great sword square
in the center of the path as though
he had sprung from the living rock
then with the design of halting the
mob creating a panic or delay he
opened his lips and from them pealed
forth a strident inhuman screech
sounding like nothing else in either
heaven or earth it was the gut-
tural hi-yi-yi of the cossack about
to join in battle 

  cries of fear arose from the crowd
as they saw the apparition and
stopped while above them upon his
pinnacle the master chuckled and
settled himself for the show

  the curtain had risen the play-
ers were at hand the first line had
been spoken-the play was about to
begin

  the master promised himself a
rare entertainment he had tested
the mettle of ponkert men before
and was well assured that they would
not pass until the boy and girl were
far down the river so he hoped for
the girls escape meant much to him


weird tales

  the report that the maniacs kick
had been fatal to dmitri had been
circulated in the village and believed
for it was well known that the crip-
ple had not left his chair for many
days but little known that the ail-
ment was confined only to the old
mans legs so now they looked at
this specter arisen from the dead
and the superstitious mob surged
back in horror faces blanched
while pale lips muttered half-forgot-
ten charms for the laying of the rest-
less dead who will not sleep o nights
and twitching fingers crossed hearts
with hurried strokes

  and dmitri moved the thirsty
sword swept through thinly com-
plaining air in dazzling circular
swoop

  come he howled as he swung
the sword the red glare of the
torches running along the blade like
dripping blood come and kiss
death dog-brothers  

  and a man moved-the idiot tan-
ner spurred forward by hate more
brave than the others he came for-
ward on trembling limbs with out-
stretched hand and ingratiating
smile deceitful and placatory words
waited to be uttered in case the thing
was a phantom and behind his back
the other hand closed upon the heavy
dagger to be used if it was only a
man that blocked the way

  dmitri leaned upon his sword and
waited

  nearer the tanner came to the
specter and nearer still while hi
hoarse frightened breathing was all
that could be heard-that and oars
a-thump upon the river

 fingers seeking touched and
found solid flesh beneath material
cloth and with a cry he lives
the madman darted out his dagger
in swift and cowardly thrust

  slashing down as the falcon stoops
for prey screamed the thirsty sword
shore through the profaning arm-
and the hand still clasped about the
daggers hilt spun into the shadows

then with quick reverse stroke the
old man struck yet again so that ten
feet of air was the only union be-
tween the tanners head and the
shoulders that had borne it

  while the body stood upon limply
crumpling legs the imprisoned air
within its lungs rushing forth
through dribbling neck so that the
dead man seemed to speak in cough-
ing liquid grunts the head rolled
jaw agape in stupid amaze and
stood upon its stub as though it
watched the battle through fast-glaz-
ing eyes

  for as the wheezing body col-
lapsed in a red sticky pool with a
roar he lives that was flung
back by the gloomy echoes in the ra-
vine the crowd surged on axes and
knives waving high among the wild
and frantic torches

in the meantime events were tak-
ing place upon the river the boat
was fast to the wharf and the river
had fallen so low that when the two
entered the boat the shallow water
would not bear it over the muddy
bottom

  hugo was forced to jump over-
side and push mightily through the
reeds sinking deep in the mud
after some moments of agonized
struggle he felt harder ground be-
neath his feet the keel of the boat
grated on gravel and floated free
then swung sluggishly in the still
water near the shore while he
climbed in and took the oars

 a confused murmur of voices
drifted down from the heights and
the girl turned to listen

 they have reached the top
hugo    she exclaimed   hurry  

  the oars dug deep and the boat
shot forward with the sudden pounce
of a cat the thole-pins creaked and
the stout oars bent with the stroke
hugo clinging to the shore beneath
the overhanging cliff in dread of
falling stones which he knew would
follow if they were seen
the werewolfs daughter



  the skin along his spine crawled
and his scalp priekled with the mo-
mentary anticipation of the shouts
that would mean they were discovered
and the rumble of falling boulders
that would follow the shouts even
the splash of one dropping from that
height would be sufficient to fill the
boat in an instant and sink it leaving
them helpless in the water and ex-
posed to their pursuers

  ivga mercifully ignorant of their
peril was listening for further
sounds

 five more strokes would take
them now to safety three had been
taken when suddenly a wild un-
earthly screech pealed out from
above the boat was exactly below
the notch in the mountain-top

  it was dmitris wordless yell as he
stepped from his concealment to face
the mob something in the tone
struck home to ivga but believing
dmitri dead she did not associate
the voice with his still it was
familiar and her puzzled brows knit
together in vague indefinable worry
it seemed to her as though she
should know who or what had
screamed

  strange was the voice and yet
somehow-not strange 

  she put up her hand to attract
hugos attention  stop    she com-
manded in a low voice did you
hear that noise what can it be

 now although hugo had heard
the screech and recognized it for
what it was the voice of a man he
read into it a dreadful meaning and
suspected that they were seen so
nothing was farther from his mind
than any thought of hesitating there
in that dangerous spot yet not
wishing the girl to be alarmed he
answered carelessly  twas noth-
ing a night bird crying   and with
another fierce stroke shot into mid-
stream and the rushing current
caught them and swept the two
away

  still was ivga vaguely disturbed

but though she listened long ready
to trap any vagrant sound none
came and as they were carried
farther and farther away from the
mountain and the lights of ponkert
the more remote beeame any possi-
bility of hearing the uproar soon to
take place in the notch

  at last she sank dowoi into the
bottom of the boat and there lay
while hugo rowed sturdily down
the stream and seeing him appar-
ently forgetful of her presence there
gazing off into the dark forests she
placed her head in the hollow of her
arm and tried to sleep

dmitris back was firm against
the boulder and his left side was
partly protected by an outcrop of
rock as the man-pack closed in upon
him thus he was not entirely ex-
posed to the villagers weapons which
began to lick in and out like frozen
tongues of flame

  those who had swords feeling
their superiority over the common
herd who were armed by more
menial weapons had taken the front
of battle

  dung-forks were present flails
clubs and pikes spears and staves of
wood wraved in the torch smoke like
limbs of a leafless forest the hum-
ble spade was conspicuous ax and
hatchet glittered and knives reached
out like an old witchs one lone fang

  it was a motley crew and motley
was the arming of it but at the
fore swords were slithering and
blades hissed as though in the dark-
ness death sat whetting his scythe

  and the harvest was not long in
the reaping for the time that dmitri
had spent polishing his well-beloved
gate-opener over and over until it
attained an unbelievable edge had
not been wasted and a heap of bod-
ies like a windrow in the haying-
field began to rise a bloody barrier
across the narrow way

 and the blades kissed rusty
weapons that had hung long disused


weird tales

upon the walls of some peasants
hut heavy ancient tools for murder
wielded by unskilful hands they
circled in clumsy stroke and parry
stroke again-and parry third
stroke no parry-and so fell clean
unblooded unfleshed racing their
owners to the ground and other
blades hacked in turn

  and now the path grew slippery
a tiny rivulet trickling black in the
torchlight from gaping throat from
riven chest from shattered skull
while panting reckless men struggled
up the steep

  slipping in the red ooze sliding
and falling on the loose rocks
stumbling over bodies of those that
had gone before on they came
drunk with the reek of blood-and
staggered back wailing for a space
through bubbling throats striving
for one more glimpse through eyes
that were slit and never would see
again or feeling their way with
stumps of arms through the eager
throng

  many remained to add their bodies
to the rampart of steaming flesh but
a pitiful debris of battle crawled
back one-legged no-legged thud-
ding with raw elephantine hoofs
which had been knee-joints upon the
rock every step a separate agony
and shorter by over a foot in height
than a moment before

  dmitris sword was sharp

  several died not knowing the blow
that slew them slashed into eternity
by a cold edge like a breath of wind
upon their throats and while their
blades shone unsullied by any stain
save rust gate-opener as it rose and
fell drank deep bit hard and lusted
for the next swooping hither and
thither in hungry search for prey

  and men began to cry out that it
was no man that opposed them but
a devil and that the sword lived

  so dmitri held the narrow way

  a lull came in the fighting while
men moved the wounded from their

path and dmitri tugged the bodies of
the dead into a heap before him

  they were clustering together for
the rush when a voice roared out in
that place of death as though a fiend
was merry it was a hideous ghast-
ly laugh again it howled out and
then wild and exultant

      shen shen shivagen

         swing the steel swing again

      ride ride to our play

         slay slay

and dmitri made mock of his enemies
in a song of the steppe

  then they were at him again three
together scrambling doggedly over
the heap of bodies one with a pike
and two with clubs

 gate-opener swung up and the
pike rattled in two pieces on the
rock while its holder impaled him-
self upon the sword swift disen-
gagement for cursing the others
were upon him a flurry of clubs
dull thuds a sharp cry and one was
reeling back carrying his left arm
severed at the shoulder in his right
hand stupidly as one who sees the
calamity which has befallen yet can
not believe the other man lay
prone another body for the barri-
cade

  those that were left of the mob
wavered and drew back milling to-
gether while they gathered courage
for the charge but dmitri although
exhausted allowed himself not a mo-
ments rest he was busy fixing the
fallen swords and pikes in the barri-
cade so that the points projected
outward presenting a thorny hedge
of steel points behind which he
waited

the boat had traveled perhaps
a half-mile driven by hugos
strong muscles and the current when
the girl who lay at his feet her head
pillowed on the great book made
from her fathers skin looked up as
the boy rowed vigorously down the
stream
the werewolfs daughter



  she was leaving her home with a
stranger bound for a strange land
and though her life in the village
had been a thing of horror best for-
gotten still it was home the only
one she had ever known

  dmitri was dead murdered in his
cabin without being able to lift a
finger toward his defense or hers
trapped like a rabbit in its burrow
all that she had held dear had died
with him the only father she had
ever known what was to become
of her now

  hugos face looked hard in the
moonlight set and stern lips com-
pressing with each stroke of the
oars carrying her away where
and to what fate perhaps his
father the lord would not like a girl
that brought nothing but the clothes
she stood in perhaps hugo would
not love her long mans fancy was
fickle so dmitri had told her and
if he should leave her what was
there then to do but die

  these and other thoughts flitted
through her mind while she lay there
intently staring at him until at last
he became conscious of her fearful
gaze and looked down smiling

 how his face changed when he
smiled little crinkles about the eyes
appearing that one would never sus-
pect existed suddenly she was
positive he loved her truly womans
intuition proclaiming with certainty
that hugo could be trusted but she
longed to have him tell her so again

 art tired sweetheart he
asked placing his hand on her fore-
head

  the gentle touch soothed her wild
fancies and she nodded eyes closed
and clasped his hand in both her
own the little hands were hot and
fevered but peace and rest began to
flow into her from hugos cool hard
palm he was so strong so valiant
so adorable although she would
never tell him that

  the fingers gripped tighter she
felt the boat rock as he sat down be-

side her and impulsively she laid
hei head upon his chest and his free
arm held her close thus they drift-
ed along silently each happy because
the other was near until the girl
was first to speak

  hugo she whispered do you
really love me

  you know i do he answered

  you must i am so sick and so
tired hugo always love me-i love
you so much i could not bear it if
you should leave me now for i have
no one else but you you must be
my father mother sweetheart and
brother for you are all i have to
love and i should die if you loved
someone else

  presently she spoke again her
voice muffled against his chest
how much do you love me hugo
was there ever another girl in
france

  it was a hard question to answer
there is always another girl or an-
other man and who can measure
love

  but hugo rose nobly to the occa-
sion and if his speech was perhaps
a little grandiloquent it can be for-
given him since he did not live in
an age or clime where emotions are
suppressed as tightly as the present

  to the age-old question followed
as old an answer and if there were
half remembrances of black eyes and
red lips in a warmer land these
memories were stifled forever as he
said there was never anyone else
but you dear never while grass
grows and wind blows ill love thee
sweet and when they grow and blow
above me my heart will still be
thine  

upon the mountain a young man
was pleading with the mob it
was the brother of the slain wood-
chopper they had found in the forest
and as he gesticulated and stamped
about the end of the small ravine a
mad fanatical light shone in his eyes


weird tales

   come he raved at them are
 ye men or sheep  we are forty -and
 he is one even rats fight when
 they are in packs ye are worse than
 rats

there was a deathlike silence of
some seconds broken only by the
groans of a faceless man dragging
himself down the slope trailing a
 shattered body along by his arms

 then suddenly a voice spoke some-
  where in the crowd with a certain
 pleased surprize like one who has
 just discovered a new and amusing
 fact two words were forty
 was all that it said dwelling with a
 peculiar unction on the first word of
 the correction

   who said that cried the first
 speaker glaring angrily about but
 no one answered

   the broken man lurched on crawl-
 ing like some eyeless slug toward the
 cliff edge and the people they
 shrank away from him as though he
 were a leper

   an uncanny feeling was fast be-
 coming a conviction that any who
 had felt the bite of that long sword
 were accursed

   from the sides they shrank away
 and from in front until he struggled
 through a lane of silent watchers
 and reached the edge of the cliff he
 stopped sensing vacancy before him
 his shattered head swaying blindly
 to and fro no one moved to save
 him a hoarse puzzled croak bubbled
 from his red mask of a face then he
 heaved forward on his arms bal-
 anced on the edge toppled and fell

   a shrill scream a thud below a
 roar of sliding gravel and silence

   men breathed again the strain
 was broken shamefacedly they
 dodged one anothers eyes each
 thinking why didnt i stop him
 before he fell why am i such a
 coward

   the young man seized the pre-
 sented opportunity

   he did that he shouted point-
 ing at dmitri a dim figure in the

pass now once more the
werewolf cowers beyond him shall
we wait longer

 with deep growls of rage and
shame they answered him and the
mass surged forward in the last
charge it was a ponderous irresist-
ible wave of bodies that rolled on to
the attack reached the barricade-
and ghastly horrible shrieks arose
as those in the front were pinned
upon the spikes that projected from
it but there was  turning back

  over the bodies of their writhing
comrades climbed the mob and
pressed on presenting a front of
spears and pikes

  in vain dmitri struck and struck
again the foe was too many and
feeling his strength ebbing fast the
old man knew his hour was upon
him

 back he was crowded as they
mounted over the still-living bodies
that were spiked on the barrier of
projecting swords and sprang down
hammering hard with splintered
clubs and spears

  suddenly as he fought he recol-
lected the words of the old gipsy
crone and with a wry smile realized
that this was the scene she had
described in her vision

  a red mass of gashes he staggered
back still farther gate-opener
swinging like a monstrous sickle in
the hands of death  longer bright
and shining its edge nicked and
dulled on the bones of men

  a momentary lull in the fighting
the way was clogged with dead and
as they cleared the path dmitri
howling an unintelligible battle yell
went berserk

  in his turn he charged-his last
wild strokes a mad effort to keep
them back from the river ten seconds
more-for within his body something
had broken and he knew the end was
near

  gate-opener wdiistled down and a
man collapsed like a slashed sack of
meal-eviscerated his life juices
the werewolfs daughter



flowing from him then while
dmitri still hacked his road through
flesh his right foot came upon some-
thing that rolled and threw him
down

  instantly he was up but too late-
three spears took him and he fell
with his last failing remnants of
sight he saw that he had stepped
upon the tanners head and that
gate-opener lay close by shattered
beyond mending both were leaving
together-the man and the sword

  he smiled wryly again a dead
man shall slay thee  he quoted the
gipsy woman and his eyes closed

  over his body cursing pushing
the tiny remnants of the mob rushed
on to the river but too late for the
twain were far away

  and behind them dmitri raised
himself upon an elbow gasping
faintly with his last breath bren-
ryk have i not kept my word to
thee and so died

upon the river a little boat raced
south rocking in the rushing
current and as they drifted far from
earshot of the village the boy be-
gan to sing softly crooningly the
remainder of the song he had sung
in the forest and which was the elf
mans plea to the fairy for her love

   ill build for thee a silver palace
     and we will call it home

   together drink from a golden chalice
     nevermore to roam

   pain and sorrow all forgotten

    happy we will be

   let mortals go their stupid way

     for i love thee

  and as the voice mellow and
young died away in the distance
while they slipped toward the dan-
ube and the sea the captains soul
passed from his war-torn body drove
past the master perched upon his
rock and began the journey to the
place where such souls go

  and the master as he sped upon
his way gave the captain that sign
of approbation which is given from

one valiant spirit to another for had
he not served the master well

  but of the red wrath and ruin
that raged in ponkert that day when
the soldiers of the black brigade
learned of the glorious fight and
sought out those that were left from
the battle taking a hideous revenge
for their beloved captain it is not
necessary to speak

  carried along on the bosom of the
river the little boat went rocking
downstream while above the sky
reddened with morning

  in the stern hugo trailed an oar
as rudder no longer rowing more
than half asleep nodding over his
task but not so far gone that he did
not know when the girls little fin-
gers slipped into his hand lying limp
on the seat

  he opened one eye enough to see
that hers were closed and that she
slept apparently she was dreaming
for her lips were curved in the love-
liest smile he had ever seen upon her
face she looked much like a little
child lying there asleep her thick
curls in pretty disarray

  carefully that lie might not wake
her he disengaged her fingers from
his hand removed his coat and
spread it over her then one cal-
loused palm held the oar again and
the other stroked a curl that lay
conveniently near

  at the light touch she smiled once
more as though her dreams were
pleasant

  dimly happily she knew that she
would never never be lonely any
more

	blois at last

so we see them two wanderers in
arcadia almost hidden from us
now by the intervening years drop-
ping down the river each finding
joy in the other perfect mates and
very happy

  but it would be too long a story
to relate the whole of that journey-


weird tales

how from this river they entered
another whose name we do not know
but might have been the drave the
save or the theiss and were carried
on bow they went ashore by night
and procured food in many manners
sometimes a vegetable garden suffer-
ing from their visits sometimes a
hen-roost or dairy for although
hugo had money it must be saved
for ship passage when they reached
the sea

  and they had far indeed to go
some seven or eight hundred miles
of travel upon the danube alone full
of natural perils more dangerous
than the men they encountered-and
they were many

  a separate tale could be made of
their adventures on the river-liow
they passed by cities in the night un-
hindered by castles that frowned
down at them two midgets in a
cockle-shell but accosted them not
for toll how river pirates less leni-
ent twice attacked them sweeping
out in long low skiffs from the hid-
den coves in the river bank

  that fight at least deserves a chap-
ter-how they howled out their cry
of blood and death as the skiff
came near and evil faces leered at
the two in the boat how the knit-
ting-needle knitted well unraveling
soul from body and how another
fought beside the girl and boy so
that the attackers dotted the sullen
trater and the fishes fed for days
for invisible to them a thing brood-
ed over the boat a creature powerful
to aid and protect and unknowing
they were owned by it they uncon-
sciously did its bidding but to their
enemies it proved a horror by night
and a terror by day a thing that
mazed mens brains so that sword
strokes and spear thrusts missed
their marks a thing that occasional-
ly was seen by the attackers in its
true shape so that mind could not
bear the shock and men flung their
weapons away and themselves over-
side gibbering madmen if they lived

 for the master was leaving
ponkert and hungary for a new
hunting-ground and wo to any who
would hinder his journey or harm
those who traveled under his protec-
tion 

  and amongst these perils those of
the river must be mentioned

  once they passed the kazan de-
file and the terrible iron gates the
rest was less hazardous but all that
way avas from one danger into an-
other and they dared not travel by
land so along the stream from old
moldova to orsoaa and the iron
gates they floated where the river
is enclosed by mountains and rocky
banks and even landing was difficult
at that time

  through the rocks sand banks
and whirlpools they went some-
times wet all day long from the
spray and often sick and always
weary but pressing on ever on and
each night one days journey nearer
the sea

  once their boat was sunk in the
terrible stenlca rapids a bank of
rocks extending almost across the
river most of them visible at low
water such as they then had and
eleven hundred yards long below
these they stole another boat that
night and went on

  through the vast swamp of the
danube delta they reached the coast
of the black sea from the sulina
mouth of the river here when the
sea rose even a few inches the banks
of the river could be known only by
clusters of wretched hovels built on
piles and narrow strips of sand it
was a avild open seaboard strewn
with wrecks which were the only
guide for mariners to and avhere the
shallows avere

  the people were half-starved in-
bred atavistic creatures wreckers
by nature hardly human and the
tavo were afraid and did not linger

  where nw is a first-class port

habitants lighthouses and floating

elevators it was only by cbance that
they obtained passage on a ship at
constantinople they shipped again
for the last time most of their
money was gone and it was more for
pity than for gain that a captain
agreed to carry the wanderers to
france

  and so they reached the sea and
ships and from the sea they came at
last to blois

epilogue

this the third and final episode of
that strange drama which first
came to the notice of history over
four hundred years ago in an obscure
hungarian village and ended so very
recently in a certain town near
paris has been gathered from sev-
eral sources

  i admit that liberties have been
taken with portions of the narrative
which in the main is couched in my
own words in order to form a co-
herent tale that might be easily
understood

 regina noel my ward whose
story has been related in the return
of the master  furnished me much of
the material that i have drawn upon
she having obtained it from the mas-
ters own lips in her year of asso-
ciation with him obviously there
were gaps in the masters tale many
of them in fact for wherever dis-
credit might be reflected upon him-
self he omitted those portions

  also reginas memory is yet none
too perfect and she had forgotten
much wherefore although spurred
by the interesting fragments wrhieh
she possessed i had flung myself
into the task of writing them into a
whole so many of the essential bits
of knowledge were missing that i
found myself at a standstill

  at one time i despaired of ever
securing enough to work with so
whipped my experiences in france
into rough shape in order that those
at least might be saved since then

i have formed the acquaintance of a
madame white a spiritualist me-
dium among other things and a
dabbler in the occult strictly for the
love of it she is high in theo-
sophieal circles well read highly
intelligent and accomplished not only
in the more curious arts but also in
the various forms of electrical sci-
ence

  to her i owe the clue which has

enabled the completion of the fore-
going story which bridges a gap of
four hundred years explains some
of the witch mania of seventeenth
century europe makes plain exactly
who and what that dread being the
master really was and definitely de-
cides the peculiar destiny of ivga
brenryk-the werewolfs daughter

  the key lay within that mysterious
and ghastly book innoeent in ap-
pearance but how terrible formed
as it was from a tanned human skin
and so desperately desired that the
master dragged me across half a
world to obtain it i

  madame white has explained the
method she used but it is not very
clear to me roughly the theory is
as follows

  all inanimate objeets possess a
sort of slow sluggish life a person-
ality an individuality one might
say an ability to catch and preserve
incidents that have taken place
around them a certain photographic
aptness for retaining transitory
events thus when a camera is
leveled at an object for the taking
of a snapshot not only the prepared
sheet of film receives the impression
but also the wrood metal and cloth
of the camera itself the very walls
which enclose you when this is read
are receiving impressions of you and
the objects within the room which
are in turn receiving impressions
also and filing them for ever and
ever away one superimposed upon
another to an indefinite extent-

weird tales

ready to be used by those who under-
stand their value and means of re-
constructing their past preserved
pictures

  it would appear that even a stone
has memories which opens a vast
field of inquiry one would be inter-
ested for instance to discover the
scenes that the sphinx has witnessed
through the oenturies may her
secrets at last by this method be
known 

  briefly she gains her knowledge
by placing herself closely to the
object from which she wishes to
learn and while in a semi-conscious
state she forms an inexplicable
union with it she claims that she
and the object exchange personalities
for the time being she seeing the
scenes that it has beheld and living
among them as a spectator

  this seems a trifle too wild even
for me i prefer to believe that this
is all a blind expressly to bewilder
me and her real method is a simpler
one akin to clairvoyancy or second
sight she reading these faint impres-
sions by a sort of sixth sense that
are too weak for an ordinary peison
to perceive i slept for three nights
with the book beneath my head but
got nothing but a splitting headache
for my pains

  madame white at her first trial
gave me such a revolting description
of a man being flayed alive that it
fairly made me ill

  after many of these so-called
unions i had the story nearly
complete the things that the book
had seen fitting together with
that which regina told me and other
facts which i already knew from my
studies still there were blank spots
and on these i have been obliged to
use imagination to fill in if i would
give a realistic picture of the period
i crave the license ordinarily given
to poets in the reading of this try
and approach the tale with an open
mind for at the worst it may enter-

tain and there is food for thought
within it

 the babylonians warning in
chapter seven received entirely
through madame white the book
slung from the scaffold having ap-
parently caught and held the very
words is a most remarkable bit of
prophecy yet i think he laid alto-
gether too much stress on the part
  the stranger from an unknown
land   was to play those who have
read the return of the master will
recall that as a conqueror of the mas-
ter i cut a poor figure as a hero
most of my time being spent dodg-
ing or running away from something
or othor the real fighting being done
for me the general trend of his pre-
diction however as any who are at
all familiar with mediaeval european
history will notice befell as the
babylonian foretold

you may search the books and
records of the period both in
france and hungary for any men-
tion of these happenings but unless
you meet with better fortune than
we have had your search will be in
vain

  history is discreetly silent upon
the primary cause of the frightful
persecutions in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries the master
is never referred to in any form
religious mania ignorance and
superstition being blamed instead

  there has been much discussion in
recent years on the causes of that
wave of psychic panic which passed
over christendom in these centuries
and was as marked on the continent
of europe as in great britain and
new england

  it is of course a mistake to think
of witchcraft as a mediaeval super-
stition for comparatively little is
heard of it in the middle ages the
great witchcraft furor originated in
the sixteenth century and lasted
perhaps less than a hundred years
is it not curious that it attacked
the werewolfs daughter



catholics equally with protestants
and the latin races equally with the
teutonic 

  would it be too bold to advance
the theory that perhaps for the first
time in history the master found
the exactly suitable conditions for
his ghastly purpose of revenge upon
the human race 

  thus where before his victims
had been numbered in sevens that
number of occult significance his
influence from a small beginning
spread and circled and continually
spread each sufferer infecting others
with his disease in that poisonous
atmosphere of bigotry superstition
and intolerance the innocent per-
ished with the guilty everyone who
had grudges straightway pointed
the finger of accusation at his enemy
thus the toll mounted into thou-
sands and tens of thousands

 witch wizard sorcer-
er werewolf vampire
warlock to the stake then
with this monster   great day to-
morrow  sport for all   another
demon found tried and sentenced  
death to them

  so the general trend of thought
ran from the year  in como
italy where one thousand persons
were put to death in one year and
about one hundred every year after
for several years in lorraine so
many were banished from the coun-
try that whole towns were on the
point of becoming desolate there
nine hundred people so boasts the
learned inquisitor remigius were
put to death by him alone in fifteen
years

  in england from  to  the
average number of executions
reached the terrific height of five
hundred annually so that about
forty-two thousand witches were
burnt in the presence of a delighted
audience numbering thousands of
people the madness died very
gradually and even broke out ram-
pantly in germany in 

  during the eighteenth century
- the true children of the
kirk of scotland regarded them-
selves as the excellent ones of the
earth all others being but slaves of
satan it was generally believed
that evil spirits were roaming about
with satan at their head and that
these spirits assumed various forms
such as a black dog or even a bull

  belief in witch animals still per-
sists among the uneducated classes
in parts of the united kingdom

  does not the theory help to ex-
plain 

  the salem trials in this country
were nearly the last of the sporadic
outbreaks that occurred as reason
began to dominate superstition and
the old ideas to lose their power
the new enlightenment can be laid
to the opening of the mechanical
age machines and fancies do not
seem to get along well with each
other and only the more backward
peoples have now such beliefs the
old gods are dead and a new one
commands obedience

  perhaps the old ways were better
but those days were dark and bloody
and who would change if he could 

  and now the master has left our
world let us hope for ever the
master that tragic sinister cruel
being that mysterious creature who
was betrayed and forced into ways
that delivered a staggering blow to
civilization upon this planet that
we have recovered is no honor to us
one being no matter how powerful
can not conquer a world

  though his final effort might have
succeeded for a time in france his
success could not have been other
than temporary we have too many
weapons instant communication be-
tween localities and intelligent scien-
tists for such a desperate attempt as
he made in starting a pack of were-
wolves in this age to succeed he
had his ehance and failed

  but i have wandered far from the
track


weird tales

  as has been said there is prac-
tically no proof of this tale unless
you can read a little proof into the
following facts which have been
taken from a number of sources
ponkert i have found on no map nor
another reference to it outside of
the odd book probably the name
has been changed with the passing
of years still it might be found by
means of the mountain which ma-
dame white describes mountains
near a river with the peak split in
twain can not be common there if
anywhere proof might be obtained

  madame white states definitely
that the young frenchman came
from blois and returned to the home
of his father

  years later according to the en-
cyclopedia britannica blois was
known as the city of werewolves due
to the numbers of these creatures in
and about the city

  the narrative states that the young
frenchmans name was gunnar

  in the records of the city we find
a bare notice of a couple by that
name there were seven sons at the
death of the old couple in the year

 who separated and were heard
of no more their land was sold and
that branch of the family passed
from existence again the recurrent
seven

  now i think it is not too unreason-
able to suppose that ivga granting
this couple to be the same which fig-
ure in the story would have dis-
closed this curse to her sons before
she died perhaps in that moment
recalling the unholy bargain she had
made for her life as the master had
promised she would remember

  awed by their peril they must
have fled in many directions each
changing his name slightly to throw
his pursuer off the track

  freed from his promise by ivgas
death the master would have left
the place where he was then amusing
himself como and begun his work
of stamping out the accursed line

  you will find that these facts
strangely agree with madame whites
and regina noels composite story
and with the details of the other ac-
counts you have read

  to me they seem to bridge a great
gap

the end
a brief tale is

poison

by jack snow

no it wasnt on saras ac-
count that cristin was doing
it sara simply had been
the last straw he had nothing left
to cling to now-nothing more to live
for he took out a small bottle
from his pocket and stared at it he
pulled the cork and smelled its con-
tents it smelled of almonds and
was colorless  water he recorked
the bottle and placed it carefully in
his pocket again he had got it this
morning from the druggist the
stupid fool had gaped at him when
he asked for it but he had got it all
right there was enough poison
there he was sure for six men

  cristin looked at his watch it
was ten minutes to  at  on the
last stroke of the bell he would re-
move the cork and swallow the color-
less liquid then-god-he would
be well ut of it perhaps he would
be able to avatch over sara perhaps
he might sing to her in her sleep and
bring her beautiful dreams

  cristin was a strange bright-eyed
young man ilis eyes were palely
green and some of the folks about
town were wont to trace his eccen-
tricities and queer actions to the
depths of his gleaming pupils they
said he was mad that was the
reputation he had earned himself by
giving way to violent fits of revolt
and stormy passion against himself
and his world

  and now cristin stood stiffly star-
ing before him the wide window
was opened and a slight summer
breeze stroked the draperies with a
gentle undulating motion he stared
up at the heavens all this-the
crescent moon the vari-pointed stars

the deep velvet blue the low mur-
muring wind-all would be alien to
him in a few minutes he was going
to die at the stroke of the clock he
was calm it would all go off quietly
what was the use of making a fuss
a few years more or less what could
it matter tears sparkled in his
eyes

  the clock was striking ten-eleven
-twelve he uncorked the bottle and
raised it to his lips the liquid went
down easily leaving the character-
istic almond taint of the poison in
his nostrils he felt the unmistak-
able puckering of his lips and mouth
he was trembling and cold could
it be that he was dying so soon

  he sat down on the edge of the
mounded white bed iiow like a
shroud it looked concealing some
gigantic bloated corpse he arose
again and walked to the window
he could not remain still action
motion were what he wanted and so
he was to die tonight he thought
had the insidious poison already
spread through his system was
this indeed his last night his last
hour among familiar homely things
was all to be changed now was
nothing ever to be the same was
he to die tonight god he could
scarcely bring himself to believe it

 a thousand thoughts rushed
through his mind-things he had for-
gotten he had not written to his
sister he had meant to write he
must do so before he could die and
his papers-he had forgotten to stop
them they would koep on coming
until his room was filled to the ceil-
ing but why did he think of such


weird tales

tilings now that he was to die all
was to be changed now

  cristin looked out into the night
how queerly how vaporously the
stars twinkled they seemed to be
dripping starlight and what a
wind that was whistling through the
tree tops what a wild roaring
wind and-oh god-he could
feel no wind at all and all those
purple clouds hovering so low-what
were they surely such clouds had
never been seen before they were
hollow and reddish purple ominous
feverish-looking things cristin
flenched his fists and turned from
the rindow although the sound of
the roaring windtstill filled his head
so he was really going to die tonight

  it was almost dark in the room
except for the moonlight and the
various objects took on strange and
grotesque shapes nothing was the
same now-nothing would ever be the
same all was changed and strange

  what were those long thin shad-
ows there in the comer by the win-
dow they were writhing and grop-
ing up the side of the wall like huge
serpents he stared palely through
the gloom and then sighed it was
the plants the flowers and ferns in
the pots how they were growing
up the wall they crept-up-up
now they were spreading over the
ceiling a terrific odor assailed his
nostrils it was the mighty sweetness
of the lavender narcissus towering
above him like a small tree the
fern was still growing mounting
higher and higher interlacing its
festoons and weaving about over the
eeiling would it never cease its wild
growth he could hear its tendrils
cracking and unfolding the room
looked like a greenhouse

  and then cristin shook himself
he was allowing his fancy to play
tricks on him again he must con-
trol himself but then if only fancy
pure and simple it were what a mad
one what a strange delirium of a
dying mind that -was it he was

dying all this was only natural he
must resign himself to its weirdness
dying he was tonight oh god
surely not tonight not this night
no no this was too strange too ter-
rible give him a few hours just
until morning only a few brief
hours let him have tonight

  he would not die tonight he would
not no no he would live he
would bring the poison up yes by
all the demons of hell it should come
up he would not die he would not
but oh how the wind roared and
moaned and the purple clouds were
gathering thicker and thicker

  cristin stood trembling and per-
spiring with desperation water
water he wanted water would
bring it up he must have water
he started toward the door and then
whirled around gasping where was
the door it should be there by the
bureau he remembered but it was
gone only the smooth paper was
there where was it he groped
wildly about the room feeling with
his hands and stumbling over chairs
and stands this continued for some
minutes a cristin rushed frantically
about the room but at last he gave it
up he fell on the bed trembling
and sobbing he was a prisoner-a
prisoner in his own room and he
must have water

  sobs deep and long racked his
body and then at last he sat up and
stared up at the wall there was a
picture he muttered to himself a
picture of a beautiful green meadow
with a gurgling singing stream flow-
ing through it there were golden
yellow buttercups and sweet nodding
daisies growing on its banks a
calm china-blue sky and white bil-
lowing clouds floated serenely above
there was water and escape from
death-miserable ratlike death what
a haven he seized a chair and
placed it underneath the picture he
climbed upon the chair and gazed
into the picture for several minutes

  how clear and sparkling the water
poison



was how it would eool his poor
brain and soothe his fevered lips he
grasped the edges of the picture
frame in ms hands and stared eager-
ly thirstily at the picture and
then suddenly he felt himself dan-
gling in the air he must have
lacked the chair from under him he
thought he looked down but no
there it was-but oh how far below
him and how vast how immense
the room had become and the picture
-the picture was plunging toward
him at a terrific speed he could
hear the water rushing between the
banks of the stream he was still
dangling in the air in space things
were gigantic were becoming huger
and more gargantuan every moment
or wait-could it be that lie was glow-
ing smallert yes that must be it
the trouble was not with the room
and his surroundings but with him-
self it was the effect of that devils
poison it was shrinking him up
smaller and smaller

  there was only one thing for cris-

tin to do he pulled himself up over
the edge of the monstrous picture
frame and tumbled forward upon
the grass he was in a meadow
several hundred feet away flowed a
elear sparkling stream he was
walking toward the stream what a
blue sky was above and what sweet
fresh air stirred only by a gentle
fanning breeze and birds sang-
lovely trilling notes

the next day the news of cristms
death was made known and spread
generally over the town when it
reaehed the old druggist he was
shaken and bewildered for a moment
then he retired to the depths of his
dark ill-smelling shop mumbling and
rubbing his chin in perplexity

  strange he muttered to him-
self he should have known i
wouldnt sell him prussic acid know-
ing him as well as i did but now
how the devil did he kill himself with
a bottle rinsed out with almond oil
and filled up with water

the monster-maker

by w a morrow

a young man of refined ap-	able skill the house was a queer and

pearanee but evidently suffer-	primitive brick affair entirely out of

ing great mental distress pre-	date and tolerable only in the de-

sented himself one morning at the	cayed part of the city in which it

residence of a singular old man who	stood it was large gloomy and

was known as a surgeon of remark-	dark and had long corridors and dis-


weird tales

mal rooms and it was absurdly large
for the small family-mail and wife
-that occupied it the house de-
scribed the man is portrayed-but
not the woman he could be agree-
able on occasion but for all that he
was but animated mystery his wife
was weak wan reticent evidently
miserable and possibly living a life
of dread or horror-perhaps witness
of repulsive things subject of anxie-
ties and victim of fear and tyranny
but there is a great deal of guessing
in these assumptions he was about
sixty-five years of age and she about
forty he was lean tall and bald
with thin smooth-shaven face and
very keen eyes he kept always at
home and was slovenly the man was
strong the woman weak he domi-
nated she suffered

  although he was a surgeon of rare
skill his practise was almost nothing
for it was a rare occurrence that the
few who knew of his great ability
were brave enough to penetrate the
gloom of his house and when they
did so it was with deaf ear turned to
sundry ghoulish stories that were
whispered concerning him these
were in great part but exaggerations
of his experiments in vivisection he
was devoted to the science of sur-
gery

  the young man who presented him-
self on the morning just mentioned
was a handsome fellow yet of evident
weak character and unhealthy tem-
perament-sensitive and easily ex-
alted or depressed a single glance
convinced the surgeon that his visitor
was seriously affected in mind for
there was never bolder skull-grin of
melancholia fixed and irremediable

  a stranger would not have sus-
pected any occupancy of the house
the street door-old warped and
blistered by the sun-was locked and
the small faded-green window-blinds
were closed the young man rapped
at the door no answer he rapped
again still  sign he examined
a slip of paper glanced at the num-

ber on the house and then with the
impatience of a child he furiously
kicked the door there were signs of
numerous other such kicks a re-
sponse came in the shape of a shuf-
fling footstep in the hall a turning
of the rusty key and a sharp face
that peered through a cautious open-
ing in the door

  are you the doctor asked the
young man

  yes yes come in briskly re-
plied the master of the house

  the young man entered the old
surgeon closed the door and carefully
locked it this way he said ad-
vancing to a rickety flight of stairs
the young man followed the sur-
geon led the way up the stairs turned
into a narrow musty-smelling corri-
dor at the left traversed it rattling
the loose boards under his feet at the
farther end opened a door at the
right and beckoned his visitor to en-
ter the young man found himself
in a pleasant room furnished in an-
tique fashion and with hard sim-
plicity

  sit down said the old man
placing a chair so that its occupant
should face a window that looked out
upon a dead wall about six feet from
the house he threw open the blind
and a pale light entered he then
seated himself near his visitor and di-
rectly facing him and with a search-
ing look that had all the power of a
microscope he proceeded to diagnos-
ticate the case

  well he presently asked

  the young man shifted uneasily in
his seat

  i-i have come to see you he
finally stammered because im in
trouble  

  ah

  yes you see i-that is-i have
given it up

    ah   there was pity added to
sympathy in the ejaculation

  thats it given it up added
the visitor he took from his pocket
a roll of banknotes and with the
the monster-maker



utmost deliberation he counted them
out upon his knee five thousand
dollars he calmly remarked that
is for you its all i have but i pre-
sume-i imagine-no that is not the
word-assume-yes thats the word
-assume that five thousand-is it
really that much let me count
he counted again that five thou-
sand dollars is a sufficient fee for
what i want you to do

  the surgeons lips curled pityingly
-perhaps disdainfully also what
do you want me to do he carelessly
inquired

  the young man rose looked around
with a mysterious air approached the
surgeon and laid the money across
his knee then he stooped and whis-
pered two words in the surgeons ear

  these words produced an electric
effect the old man started violent-
ly then springing to his feet he
caught his visitor angrily and trans-
fixed him with a look that was as
sharp as a knife his eyes flashed
and he opened his mouth to give ut-
terance to some harsh imprecation
when he suddenly checked himself
the anger left his face and only pity
remained he relinquished his grasp
picked up the scattered notes and
offering them to the visitor slowly
said

  i do not want your money you
are simply foolish you think you
are in trouble well you do not
know what trouble is your only
trouble is that you have not a trace
of manhood in your nature you are
merely insane-i shall not say pusil-
lanimous you should surrender
yourself to the authorities and be
sent to a lunatic asylum for proper
treatment 

  the young man keenly felt the in-
tended insult and his eyes flashed
dangerously

 you old dog-you insult me
thus  he cried   grand airs these
you give yourself virtuously indig-
nant old murderer you dont
want my money eh when a man

comes to you himself and wants it
done you fly into a passion and
spurn his money but let an enemy of
his come and pay you and you are
only too willing how many such
jobs have you done in this miserable
old hole it is a good thing for you
that the police have not run you
down and brought spade and shovel
with then do you know what is
said of you do you think you have
kept your windows so closely shut
that no sound has ever penetrated be-
yond them where do you keep
your infernal implements   

  he had worked himself into a high
passion his voice was hoarse loud
and rasping his eyes bloodshot
started from their sockets his whole
frame twitched and his fingers
writhed but he was in the presence
of a man infinitely his superior two
eyes like those of a snake burned
two holes through him an overmas-
tering inflexible presence confronted
one weak and passionate

  sit down commanded the stern
voice of the surgeon

  it was the voice of father to child
of master to slave the fury left the
visitor who weak and overcome fell
upon a chair

  meanwhile a peculiar light had
appeared in the old surgeons face
the dawn of a strange idea a gloomy
ray strayed from the fires of the bot-
tomless pit the baleful light that il-
lumines the way of the enthusiast
the old man remained a moment in
profound abstraction gleams of
eager intelligence bursting momen-
tarily through the cloud of somber
meditation that covered his face
then broke the broad light of a deep
impenetrable determination there
was something sinister in it suggest-
ing the sacrifice of something held
sacred after a struggle mind had
vanquished conscience

  taking a piece of paper and a pen-
cil the surgeon carefully wrote an-
swers to questions which he peremp-
torily addressed to his visitor such as


weird tales

 his name age place of residence oc-
 cupation and the like and the same
 inquiries concerning his parents to-
 gether with other particular matters

  does any one know you came to
this house he asked

 no

  you swear it

  yes

  but your prolonged absence will
 cause alarm and lead to search

    i have provided against that  
  how

  by depositing a note in the post
 as i came along announcing my in-
 tention to drown myself

  the river will be dragged

    what then    asked the young
 man shrugging his shoulders with
 careless indifference rapid under-
 current you know a good many are
 never found

  there was a pause

  are you ready finally asked
the surgeon

  perfectly the answer was cool
 and determined

  the manner of the surgeon how-
 ever showed much perturbation the
 pallor that had come into his face at
 the moment his decision was formed
 became intense a nervous tremu-
 lousness came over his frame above
 it all shone the light of enthusiasm

  have you a choice in the meth-
 od he asked

  yes extreme anesthesia

  with what agent

  the surest and quickest

	do you desire any-any subse-
quent disposition   

  no only nullification simply a
 blowing out as of a candle in the
 wind a puff-then darkness without
 a trace a sense of your own safety
 may suggest the method i leave it
 to you

  no delivery to your friends
  none whatever

  another pause

 did you say you are quite
ready asked the surgeon

  quite ready

  and perfectly willing
  anxious

  then wait a moment

  with this request the old surgeon
rose to his feet and stretched himself
then with the stealthiness of a cat he
opened the door and peered into the
hall listening intently there was no
sound he softly closed the door and
locked it then he closed the win-
dow-blinds and locked them this
done he opened a door leading into
an adjoining room which though it
had no window was lighted by means
of a small skylight the young man
watched closely a strange change
had come over him while his de-
termination had net one whit les-
sened a look of great relief came into
his face displacing the haggard de-
spairing look of a half-hour before
melancholic then he was ecstatic
now

the opening of the second door
disclosed a curious sight in the
center of the room directly under the
skylight was an operating-table such
as is used by demonstrators of anat-
omy a glass case against the wall
held surgical instruments of every
kind hanging in another case were
human skeletons of various sizes in
sealed jars arranged on shelves were
monstrosities of divers kinds pre-
served in alcohol there were also
among innumerable other articles
scattered about the room a manikin
a stuffed cat a desiccated human
heart plaster casts of various parts
of the body numerous charts and a
large assortment of drugs and chem-
icals there was also a lounge which
could be opened to form a couch the
surgeon opened it and moved the op-
erating-table aside giving its place to
the lounge

  come in he called to his visi-
tor

  the young man obeyed without the
least hesitation

  take off your coat

  he complied
the monster-maker



  lie down on that lounge

  in a moment the young man was
stretched at full length eyeing the
surgeon the latter undoubtedly was
suffering under great excitement but
he did not waver his movements
were sure and quick selecting a bot-
tle containing a liquid he carefully
measured out a certain quantity
while doing this he asked

  have you ever had any irregular-
ity of the heart

  no

  the answer was prompt but it was
immediately followed by a quizzical
look in the speakers face

  i presume he added you mean
by your question that it might be
dangerous to give me a certain drug
under the circumstances however i
fail to see any relevancy in your ques-
tion  

  this took the surgeon aback but he
hasteiijed to explain that he did not
wish to inflict unnecessary pain and
hence his question

  he placed the glass on a stand ap-
proached his visitor and carefully ex-
amined his pulse

  wonderful he exclaimed
  why

  it is perfectly normal

  because i am wholly resigned
indeed it has been long since i knew
such happiness it is not active but
infinitely sweet  

  you have no lingering desire to
retract 

  none whatever

  the surgeon went to the stand and
returned with the draft

  take this he said kindly

  the young man partially raised
himself and took the glass in his hand
he did not show the vibration of a
single nerve he drank the liquid
draining the last drop then he re-
turned the glass with a smile

  thank you he said you are
the noblest man that lives may you
always prosper and be happy you
are my benefactor my liberator
bless you bless you you reach down

from your seat with the gods and lift
me up into glorious peace and rest
i love you-i love you with all my
heart 

  these words spoken earnestly in a
musical low voice and accompanied
with a smile of ineffable tenderness
pierced the old mans heart a sup-
pressed convulsion swept over him
intense anguish wrung his vitals per-
spiration trickled down his face the
young man continued to smile

  ah it does me good said he

  the surgeon with a strong effort to
control himself sat down upon the
edge of the lounge and took his visi-
tor s wrist counting the pulse

 how long will it take the
young man asked

  ten minutes two have passed
the voice was hoarse

    ah only eight minutes more   
delicious delicious i feel it com-
ing    what was that    ah
i understand music    beauti-
ful    coming coming  is
that-that-water    trickling
dropping  doctor  

 well

 thank you thank you   
noble man    my savior    my
bene    factor    trickling
   trickling    dripping drip-
ping    doctor

 well

     doetor  

  past hearing muttered the sur-
geon

  doctor

  and blind

  response was made by a firm grasp
of the hand

  doctor

  and numb

     doctor  

  the old man watched and waited
  dripping    dripping

  the last drop had run there was
a sigh and nothing more

the surgeon laid down the hand
the first step he groaned ris-
ing to his feet then his whole frame
dilated the first step-the most


weird tales

difficult yet the simplest a provi-
dential delivery into my hands of that
for which i have hungered for forty
years no withdrawal now it is
possible because scientific rational
but perilous if i succeed-if i shall
succeed i will sueceed    and
after suceess-what    yes
what publish the plan and the re-
sult the gallows  so long as
it shall exist and i exist the gallows
that much    but how account
for its presence ah that pinehes
hard i must trust to the future

  he tore himself from the revery
and started

    i wonder if she heard or saw any-
thing  

  with that reflection he cast a glance
upon the form on the lounge and then
left the room locked the door locked
also the door of the outer room
walked down two or three corridors
penetrated to a remote part of the
house and rapped at a door it was
opened by his wife he by this time
had regained complete mastery over
himself

  i thought i heard someone in the
house just now he said but i can
find no one

   heard nothing  

  he was greatly relieved

  i did hear someone knock at the
door less than an hour ago she re-
sumed and heard you speak i
think did he come in  

 no

  the woman glanced at his feet and
seemed perplexed

  i am almost certain she said
that i heard footfalls in the house
and yet i see that you are wearing
slippers  

  oh i had on my shoes then
that explains it said the wo-
man satisfied i think the sound
you heard must have been caused by
rats  

  ah that was it exclaimed the
surgeon leaving he elosed the door
reopened it and said  i do not wish
to be disturbed today he said to

himself as he went down the hall

all is clear there

  he returned to the room in which
his visitor lay and made a careful
examination

  splendid specimen he softly ex-
claimed every organ sound every
function perfect fine large frame
well-shaped muscles strong and
sinewy capable of wonderful devel-
opment-if given opportunity   
i have no doubt it can be done al-
ready i have succeeded with a dog-
a task less difficult than this for in a
man the eerebrum overlaps the cere-
bellum which is not the case with a
dog this gives a wide range for ac-
cident with but one opportunity in a
lifetime in the cerebrum the intel-
lect and the affections in the cerebel-
lum the senses and the motor forces
in the medulla oblongata control of
the diaphragm in these two latter lie
all the essentials of simple existence
the cerebrum is merely an adorn-
ment that is to say reason and the
affeetions are almost purely orna-
mental i have already proved it
my dog with its cerebrum removed
was idiotic but it retained its physical
senses to a certain degree  

  while thus ruminating he made
careful preparations he moved the
eoueh replaced the operating-table
under the skylight selected a number
of surgical instruments prepared
certain drug-mixtuies and arranged
water towels and all the accessories
of a tedious surgical operation sud-
denly he burst into laughter

  poor fool he exclaimed paid
me five thousand dollars to kill him
didnt have the courage to snuff his
own candle singular singular the
queer freaks these madmen have
you thought you were dying poor
idiot allow me to inform you sir
that you are as much alive at this mo-
ment as ever you were in your life
but it will be all the same to you
you shall never be more conscious
than you are now and for all prac-
tical purposes so far as they concern
the monster-marer



you yon are dead henceforth though
you shall live by the way how
should you feel imthout a head ha
ha ha    but thats a sorry joke
he lifted the unconscious form
from the lounge and laid it upon the
operating-table

a bout three years afterward the
following conversation was held
between a captain of police and a de-
tective 

  she may be insane suggested
the captain

  i think she is

  	 and yet you credit her story  

  i do

  singular

  not at all i myself have learned
something 

 what

  much in one sense little in
another you have heard those queer
stories of her husband well they are
all nonsensical-probably with one ex-
ception he is generally a harmless
old fellow but peculiar he has per-
formed some wonderful surgical op-
erations the people in his neighbor-
hood are ignorant and they fear him
and wish to be rid of him hence they
tell a great many lies about him and
they come to believe their own stories
the one important thing that i have
learned is that he is almost insanely
enthusiastic on the subject of surgery
-especially experimental surgery
and with an enthusiast there is hardly
such a thing as a scruple it is this
that gives me confidence in the wo-
man s story  

 you say she appeared to be
frightened   

  doubly so-first she feared that
her husband would learn of her be-
trayal of him second the discovery
itself had terrified her  

  but her report of this discovery
is very vague argued the captain
he conceals everything from her
she is merely guessing 

  in part-yes m other part-no
she heard the sounds distinctly

though she did not see clearly horror
closed her eyes what she thinks she
saw is i admit preposterous but she
undoubtedly saw something extremely
frightful there are many peculiar
little circumstances he has eaten
with her but few times during the last
three years and nearly always car-
ries his food to his private rooms
she says that he either consumes an
enormous quantity throws much
away or is feeding something that
eats prodigiously he explains this
to her by saying that he has animals
with which he experiments this is
not true again he always keeps the
door to these rooms carefully locked
and not only that but he has had the
doors doubled and otherwise strength-
ened and has heavily barred a win-
dow that looks from one of the rooms
upon a dead wall a few feet distant
what does it mean asked the
captain

  a prison

  for animals perhaps
  certainly not

 why

  because in the first place cages
would have been better in the second
place the security that he has pro-
vided is infinitely greater than that
required for the confinement of
ordinary animals

  all this is easily explained he has
a violent lunatic under treatment
i had thought of that but such is
not the fact

 how do you know

  by reasoning thus  he has always
refused to treat cases of lunacy he
confines himself to surgery- the walls
are not padded for the woman has
heard sharp blows upon them no
human strength however morbid
could possibly require such resisting
strength as has been provided he
would not be likely to eonceal a luna-
tics confinement from the woman
no lunatic could consume all the food
that he provides so extremely violent
mania as these precautions indicate
could not continue three years if


weird tales

there is a lunatic in the ease it is very
probable that there should have been
communication with someone outside
concerning the patient and there has
been none the woman has listened at
the keyhole and has heard no human
voice within and last we have heard
the womans vague description of
what she saw

  you have destroyed every possible
theory said the captain deeply in-
terested   and have suggested nothing
new  

  	 unfortunately i can not but the
truth may be very simple after all
the old surgeon is so peculiar that i
am prepared to discover something
remarkable  

    have you suspicions   

  i have

 of what

 a crime the woman suspects
it

    and betrays it  

    certainly because it is so horrible
that her humanity revolts so terrible
that her whole nature demands of her
that she hand over the criminal t- the
law so frightful that she is in mortal
terror so awful that it has shaken
her mind  

 what do you propose to do
asked the captain

 secure evidence i may need
help  

  you shall have all the men you
require go ahead but be careful
you are on dangerous ground you
would be a mere plaything in the
hands of that man  

two days afterward the detective
again sought the captain

  i have a queer document he
said exhibiting torn fragments of pa-
per on which there was writing
the woman stole it and brought it
to me she snatched a handful out of
a book getting only a part of each of
a few leaves  

  these fragments which the men ar-
ranged as best they could were the
detective explained torn by the sur-

geons wife from the first volume of a
number of manuscript books which
her husband had written on one sub-
ject-the very one that was the cause
of her excitement

  about the time that he began a
cettain experiment three years ago
continued the detective he removed
everything from the suite of two
rooms containing his study and his
operating-room in one of the book-
cases that he removed to a room across
the passage was a drawer which he
kept locked but which he opened
from time to time as is quite com-
mon with such pieces of furniture the
lock of the drawer is a very poor one
and so the woman while making a
thorough search yesterday found a
key on her bunch that fitted this lock
she opened the drawer drew out the
bottom book of a pile so that its mu-
tilation would more likely escape dis-
covery saw that it might contain a
clue and tore out a handful of the
leaves she had barely replaced the
book locked the drawer and made
her escape when her husband ap-
peared he hardly ever allows her to
be out of his sight when she is in that
part of the house  

  the fragments read as follows
    the motory nerves i had
hardly dared to hope for such a re-
sult although inductive reasoning had
convinced me of its possibility my
only doubt having been on the score
of my lack of skill their operation
has been only slightly impaired and
even this would not have been the
case had the operation been performed
in infancy before the intellect had
sought and obtained recognition as an
essential part of the whole therefore
i state as a oved fact that the cells
of the motory nerves have inherent
forces sufficient to the purposes of
those nerves but hardly so with the
sensory nerves these latter are in
fact an offshoot of the former
evolved from them by natural though
not essential heterogeneity and to a
certain extent are dependent on the
the monster-maker



evolution and expansion of a contem-
poraneous tendency that developed
into mentality or mental function
both of these latter tendencies these
evolvements are merely refinements
of the motory system and not inde-
pendent entities that is to say they
are the blossoms of a plant that propa-
gates from its roots the motory sys-
tem is the first   

   nor am i surprized that such
prodigious muscular energy is devel-
oping it promises yet to surpass the
wildest dreams of human strength i
account for it thus the powers of as-
similation had reached their full de-
velopment they had formed the
habit of doing a certain ar ant of
work they sent their products to all
parts of the system as a result of
my operation the consumption of
these products was reduced fully one-
half  that is to say about one-half of
the demand for them was withdrawn
but force of habit required the pro-
duction to proceed this production
was strength vitality energy thus
double the usual quantity of this
strength this energy was stored in
the remaining   

   developed a tendency that
did surprize me nature no longer
suffering the distraction of extraneous
interferences and at the same time
being cut in two as it were with
reference to this case did not fully
adjust herself to the new situation as
does a magnet which when divided at
the point of equilibrium renews itself
in its two fragments by investing each
with opposite poles but on the con-
trary being severed from laws that
theretofore had controlled her and
possessing still that mysterious tend-
ency to develop into something more
potential and complex she blindly
having lost her lantern pushed her
demands for material that would se-
cure this development and as blindly
used it when it was given her hence
this marvelous voracity this insati-
able hunger this wonderful ravenous-
ness  and hence also there being

nothing but the physical part to re-
ceive this vast storing of energy this
strength that is becoming almost
hourly herculean almost daily ap-
palling it is becoming a serious   

  narrow escape today by
some means while i was absent it
unscrewed the stoppet of the silver
feeding-pipe which i have already
herein termed the artificial mouth
and in one of its curious antics al-
lowed all the chyle to escape from its
stomach through the tube its hunger
then became intense-i may say fu-
rious i placed my hands upon it to
push it into a chair when feeling my
touch it caught me clasped me
around the neck and would have
crushed me to death instantly had i
not slipped from its powerful grasp
thus i always had to be on my guard
i have provided the screw stopper
with a spring catch and   

  usually docile when not
hungry slow and heavy in its move-
ments which are of course purely
unconscious any apparent excitement
in movement being due to local ir-
regularities in the blood-supply of the
cerebellum which if i did not have it
enclosed in a silver case that is im-
movable i should expose and 
the captain looked at the detective
with a puzzled air

  i dont understand it at all said
he

  nor i agreed the detective
  what do you propose to do
  make a raid

    do you want a man   

   three the strongest men in your
district

 why the surgeon is old and
weak 

  nevertheless i want three strong
men and for that matter prudence
really advises me to take twenty 

at one oclock the next morning a
cautious scratching sound might
have been heard in the ceiling of the
surgeons operating-room shortly
afterward the skylight sash was care-


weird tales

fully raised and laid aside a man
peered into the opening nothing
could be heard

    that is singular   thought the de-
tective

  he cautiously lowered himself to
the floor by a rope and then stood for
seme moments listening intently
there was a dead silence he shot the
slide of a dark-lantern and rapidly
swept the room with the light it was
bare with the exception of a strong
iron staple and ring screwed to the
floor in the center of the room with a
heavy chain attached the detective
then turned his attention to the outer
room it was perfectly bare he was
deeply perplexed returning to the
inner room he called softly to the men
to descend while they were thus oc-
cupied he re-entered the outer room
and examined the door a glance suf-
ficed it was kept closed by a spring
attachment and was locked with a
strong spring-lock that could be
drawn from the inside

  the bird has just flown mused
the detective a singular accident
the discovery and proper use of this
thumb-bolt might not have happened
once in fifty years if my theory is
correct

  by this time the men were behind
him he noiselessly drew the spring-
bolt opened the door and looked out
into the hall he heard a peculiar
sound it was as though a gigantic
lobster were floundering and scram-
bling in some distant part of the old
house accompanying this sound
was a loud whistling breathing and
frequent rasping gasps

  these sounds were heard by still
another person-the surgeons wife
for they originated very near her
rooms which were a considerable dis-
tance from her husbands she had
been sleeping lightly tortured by fear
and harassed by frightful dreams
the conspiracy into which she had
recently entered for the destruction
of her husband was a source of great
anxiety she constantly suffered from

the most gloomy forebodings and
lived in an atmosphere of terror
added to the natural horror of her
situation were those countless sources
of fear which a fright-shaken mind
creates and then magnifies she was
indeed in a pitiable state having
been driven first by terror to despera-
tion and then to madness

   startled thus out of fitful slumber
by the noise at her door she sprang
from her bed to the floor every terror
that lurked in her acutely tense mind
and diseased imagination starting up
and almost overwhelming her the
idea of flight-one of the strongest of
all instincts-seized upon her and she
ran to the door beyond all control of
reason she drew the bolt and flung
the door wide open and then fled
wildly down the passage the appal-
ling hissing and rasping gurgle ring-
ing in her ears apparently with a
thousandfold intensity but the pas-
sage was in absolute darkness and she
had not taken a half-dozen steps when
she tripped upon an unseen object on
the floor she fell headlong upon it
encountering in it a large soft warm
substance that writhed and squirmed
and from which came the sounds that
had awakened her instantly realiz-
ing her situation she uttered a shriek
such as only an unnamable terror ean
inspire but hardly had her cry
started the echoes in the empty cor-
 ridor than it was suddenly stifled
two prodigious arms had closed upon
her and crushed the life out of her

   the cry performed the office of di-
recting the detective and his assist-
ants and it also aroused the old sur-
geon who occupied rooms between
the officers and the object of their
search the cry of agony pierced him
to the marrow and a realization of the
cause of it burst upon him with
frightful force

   it has come at last he gasped
springing from his bed

  snatching from a table a dimly
burning lamp and a long knife which
he had kept at hand for three years
the monster-maker



he dashed into the corridor the four
offieers had already started forward
but when they saw him emerge they
halted in silence in that moment of
stillness the surgeon paused to listen
he heard the hissing sound and the
clumsy floundering of a bulky living
object in the direction of his wifes
apartments it evidently was ad-
vancing toward him a turn in the
corridor shut out the view he
turned up the light which revealed a
ghastly pallor in his face

  wife he called

  there was no response he hur-
riedly advanced the four men follow-
ing quietly he turned the angle of
the corridor and ran so rapidly that
by the time the offieers had come in
sight of him again he was twenty steps
away he ran past a huge shapeless
object sprawling crawling and
floundering along and arrived at the
body of his wife

  he gave one horrified glance at her
face and staggered away then a
fury seized him clutching the knife
firmly and holding the lamp aloft he
sprang toward the ungainly object in
the corridor it was then that the
officers still advancing cautiously
saw a little more clearly though still
indistinctly the object of the sur-
geon s fury and the cause of the look
of unutterable anguish in his face
the hideous sight caused them to
pause they saw what appeared to be
a man yet evidently was not a man
huge awkward shapeless a squirm-
ing lurching stumbling mass com-
pletely naked it raised its broad

shoulders it had no head but instead
of it a small metallic ball surmounting
its massive neck

  devil exclaimed the surgeon
raising the knife

    hold there   commanded a stem
voice

  the surgeon quickly raised his eyes
and saw the four officers and for a
moment fear paralyzed his arm

  the police he gasped

  then with a look of redoubled fury
he sent the knife to the hilt into the
squirming mass before him the
wounded monster sprang to its feet
and wildly threw its arms about
meanwhile emitting fearful sounds
from a silver tube through which it
breathed the surgeon aimed another
blow but never gave it in his blind
fury he lost his caution and was
caught in an iron grasp the strug-
gling threw the lamp some feet to-
ward the officers and it fell to the
floor shattered to pieces simultane-
ously with the crash the oil took fire
and the corridor was filled with flame
the officers could not approach be-
fore them was the spreading blaze
and secure behind it were two forms
struggling in a fearful embrace
they heard cries and gasps and saw
the gleaming of a knife

  the wood in the house was old and
dry it took fire at once and the
flames spread with great rapidity
the four officers turned and fled
barely escaping with their lives in
an hour nothing remained of the
mysterious old house and its inmates
but a blackened ruin

lilith

strangely interwoven are
old myths regarding a fabu-
lous animal called the lamia
and an ancient demon-first feared
by the jews and later by other people
-whose name was lilith the beliefs
about lilith differ some of the old
rabbinical writers asserted that she
was adams first wife but that she
forsook him and became a demon
the word lilith in hebrew means
night monster and the habitat
of the fiend was supposed to be in
deserted places

 the prophet isaiah chapter
xxxiv verse  in predicting the
desolation of the land of edom said
lilith shall dwell there the king
james translators rendered lilith
as  screech-owl  whereby this
harmless little bird is to this day
feared by many including our
southern negroes as a harbinger of
ill omen but in the first latin trans-
lation of the christian scriptures
in the fourth century the word
lilith was rendered   lamia  

  now in greek legend lamia was a
libyan queen with whom the god
jupiter fell in love juno out of
jealousy robbed lamia of her chil-
dren whereupon she killed every
child she could lay hands on and
became a hideous child-devouring
monster as centuries passed it was
believed that she had a womans face
and a serpents tail and that she

was also a sort of prototype of the
modern vampire taking the form of
a beautiful woman and enticing
young men to her embraces to feed
on their life and hearts blood

  the ancient jews said that lilith
was especially dangerous to women
and young children she was eager
to seize new-born children and
mothers and children were therefore
provided with amulets against her
if a child smiled in its sleep during
the night of the sabbath or the new
moon it was a sign that lilith was
playing with it

  even as late as  the lamia was
thus described by an english zoolo-
gist the lamia is believed to be
the creature mentioned in the th
of isaiah called in hebrew lilith
it is thought to be the swiftest of all
four-footed creatures so that its
prey ean seldom or never escape it
it is said to be bred in libya and to
have a face and breasts like a very
beautiful woman and by its fraud
it destroys men for when it sees a
man it entices him to draw near and
when it has him within reach it
falls upon him and devours him it
has no voice but that of hissing like
a serpent its hinder parts are like
a goats its fore legs like a bears
its body is scaled all over it is said
they sometimes devour their own
young


ktti here are four authors whose works i always look for with eager
 avidity in weird tales writes n s van of jamestown new york

        they are h p lovecraft frank b long jr seabury quinn or
rather jules de grandin and edmond hamilton lovecraft is the dark god
of the tomb whohovers in the shadows of vaults and calls forth shapeless
things from cold stars long is the god of hysterical madness who whirls the
reader into black woods with ghastly white trees and calls forth unnamable
things from the depths of space who prod into the mad brain with icy fingers
hamilton is the thunder-god who rushes into the depths of the universe and
fights strange beings who twist giant suns out of their corners and send them
hurtling madly away

    writes h f scotten from indianapolis i have read all of the october
number except munns story the werewolfs daughter which i expect to be
good sort of saving the heart of the melon to the last as it were quinns
restless souls was the best of the de grandin stories to date i think the story
that entertained and impressed me most however-due no doubt to my love of
the unusual in plots regardless of flowery language or literary brilliance-was
the incubator man my congratulations to its author wallace west

    i chanced to lead your october issue of weird tales presented to me by
a friend to pass an afternoon away writes raymond v carroll of ellicott-
ville new york in a letter to the eyrie and i must confess that i thor-
oughly enjoyed the occasion the afternoon proved to be one of the shortest
and most entertaining i have experienced for some time despite the fact that
it was a rainy dismal day and my spirits were at low ebb i am looking
forward with interest to finishing the number the dream chair by leroy
ernest fess is certainly an original tale the like of which i havent read in
years the temple of serpents and the dancing death are certainly eery
tales that held and fascinated me and i trust that these authors will continue
to contribute to your most unusual magazine  

    chester a brown of weeksbury kentucky writes i like your maga-
zine it gives ones mental teeth something quite different to chew on weird

                                                                                 


weird tales

tales gives its readers palatable diets which i find to be well cooked by your
staff of ink-slinging chefs-meaning such excellent writers as seabury quinn
mary mcennery erhard a leslie victor rousseau and all the rest it
would be rather impossible for me to fill out the favorite coupon as i regard
them all as favorite stories no exceptions in the case all are what they
should be-and more

    from hot springs arkansas mrs charles brandenburg writes to the
eyrie i have been reading weird tales for three years and am wild
about it in every particular except one that is i wish you would not
publish such stories as crashing suns or in fact any scientific story they
are far too imaginative for me to enjoy i believe that you can always find
plenty of stories on earth of a weird nature my idea is that the scientific
nature of these stories takes away all the pleasure of reading them i like
african bush tales and tales of india china and ocean or ship tales i buy
one magazine a month and that is weird tales because it is entirely dif-
ferent and gives one something to think about i hope it continues to be as
interesting as it is now

    why didnt you have a cover picture for crashing suns asks jack
darrow of chicago you havent had a cover picture for any of edmond
hamiltons stories since the metal giants in the december issue of 
crashing suns was the best story in both of the two issues in which it ran
body and soul by seabury quinn and the oath of hul jolt by nictzin
dyalhis come next in the september issue

    i want to say a word for the poems of a leslie writes lilia price
savino of portsmouth virginia i think him a genius and i am always
glad to see his name in the table of contents that is the first page to which i
turn before i leave the book store and if i miss the names of seabury quinn
and eli colter i am disappointed

    writes mabel oneil of pawtucket rhode island i love a leslies
poems i have one in my scrapbook copied from weird tales quite a while
ago and cant remember the title to it the first stanza was as follows

                   ashes of sky-flame glowing

                      thunder of tide on the bars

                   night and a wild wind blowing
                      a curse to the screaming stars   

 the poem is elysium and appeared in weird tales for september -
editor

    norman e marland of bridgeport connecticut writes to the eyrie
i see you are publishing in book form a g birchs story the moon terror
which ran serially in weird tales in  it ought to be a great success
i am looking forward to the publication of seabury quinns stories of jules
de grandin in a book as that would seem to be a foregone conclusion but

sibly i wont imagine i feel eyes star-
ing at me if i leave this particular
room besides i dont like the mis-
shapen appearance of that dead
rat   

ihave reseated myself here at the
table in the grip of such fear as i
never thought a man could bear and
live i shall pay heavily for this ex-
perience i shall go away in the
morning-if i live till morning-with
soars on my soul from this night

  there is some power something in
the house with me here beside me
the reason i say that i cant leave
the room

  i tried to go upstairs-and was
stopped as though i had run into a
wall i fought and pushed against
the thing that held me it was use-
less a hand pressed against me-an
unbelievable hand that seemed to
cover my body from neck to waist and
shoulder to shoulder it was play-
ful that hand it gave me a little
shake that sent me smashing against
the opposite wall

  im afraid i lost control of myself
for a few minutes i remember i
tried to run at every door i was
thrown back once i fell over the
table in the darkness always that
hand stopped me at every door the
last time it crawled up my body and
stopped at my throat a thumb and
forefinger curled around my neck

  the room was in darkness when i
came to after a long time i found
the candle it was mashed flat i
managed to mold the warm wax into
usable shape and lit the wick again
then i picked up my pencil auto-
matically thank god for it if i
didnt have some slight thing to do
im afraid my reason would crack

weird tales

the human mind wont stand too
much why did i ever come here

  i must be calm i must plan how to
escape from this awful place but
how can i get away with the doors
barred to me by that hand 

  and what is this power i sneered
at how did i dare to come here
why does it keep me prisoner in this
room what does it want with me
why did it wall me up in this house
as cut off from the world as though
i were already in my grave what
is it going to do to me 

  i begin to understand a game
a terrible game torture

 a moment ago a hand clamped
around my waist think of a hand
big enough to encircle a mans waist
it tightened tightened every-
thing turned black

  before i was completely uncon-
scious the pressure relaxed my
bruised solar plexus nerves revolted
i rocked with illness that snarling
laughter echoes again if i could
only get out of here i must get out
but the shutters hardly tremble as
i pound at them the hand still
holds me from the doors i am let
alone for an instant   

  a stab of pain my left wrist has
been twisted

  huge fingers lift me bodily from
the stool and smash me down again
another touch my wrist

  what hatred has this thing con-
ceived for me i am pinched
wrenched twisted i ean see nothing
i feel a white light of pain a bruise
appears on my arm where the sleeve
has been tom off i see nothing
nothing

  god i hate this monster yes i
hate you torture me all the more
for saying it i hate you i will hurt
you as you are hurting me see-i
smash you with this stool

  the stool passes through empty
air

  i pound the table with my fist the
hand just clutched at my left shoul-

der my whole side is limp and

numb

  i will kill this thing i will i
will i will avenge myself smash
it twist it in my hands i will kill
it what can i do to kill it how
can i hurt it

  an idea comes to me it is a great
idea a glorious idea i shout with
the power of it i sing with the tri-
umph of it  i will revenge myself

  now i grow calm easy now cool
and shrewd i mustnt let the thing
suspect i stop the laugh that comes
to my lips i will kill it how easy
it will be-the simplest thing

  i will kill it with fire no life can
stand fire can breathe flame not
even supernatural life in fire the
thing would twist and die like any
human but i must be ealm i must
think i must plan how to trap the
monster that tears at me

  if i can only set fire to the house
it can not get out the windows are
wedged solid i must fire the house
i can do it with this candle that glit-
ters before me

  i must let the fire get a big start
otherwise the thing would smash it
down with its hands if only it will
go away for a few minutes just a
few minutes a few minutes to set
fire to the house

 how can i make it go away i
must do something to make it go
away ah i must pretend to faint
i will slump forward over the table
and then i will stay still as still as
the dead rat on the floor no mat-
ter how the hands twist at me i will
stay still the thing may go upstairs
or into another room only an instant
all i need to fire the house   

he did he did the monster is
stupid now he has gone up-
stairs he gouged at me with his
hands but i was still as still as the
dead rat ha ha ha ha ha ha
he thought i was dead he thought
i was dead like the rat the rat and
i the rat and i ha ha ha

stone by single stone to this country
from cyprus

  yes i nodded

  very good the stones of which
it is erected were probably quarried
from the ruins of some heathen tem-
ple and like sponges soaked in water
they were full to overflowing with evil
influences this evil undoubtlessly af-
fected the old warrior knights who
dwelt in that house probably from
 when richard of england sold
cyprus to their order to  when
the french king and the roman pope
suppressed and destroyed the order-
and shared its riches between them

    that the souls of those old monks
who had forsaken their vows to the
god of love to serve the goddess of
lust with unclean rites and cer-
emonies could not find rest in peaceful
graves there is little doubt but that
they were able to materialize and
carry on the obscenities they had
practised in life there is also much
doubt some ghosts there are who can
make themselves visible at will others
can njaterialize at certain times and
in certain places only others can show
themselves only with the aid of a
medium

  when the rich monsieur profiteer
took up the old house and brought it
to america he doubtless imported all
its evil influences intact but they
were latent

  then only one little week ago
that which was needful came to the
house it was nothing less than made-

good mademoiselle dunroe was the
radio set-the condenser and the am-
plifying agent needed to release the
invisible wickedness which came from
cythereas wicked altar-the discar-
nate intelligences which were once bad
men do you not recall how she was
greeted in the chapel of the black
lodge hail priestess and queen-
she who gives her servants life and
being those wicked things which
once were men admitted their debt to
her in that salutation my friend

 remember how mademoiselle
dunroe told you of her inability to
draw hat she wished the evil in-
fluences were already beginning to
steal her brain and make her pliable
to their base desires they were be-
ginning to iaj plans to feed upon her
vitality to clothe themselves in the
semblance ox humanity and as they
possessed her she saw with her inward
eye the scenes so many times hereto-
fore enacted in that terrible under-
grounu chapel

  from the first i liked not the
house and when the poor mademoiselle
dunroe told us of her troubles with
her drawings i liked it still less how
long it would have taken those old
secret worshipers of evil to make
themselves visible by the use of made-
moiselle dunroes vitality i do not
know perhaps they might never
have succeeded perhaps she would
have gone away and nothing more
avould have been heard of them but
that flap-eared she-ass of a mademoi-
selle prettybridge played the precise
game the long-dead villains desired
when she held her so absurd seance

her go into a trance like a medium
and she shall materialize us and la
la what deviltry we shall do and
so they did while they sent one of
their number to thump upon the table
and hold us spellbound listening to
his nonsense rimes the rest of them
became material and rode forth upon
their phantom steeds to steal them a
little child oh my friend i dare
not think what would have been had
they carried through that dreadful
blood-saerifice warm blood acts upon
the wicked spirits as tonic acts on
humans they might have become so
strong no power on earth could have
stayed them as it was the ancient
evil could be killed but it died very
very hard

  was dunroe under their influence

night i asked

  undoubtlessly already they had
made her draw things she did not
consciously understand then when
they had roused her from her bed and
guided her to the instrument she
played first a composition of beauty
for she is a good girl at heart but
they wished her to play something

  hm i murmured dubiously
granting your premises i can see
the logic of your conclusions but how
was it you put those terrible ghosts
to flight so easily   

   i waited for that question he
 answered with a laugh have you
 not yet learned jules de grandin is a
 very elever fellow friend trow-
 bridge parbleu i have known it for
 years

   attend me for what i say is worth
 hearing when those evil men went
 forth in search of prey and killed the
 poor policeman i said to me jules
 de grandin you have here a tough
 nut to crack mordieu a very tough
 nut indeed

    t know it  i reply

    very well then i ask me who
 are these goblin child-stealers

    ghosts-or the evil representa-
 tions of wicked men who died long
 years ago in mortal sin  i return

    now i say you are sure these
 men are materialized by mademoiselle
 shane-her strange playing her
 unwitting drawings her trance at the
 so odious mademoiselle prettybridges
 table-tapping party they all prove it
 what then is such a materialization
 composed of  

    of what some call ectoplasm
 others psychoplasm  i reply

    but certainly-i will not give
 myself peace till i have talked this
 matter over completely-but what is
 that psychoplasm or ectoplasm  tell
 me that  

   and then as i think and think
 some more i come to the conclusion
 it is but a very fine form of vibra-
 tion given off by the medium just as
 the ether-waves are given off by the
 broadcasting station when it com-
 bines with the thin-unpowerful vibra-
 tion set up by the evil entity to be
 materialized it makes the outward
 seeming of a man-what we call a
 ghost

   i decided to try a desperate ex-
 periment a sprig of the holy thorn

of glastonbury may be efficacious as
a charm but charms are of no avail
against an evil which is very old and
very powerful nevertheless i will
try the holy thorn-bush if it fail
i must have a second line of defense
what shall it be

  why not radium salt radium
does wonderful things in its pres-
ence non-conductors of electricity be-
come conductors leyden jars can not
retain their charges of electricity in
its presence for why because of
its tremendous vibration if i un-
cover a bit of radium bromide from
its lead box in that small enclosed
chapel the terrific bombardment of
the alpha tau and gamma rays it
gives off as its atoms disintegrate will
shiver those thin-vibration ghosts to
nothingness even as the boche shells
crushed the forts of liege

  i think i have an idea-but i am
not sure it will work at any rate
it is worth trying so while ma-
demoiselle oshane lies unconscious
under the influence of evil i rush here
with you borrow a tiny little tube of
radium bromide from the city hos-
pital and make ready to fight the
evil ones then when we follow
mademoiselle dunroe into that ac-
cursed chapel under the earth i am
ready to make the experiment

  at the first door stands the boy
who was not so steeped in evil as his
elders and he succumbed to the holy
thorn sprig but once inside the
chapel i see we need something which
will batter those evil spirits to shreds
so i unseal my tube of radium and-
pouf i shake them to nothing in no
time  

  but wont they ever haunt the
cloisters again i persisted

  ah bah have i not said i have
destroyed them-utterly he de-
manded let us speak of them no
more the mention of them gives me
a bad taste in the mouth i must
wash it away

he emptied his goblet of brandy

dorit spoil the party 

 someone called when i sat down at the piano

 i was just about to enter the room
 when i overheard bill saying itll
 seem like old times to have dan with
 us again 

   youd better lock the piano came
 the laughing rejoinder

   nonsense  he wont have the nerve
 to play after what happened the last
 time

   that was a shabby trick i almost
 wish we hadnt pulled it  

    how well i knew what they were talking
 about

    at the last party i had attended i had sat
  down at the piano and in my usual chop-
  stick fashion started playing some popular
  numbers

    before long however i had noticed an
 unusual stillness i stopped playing turned
 around arid saw-the room was empty

    instead of entertaining the party as i had
  fondly imagined my halting stumbling per-
  formance had been a nuisance

   burning with shame and indignation i
 had determined to turn the tables at last
 tonight the moment had come

   every one seemed overjoyed to see me
 again-obviously glad that i had evidently
 forgiven and forgotten last years trick

    suddenly i turned to bill and said hope
  youve had the piano tuned old boy i feel
  just in the mood 

    instantly the friendly atmosphere changed
  it was amusing to see the look- that spread
  from face to face for a moment no one
  spoke then just as i was siting down at
  the piano some one called

    for heavens sake get away from that piano
  dont spoil the party

    that was my cue instead
  of replying i struck the first
  bars of sundown and
  how easily smoothly kith
  all the verve and expression
  i had always longed for

 what you did for me last
 year 

   the eager laughing
 faces turned red with
 embarrassment one or
 two of the boys murmured
 an apology seeing their
 confusion i continued 

   i mean it if you
 hadnt opened my eyes

 id still be a dub at play-
 ing i went home mighty
 angry that night ill
 admit but it taught me
 a lesson and believe me
 folks when i think of the real pleasure i
 get out of playing now im only sorry you
 didnt pull that trick sooner

    before letting me go home that night bill
 demanded how did you do it

   i laughed why i just took advantage
 of a new way to learn music thats all
 what didnt you take lessons from a
 teacher

   no i taught myself when that trick
 showed me up last year i sent to the u s
 school of music for one of their free demon
 stration lessons well it proved to be so
 much easier than i had hopd for that i sent
 for the complete course and believe me
 im mighty glad i did there wasnt any
 expensive private teacher to pay-and since
 the lessons came by mail i didnt have to
 set aside valuable hours to study i prac-
 ticed only in my spare time a few minutes
 a day andthe course is thorough why
 almost before i knew it i could play any-
 thing-ballads rhapsodies waltzes jazz

i fool my friends

    the guests gasped with
 amazement fascinated
 scarcely believing their ears
 they drew nearer when
 i finished they loudly
 clamored for more time
 and again when i would
 have stopped they eagerly
 insisted on just one
 more please

  when they finally allowed
  me to leave the piano i
  turned around and said
  just a moment folks
  i want to thank you for
