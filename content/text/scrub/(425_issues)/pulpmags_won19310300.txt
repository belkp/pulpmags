hugo cernsback em the green torture by a r hilliard the retu from jupiter by caswell edwards the terror of aryl by r f starzl the synthetic monsiefi ancis the gambler he gambles that a lucky break will come to him in the course of time

m

ost men live in the hope that their lucky break will
come tomorrow or next week or next year

they gamble that fate some day some way will make
them rich they risk their whole lives on what may come to
them in the course of time

this is a worse form of gambling than gambling for
money with a card sharp or a three shell game expert

gambling on what time and fate have in store for you
is more costly than any other form of gambling known

you lose more than money you lose your self-
respect you lose the self-respect of those about you

and as each year passes your chance to amount to any-
thing becomes slimmer and slimmer

you get discouraged you begin to feel that fate is against
you you complain secretly about your ill luck perhaps you hide
your shortcomings behind a whole flock of easy excuses

but the hard cold world doesnt care about you

youyfl got to look out for yourself

time alone cannot help you if it could every man over
 would be rich

you cannot count on luck or fate or circumstances if you
could everybody would get rich at some time or other

your life is too precious to waste away waiting for some-
thing to turn up

theres one sure way-yes only one sure way-to
t what you want out of life

nothing can help you but your own brain make your brain
just a little bit more effective and you will multiply your
earning power

there is no limit to what the human brain can accomplish
scientists and psychologists tell us we use only about ten per
cent of our brain power ninety per cent is unused it lies
dormant the longer it is unused the harder it becomes for us
to use it for the mind is like a muscle it grows in power
through exercise and use it weakens and deteriorates with
idleness

what can you do about it that is the question you are
asking yourself here is a suggestion

wonders of the future

by hugo gernsback

gpgeagst seems almost impossible to

iiceej skeffl reaiz that t application of
ipifl electricity has been practicable

or  y a tle over a hundred

years  s true that frce
jssagaal known as electricity has been in
existence in some form as long as the earth
itself and even long before that-in fact for
billions upon billions of years but the fact
remains nevertheless that electricity a we
know it today in the role of a servant to
mankind dates back a little over a hundred
years while the ancients knew something
about static electricity such as that pro-
duced by rubbing amber with a piece of
cloth and while they also knew something
about magnetism as manifested by the lode-
stone yet the two forces were not thought of
-as co-related at all and none of the ancients
in their wildest dreams could have imagined
the wonders of modern or galvanic elect-
ricity which now practically rules our very
lives

yet the forces themselves-that is elect-
ricity and its sister magnetism-were always
everywhere about us the earth had its
electromagnetic field the sun was shooting
huge quantities of electromagnetic energy
down on us and there were very many evi-
dences of this power all around us such as
lightning the aurora borealis and other
manifestations-but no one recognized and
identified them

there is of course no good reason to be-
lieve that there are no remaining unrecog-
nized forces there may be a score of other
kinds of energy which our present instru-
ments have no means of detecting pervading
all nature

gravitation for instance is one of these
forces that is everywhere present what has



been suspected by far-visioned scientists is
now about to become true in a practical way
because of what einstein has already tried
to demonstrate with his new field theory-
that gravitation and electromagnetism are
fundamentally one and the same thing of
course today we know only the external phen-
omena of gravitation and we are just as
powerless to overcome it as the ancients were
to harness lightning if the two forces-
electromagnetism and gravitation-are fin-
ally merged into one it may then be possi-
ble to construct a gravitation generator just
as we are building electric generators and
dynamos today it may then be possible to
make gravitation useful to humanity and
even conduct it through long wires or direct
it through space just as we do with the
electrical current today

of course the possibilities of discovery do
not by any means stop here there are pro-
bably a great many other unknown forces
which may some day be made useful to
humanity if we come to recognize them
we know that with our restricted senses
we are in no position today to perceive even
a fraction of what goes on around us very
recently indeed have we found a new form
of energy which may prove to be a tre-
mendously useful one i refer of course
to the cosmic rays which are evidently an
indication of some strange phenomena of
nature that in time to come we may know
better presumably the cosmic ray itself
belongs to the electromagnetic spectrum and
if so in time it may be made of service to
humanity

but as yet we are as far away from the
solution of these problems as the ancients
were from the modern utilization of elect-
ricity
a sequel to the rescue from jupiter showing
the destruction of one world and the
reclaiming of another

far out in the black and icy void that
separates jupiter called pleida from
his nine satellites a spark of light was
traveling through the darkness-a tiny mite
of illumination trailing behind it a fiery
train like some furious diminutive comet off
its course

through airless space it was hurrying
making its way toward neina the largest
of his habitable moons it was a space-
car long swift gleaming in the pale light
of the distant sun like a cartridge of stain-
less steel on either side was a row of

round portholes through which the occu-
pants could look out into space

at the nose a huge lens gleamed dully a
lens that appeared capable of sending a
beam of light to illuminate the way ahead
but no light was coming from it now ex-
cept the reflected light of the sun the
glow that revealed this swiftly passing car-
riage of space in the darkness through which
it passed came from the rocket tubes that
propelled it along its sides they ran in
bundles of five and seven from a point near
the nose to the tail they poured out their

winging their way into the air as well as from the ground
the embattled citizens of neina started their attack

energy behind the car in flaming streams
too brilliant to look upon with unshielded
eyes

near the nose was the cabin that housed
the controls three men handled the de-
tails of the crafts motion charting a course
through the six directions of space as it
threaded its complex path from planet to
satellite they were constantly busy with
the task applying more power in one quar-
ter checking it off in another swinging the
machine to correct every deviation

there was good reason for their preoccu-
pation for the tensest moments of the jour

ney were at hand the time had come when
the influences of the central planet and its
satellite tended to counterbalance each other
leaving the rocket in its fall to the mercy
of the suns mightier attraction nothing
could save her from being piilled completely
from her path at this point and plunging
out of control through five hundred million
miles of space into the flaming heart of the
sun except the skill of the pilots and their
supply of power

despite this critical time the young man
at the rockets bridge-the fourth person in
the control  cabin-paid little attention to


wonder stories

the maneuvering of the craft he paced
back and forth troubled impatient

are we making all she will stand he
inquired for the twentieth time

a lieutenant looking up from his dials
for an instnt nodded affirmatively we
cannot alter her course or speed now he
said we are at the critical point we
must slack her away to make a landing to
proceed otherwise
would mean a crash

he spoke respectful-
ly for the man at the
bridge was alius
marce the courageous
impetuous not always
wise son of the house
of alius erstwhile
commander of the arm-
ies of independence of
the four habitable sat-
ellites the lieutenant
knew well the cause of
his commanders per-
turbation through-
out the journey he had
put every ounce of
power possible behind
the rocket had sped
through enormous dis-
tances at rates possible
only to the swiftest
craft of the neinians
the long new military
ships designed under
the direction of the two
visitors from the old
planet tellus the
earth

nevertheless the
pace had not been fast
enough for alius
marce each passing
moment saw his hope	

for neinian independ-
ence fading he beheld

in his minds eye how the hordes of squat
folk from jupiter which they called pleida
would soon again rule the graceful peoples
of neina and the satellites there was only
a chance-a desperate chance-but could he
make it  a  

this masterly sequel to
the rescue from jupi-
ter deals with great stir-
ring events of three worlds
the rescue left many im-
portant questions to be an-
swered would the earth
remain a barren and lifeless
world with its two lone sur-
vivors as guests of the peo-
ple of neina satellite of
jupiter what would be
the relations between the
neinians and the jovians-
and finally what would our
neinians do if they discov-
ered that their world would
soon be uninhabitable

here is a story just filled
with thrilling events and
stirring deeds w e see
great heroism on one side
cowardice and despair on
another we see a world
enslaved and another made
free as usual mr ed-
wards tells his story with
restraint yet in a powerful
and dramatic way h e
whirls us through space
hundreds of millions of
miles whirls us back shows
us through his words the
upheavals that are let loose
when vicious and depraved
men set out on conquests of
greed and hatred

alius marce trembled inwardly when he
thought of that one expedient by which the
satellites might gain freedom forever from
the tyrant a grisly expedient a ghastly
plan-if only-

did you see the long lines of neinians
enslaved he demanded of his aides feed-
ing his wrath against the pleidans by re-
calling their outrages the lieutenant look-
ed up grimly nodded

thousands of
them marce went on
they flaunted them at
us i can see them
now-neinian women
children men who had
been tortured until
they no longer bore
resemblance to any-
thing but pleidan
beasts forced to work
in the uranium mines
the platinum mines
maimed starved dis-
eased  

the lieutenant has-
tened to calm him
but what could you
do our allies-
our allies alius
marce gestured with
anger and exasperr-
tion they bartered
their birthright - for
what for the free-
dom of their few en-
slaved in order that
they might all be made
victims of pleida the
allies now we know
how little they can
mean to us-how little
they have ever meant
to us neina stands
alone

they could see the growing image of the
satellite beneath them dead ahead it had
been large as an apple then like a dinner-
plate now it had begun to take onchar-
acter to become a spinning earth before
their eyes a globe upon which people lived
the return from jupiter



worked sought freedom and happiness

alius marces eyes were filled for a mo-
ment with moisture as he beheld and recog-
nized it neina which the pleidans con-
temptuously called noninus-this satellite
that was itself larger than the planet mer-
cury and nearly as large as the planet
mars warmed as was pleida by internal
fires green on the surfaces of its contin-
ents its oceans filled with heaving water
its people tall stately white and winged

in the heavens he could make out now
another of the satellites quena which was
as large as the tellurian moon and also in-
habited somewhere in this vicinity in
space was also the warlike satellite hel-
va-little helva whose
brave struggle against the
despots of pleida had all
but depopulated her
whose people were now
weary of war and eager
for peaceful counsel
however false alas for
helva quena luana-
they were now in the
hands of the enemy the
court of dolmician
would have its way with
them but neina still
held out

they could discern the
continents of their be-
loved world the mountain
chains the oceans and
large lakes the swift
rocket-car was already slipping into the first
of its braking ellipses the concentric rings
of flight that would bring her closer and
closer to the surface until it was safe to
land

alius marce was swept by alternate
waves of eagerness and dread his people
how would they take this news his fath-
er he would be seriously affected by the
blow that had been dealt them in the con-
ference on pleida he strode back and
forth back and forth in the cabin neina
seemed so close that they might almost
reach out and touch her yet she was far
away from them still as measured in the time
that must yet elapse before they had slowed

sufficiently to land

alius marce was too expert himself in the
guidance of rocket-craft to interfere with the
course selected by his engineers a tiny
slip now might be fatal to all of them and
to neinas hope for ultimate independence
as well it was alius marce alone who had
the desperate plan that might succeed

the neinians must not lose courage they
must not give up

perhaps we can reach them from here on
the radio beam he said we must make
a good contact before we say anything we
must make sure that our beam is not dif-
fused no one must hear what we have to
say now except my father and the heads of
the families of neina

an aide pressed a sig-
nal button above his head
alius marce strode aft
toward the radio cabin
where two men worked
with their apparatus for
several minutes nothing
happened then one of the
operators looked up smil-
ing we have the pal-
ace at ancienda he an-
nounced

who is there

in response to the com-
manders question a
screen lighted up alius
marce beheld three per-
sons in a room the obser-
vation gallery atop the
palace tower they were his father head
of the house of alius and the two tellur-
ians nina and her father the only surviv-
ing natives of earth

the young mans eyes passed from one to
the other of them as the operators worked to
bring the image into better focus to narrow
their communication beam excluding all in-
terference he saw that much of what he
was hastening to tell them they already
knew either by guessing it from the speed
of his flight or by other observations
through the curved roof of the gallery a
huge telescope projected into the heavens
and upon a screen in the room alius marce
beheld a picture of that portion of the sky

gawain edwards


wonder stories

toward which the neinian telescope pointed

with increasing foreboding he perceived
that they had been watching his fast flight
through space from pleida they had also
seen something that had escaped him at
the surface of distant pleida a great space-
fleet was already gathering-an army of
invasion such as had never before in the
history of the planet been concentrated for
the subjugation and punishment of a single
satellite

the impressiveness of the preparations
were apparent even at that great distance
revealed through the huge telescope al-
ius marce saw on the screen of the observa-
tion gallery as reflected to him by televi-
sion from neina that the armies of the in-
vaders were already marching stormily on
the surface of the planet converging upon
mobilization centers like long trains of in-
distinguishable insects returning to their
burrows part of the prodigious transport
fleet the pleidan army was already assem-
bled at these mobilization centers ready to
receive the recruits and bear them to neina
when the signal came

i have a plan

the telescope had also mirrored some-
thing else hundreds of fighting ships
of new design shimmering wasps of the air
and space on maneuvering flights above the
planets surface testing their equipment
when alius marcus saw them he gasped
the pleidans had new ships like those of
neina someone among the allies had al-
ready given away the secret of the tellur-
ian power in the airless miles above the
planets shell they were practicing like
droves of broadwinged birds their swift
paths marked by tiny rivulets of fire

the young commander shuddered invol-
untarily remembering sights that had met
his eyes on pleida only a few hours before
behind all this movement and display he
saw the sullen sinister purpose of the em-
peror of the planet dolmician the squat
tyrant to whom mercy was unknown whose
only interest in the satellites was to conquer
and enslave them

alius marce saw that he was not alone in

his foreboding as the images of the three
persons in the observation gallery brighten-
ed became refined and clear he saw that
the countenance of his father was heavy
troubled showing lines of strain and sleep-
lessness the old man from tellus was
preoccupied no doubt with some invention
or investigation upon which he was work-
ing the tellurian was the greatest of
scientists begrudging every moment spent
away from his laboratory yet nobody in all
neina knew on what he was working

but alius marces eyes lighted when he
at length beheld nina most beautiful of the
last generation of earth nina for whose
rescue he had risked his life and the safety
of his satellite he saw her smiling at him
her lips moved in thankfulness at his near-
ness and his escape from the dangers of the
pleidan conference he could see her speak
though there was as yet no sound accom-
panying the movement of her lips

is the beam ready he asked impa-
tiently	

the chief operator threw a switch a
bank of yellow tubes suddenly glowed it
is ready now he said

in a second alius marce heard distant
r voices gradually they grew more distinct
they had established communication at last
with the satellite he must now speak
quickly telling them what to do

his father seemed to step forward in the
distant room toward him

my boy he said what is it we have
waited for you

alius marces eyes grew misty for a mo-
ment at the pathos and resignation in the
old mans voice but he could not hesitate
to tell the truth when neinas fate hung
by a thread

father he said quickly neina has
been betrayed our allies have deserted us
our hard-fought victories have turned to de-
feat and neina must stand alone for free-
dom or give up to a slavery more fright-
ful than any ever visited upon the satel-
lite

he saw the old man quail as if he had
been dealt a body blow betrayed he
repeated the word hollowly for what
for the release of their prisoners in the
the return from jupiter



pleidan mines dolmician met us osten-
sibly to talk ol peace craftily he seated
us so that we might see the prisoners as
they herded them from the grisly metal
works before us they saw us fell down
in the dust to plead with us crying out for
liberty rest or death torn as they were
by war the leaders of the allies were unable
to stand the sight

they fell to bargaining and dolmician
made them great promises-double-mean-
ing promises if they would sign pacts with
him for continued federation in vain i
pleaded with them my father they
would not-could not see that freedom for
themselves and us was worth more than the
lives of a few miserable slaves we had
beaten dolmician yet with his crafty play-
ing upon our emotions he tricked them in-
to throwing it all away-

but you asked his father hoarsely
you held out

i did he flaunted the neinian cap-
tives at me he caused swordsmen to come
before us and cut them down and to inflict
unspeakable tortures upon them before my
eyes still i would not yield though the
cries of the wretches will ring in my ears
until my dying days

 dolmician l said i come to make an
end to war but you compound the injury
-shall withdraw and if my allies do not
join then neina alone will resist you

he laughed like a demon your allies
will not come he declared their blood
is turned to milk by the leprous scabs upon
the backs of their countrymen and you
too had better sign my pacts with me or all
of your race shall perish in the mines
and if i sign i asked he smiled
craftily why then of course ill release
these fools but you will pay tribute as will
the other satellites in platinum and uranium
from your own mines produce it by free
labor or slavery as you will i will wring
enough of it from all of you to support our
population without labor for the rest of the
planets days

it was then my father that i rose and
brought the business to an end you are
a fat pig i shouted at him within hearing
of all the princes of his realm and as quick-

ly as possible i boarded the space-car and
took off for neina while behind me even
before we had started the rockets we heard
rumble of preparations for invasion and
war

the head of the house of alius was sud-
denly regal erect he was a flaming taper
of wrath against the brutal pleidans an old
wax candle but nevertheless a strong one
alight with anger desperation and love for
his people alius marce from his ship in
space saw it and rejoiced

call together at once the heads of all tha
houses of neina he said by the time
they have arrived i shall have alighted we
will tell them the truth they must under-
stand that this is to be the bitterest war
neina has ever seen i have a plan- his
eye fell momentarily upon the old man from
tellus who was still wrapped up in his own
secret thoughts-that may save us-a des-
perate plan but one that will work

in the meantime replied the head of the
house of alius we shall begin a new mob-
ilization when the ships of dolmician
reach neina they will learn that there is
vigor in this dying satellite still

dying satellite

the old mans eyes fell momentarily
a slip of the tongue marce-but never-
theless- well it is of no consequence
now

freezing satellite murmured the old
man from tellus speaking his first words in
many minutes nina heard him alius
marce saw her clutch his arm

what are you talking about he de-
manded

it is nothing alius marce

nothing is important now marce de-
clared nina tenderly her warm eyes upon
him through the cold miles of space that
separated them except that you come
quickly and safely to lead your people

something was wrong with the com-
munication apparatus the images
blurred a tube snapped the screen went
black the voices died to a murmur went
out alius marce found himself staring
at the empty square through which he had
just been transported so it had seemed to


wonder stories

the observation gallery of the palace at
ancienda he turned angrily to the opera-
tors but they were already at work trying
to find the difficulty

some new interference said one
someone tapped in blew out our circuit

i never knew it to behave like this before
alius marce went out of the room fur-
iously filled with strange fears and impul-
ses something is wrong on neina he
declared can we go down no quicker
the lieutenant shook his head not un-
less you wish to take a long chance he
said we might be lucky-

marce saw what he meant he glanced
out of the window trying to estimate their
speed the distance to the satellite all the
variables that might affect their course

if there is a chance-let us descend
he ordered impetuously plunge the ship
obliquely into the sea she is a staunch
craft we can ride it out

the man at the forward wheel saluted
without comment the blasts of the rocket
tubes at the rear diminished heightened
diminished the rocket-ship yawed over
the world beneath them seemed to reel and
twist it came dashing upward at a fur-
ious rate

slacken away there put on the rock-
ets at the nose

the grim sweating aides threw a long
lever forward preserving their balance per-
ilously as they did so there was a burst of
heat streams of fire flew upward past
them from the nose as they plunged down-
ward through the clouds of flame shot for-
ward by the concealed tubes the ship was
enveloped in a fury of fire as the speed de-
creased blood pounded in their temples
arid now-the sea

a warning bell sounded clamorously
the mechanics came swarming forward from
the fuel reservoirs and the pumps seeking
their hammocks against the shock they knew
was in store for them the officers lashed
themselves to spring-mounted stanchions at
their posts

alius marce glanced once more at his
satellite his world the water was beneath
them rising at a terrific rate how fast this

face came up toward them-this oceans
blue-green friendly face

he fastened himself into his own ham-
mock

seconds passed that seemed like hours
to their ears now came a faint shrill whis-
tle the rushing sound of the atmosphere as
it passed over the rocket-cars gleaming
sides despite the cooling pipes imbedded
in every wall the heat grew intense

then they felt the crash where there
had been fire there was now a tremendous
cloud of white steam their course had
brought the rocket down so that it barely
skimmed the surface over the top of the
water they skipped like a boys skimmer
the shining craft sending up spurts of hot
vapor from its glistening sides at that
speed each wave was like a solid wall

chapter ii
the tellurians secret

a portion of the palace of alius at
ancienda had been set aside for the
exclusive use of the visitors from tellus
in this part amid the graceful ornamenta-
tion with which the neinians loved to sur-
round themselves the old man and nina
waited while alius marce rescued from the
ocean by swift ships sought private audience
with his father

the tellurian patriarch with the quiet
humility that had attracted the neinian
populace to him from the first had with-
drawn voluntarily from the observation gal-
lery knowing that alius marce would wish
to confer with the head of the house of al-
ius before going before the council of elders
on the matters that confronted the satellite

nina he said when they had reached
their own chambers we are homeless wan-
derers in the universe and whether you
would have it so or not our welcome here
depends primarily upon what we have to
give in return

she looked at him quizzically the peo-
ple of neina have treated us royally she
observed

the old man was silent for a moment re-
flecting that is true he conceded
the return from jupiter



they made life possible for us when w
were about to gasp our last breath and we
cannot complain on any score concerning
their attitude toward us on this satellite-
and yet-

he seemed to wander in his thoughts
nina used to him was nevertheless per-
turbed by his increasing preoccupation she
knew that he had passed his time since their
arrival on neina in almost ceaseless re-
search either in his laboratory or in the
mountain fissures that split the satellite
deeply in the regions once worried by earth-
quakes but now quiet part of what he had
learned in these studies had been disclosed
to her filling her with uneasiness but most
of it was still a secret known only to the
old man himself as to what he had been
at work upon in his laboratory she had no
idea that part of their quarters he had
reserved strictly to himself

but now following a brief interval of
quiet he rose and took her by the hand i
do not know why he began but i feel
that our peaceful existence of the last few
months here is at an end whether this
end is a matter that concerns us two alone
or whether it portends terrible things for
the satellite as well i cannot tell

but nina i have this to say alius marce
is an upright young man into his hands
i can commend you with faith in your fu-
ture happiness as for myself-i am an
old man who has seen much-too much-
she perceived that his eyes were burn-
ing brightly feverishly you must not ex-
cite yourself so she said you are upset
as we all are by the knowledge that this war
the neinians fought so assiduously and
which they thought won is not finished
the old man replied gravely that is
partly true and yet it was not such a sur-
prise to me i have studied the full history
of a planet-he paused almost impercep-
tibly-that was a battlefield throughout
its time i have learned that war is never
finished i have also learned that no ques-
tion no matter how important or how tri-
vial was ever settled by war

yet you would not deny the neinians the
right to fight when their independence is
threatened

the tellurian grew thoughtful i knew
a nation that fought bitterly for freedom
and won it-only to enslave itself-

nina shrugged her shoulders impatiently
thinking of alius marce and his words to
her of the hours they had spent together
of the bright future that both had hoped for
when this frightful struggle with pleida
should end

nevertheless she said if the war is
not over we will continue to fight and the
neinians will win their victory through the
war machines you have taught them to build
from your earth science neina must be
free and alius marce before all others
will lead his people to liberty

her father paused in his thinking to look
at her you are a neinian already he
exclaimed

she threw back her head proudly yes
she said i am the betrothed of alius
marce and shall be queen of neina

my child-alas for the queen of neina
-when neina is no more

father-what do you mean

silently as if he had not heard her the
old man moved about the room the doors
were closed againstthe world nevertheless
they could hear through the hangings of the
apartment the rushing sounds of many ex-
cited feet in the halls the faint far-away
shouts of people in the streets and in the
great plaza the tumultous arrival of the
heads of the great houses of neina the
patriarch paused to listen to these manifes-
tations of the national crisis dismissed them
from his mind resumed his aimless putter
ing

at length he turned and came back to
nina who had been standing through-
out his talk and subsequent pantomime like
one who is struggling on the verge of some
half-remembered thought

i do not know how much longer we will
be left alone he said gently i wish to
show you something before we are inter-
rupted nina

he took her by the hand and together
they walked to the huge doors that guarded
his private laboratory he pressed the lock
the portal was opened by an invisible silent


wonder stories

mechanism that responded to his will
they walked through into the domed rooms
beyond nina was struck with the strange-
ness of what she saw

about the walls were work benches at
the rear a furnace glowed dully ready to
be stoked into raging heat at the turn of a
key the place was filled with glass tubes
bulbs misshapen metal discarded articles
that littered the floor

but dominating all was a huge machine
that occupied the middle of the laboratory
mounted upon a platform that accentuated
its bigness made it seem something like a
sleeping monster

at first nina thought it some new weird
instrument of war that her father had de-
vised for the use of the neinans atop it
partly protected by a bright metal shield
was the hugest of the tubes of the laboratory
its reflecting mirror trained downward
against some coiled stuff beneath huge
metal bottles fed the device with gas the
tube above glowed a little quiescent like
the eyes of a monster that has no anger in
its heart nevertheless filled with baleful
warning

the old man laughed as nina shrank
away

for all its sinister appearance he said
it is no destructive machine no i have
designed machines of war enough this is a
servant and slave of peace

but what is it what can it do

the old man chose to be mysterious he
smiled quietly this is my machine for
undoing a great folly he replied this
is my machine for repopulating the earth

what the girls eyes opened wide
as she caught his meaning do you
mean- is it possible

her father nodded solemnly

but how what can this machine-

he raised his hand for silence at their
door a new commotion had arisen a more
pointed one directed at them someone was
pounding upon it calling out loudly

hastily the old man bundled his daugh-
ter out of the laboratory and closed the huge
portal then with dignity he approached
the chamber door opened it

a page was outside apologetic

i am commanded to deliver this mes-
sage to the visitors from tellus the coun-
cil of the heads of the great houses of neina
has convened the presence of the tellur-
ians is desired at once

the patriarch sent a significant glance at
nina but she appeared in no wise perturbed
very well he said we shall come at
once

nina he observed after tbe page had
departed this is no ordinary summons and
i am inclined to believe that it is no ordinary
request they are about to make of us

she nodded

then let us remember-his voice grew
grave troubled-that while we have be-
come greatly indebted by the hospitality of
these people there is one thing between us
that we have sworn to keep secret even
though our lives are forfeit he looked
sharply into her eyes she saw his mean-
ing there her own eyes grew serious

that one thing i shall never reveal
she said simply even though alius marce
should ask it

and he will never fear replied the
old man it is that one secret that we are
now about to be called upon to reveal

the council of neina

the meeting hall of the heads of the
houses of neina was an enclosure vast
and impressive as the history of the satellite
itself within it from antiquity had been
held the most important meetings of the
race its walls had rung to the strophes of
that curious oratory peculiar to the neinian
language

its ancient fretted ceiling fashioned of
concentric ovals that caught up the speak-
ers voice and flung it hardly diminished to
all parts of the auditorium had witnessed
the coronation of kings the election of dem-
ocratic rulers the overthrow of ancient cus-
toms coups detat and all the panoply of
history from the time of the first insevestas
to-the present

it was such a hall as any world might be
proud to own achieving as it did a kind of
national expression a greater monument to
the skill intelligence and art of the neinians
the return from jupiter



that any conscious work of art could ever
have been it was particularly impressive
vhen in their bright robes and headgear
the nobles of the satellite were assembled-
there

upon the dais along the side-a dais that
glittered with the gems of neina and the
jeweled lamps fashioned by the best crafts-
men of the satellites ages-sat the heads of
the foremost houses in the center of them
all was old alius and beside him alius
marce now respectively ruler of neina and
commander-in-chief of her armies

like a turbulent scarlet sea the lesser
nobles in the pit rose when the old man
from tellus and nina entered they ut-
tered no sound but each man held aloft his
left hand in token of fealty to alius and
in welcome to the visitors from earth the
visitors were seated near the head of the
house of alius and then only did alius
marce break the silence with his recital of
all the horrors of his visit to pleida of the
neinian slaves that had supplicated him of
dolmicians barbarities and cruelties of the
desertion of the allies

the listeners murmured stirred with
anger and indignation

for twenty-nine circlings of our satellite
around the planet pleida he said we
have fought for freedom against dolmicians
fighters of the air and space with the aid
of our allies making use of the many new
and horrible weapons of war designed for
us by our friend from tellus we beat them
back until they finally acceded to our de-
mand for talk of permanent peace

but our allies were all but exhausted
you know the rest wtien we would have
conferred upon terms of peace and inde-
pendence dolmician tricked them played
on their sympathies traded them false se-
curity for real freedom caused them to be-
tray us and the cause of liberty we had
espoused

when he paused the rumblings of the
listeners swelled to a sullen roar against
pleida they cheered wildly as he declared
that he alone of the allies had held out had
rejected the terms of shameful peace

neina is the largest of the satellites of jupiter
known to us as anymde it completes its orbit in
even days and four hours

for i alone of all the leaders knew of
a plan by which the proud overbearing race
of pleidans might be forever overthrown
their lands laid waste their ugly temples
forced to go untenarlted their cattle and all
living things on the planet turned to
dust-

alius marce waited dramatically for ihe
full effect of this announcement as though
electrified the entire assemblage of the heads
of the houses of neina rose to its feet a
plan to wipe the pleidans out of the uni-
verse what could young marce mean

the young commander appeared not to
be ready to enlighten them in the hush
that followed the first reception of his an-
nouncement his father spoke

my son if you have such a power do
not keep it from us what is this plan

alius marce smiled i will have to tell
you a story he replied out of the corner
of his eye he glanced at the tellurians the
old man was staring straight ahead of him
nina only half comprehending what alius
marce had said was watching closely wait-
ing for him to continue the head of the
house of alius spoke again

proceed

some deismas ago alius marce began
we brought to our world two homeless
ones the visitors from tellus with them
came many marvels to delight our peopfe
and to aid them in their battles against
dolmician but the greatest of these mar-
vels they have not yet revealed to us it is
the marvel that destroyed their world

let me tell you something about that
world as i saw it upon the first journey
ever made there from pleida i was then
an humble member of the expedition headed
by salvarius carde whose doings as lieu-
tenant to dolmician have since been much
to our detriment in those days there was
peace between the satellites and pleida and
there was time and energy for the explora-
tion of the universe in the new space-ships
designed a short time earlier by the scien-
tists of neina but taken over by dolmician
for the use of his own explorers

we landed upon tellus after many
weary adventures in space hoping to find
there a race of living intelligent beings


wonder stories

fresh fuel for our ship and perhaps new
and startling thinge to report upon our re-
turn that there would be men upon the
earth we had no doubt for had not a ship
come out of space from tellus many gen-
erations past bearing these inhabitants on
a friendly visit to our satellite

  las for our hopes we found tel-
jfvlus dead and uninhabitable in the
enormous open spaces that formerly were
supposed to be covered with water we dis-
covered only tremendous dry fields of salt
even at the poles where ice-caps had once
jain there remained almost no moisture
the arid backs of the former continents were
heaps of sand and rock devoid of vegeta-
tion and all forms of life the earth was
a sorry remnant of a world dead before its
time no longer fulfilling its destiny of life
because there was no water to sustain living
beings on its surface	-

alius marce drew a deep breath perceiv-
ing that his listeners were deeply impressed
with this recital

the good fortune befell me he con-
tinued to find the last remnant of the
many populous cities that only a few years
earlier had spread themselves upon this
globe upon the command of salvarius
carde to search every corner of the planet
for signs of life i like the others passed
over the illimitable deserts at length i
came upon a valley miles in length and of
a depth that indicated it immediately to be
the lowest spot on the surface of the planet

i entered cautiously moving slowly
close to the surface of the ground my eyes
seeking for any trace of the lost man-beings
that our lore told me had existed on tellus
how shall i describe the scene that met my
eyes the floor of the valley had once
been level sea bottom and its walls were
rocky cliffs descending into the earth as
the water of the oceans had dried up vast
deposits of salt deeper and of a clearer sub-
stance than i had ever seen anywhere had
fastened themselves to the sides the floor-
everywhere in the depression it was like
entering a valley strewn with layers of the
finest cut jewels the suns rays were re-
flected multiplied until the glare was

blinding and everywhere was eternal
sterility

at length examining ledge after ledge
 came to the bottom of the valley which
was like some hot insufferable furnace of
dryness and heat there i found what re-
mained of a great city like an avenging
power the sand and soil had crept it upon
it had poured over the high cliffs on either
side had swept up into and through that
city until it was all but buried the weath-
ered tops of the huge stone buildings were
all that was to be seen

it was at that spot that the last of the
earths races had fought their losing battle
with death and extinction it was there that
the last lake of tellus water had lain until
fearful dissolution had overtaken it as it
had overtaken all the rest now that world
is but a dead planet coated with crystalline
salt dry lifeless

 i paint you this picture carefully com-
pletely because i am drawing for you a por-
trait of proud pleida as she will also ap-
pear-if we make use of my plan

there was a sensation as he seemed to
finish drawing his robe about him he
waited silent as the listeners held their
breaths for his next words

and that plan burst out old alius

but alius marce swept aside his questions
and went on again on a later expedi-
tion headed by myself and undertaken
against the wish of dolmician i found our
two visitors from tellus-he paused to
bow in the direction of nina and her fath-
er who were silently regarding him-hid-
ing in a cave beside a miserable and fuming
pool into which the mysterious ferment that
had destroyed all the earths other water
had already fallen

that ferment lords of neina was a pro-
duct of earths many wars it had been
created by one tribe in its conflict against
another alas it had gone beyond con-
trol had in time destroyed all water-that
of friends as well as the enemy against whom
it was directed

our visitors i am convinced know how
this ferment was made it was an alloy
it could be made here on neina and planted
by fast space-ships in the seas and lakes of
the return from jupiter



pleida and there would be no more talk
after that of attacking neina

the lords of the satellite perceived the
daring the supreme audacity of this stupen-
dous plan against pleida for a full min-
ute they were silent as if stunned de-
populate pleida by destroying all her wa-
ter impossible inhuman and wanton
but yet-

somewhere-in a far corner of the vast
auditorium a rumble started a tumult of
applause it spread over the assemblage
in ripples waves thunderous breakers of
applause shouts of approval stampings on
the floor even the conservative lords
swept off their feet by this unprecedented
proposal were moved by the crowd hysteria
about them and ceased their objections

chapter iii
the dread prophecy

only the patriarch of tellus and nina
his daughter remained with averted
faces the old man trembling reached out
and-seized her hand squeezing it it has
come-as i expected he murmured

i will remember my promise she re-
plied firmly no matter who shall ask it
i will not tell that secret and destroy an-
other world

they saw that old alius robed ruler of
all the houses of neina was standing up
holding out his hand for quiet slowly al-
most reluctantly the tumult subsided the
applause and shouting died away

friends he addressed the lords assem-
bled upon pleida the forces of dolmi-
cian are already forming at any moment
-perhaps even now they may begin the
flight that means battle and perhaps death
for us we must act quickly by your ap-
plause i judge you have accepted alius
marces plan-

a roar that threatened to be even more
thunderous than the first began among the
listeners but old alius quickly shut it off

if we are agreed he declared then i
demand-he turned to the tellurians-i
demand that these our guests tell us the

process by which this strange and dangerous
substance may be manufactured

nina impetuous would have leaped to
her feet with a cry but her father quickly
restrained her whatever happens say
nothing he cautioned her we must be
careful after all we are neinas guests

with alacrity he then rose to his feet
standing directly before old alius

friends he declared no man is more
indebted than i to neina no man has
brought less to her or received more from
her it has been my humble privilege to
aid the satellite in some of her battles what
help i could give i gave gladly and i have
been amply rewarded

but as for your new request-let me
revert for a moment to the picture of our
earth as alius marce painted it for you
think of it the green earth where once bil-
lions of men not greatly unlike yourselves
once lived the green earth that burgeoned
with limitless good things in sea and air
and on the land teeming with trees grass
fish flesh fowl the pleasures of living and
travel good food happy homes where
are those wonderful things now alius
marce spoke the truth-they are all gone
they perished miserably in the passing of
all the water from the earth

 lords of neina think think what this
means to depopulate a planet to make it
uninhabitable outside our system we
know not what there is it may be that
yonder in the endless sky other planets
wheel around other suns that happy peo-
ples live there amid pleasures of which
we know nothing but be that as it may
such endless distances separate us from them
that we shall never know what they do
there what they are thinking about what
hopes and joys are theirs we have only
the system of the brilliant sun his planets
are our only homes

and of his planets nine in number
which are suitable for living things mer-
cury is far too hot venus too wet mars
is fair but beasts of strange and poisonous
sort overrun it men have never yet suc-
ceeded in planting colonies there jupiter
or as you call it pleida is habitable as are
four of her satellites thanks to the internal


wonder stories

fires that heat them beyond these lie the
outer planets cold and dead huge lumps of
frozen stone coated with the ice of carbon
dioxide and hydrogen

there is then only tellus and the sys-
tem of pleida of these the earth is now
a desert unfit for life

lords of neina-would you voluntarily
destroy another planet-leave only these
satellites in all the universe so far as we
may know to carry on the fitful gleam of
human life

alius marce was filled with the hot blood
of youth his anger was still warm against
the people of the mother planet he per-
ceived what the old mans words were doing
to his listeners he leaped to his feet

if that planet supports only such mis-
shapen creatures as these squat men of
pleida he exclaimed i say destroy it and
its life with it

but alius marce-lords of neina-
the young commander blazed at the old
man what would you have us do lie
down and let them enslave ys to save the
solar system no the war is not over
we shall continue to fight with whatever
weapon comes to our hand neina must be
free

the man from tellus faced him calmly
he was like a jeremiah at the end pro-
phesying doom he raised his withered arm
and placed it on the arm of his young host

wait he said do not be angry with
me our sympathies are necessarily with
you-our lives are bound up with yours

but when you speak of fighting stop
and think you may conceivably win
against the powerful armies now gathering
on pleida with the frightful weapon you
have just asked of me you would certainly
destroy her and the armies with her you
would then have won freedom for neina-
but to what avail

 a llus marce you have not been told
-iwhat your father already knows it
is time you learned it now i will remind
you that your satellite is located far from
the life-giving heat of the sun since the
beginning of time it has depended for heat
upon the hidden fires in its interior think

alius marce-are your people not already
suffering from the coldness of your streets
and fields are they not already spending
the major part of their time indoors over
artificial fires

the old man waited for a moment dra-
matically then he turned to the huge as-
sembly sometimes it requires a stranger
to point out truths to us this is the thing
i wish tosay to you the unrest of neina
has been stirred up by heartfelt rebellion
against the oppressions of dolmician but
while your wars have kept the attention
of the people far from home life has been
growing increasingly harder on your satel-
lite while you may fight successfully
against the mandates of the lustful emperor
you have at hand no remedy for the in-
exorable cruelty of nature

in brief neina is growing old some
subtle change in her internal chemistry has
been taking place for generations lately
this change has been progressing cumula-
tively now with each swing around her
mother planet the lowering of her tempera-
ture is so great that it is plainly noticeable
neinas furnaces are dying and in a few
more tens of deismas-in a generation or two
at the most she will virtually be a frozen
world

alius marce looked into the old mans
eyes and saw sincerity there it had sud-
denly become clear to him the perturbation
of his father as it had been reflected in the
televisor the chance remarks of the tellur-
ian scientist the feeling that some doom
greater than the threat of dolmician over-
hung his world he glanced from the old
man to his father and saw old alius stand-

old alluss sentence echoed in the silent
room like the crack of doom he repeated
it slowly as if himself a stranger to its
meaning yet sure too of a subtler content
than any of the others had yet grasped

tured carefully selected one are often those
of a group of animals a crowd will grow
panic-stricken will mill and bellow under
circumstances in which every member of it
would as individuals remain calm and
poised like a good soldier amid the terrors
of the battlefield

the lull that followed old alluss second
declaration of faith in the tellurians as-
tounding assertion was like the silence that
often precedes the greatest furies of the ele-
ments for a full minute hardly any man in
the assembly hall stirred then suddenly
here there a rumbling began alius
marce stricken dumb for a moment by the
disclosures that had swept all his carefully
made and much cherished plans out of the
window stood like a statue of marble on
the high platform beside the old man from
earth together they heard the storm be-
low lhem begin to break

somebody shouted abruptly amid the
growing clamor

proofs proofs

another took it up where are your
proofs that neina is growing cold that all
the satellite is doomed

alius marce held both hands up and
stilled them the old man spoke again

lords of alius there are proofs enough
-but today you have no time to go into
that to show you what i have learned
would take hours perhaps days-and as
we stand here the hosts of pleida gathering
to conquer and enslave all the peoples of this
satellite may be already awaiting the sig-
nal to launch into space

but by deiminos tellurian you have
robbed us of a reason for resistance with-
out giving us any comfort or hope

the old man waited for the tumult to
subside then continued calmly

you are wrong i have a proposal to
make of all the men of the solar system
i alone hold full and undisputed title to an
entire planet a planet near enough to the
sun to enjoy its life-giving warmth a plan-
et neither too large nor too small a planet
capable of sustaining ten times the popula-
tion of neina and more 

lords of neina you have been my most
gracious hosts in return accept my invita-

tion to you and our people to repopulate
the earth abandon neina to the pleidans
and to the cold come with me to tellusn

arm

tut you have told us and i have seen

- it with my own eyes cried alius
marce tellus is dry she is dead and un-
inhabitable

yes-at present it is- the old mans
eyes snapped but what if i were to tell
you i had found a way to bring water back
to that arid globe

have you

for many months i have worked alone
in my laboratory at last i have contrived
processes that will manufacture water from
the nitrogen-bearing atmosphere of tellus
i have tried it experimentally and it works
with my apparatus and a thousand replicas
of it we can put the atmosphere of tellus
back into the oceanic basins where it be-
longs restore living things to the planet
and make it habitable

this announcement topping all the oth-
ers the tellurian had made left the great
lords in the meeting hall temporarily
stunned even alius marce and his father
were at a loss for words the whole as-
semblage was silent its members gaping at
the old man upon the platform who had had
the audacity to suggest that neinians forsake
their home satellite to repopulate another
globe and who had as calmly declared that
one of the miracles which had been sought
throughout the ages the controlled transmu-
tation of elements could be performed at
last

but they did not have long to stand there
silently even as they contemplated this
new element in the climactic jumble of
events of the last few hours there clanged
through the chamber the great tones of a
hidden bell the tocsin gong of approaching
danger like the fulfillment of a prophecy
a portion of the wall beside old alius light-
ed up with the characteristic glow of the tele-
vision in a moment the image of neinas
foremost astronomer stood before the as-

-	my lords he declared the enemy fleet
has already launched from pleida

old alius turned quickly to the screen
they have started how long have we

we have only one circling of the moth-
er planet in which to prepare

immediately the spell of the old tellur-
ians words left the lords of neina and there
was questioning discussion confusion in the
meeting hall should neinians accept the
invitation of this half-mad old man and
abandon the satellite if they should what
would be the consequences

there were many who despite their af-
fection for the earth that had brought their
race into being were for immediate aban-
donment they pointed out that the tel-
lurians were not unlike themselves except
that they had no wings were somewhat
heavier of body and more muscular this
argued that conditions on tellus were not
too greatly dissimilar from those on neina
it was therefore a feasible project from a
biological point of view

but other lords equally influential as-
serted that the old man was a prophet of
evil and deserving of banishment they
argued that neina was the only proper home
of the neinian race they declared that
the defense of the satellite was the only
program that loyal lords could countenance

the noise of the argument rose from sub-
dued murmurs to a buzzing of voices the
sounds increased to angry sentences and
shouting so loud that it drowned out the
steady clangor of the warning bell old
alius despairing of ever reaching a deci-
sion in this fashion rose once more on the
dais and commanded the silence and atten-
tion of the lords

my people he called out to them i
have ruled neina for a long time no man
has loved her more than i yet when our
friend from earth speaks to us i know he
speaks the truth it is my counsel there-
fore that we accept his invitation to go to
tellus

nevertheless it would be folly to trans-
port our people thither without first pre-
paring a place let us with all haste dis-
patch this tellurian scientist and his pre-

a littie over a week in tellurian time

cious apparatus with a sufficient crew ta
earth there to set up the machine and begin
to build for our coming the rest of us
willremain here to meet the onslaught of the
pleidans our armies will go to the satel-
lites defense we will attempt to keep our
freedom until everything is ready for our
departure

this is my advice what is your will

with one accord the leaders cast their
votes in favor of this plan and acclaimed
old alius as the wisest among them

then there is no time to lose he shout-
ed arm the pleidans are coming

chapter iv
arm arm

high over the greatest of the military
space-ship hangars of neina in the
topmost launching place a little army of
men worked like mad upon a huge gleam-
ing projectile the cartridge that was to
carry the hopes of all neina on this long
dangerous and uncertain journey through
space the old man from tellus was there
with old alius and the girl nina superin-
tending the preparations for the flight

far below them they heard the shouting
of the people n the streets the clamorous
people of neina who did not yet know the
doom that was hanging over them in this
curious world at once the most advanced
in science and the least advanced in social
arts in the system of jupiter news travelled
slowly there was no public television no
close communion of the people

ruled by an oligarchy divided by clan-
loyalties the neinians felt little need for the
hasty dissemination of information about
their nation or themselves they knew only
that alius marce and his men had returned
from pleida and that a conference had been
held with the lords of neina the crowds
were now gathering to catch a glimpse of
the young hero as he passed through the
streets from the council chamber to his
own palace

the neinians believed that peace had
been concluded that alius marce was re-
turning triumphant from the signing of a
the return from jupiter



pact that made them free they observed
him standing like a young god in the metal-
lic vehicle that carried him through the
glittering rays of ancienda on either side
the spectators roared out their admiration
for this winged creature tall and manly who
had been in such haste to bring the good
news to neina that he had courageously
plunged his space-flier into the sea to save
a few hours of precious time

but as for alius marce he was troubled
at this display he groaned inwardly to
remember that he had failed in the mission
these folk believed had been a success he
felt himself unworthy of their applause he
was ashamed yet proud too that his people
should love him so

it had been left to the lords of neina in
their mobilization to tell the populace what
the situation was alius marce on his de-
parture from the council chamber had not
anticipated the welcome now being show-
ered upon him

seeking advice he had turned to the old
lieutenant who rode beside him saldu
he asked shall i tell them

do not the other counselled alas
they will learn the truth soon enough and
by that time our plans for mobilization will
be well under way to tell them now
might lead to disaster smile alius
marce as if all things were as they should
be we cannot chance letting the people
know how uncertain their leaders are as
to the outcome of this day

so marce smiled and bowed and acted
the gracious son of the head of the house
of alius but as they progressed through
the crowded streets some subfiie sixth sense
warned the people that this was no heroic
procession as they had supposed alius
marce could scarcely restrain his glances
toward the black skies there he knew
though they were still too far away to be
visible the hosts of pleida were already a-
wing the demonstrations grew less noisy
there was a rustling and uneasiness in the
throngs that lined the way

a whisper had got out that the armies of
neina were mobilizing again what sort
of peace and triumph was this against

whom would the space-cars of the satellite
fly except those of the mighty pleida

the whisperings ran like wildfire through
the crowds so it was to be war again
the winning campaign that had been fought
by neina and her three allies against the
barbarities of pleida had gone for nothing
so that was what alius marce had learned
on his voyage to the mother planet that had
sent him back in such heroic haste

the people grew silent watchful alins
marce smiled and bowed but there was no
response

they know he murmured to his lieuten-
ant saldu they know before we tell
them that the peace is not concluded that
it is to be war again

 the lieutenant nodded it was not a
secret that could have been kept he re-
plied quietly

the procession drew on through the sul-
len streets until it came to the great
plaza before the palace of alius-the plaza
that had known so many historic happenings
since it was built by the first alius in the
misty antiquity of the satellites past here
had tramped victorious armies home from
battles against planetary and interplanetary
foes here had once alighted a graceful
winged space-car from the far-off earth
bearing men like neinians except that they
had no wings here was the scene of many
a triumph and tragedy marking the epochs
of neinas history

the glistening car bearing alius marce
rolled into the open space it was clear
that the whisperings of renewed war of dis-
content nd uneasiness had preceded it
countless thousands of neinian citizens
were assembled there shivering and silent
in the chill wind that swept across the plaza
alius marce observed them with gloomy
thoughts remembering the prophecy of the
old man from tellus for within his own
memory tropical plants had bloomed and
unfolded upon this square where now only
the hardy sub-polar shrubs could be made
to grow

the people of neina were not however
speculating on these things they were in-
tently watching alius marce as his proces-

sion made its stately way across the square
the young commander surveyed them heard
an alarming ominous thunder in their mur-
murings what was the meaning of marces
strange return they asked themselves what
could be the significance of his silence and
reticence

at the palaces wall where the twin en-
trance-tubes ran down beneath to afford
passage for the surface-cars alius marce
could restrain himself no longer he re-
membered the warning of silence his father
had imposed upon him he glanced un-
easily toward the distant launching-level
where out of sight he knew that the mech-
anics and crew were busier than ever with
their work upon the expedition to tellus
he shrugged cast everything to the winds
these people he loved they were his peo-
ple he had risked everything on more than
one occasion to save them they had a right
to know the dangers that threatened

he stepped suddenly to the back of the
car a roar arose as the crowd pressed
closer to hear his words

people of neina he shouted arm
arm for the most bitter war that you have
ever known our allies have deserted us
bought by promises and false security and
neina has been betrayed already the
arms of pleida are flying toward us through
the night of space we must meet them at
the breaking line where the pull of pleida
and neina balance there and there alone
will we be superior to them for our craft
though outnumbered are more maneuver-
able

arm arm people of neina and we
shall yet win that freedom for which we
have sacrificed so much

again through the magic confidence of
his speech alius marce had become neinas
hero it was a struggle for the guards to
clear a path for him to the entrance of the
palace the neinians shouted for him
pushed in to get a glimpse of him swore
unending allegiance in voices cracked by
emotion

arm arm

the cry was taken up like a chorus and
all the people of neina when their leader
had disappeared and the heavy doors of the

palace had closed after him hastened away
to obey so occupied were they that few
noticed the launching of a mighty craft from
the highest level of the space-car storage
place and none thought of its possible sig-
nificance as it struck out bravely into the
hostile void seeking ultimately to land upon
old tellus the arid earth

an old man the venerable head of the
house of alius and a young girl nina
only remaining daughter of earth moved
slowly toward the elevator that would carry
them to the street level of the space-car
house

my child old alius said to her you
had an opportunity to return once more to
the planet of your birth to live there safely
and in peace to await our coming yet at
the last moment so perverse is your will-
the will of a woman-you refused and stood
firmly upon your right to remain here
choosing the dangers of tragic neina for the
peace and quiet of the unpeopled earth
yes- admitted nina i chose to
stay-

but once the space car bearing your
father and two hundred of my ablest scien-
tists had started on their journey you burst
into such copious tears that i have only
now succeeded in staunching them old
alius shook his head it is a womans
way-

nina broke in upon his observations
nothing of the sort

then why- he asked

nina considered briefly i have two
loyalties she explained impetuously
which permit me to be happy neither here
nor there sfc long as on tellus lies my
home but here remains my love

old alius was silent for a moment as they
stepped into the lift so you remained
he asked to be near alius marce you
love him that much

she looked at the patriarch quickly
im-afraid i do she answered some-
times i hate him but i love him too

alius marce-though he is my son-is a
spoilt fellow the old man exclaimed fer-
vently he has more power than becomes
his years even today despite poor neinas 
the return from jupiter



dangers and despairs he has stirred up the
people in order to satisfy his vanity had
he left things alone we would have been
mobilized in an orderly and effective fash-
ion before the fall of night we would
have been in position to fall upon the at-
tackers swiftly secretly

but now the people are mad with false
patriotism the lords no longer control
them they want to follow alius marce
like a rabble making a great display but
wasting their power and losing all chance
for strategy

nevertheless declared nina i believe
alius marce can win i have remained be-
hind to help him

you help him how

nina smiled quietly perhaps i could
lead a ship into the fight she suggested
perhaps i might suggest some new strategy
or direct the use of a weapon

you mean-

i mean that i am too wise in the ways
of men with women to thrust myself upon
aiius marce but if he will listen to me-
the old man looked into her eyes then
by heaven and earth he shall listen to you
he must

pehaps she cried cryptically

chapter v
the flight to tellus

neina was shrinking behind them like
a lump of ice melting and running into
nothingness in the fierce heat of the sun
they had long since passed the sphere of the
satellites strong influence now they were
at the cruel mercy of the sun dependent
upon the trueness of their course the ac-
curacy of their calculations the steadiness
of their machine and its fuels alone in
uncharted space guiding their route by those
unbelievably distant buoys that glowed dim-
ly in all directions clutched in the hollow
cold of space they were nevertheless at
peace among themselves resigned to what-
ever fate was in store for them

it was around the old man from tellus
the aged prophet and scientist who in its
extremity had offered haven for their race

that the neinian scientists gathered while
the engineers of the craft neinas best
guided the frail speck through the infinity
of the heavens	

he was explaining to them minutely what
he intended to do upon tellus going over
the ground carefully in the empty hours
of the journey so that there might be no
time lost unnecessarily when the time came
to act

despite its unbelievable smallness in rela-
tion to the bodies of the firmament and the
forces against which it was pitted the rock-
et that bore the expedition seemed huge
to the men within it part-way back in
chambers surrounded by huge tanks con-
taining the precious concentrated fuel that
drove them onward they congregated in a
laboratory the like of which had never been
seen before on any craft or earth mech-
anics were still at work on it under the eye
of the old man from tellus fitting it up
for its part in this unparalleled migration
of a sovereign people from satellite to plan-
et

folded in sections against its walls were
parts of a contrivance resembling a huge
basin perhaps hundreds of yards in dia-
meter when assembled in furnace-rooms
beneath the laboratory other parts for this
structure were still in preparation in the
storage rooms were many other pieces of
complex machinery huge thermo-couples
designed to transform the heat of the sun
directly into electric power transmission-
generators for changing power into di-thur-
nian waves by which means the last genera-
tions of the tellurians and after them the
neinians had learned to transmit energy
great distances directly through space or at-
mosphere gyroscopic controls heavy fly-
wheels automatic stabilizers

in the furnace-room and shop there were
also being prepared receiving reflectors for
the di-thurnian power designed to be fast-
ened to the earth or to the strange machine
the old man from tellus had built secretly
in his own laboratory on neina this had
been carefully packed into the space-flyer
before its departure and barred from the
sight of everyone save the old man who had
invented it


wonder stories

you must understand the tellurian
scientist explained to his followers from
neina what conditions we expect to face
upon the earth many generations ago
when all other sources of power had been
used up or greatly reduced a tellurian
scientist discovered an almost magical al-
loy that had the power when hot of af-
fecting the dissolution of water in such a
way that great amounts of energy were re-
leased this fellow and his descendants
contrived a kind of engine to take advantage
of this phenomenon not knowing or per-
haps not caring that they were thereby pro-
viding a source of power that would ulti-
mately wipe out mankind and all living
tilings

for this was the curious and special pro-
perty of that magical alloy in its presence
the hydrogen in water somehow underwent
a nuclear change fourteen atoms of hydro-
gen combining to form one atom of nitro-
gen the power derived by this process
appeared in the form of heat and radiation
an expression of what scientists have called
the mass defect the gases given off by
the explosion that followed consisted of hot
nitrogen and oxygen and the water once
thus destroyed could never be replaced be-
cause one of its vital elements hydrogen no
longer existed as such

a wise use of this energy would never
have exhausted our plentiful seas but
humankind was so constituted that plenty led
to extravagance and extravagance to wil-
ful waste and waste in its turn to disaster
and want

wars broke out among the races of the
planet and then an inventor with dia-
bolical cleverness succeeded in preparing
the disintegrating alloy in powder form so
that it might be thrown directly into the
seas and reservoirs held by an enemy de-
stroying that enemy by cutting off his supply
f power

einstein had theoretically demonstrated in the
th century that if a heavy element were built up
from a lighter one energy would be given off in pro-
portion to the mass difference of the total atomic
weights involved thus  atoms of hydrogen weigh
  each while an atom of nitrogen weighs
only  the difference or mass- defect being 
or more than a tenth of the energy of a single hydro-
gen atom millikan believes that some such process
accounts for the generation of cosmic rays

	he result was annihilation at once fear

x great numbers of men more than
half the water of the earth disappeared in
a few months the warfare that had rocked
the world came to an end in the horror of
thirst and privation when stock was taken
of the remaining water of the globe the
winning race congratulated itself that there
was still enough to last -indefinitely but
its engineers had reckoned without the mys-
terious and sometimes malignant action of
nature when provoked she can sometimes
retaliate with terrible and swift weapons

the powdered alloy used with such tell-
ing effect against the enemy was cast by the
spuming waters into the air where it floated
from place to place on the winds in the
form of impalpable dust it fell into the
seas lakes reservoirs of the remainder of
the world it went with insidious persis-
tence into every pool on all the globe and
at last mankind died as a result of its own
ruthlessness the earth became a dry and
crystal-covered clod without life of any
kind

it is such an earth men of neina we
must rehabilitate-a dry earth with an at-
mosphere of oxygen almost too strong for
mans tender lungs and weighed down with
the gas nitrogen somehow from-these two
elements we must restore water to that
earth for the people of neina 

the scientists of the satellite stared at him
during these recitals in awe daring not to
ask that terrible question that each had on
his tongue they knew that when the time
came the tellurian would reveal everything
to them they were content with his grad-
ual unfolding of the plan as the hours and
days of the frightful journey rolled past

	 

the hot sun turned his single burning
eye on them they felt his heat as
speeding through space they approached
him in their quest of that tiny planet oc-
cupying the third orbit of the solar system

in the space-rocket there was no night or
day time passed in a steady stream the
occupants felt neither motion nor the op-
pression of weight though their speed
was terrific measured by terrestrial stand-
pthe return from jupiter



lards to them it seemed that they were poised
motionless amid the vastness of space as if
their metallic car were as immobile as a
projectile painted upon canvas

some were alarmed complaining that
they had already been too long on the way
some pointed to the growing size of the
suns disk and spoke with terror of the dan-
gers that lay in that direction recalling that
once in a past age a rocket bearing tellur-
ians on their return journey from neina had
slipped unknowing from the proper way
they recalled how it had been drawn irre-
sistably toward the brilliant orb that was
the mother of the planets its occupants per-
ishing miserably and in terror as the heat
grew about them and the walls of their
rocket-car glowed with the electronic bom-
bardment of the suns radiations

but the old man from tellus as the time
passed grew in energy as his followers
grew in fear he drove them mercilessly
to their tasks about the ship in the hot
workshop the engineers were bringing to an
end the fashioning of mysterious engines he
had devised in the laboratory physicists
and chemists bent endlessly over tests and
experiments he had directed forgetting their
fears and uneasiness in the wonders of the
new worlds the old man had opened to them
in the hidden things of nature

the lectures in the ships crowded audi-
toriums continued sometimes they dealt
with the lore of the skies bits of astronomy
that was the distilled wisdom of generations
of tellurian observers other times he ex-
plained little known laws of atoms show-
ing how cunningly the universe was put
together electron and nucleus whirling or-
bits too small for any microscope to see
multiples of atoms building upward into
molecules the miracles of chemical com-
position by which we live and all things ex-
ist the solid planets the liquid glowing
sun the ringed orbits of the solar worlds
the circling paths of universes in the solemn
mysterious processions of the stars and ne-
bulae

it is because i love all nature and hence
all life that i have dared to make ihis at-
tempt to restore water to the earth he ex-

plained pleida teeming with life-even
the life that to us seems loathsome cruel
insensate-is better than a planet without
life of any kind behind the universe ex-
amine it as you will there must exist some
mighty plan and if that plan is the ever-
unfolding influence of sentient life then
we must sacrifice everything to further it

in the days of the ancient peoples of
earth there were many who delved into
natures secrets revealing many things that
we have since been able to turn to our use
in olden times there was a scientist whose
discoveries i have come upon in my wide
reading of tellurian lore he passed the
quick alpha rays of radium through nitrogen
gas and by photography in a cloud cham-
ber demonstrated that the ionized particles
that make up these rays upon colliding with
occasional atoms of nitrogen were able
under certain conditions to knock loose pro-
tons

this man was unable to demonstrate
whether or not these protons would later
pick up electrons and so become true atoms
of hydrogen but i in my experiments on
neina have demonstrated that they can
those experiments point the way to the solu-
tion of our problem if under terrestrial
conditions we can bombard atoms of nitro-
gen and produce hydrogen the manufacture
of water in sufficient quantity will only fol-
low upon the devising of proper methods
and large enough plants

are we to understand asked one of the
scientists that you have already performed
this experiment and found it possible

the old man nodded in the labora-
tory he replied

but queried another you have told
us that in building up the hydrogen of water
into nitrogen through your disintegrating
alloy great energy was released is it not
necessary in reversing the process to put
back into it exactly as much energy as ear-
lier went out

true-true but that is a problem i
have also thought about you shall see in
good time how we may deal with that

earth draws near

jupiter had dwindled in the sky to the
size of a bright glowing star and her
satellites were now invisible to the unaided
eye no longer was the system behind
them ah objects in the icy void had seem-
ed to change with the passing hours now
there was no up or down or back or front
the rushing gases of the space-ships mul-
tiple exhaust appeared to have no effect
there was only the faint constant whisper-
ings of the rocket tube explosions as they
echoed inside the car transmitted there by
the metal of the hull

far to their left they described a yellow
star burning steadily in the inky blackness
of space

that star is earth the old tellurian
said we will cross her orbit meeting
her at a long angle to make our landing
easier-if the navigators have calculated
our course properly

and if they have not

we will be drawn into the sun there
can be no second try

the navigators and engineers standing
hour after hour at their instruments checked
and rechecked the course compressed their
lips grimly they measured the rockets
imperceptible speed and finding it too great
damped off the exhaust soon they would
know how skillful they had been to strike
the earth they must have aimed neither too
high nor too low to far either to the right or
the left they must have traveled only just
so fast neither slower nor swifter from
neina the planet tellus had been but a tiny
yellow moving speck at such a target had
they launched the metal cartridge upon
whose safe arrival depended so many lives

the laboratory of the space-car was now
crowded with finished apparatus there was
no longer room for the long rambling talks
of the scientist nevertheless he addressed
the neinians speaking to them sometimes
singly sometimes in pairs in small groups
explaining to each his part in the great in-
tei planetary drama for which the stage was
being set

let every man be familiar with the work-
ings of his space-suit he admonished them

they are not new to you but i have direct
ed certain changes to be incorporated that
give greater mobility and longer time away
from the compression chamber there is
now a better type of oxygengenerator in
each the metal gauntlets are provided
with improved heaters so that the occupant
may work for several hours without losing
the use of his hands when the time comes
every man must execute his own particular
task with speed and efficiency

they saw after more time had elapsed
that tellus was indeed drawing near now
they could distinguish the bright point of
light that marked the position of luna
earths single moon

the old tellurian still driving his men
in the laboratory and workshop stalked to
and fro like a slave-master afraid that all
would not be ready by the time the glisten-
ing rocket crossed the path of the approach-
ing planet

we shall have no time to lose he de-
clared as he went through the shop exam-
ining half-finished parts laying out new
work are the mirrors completed

the mechanics nodded

and the thermocouples

yes

it is a pity we could not have had time
to manufacture the contrivance complete on
neina so we could have tried it out but
as it is-

he shook his head savagely the pleid-
ans couldnt wait well we shall beat
them anyway then in a moment how
about the generators are they ready
nearly there are two more to be wired
and tested

speed them up

gone were the fears of the neinian scien-
tists that they had lost their way now they
could see the target plainly with unaided
eyes it was beginning to loom up at them
a most brilliant disc in a dark and forbid-
ding universe vaguely they could discern
the spots which had once been old tellus
continents-they were dark patches set roy-
ally among glistening areas of white

the old man found many of them looking
wonderyigly upon these revelations from the
spaee-cars windows neglecting their work
jhe return from jupiter



but wheh he saw the object of their interest
he became suddenly indulgent

there is the planet we must bring back
to life he murmured if my science can-
not do it we are lost-and so are the people
of neina

gently he admonished them and the rock-
et hummed with the sounds of industry that
di owned even the throb of her pumps and
the whisper of the rockets that propelled and
guide her aboard the craft as the bright
face of earth drew near there was a note of
gaiety the scientists technicians and
mechanics worked like men who perform
tasks they thoroughly enjoyed the navi-
gators began to perceive that their aim had
been true they had neither overshot nor
undershot the mark there it was beckon-
ing to them out of silent space

the time had come when even the old
tellurian appeared more certain of himself
and the outcome of the voyage but he did
not relax his vigilance he was constantly
with the navigators in their calculations and
dispensed his orders with the same rigid
manner

tonight he said for matters aboard
the space-flier had been governed precisely
as if there had indeed been day and night
every man must retire early and rest well
tomorrow we shall come within the gravita-
tional influence of the earth-and after
that as you know well there will be work
to do

chapter vi

ninas strategy

swiftly silently speeding through the
blackness of the void that separated
neina from her planet the forces of pleida
were coming ignorant of the single rocket-
ship that had sped away from their quarry
ii search of the planet earth and scornful
of what this small world could do even if
they had known the rocket-ships sped
straight toward their goal resolved to leave
no free man on the satellite

heading the invading expedition was sal-
varius carde mightiest of the pleidan nob-
les the favorite of dolmician he stood

upon the bridge of his flagship and surveyed
the neinan preparations through the teles-
copes with which his vessels all were equip-
ped

they have been warned of our coming
he shouted gleefully to guttar his second
in command they are scurrying around
like ants but what can they do against us
we are invincible

he turned from his contemplation of the
unhappy satellite to survey the majestic
force he was leading to its conquest he
beheld eight hundred glistening rocket-ships
of the finest war design flying in a great
spreading wedge four hundred on either
side and a trifle behind his own craft be-
hind them rode the pleidian transports with
the colors of dolmician etched into their
shells and the nozzles of weapons protrud-
ing from their sides

it was a crushing force the mightiest ever
to fly in one campaign salvarius carde
surveyed it with unconcealed pleasure
knowing full well that no effort of the nein-
ians would ever serve to stand against such
a force better for them if they failed to
attack at all he would be more disposed
to measure out mercy upon them if they
made no preliminary show of force but
if they should-

he laughed as he thought of the puny
force of his old enemy the proud head-
strong alius marce

if alius marce should come against him
he would make a special point of humbling
him the pleidian delighted in contem-
plating the unequal battle the few battered
ships of neina against these proud cruisers
that bore the colors of dolmician

	 

the astronomers of neina were as cog-
nizant as was salvarius carde of the
strength of pleida through their instru-
ments they had already counted the ap-
proaching craft of the enemy estimated the
weapons they might use calculated the
speed of their flight

reports went constantly to alius marce
who remained in the huge hangars that
shielded his own space-ships superintending
their loading fueling arming

the fleet of pleida is now half-way from


wonder stories

the planet to our satellite the astronomers
informed him through the wall television
that had been fitted up for his use they
are coming at such speed as to bring them
upon us within the next twenty senuras
how far are they from the cancelling
point where neina measures her strength
with pleida and finds it equal

many deismas yet commander but ap-
proaching it at terrific speed

alius marce turned quickly away let
them come he commented for at that
point the peoples of neina will also con-
test with the forces of pleida and dolmi-
cians men will find them more than their
equals

impulsively he passed from space-fighter
to space-fighter examining the equipment
the crews and their weapons as he ap-
proached they sprang to attention proud of
their commander it was not until he had
come to the last that he found a surprise
waiting for him it was nina uniformed
like the commander of a space-ship of war
he paused staring at her in amazement
nina he said i thought you were-
with your father i thought after what
happened at the conference that you had de-
serted us

she smiled at him on the contrary i
have remained to help you defend neina
help us she saw immediately that
she had wounded his pride by so blunt a
statement for alius marce was not a man
to accept help from any source i am glad
that you remained behind to be with us un-
til your father returns he went on quick-
ly but if you mean-he gestured tow-
ard her military garb-that you wish to
take part in the actual battle-that cannot
be we have no women in the armies of the
neinians

she flushed but stood firm alius
marce she exclaimed i would never
have dared to come to you at such a time
had i not been sure that neina is in grave
danger i had your fathers permission to
don this uniform and to address you here
i-

he stopped her with an upraised hand
commanding silence

i can have no woman in my army nina
i want to be gentle with you but this is a
serious hour and there is no time for argu-
ment in a few minutes we must take off
toward pleida to intercept our enemies be-
fore they reach the satellite

he finished with a tone like a military
command and turned on his heel she cried
out after him but he would not listen i
do not insist that you include me she
called but you must listen to my plan
i have strategy that may win where every
other way will surely lose

he hesitated at that she caught up with
him

i also have a plan he asserted we
shall proceed directly to the fight and there
shall engage the enemy as neinian ships
have done for generations we shall be
victorious with the weapons your father
has devised for us we will riddle them
but marce they are as numerous as
leaves in the trees eight hundred fight-
ing ships and as many transports while
you have only a few over a hundred and
they are old despite their new weapons
and remember alius marce how space-
ships fight at terrific speeds you will
meet head-oh your only opportunity for
riddling them as you say is in that instant
of time when the opposing fleets flash past
each other once past you must circle
swift heavy space-ships are not easily man-
euverable what if they should choose not
to turn and meet your second thrust you
would not be able to catch them before they
landed on the satellite 

but they will turn since time out of
mind space-ship fleets have fought their
battles by circling between the worlds

this is no ordinary war pleida is out
for swift and certain conquest why els
would she send many transports filled with
troops and guards she will try to land
them at her earliest opportunity regardless
of the conventions of your age-old space-
fighting they will merely pass you take
what losses are necessary and speed on to
the defenseless satellite before you can
turn your heavy fleet and come to our res-
cue the whole pleidan armada will have
landed and taken your capital
the return from jupiter



alius marce shrugged i cannot believe
it he commented in any case what
better plan have you

this they will be suspicious of ambush
if you do not attack as you have suggested
and so will land cautiously at a distance
from ancienda and march into the city
thereafter by land overwhelming us with
poisonous gases as they come but if they
think your fleet is out they will attempt to
alight boldly on the citys landing space as
many of them as can find room in order to
complete the conquest quickly before the
fleet can return and aid in the defense

i propose that we do this let me lead
the fleet against the pleidan armada your
people love me the fighters will follow and
do as i tell them we will take only skele-
ton crews-just enough men in each ship to
maneuver and handle the weapons mean-
while you with your greater skill and
knowledge will take the main body of the
fighters and plant them in strategic posi-
tions around the common landing field in
ancienda

fulfilling your campaign i shall lead
your space fleet through the hosts of the at-
tackers turn and pretend to try desperate-
ly to overtake them they will not know
that it is i leading the fleet and that you are
in ambush against them on the satellite and
they will land directly as i foretold

when they have opened their ships and
begun to disembark you will suddenly give
the command and blaze away at them with
every weapon in your power destroying
their ships or crippling them killing many
of the pleidians and making the others pri-
soners by the time i have returned with
the space fleet you will have won the day
made neina safe at least for the time being
and have provided the people in addition
with a number of ships that will be of great
use when the time comes to migrate to tel-
lus

she looked eagerly into alius marces
face watching for his reaction to this sug-
gested defense he remained silent

what do you think of it she asked
isnt it better

he shook his head impulsively my

place he said without answering the ques-
tion is at the head of my fleet i cannot
stoop to lay traps like some common gar-
dener whose enemy is a mouse

but alius marce-

for the second time he turned abruptly
away from her i cannot consider it
he declared

she seized hold of him restraining him
by force as he made to move off again
this is no time of think of personal pride
of ancient customs or of position she
pleaded neina has her back against the
wall we must defend her until my father
brings us word of a better place to live
if you persist in your attack in space an-
cienda will surely fall and the people of
the satellite will be enslaved your ene-
my salvarius carde will live in the cham-
bers that your father and his fathers before
him have hallowed with their memories
you and all your family will go down into
the mines their chance for life and freedom
forever lost

i will attack them in space said alius
marce coldly	

then you will lose neina because of
your false pride your people will suffer
extinction because they have placed too
much trust in one who was not great enough
to think first of their welfare

as she spoke nina stood firmly before
him her eyes flashing anger in her face
alius marce replied to her in kind his lips
white and thin

as for you-you may join the old wo-
men with your wailing and when i have
won this victory i shall return you to your
barren and deserted tellus and let you die
of thirst there with your father both of
you having cause enough to thank neina
for your very lives have refused to help her
in her severest extremity when one word
from either would have wiped out her an-
cient enemy and- restored peace and safety
to all the satellites

nina stood in the streets with the cheer-
ing throngs as they watched the great
war ships of alius marce launch themselves
into the sky but nina did not cheer she
shared none of the faith the neinians placed


wonder stories

in those projectiles of glistening raetal and
the powerful guns that armed them

in squads of ten they went roaring from
the launching places almost unconscious-
ly she counted-one hundred a hundred
ten a hundred twenty-fewer than a hun-
dred fifty in all to face eight hundred
what a proud display they made in the
bright light of the distant sun and what a
futile one

nina hardly waited to see them out of
sight she hastened to the palace where
old alius greeted her

as i feared he would not listen he
commented

nina nodded silently he has gone to
meet the armada of pleida she declared
there was no stopping him

so i perceive

but it was not to report this self-evident
fact that i came to you again i want auth-
ority to arm the people to organize them
to command the landing places of ancienda
and the other cities we must do what we
can at once in case my guess was right and
salvarius carde chooses to come on and
land rather than to stay and fight

the old man appeared to consider
can you handle this

with your aid

old alius eyes clouded i wish that
you were my son he whispered

then you give me permission to try it
yes-but do you realize that you will
have no regular fighting men the pick
of the regiments of neina are space-fighters
and he has taken them with him for you
there is left only untrained troops-and the
mob if you can control them

and weapons

my child-there are almost none for
generations neina has done her fighting in
space we have forgotten the use of land
arms and no recent ones have been made
i will lead you to the armories if you
find anything there you can make use of-
you are welcome

nina stared in amazement at the old man
head of neinas proudest house no arms
fit for pitched battles on the satellite

but surely you have explosives

the old man nodded hesitantly i think
so he replied

then we can mine the landing field at
least and perhaps we can adapt some of
my fathers weapons for use upon land
we have only a little time-

i will give the order for secondary mob-
ilization meanwhile you may consider
yourself commander of the land armies of
neina-land armies that hardly exist that
are untrained that have no suitable wea-
pons if you can save neina with them
you shall be rewarded-whatever you may
ask

nina did not reply directly to old alius
instead she went to the windows and threw
them open looking out on the crowded
plaza

chapter vii
battle at last

the doomed satellite neina which the
men of earth before their extinction had
called ganymede had hardly completed her
revolution around the planet which occu-
pied a period of a little over seven tellur-
ian days when the huge space-fleet of
pleida met the speeding forces of the de-
fenders the little earth which always
keeps the same face toward the huge planet
it continually circles ws just coming out
of the shadow into the bright light of the
sun when the invading force simultaneously
spied its lighted continents and the gleaming
metal space-cars of alius marce

all the planet-satellite system of pleida
-a system of ten worlds of which five were
inhabited-was watching that meeting in
space knowing that upon the success of
neina in this furious struggle for freedom
dependedmore than the inhabitants of the
other satellites would have liked to admit
many by now were feeling a little ashamed
of their desertion of plucky neina in her
extremity yet it was too late to come to her
rescue even had they had the power

dolmician had wasted no time in conso-
lidating his grip upon them already his
promises of clemency and mercy had been
broken the peoples of the satellites helva
the return from jupiter



quena and luana were in a few short hoars
reduced to slavery and poverty serving the
will of the great emperor in the dark death-
ly mines both on the planets and the satel-
lites

astronomers on helva were in position to
see the space battle as from an observers
seat eagerly training their telescopes upon
the meeting place they waited with little
doubt as to the outcome perceiving the im-
mense force of salvarius carde the puny
squadron led by alius marce

he will surely lose they prophesied
despite the superiority of their weapons
the neinians can never battle successfully
with so many the whole fleet of the de-
fenders will be wiped out

no less anxiously and with the greatest
foreboding astronomers of neina also
watched and waited for the clash into the
high observation room where his father and
the tellurians had once waited for alius
marce during his returning from pleida old

-	alius again made his way accompanied by
the best scientists remaining on the sate-
llite

have you seen nina he asked them
anxiously

one shook his head not since she
sought from me the formula for trabenzine
the most powerful of our explosives

you gave her the formula

sire-it would be too dangerous to trust
such a secret in the hands of a woman
she pleaded saying that you had given her
authority but this i could not believe so i
refused

you are a fool old alius anger sud-
denly mounted to his face his eyes flamed
throughout my years i have heard it said
that women are weak unfit for authority
but today i say to you-if the fate of neina
were wholly in the hands of nina we should
be saved you have denied her the only
weapon she had to guard us with the
chemist and the others looked at him in
amazement but he offered  no explanation
instead he grasped the offending fellow by
the arm and pushed him violently for so old
a man toward the lift that would bear him

known once to telhirians as io europa and
cullisto

toward the street go find her now he
roared make what amends you can and
give her the formula

a deep silence settled on the remaining
scientists as assistants wheeled the great
telescope through its arc until the speeding
fleet of pleida came into view

we cannot stand against them mur-
mured old alius quieter suddenly marce
will be swept away like chaff and all his
space-fleet with him

the others gazed at the opposing forces
as they moved closer together across the
seemingly tiny gap that separated them in
the icy space between two worlds

they approached with what at that dis-
tance seemed a crawling pace but which
actually was faster than the fastest speed
ever before attained in interplanetary reg-
ions invader and defender alike leaped
eagerly into the battle alius marce leading
his artnada gallantly straight for the space-
car driven by salvarius carde and the center
of the oncoming horde

the pleidan leader sweeping the defend-
ers with his glass spied out the leading
craft and inwardly rejoiced when he per-
ceived that it was the flagship of the scion
of the house of allus his special enemy
there is the man who betrayed me when
he was a member of my expedition to tel-
lus he shouted his heavy jowls quivering
with pleasure now we will turn his flyer
inside out and spill him into space for it
let me give orders to the fleet

a lieutenant depressed a switch instant-
ly communication waves sprang out from
the pleidan flagship to all the others while
the hoarse croaking voice of salvarius
carde crackled in eight hundred receivers
let no ship veer for an instant from its
course until we have let the neinians pass
us and have cut them off from their own
earth then two hundred of the fleet shall
turn and fight with them while the others
including the transports go directly to the
neinian capital and land there on the public
landing ground

we will capture the satellite while a por-
tion of our fleet remain out here to grind
this upstart alius marce to dust


wonder stories

the leader of the neinian fleet was like-
wise aware of his enemys presence in
the opposing armada he saw the colors
of dolmician upon the foremost ship and
beside them- the insignia betokening salvar-
ius cardes rank

now that he could see with his own eyes
the numbers of the enemy his courage had
began to falter for a moment he debated
whether to turn back and belatedly follow
ninas suggestion attempting to fight it out
with the pleidians on the ground but he
remembered too clearly her sharp words
his pride would never let him go back now
besides he saw that it was already too late
travelling at their furious speed the gap
between the fleets was already closing it
would take a thousand miles to turn and
less than half that much lay in the open
space before the oncoming ships of salvar-
ius carde

grimly alius marce ordered his ships into
fighting line his own ahead the others dis-
played on either side in a series of echelon
formations which had been found best for
attacking another fleet head-on the fight-
ing would have to be swift in the fraction
of a second in which ships would be ac-
tually in the act of passing the thunderous
broadsides of steel-piercing projectiles
would have to be fired one shot from each
gun-there would be no time for more until
the fleet had wheeled and swung into the
circling formation that permitted extended
battle in space

the gunners took their places remem-
ber the most powerful ally we have is the
emptiness of space alius marce admon-
ished them if you can make the slightest
break in their hulls our ally will enter and
devour them it was a figure of speech
that always pleased the men it made it
seem that all nature was on their side in a
battle that was obviously unequal it was
a little speech alius marce remembered
suddenly that had been taught him by the
old man from tellus

the heavy generators were droning their
deadly song setting up the repellant wave
that the scientist from tellus had invented
to afford partial protection for the hulls
of neinas fighting ships suddenly alius

marce as if to signal his defiance to thd
enemy ordered the light to be turned on full
blast in the huge reflectors that adorned the
nose of every craft

the effect was dazzling indescribable at
first the pure white beams cut through black
space like a hundred sharp knives weaving
this way and that as if to slice a path for
the swift cars that bore them but pre-
sently the lights began to change turning
faintly green as they increased in intensity

salvarius carde from his bridge had ob-
served them from experience he knew
what to expect from this other invention of
the old man rescued from tellus avoid
those rays he commanded you can do
it by swerving sharply to the side they
cannot swing them rapidly

it was at the exact point of the balance
between the gravitational force of neina
and pleida that they met telescopes from
neina trained eagerly on them beheld the
two fleets rush together with unbelieveable
speed saw the brilliant flashes of light as
the steel-piercing guns let go their charges
saw confusion spread momentarily in the
great fleet of salvarius carde but as
quickly as they had come together the sep-
arated again alius marces armada whirl-
ing past toward pleida strugging to turn
quickly but actually describing a great aro
in space

the neinian astronomers turned their tel-
escopes upon the fleet of salvarius carde
expecting to see him also turning what
they saw instead brought groans of dismay
and exclamations of astonishment a few
ships had indeed begun to turn back but
not the body of the fleet or the transports
hardly deflected from their course at its
most perilous point by the attack the pleid-
ians were coming straight for neina-de-
fenseless neina and all her defenders were
swinging futilely through space struggling
to turn and renew the attack against an
enemy that had already outraced them for
the prize

alius marce counted the results of their
first brush with the pleidians eight ships
had been split open by the combined effort
of the ray and guns and from them had
the return from jupiter



spilled the men inside each bloated and
bursting from the pressure of the air inside
his body tkese ghastly catafalques sur-
rounded by the bodies of their former oc-
cupants which flew along like gnats fol-
lowing the general gravitational center of
the fleet were still accompanying salvarius
carde grim reminders that he had not come
off scot free in his invasion of neina

but neither had alius marce escaped
without injury in his defense of it the
pleidans having so many ships had
thought nothing of risking a few by using
them as battering rams eighteen of the
defence fleet had been battered by collisions
with enemy ships five were out of com-
mission as a result two had been split open
from stem to stern and marce too had in
his armada now the same grim reminders of
the power of space to enter and devour

as he led the wide turn that would permit
them to swing back to neina and hasten to
her belated defense on land his space-car
flashed through a tiny cloud of bodies of
his former followers it was hard to be-
lieve when he first beheld them that these
things could once have been men they
were more like small misshapen balloons
which had been blown too full and had
burst now the terrific cold of space had
seized upon them transforming them into
satellites of frozen ghastly flesh which
would if their speed were right travel for-
ever around neina like tiny moons

alius marce turned away from this re-
pulsive sight and focussed his attention on
the small fleet of ships salvarius carde had
turned back from the invading flight to en-
gage him in space he beheld that there
were enough of them to occupy him for
hours in a futile fight while the satellite
beneath him bowed down to dolmician
he cursed himself bitterly for his blindness
and false pride for his mistaken belief that
because nina was a woman she must there-
fore be wrong

salvarius carde was already well into the
series of maneuvers that checked the speed
of his fleets descent and ancienda was
trembling without hope beneath him wait-
ing for his landing

chapter viii

the invasion of neina

old alius was in the upper chamber of
the launching rooms where a scant half
dozen space-craft in fighting trim remained
into one of these with the feverish haste
of a panic-stricken old man he was loading
fuel and supplies

if there are men on neina brave enough
to face the perils of the illimitable space
with me he cried i want a crew located
at once capable of navigating interplane-
tary routes

but my lord-the hordes of dolmician
are upon us you could never launch your
ship-

that is a chance pam prepared to take
get me a crew

a crew came and was instructed but on
their aged commander they bent eyes of such
scorn that even he quailed beneath them

for two thousand revolutions of neina
around her mother planet i have ruled this
satellite he exclaimed and always i have
done it honorably will you not believe
me now when i declare that i am not run-
ning away but am seeking aid for neina
the scientists navigators mechanics of his
crew made no reply but stared at him ston-
ily or went about their work of equipping
the craft for old alius escape

word went through the ancient city that
salvarius carde had tricked alius marce
and that the pleidans would surely land and
sack the place before the space-fleet could
return this word was brought to nina as
she labored with her defenses at the public
landing place a messenger came to her
from the observation room where alius
marces defeat had been witnessed

i have foretold this event she declared
but with the aid of the neinian people will
may yet save the satellite and her capital
crowds had already begun to gather in
the principal thoroughfares among them
she went her hair flying long her eyes blaz-
ing zeal for neina and fury for the slowness
and terror of her people i call upon you
for help against the enemy she cried


wonder stories

who will volunfeer to attack them when
i give the signal

but you are a woman someone shouted
i am a woman nina answered without
hesitation and if the men of neina are
afraid to follow me let them run and hide
i call upon the women of neina to take up
knives axes clubs staves goads-anything
that may come to hand and lie behind those
bulwarks i have erected on every side of the
public landing grounds neina can be
saved if her people will arouse themselves
her words were like magic a thousand
women whose centuries of training had
taught them to think themselves inferior
suddenly came forward and offered to help
her elated she made a new appeal di-
recting them exhorting them presently the
men also began arming themselves the
waiting places behind the hasty barracks
began to fill while the glistening ships of
salvarius carde now plainly visible in the
thin blue air came ever closer seeming
to hover over the city ready for the land-
ing

nina went from breastwork to breast-
work heartening her new recruits instruct-
ing them in the use of the weapons they
had succeeded in picking up admonishing
them reproving them i will give the
signal she said do not move or betray
your presence until you hear the thunder
of the signal i shall give it will be un-
mistakable

as she rounded the last corner and made
to cross the square toward the tower where
she had intended to take up observation
another messenger stopped her he brought
his message verbally

old alius he declared is fleeing for
his life leaving the rest of us to perish at
the hands of the pleidans

you are a fool she exclaimed thrust-
ing him aside i dont believe it

but you must believe it see- he
pointed toward the topmost launching place
and she saw that there was indeed a fever
of activity there even as she gazed the last
of the crew entered old alius ship the
heavy doors clanged shut were bolted from
inside fire flew from the huge projectiles
rear it moved began to rush up the

launching-incline gained momentum flashed
into launching speed and was gone in a
trail of flame straight out into nothing-
ness it went away from pleida and the other
satellites

there said the messenger almost tri-
umphantly i told you he was going

nina wracked by countless emotions
seized new control of herself say noth-
ing she commanded hoarsely and come
with me

together they made their way across the
square and entered the observation tower
while the first car of the fleet of salvarius
carde hastening its descent came crash-
ing upon the main public landing place
followed by half a hundred transports bear-
ing armed soldiers of pleida

nina watching wondered if her rabble
of defenders would lose their courage
and desert at the frightful spectacle of enemy
ships settling upon their own landing
ground or whether-an even worse contin-
gency-they might become so frenzied with
hate or fear that they would begin the at-
tack before she gave the order a hush
heavy with portent had fallen upon the en-
tire city except for the clamor of the ar-
riving enemy ships the satellite would have
seemed dead and filled with echoes citi-
zens who had not joined the defenders in
the barricades had fled to the open coun-
try or were hiding in their homes

salvarius carde peered carefully through
the heavy windows of his ship taking in
the situation frankly puzzled where were
the people of this cold and disagreeable
little world who had been known fbr their
meekness had they all run away

the disagreeable lack of gravity of the
smaller earth which he had not visited for
many years disturbed him he felt his
insecurity of control over his muscular ac-
tivities and wondered for an instant how
this might effect his followers it was clear
to him at the moment of landing that some-
thing unusual was indicated by the actions
of the neinians it might be that they had
actually under the tutelage of the tellur-
ians they were reputed to have brought
the return from jupiter



among them from a dying distant world
gained new courage to defend themselves

a lieutenant following the plan of action
laid out during the flight from pleida
moved to open the space-cars door a signal
for the general debarkation of all the troops
brought from the planet but salvarius
carde assailed by doubt stopped him

wait he said we will give them a
little taste of our medicine first in case they
should be planning anything

he gave the signal the fighting ships
drawn toward the outer parts of the field
like destroyers protecting the relatively de-
fenseless transports within suddenly let go
a tremendous blast of fire like a sheet of
devastation it went crackling out on every
side over the top of the hastily constructed
breastworks and into the buildings that
lined the area

the flame ate away stone as if it had
been butter cutting into the metal skeletons
beneath two buildings obelisks of mighty
proportions came tumbling down like piles
of matchwood crushing to fearful death
thousands of persons who had been crouch-
ing out of sight behind a battlement on
the northern side the building in which
nina crouched with the trembling messen-
ger swayed began to go she felt that the
end had come when as suddenly as it had
begun the pouring streams of flame sub-
sided

eagerly she looked out again she was
proud at that moment of the new-found
courage of the people of neina like rab-
bits they may have been for generations but
despite the terrific tragedy they had wit-
nessed with their own eyes despite the hot
rain that had passed for searing minutes a
few feet over their heads they had held
their ground had remained concealed

now satisfied salvarius carde had tri-
umphantly ordered the debarkation of his
troops the heavy door of the flagship
swung open with a furious clang a pole
rose up above the ship and on it waved the
colors of dolmician the heavy transports
began to disgorge their occupants amid the
clatter of military movement the rumble of
heavy armament the blast of horns signal-
ling assembly

the woman from tellus her hands tremb-
ling crept along the sill of the window
through which she was watching these pre-
parations to subjugate the satellite slowly
while the eyes of the messenger protruded
with astonishment and dread her slim white
fingers made whiter than nature by the
excitement under which they acted sought
a small ebony button

they reached it hesitated nina saw
that virtually all of the soldiers had left
their transports the debarkation was com-
plete in another few minutes a general
sacking of the helpless city would begin
the fingers on the button ceased their tremb-
ling grew firm suddenly with great ener-
gy they pressed the button sank into the
wood

outside as if a volcano had suddenly
opened up beneath the square the earth
leaped skyward

hastily awkwardly but with great effect
the entire landing field had been mined
now upon the detonation the great empty
spaceships of dolmician and the troops he
had sent to subdue a satellite too valuable
to ignore and too vigorous to oppress by
peaceful means were caught in the blast
and hurled about like ants into whose
mounded home a mad bull has plowed his
head

captured

nina hardly waited to note the effect
of her coup shouting to the messen-
ger to follow she seized a long sword that
she had found somewhere among the half-
forgotten museums of neina and hastening
to the street found herself surrounded by
her adopted people

from all sides of the landing field a great
shout went up the embattled citizens of
neina started their attack winging their
way into the air as well as from the ground
with such unbridled fury they fell upon
the foe that salvarius carde having himself
escaped the blast by what appeared a mir-
acle would have sworn that his soldiers
had been set upon by the fierce people of
helva rather than neinians

bugles hastily blew formations summon-

what was the world without name overcrowded with horrors
who would invade our fair earth

the room was vast and cavernous oc-
casional electric lights gleaming here
and there in it fought off the encroaching
darkness magnifying its gloomy corners
and the shadows among the cobwebbed
wooden girders of the roof

in the dim light there appeared in vague
relief a titanic metal monster sprawling all
along one side of the room on the floor and
uprearing its disordered ungainly shape
halfway up the wall-twisted tortured

masses of tubing wires and coils that sug-
gested somehow the vitals of a mechanical
giant

a maze of dials switches and gauges re-
vealed the switchboard control of the mon-
ster and near it stood a long low table
covered with green billiard cloth and light-
ed by a single electric light bulb suspended
above it seven men were seated there all
staring at a square of paper beneath the
light on which was a mound of ashes such

the

as might have fallen to the floor of a crema-
tor when a corpse is consumed in it

seven pairs of eyes stared at the ashes
with mingled awe curiosity and loathing
in the silence that gripped the place a si-
lence disturbed only by the booming rumble
of thunder in the rainswept night outside
and the rattle of falling raindrops on the
roof overhead one of the men coughed
as the acid-laden air bit his throat he
turned toward the open window nearby
through which swept occasional gusts of
fresh damp air

the eighth man a lanky powerful indi-
vidual whose clothes seemed too small and
tight for him stood at the end of the table
he seemed uneasy and afraid his glance
darted from one face to another then un-
willingly came back to the mound of ashes
presently he resumed his story

i dont know whether steinhilde was
crazy or not i didnt know him very well
-no one around here did-but i reckon i

knew him better than the rest that was
because  dropped in pretty often and kid-
ded him about all this machinery asked
him what he was up to anyway he never
talked very much but sometimes he would
shift those big shoulders of his slow-like
and answer oh thats my radio and then
laugh at me with never a sound

at first i thought he was kidding me
whoever heard of a radio set that half-filled
a small factory building and had tubes as
big as boiling vats and as many gears and
wheels as a threshing machine i thought
this must be a laboratory of some kind
once i even got all excited because i decided
he must be making artificial diamonds like
you read about in stories finally i pes-
tered him so much to find out if this actually
was a radio that he showed me

 if you dont think that is what it is
just listen he said and turned to the switch-
board

in a few seconds there was a roaring

his eyes were on a vast rolling slab which stood in
the center of the floor on this slab lay two figures




wonder stories

humming sound up there among the mach-
inery in the gloom which ended when wjz
broke through with a roar of music i
nearly fell off my chair there was almost
no static or interference it was that per-
fect steinhilde watched me out of the cor-
ner of his eye and laughed without any
sound

 oh shell do all right he said pat-
ting the dial shes the
best entertainer w e
have josef and i

a fter that i

f  came back often
-got so id hang
around every night af-
ter work to hear bands
and orchestras that
seemed to be right here
in the room with us
and singers that might
have been perched up
there in the machinery
somewhere the ap-
plause at the end of
the numbers was like
the roar of the sea and
the announcer had a
voice like a giant that
boomed in our ears

sometimes stein-
hilde operated the
machine and some-
times his assistant jos-
ef a little dried-up old
fellow who hardly ever
talken and then only in
broken english b e-
tween puffs on his big
black pipe but they
never offered to let me
operate the thing

then one day both of them were all ex-
cited about something and didnt pay any at-
tention to me steinhilde smoked cigarets
one after another and josef tramped about
the room here like a caged animal with his
kindly face set and his pipe cold and emp-
ty clenched between his teeth two or three
days afterward josef wasnt here i found
steinhilde with his eyes glowing like coals

sitting here at this table when i canrfj in

where is josef i asked more to make
talk than anything else

 oh hes away on a journey he replied
he says hell be back soon im sorry but
i can have no music for you tonight im
too busy some other time

i dont know what made me feel uneasy
but i tell you i was glad to get out of the
building the whole
thing began to look
funny to me so funny
in fact that i didnt
come back till tonight
i wouldnt have come
then but steinhilde
called me on the phone
all excited and fairly
begged me to final-
ly i decided to come

steinhilde met me
at the door and
brought me to the light
beside the table here
he scared me bad-
not his face although
that was grim enough
but what he wore about
his waist he had
buckled a belt with a
holster on each side
and in each holster was
a revolver thrust
through the front was
a long shiny knife
and from the right side
hung three things that
looked like old-fash-
ioned potato mashers
if he noticed me star-
ing at them he didnt
pay any attention but
only said

 white you are the only man i know
well enough to trust just now you are
about to witness something that no one else
except myself has ever looked upon im
going to step into that big ball there and
disappear do not be alarmed ill come
back i just want you to see that nothing
is tampered with while im gone 

the others at the table turned to stare at

fur new author makes
his bow to our readers 
with this thrilling story of
an unknown alien world
faced with disaster we see
man rising to the occasion
supreme and triumphant

mistakes as he tries to peer
into the unknown he is
often like a child exploring
a strange unknown mechan-

if he does make a mistake
by walking where angels

pay the price of his folly

suppose tfiat our fair

any of us give up our lives

the ball white indicated it was a huge
metal globe with a mass of wires curling up
and away from it like hairs from a human
head the interior seen through a square
opening large enough to admit an upright
man proved to be a perfectly spherical
room as though the outside of the ball was
only a crust of metal and was lined with
white finely laminated substance like plat-
inum beside the square opening was a
switchboard with labelled universal switch
in the center and a host of dials and knob
controls

i was pretty scared and didnt say a
word white continued hurriedly the
lightning and thunder outside  didnt help
any either without an-
other word steinhilde
stepped into the ball
reached out to the switch-
board and twisted a knob

great tubes back up there
in the machinery lighted
up with a red glow that
flickered on the walls like
the light of a burning
building shining through
the windows while i
stared at him steinhilde
disappeared he went
out just kind of like a
match flame before a puff
of air i just went on
staring at the empty
space pretty soon ashes
began to float down
through the air out of nowhere to settle on
the floor of the ball

white paused mopped his face desper-
ately and stared about the ring of faces like
a hunted animal fearing to detect there dis-
belief there was none  presently one of
the men glanced up

what did you do then he asked

white gulped then went eagerly on

i-i didnt know what to do did you
ever see a man cremated like that before
your very eyes i never had ive lived
rough ive stood up in the ring to some
good ones and ive been in mob fights
where mens heads were busted like eggs
once i saw a man knifed to death in a speak-

easy but i never saw anything like this be-
fore

i was about scared to death here i
was alone in the building maybe the po-
lice you fellows would think i did it at
first i pretty near ran away then i got
hold of myself and sat down to think i
decided id better call the cops and thats
what i did

only the sound of the raindrops rattling
on the roof above followed the coroner
turned to the police sergeant and conversed
with him in a low whisper then turned to a
detective

what do you think about it smith
plain case of suicide declared the det-
ective the old boy
was nuts over this radio
stuff and cremated him-
self probably bumped
off his assistant josef the
same way this stein-
hilde ought to have work-
ed for an undertaker
those are my views
too agreed the coroner
there is nothing more
we can do however one
of the men had better
watch the place tonight
he added with a meaning
nod at white who was
slumped down in his
chair and before we
leave we might as well
shut off the power and
save somebody some money

he arose went to the switchboard and
pulled the universal switch immediately
the hum of the concealed powerful motors
ceased the others arose buttoned their
coats about them and left the room leaving
behind the detective who had been assigned
to watch the building he drew a chair up
before the door sat down and leaned back
the tragic mound of ashes had been taken
by tlje coroner

white sat dejectedly in his chair he
had not been accused of the death of

wonder stories

steinhilde nor arrested yet he was aware
that he was under suspicion he realized
that the detective had not been assigned to
watch the building but to watch himself
he reviewed in his mind again the details

it was not more than twenty minutes ago
that steinhilde had stood here before him
talking and now he was dead and white
was under suspicion for killing him as he
tried to analyze his feelings further white
found that he was vaguely uneasy from
some cause apart from that suspicion he
felt that he had left undone something he
should have done or had betrayed some-
thing he shouldnt have

he sprang to his feet and paced restlessly
up and down the room pausing finally be-
fore the battered desk at which he had often
seen steinhilde working it was cluttered
with papers covered with algebraic figures
and copies of several scientific magazines
at the back of the desk against the wall was
a collection of scientific volumes white
glanced at them carelessly and was about to
turn away when he noticed a small thin red
book wedged in between two thick tomes
bearing german titles he drew it out and
turned its pages idly stared suddenly at
the reading matter in amazement then hur-
ried back to the light unnoticed by the det-
ective who was nodding in his chair white
opened the volume and began to read fever-
ishly

june -we have proved that the trans-
mission of matter by the electronic disturb-
ance set up by atomic disintegration is en-
tirely feasible josef is so delighted he can
scarcely talk our efforts of more than a
decade are about to be rewarded weather
conditions were ideal today although i be-
lieve they will have no effect on the pheno-
menon so we set up our miniature electronic
sets in either end of the building shortly af-
ter midnight and by smashing the atoms of
hydrogen succeeded in transmitting a pint
of water from one to the other the water
disappeared from the sending set and came
out of the receiving set as steam success
is close

white skipped several pages devoted to
code and mathematical formulas before he

came to another entry he grinned sheep-
ishly as he read it

josef is still chuckling about my simple
plan of installing an ordinary radio re-
ceiving sot with the speaker concealed up
in the machinery of the atom disintegrator
and passing off the whole machine as a
monstrous radio set white obviously be-
lieves that is what we have and so does our
landlady well brighter minds than theirg
have been fooled by simpler devices

july -we have now finished our first
big electronic set with its tremendous power
hook-up it stands fifteen feet high and is
both a transmitter and a receiver there is
a peculiar circumstance connected with it
as soon as we put it into operation as a
receiver mysterious sounds began to eman-
ate from it josef was fascinated he lis-
tened to it all morning and copied down a
number of what he thinks are messages
he believes he is on the trail of something
big but i think he is merely listening to
some sort of static it seems to buzz out
the letters a a a o u k a a a o u k over
and over again if the sounds come from
some station the letter combination must
bo its call letter josef points out that stat-
ic doesnt usually repeat itself in that fash-
ion he may be right

july -josef has a friend in washing-
ton who is a code expert josef is going
to send him the messages he has copied and
see what lutk he has with them if they
are of human origin and have a meaning
he can decipher them

august -real success his time we
transmitted a brick from one little electron
set to the other and it came out flawless
tried a kitten next it wralked out of the
receiving set in a dazed sort of way jos-
ef was so enthusiastic he sent the little ani-
mal through the process again it seemed
none the worse for the experience the
transmission was instantaneous even the
slightest nerve impulse in motion at the time
is transmitted with the matter

we also hooked the little set with the
big one and found both reception and send-
ing of the big set perfect it was an easy
matter to perfect it after we solved the mys-
tery of the laminated inner surface
the world without name



lt hat a war weapon we have discov-
 v ered our imaginations are stag-
gered by its stupendous possibilities an
army appears within the enemys gates
transmitted there instantaneously thousands
of miles across oceans mountains deserts
and cities as fast as armed men can march
in and out of the sending and receivingets
all existing methods of transportation ex-
cept for pleasure pass into history with
the primitive ox cart scow and pack ani-
mals distance vanishes hongkong lon-
don san francisco buenos aires hono-
lulu capetown and sydney will be but an
instant the fractional part of a second
away from each other

august -josef received his messages
back from washington with an alphabet
key his friend the code expert says they
were the hardest proposition he has ever
tackled only through the merest chance
the fundamental fact that all human under-
standing is based on a few universal traits
did he stumble on to their solution then
had to call on a linguist for ideas about
translating them into english even so only
a part could be made out one message
may furnish a clue to the identity of the
station although nothing in the european
press dispatches indicates that the polish
armies are in the field at this time here
if the message 

the pole army is hard pressed near
the big pass warning of a possible
water shortage is given by diamoude

i	can make nothing of it

josef has an idea that may bear fruit
he is going to write the english translations
for the messages if he can establish com-
munication with this a a a o u k and will
send first the original message and then
the translation which will give the senders
a that place a basis for communication with
us if they can understand the idea i hope
this entire affair will not prove to be a hoax

august -after twelve hours of unre-
mitting effort during which josef sat in
front of our electronic set using it in the
sending phase and working with a loud
improvised buzzer he finally got in touch
with this mysterious station tonight we
were swamped with messages in code at

first then a babel of voices and strange
words poured out of our set in a torrent of
sound josef finally broke through with
the buzzer and started sending his prepared
messages of the originals and the transla-
tions when he ended absolute silence fol-
lowed we are now waiting

august -our discovery it is un-
believable i shall not write down the
identity of the place a a a o u k here
lest this little volume should fall into strange
hands and i might be suspected of insan-
ity-more so than i already am i mean
when i have enough proof i shall set it all
down in these pages and then announce it
all to the world but until then the secret
of our great find must not go beyond josef
and myself however i will say that com-
munication between us and aaaouk
has been established on the basis of the
english translation josef sent them i am
fascinated i cannot work further just now
on the big electronic set we are planning to
send to washington

no additional entry had been made in
the book for nearly two weeks apparently
for the next page was dated september 
and bore the following notation

joseph is determined to go to
aaaouk their device for transmit-
ting matter is obviously the same as ours
although i dont keep it synchronized with
them for that-only enough to carry on
communication they have an intelligence
that is almost genius for they have learned
to use english

however we proved that we could trans-
mit matter by sending them our kitten and
they in turn sent us a fish a queer flabby
gaseous specimen which nearly died before
we discovered that it needed salt water in-
stead of fresh water to live in it is cer-
tain we could send a human being

they have promised us a most interest-
ing visit if we will go to see them some-
how i am filled with misgivings over the
prospect but josef is wild to go his na-
ture is too generous and trustful to have
any suspicions of individuals of their intel-
lect and accomplishments they have pro-
mised to keep him constantly in touch with
me and he like an overgrown boy that he

is can see nothing but the holiday part of
it everything might be all right but i am
afraid i dont know why

september -josef finally overcame my
objections and went today i believe he
would have been sick if i had not given my
permission i turned the knob for him
while he stood in the set smiling eagerly
all dressed up with his old battered travel-
ling bag in his hand against his will i
made him take a revolver he is such a
trusting old soul i know he wont carry it
after he arrives but will leave it under his
pillow or on the dresser or whatever kind
of furniture they use at a a a  u k i
saw him standing there in the globe smiling
then he was gone-vanished like a shadow

in the world without name

reat was my relief when i talked

jt with him for fifteen minutes after he
arrived then he went out to see the city
we talked again when he came back he is
enjoying himself hugely i could tell that
from his voice and laughter but never-
theless i wish he was back here with- me

i	cant shake off that presentiment of evil
tomorrow i shall throw myself into the de-
layed construction of that big electronic set
for washington maybe that will relieve
my feelings and in addition will surprise
josef when he comes back god grant that
he may

september -i knew it i knew it
great heavens what can i do josef got
word to me this morning in german a lan-
guage they dont understand although they
doubtless would master in almost no time

 for the love of god and humanity
kamerad dont let even one of these hellish
creatures through our set he jerked out
the words they thirst yearn crave and
demand that i send them through the set
they will do anything to get through if
one of them succeeds in getting through our
set he will do as much damage as ten thous-
and and the ten thousand will follow him-
and ten hundred thousand more after
what i have seen here it would be far bet-
ter that both of us were dead and our set
destroyed with its secret rather than have

that happen they may torture me into
saying yes but dont listen for i will mean
no i am watching for my chance to get
back to you but they wont let me near the
set now

september -i killed their fish today
dismembered it threw it into the sewer
drain i dont trust even a fish from
a a a o u k josef says our kitten can
jump ten or fifteen feet into the air when it
is frightened and is kept on display before
the crowds in the public square they are
becoming more suspicious of josef for not
ordering me to let them through i fear for
him sending that kitten to them was bad
luck-very bad-i know now

september -i can stand it no longer
for two days i have listened to josefs cries
and groans under torture before their elect-
ronic set to my pleadings for them to
stop they repeat that they will continue until
he is dead or until i let them come through
from their seething over-crowded world
tonight at seven they start again-burning
away his skin and flesh with white hot irons
this time i cannot let them go through
with it

	my worker my friend i shall rescue
him or die in the attempt i have my re-
volvers and several hand grenades saved
from the war my plans are carefully laid
when they have him before the set i shall
quickly tune in ours to synchronize exactly
and act i shall step out of their way be-
fore they know what is happening and
clear the room before they can recover
themselves i shall be back here with josef

i have worked out the plan thoroughly
ill call white over to guard the building
and machinery in case we might be delayed
ill set the automatic timer so that our set
changes from a sender to a receiver an in-
stant after i am gone

it is a desperate mission and i may
never return from it i should perhaps
explain what a a a  u k is i know
positively now but before i write it down
here i want to-

white broke off his reading in abrupt
horror the current that operated the set
had been cut off by the coroner when he
pulled the universal switch before leaving
the world without name



the building steinhilde had no chance to
escape back to the safety of the building
and after he white had promised to see
that nothing was touched or disturbed he
threw down the volume and cursed then
he leaped to his feet

there was still a chance steinhilde
might even now be praying that the set
would start functioning white leaped for
the switchboard and halted with his hand
on the universal switch

suppose something strange something
fiendish leaped out of the big ball white
shot a glance at the detective snoring in his
chair and crept toward him from the
armpit holster he gently removed the heavy
automatic pistol then leaped back to the
switchboard and threw in the switch the
motors hummed to life and the big tubes
glowed white poised grimly before the
r narrow door of the big ball there broke
on his ears with a rush the sound of tramp-
ling thudding feet a blur of strange words
and the screaming of a man the voice was
steinhildes he was shouting something
shouting it desperately

ach gott white white i see the set
coming to life smash it smash it
they are starting through gott in him-
mel it is too late

the scream ended in a sob white
scarcely knew what he did vaguely he
saw his hand flash to the knob he had seen
steinhilde turn and he plunged feet first
into the ball there was a sensation of a
violent upward surge as though he was car-
ried by a powerful elevator then he collided
violently with someone he staggered but
kept his feet as the individual he bumped
into was hurled backward out of a door-
way two other men tall thin and gro-
tesquely clad towered over him on either
side in a flash he grasped the situation

he was in the electronic set at
aaaouk into which the three enemies
of steinhilde had already hurried white
hooked an arm about each one and lunged
forward through the opening taking them
with him

they shot out out onto a wide marble
platform or dais a strange monstrous

half naked yellow giant who was standing
there leaning on an immense sword gaped at
him in astonishment then he whirled up
the broad blade savagely and charged
crack whites automatic stabbed redly at
him the giant stumbled and collapsed
his nine feet of pale yellow body rolling-
down the broad marble steps to the floor
twelve feet below

another yellow giant was closing in from
the other side with sword upraised white
had no time to use his gun he dodged in-
side the sword stroke and caught the guard
a terrific left in the solar plexus that lifted
him clear of the floor and hurled him down
the stairs

one of the long skinny men whom white
had rushed out of the ball was worming his
way back toward the opening white dove
for him his frantic fingers gripped a skin-
ny ankle a savage jerk whites eyes
widened in amazement the long body
seemed curiously light as it shot out above
the steps and crashed down to the marble
floor well clear of the bottom step

white whirled about sparring the plat-
form was empty except for the sprawled-
out figure of the man he had collided with
in the ball white took in his surroundings
at a glance

chapter iii
the torture chamber

he stood on a hundred-foot wide plat-
form at the end of a vast marble hall
the ceiling of which towered a hundred feet
above him a ceiling painted elaborately
with strange scenes the walls were grand-
ly and beautifully sculptured with weird
beasts and distorted buildings and people
along the foot of both side walls were shin-
ing whirling machines switchboards
squirming tentacles of heavily insulated
wires

he scarcely noted it all his eyes were
on a vast rolling slab much like an over-
grown operating table which stood in the
center of the floor not more than thirty feet
from him on this slab lay two figures
one was steinhilde bound and helpless but


wonder stories



struggling desperately to free himself the
other was the pitiful wreck of an old man
mercifully unconscious his naked body giv-
ing mute hideous testimony of the torture
he had endured above the table were
grouped tall mummy-faced men in strange
costumes staring in stupefied wonder at the
intruder on the platform

one of the kilted figures shook his head
angrily to throw off the astonishment that
gripped him he started to aim a long
shining rod at white again the automa-
tic pistol barked the skinny man folded
over and crashed to the floor the rod clat-
tering down beside him

white white get them steinhildes
voice was wild with sudden frantic hope
dont run for them jump

white leaped savagely his big power-
ful body left the floor like a rocket curving
over in a gentle arc that brought him crash-
ing into the group the impact bowled
them over like ten pins there was a ter-
rific flash and roar as the end of the fallen
shining rod exploded one luckless man
who had stumbled into its path dissolved in
a puff of smoke and was no more

left right left right whites heavy
fists battered them like trip hammers he
felt his victims brittle bones crack and
smash beneath his knuckles he bored in
harder unmindful of the feeble jabs rained
on him in return

abruptly he found himself standing alone
and gasping his fists red with blood the
tall men lay about him on the floor some
oddly still and others squirming in pain
three survivors were streaking it for the
doorway two hundred feet away whites
pistol leaped into view its bark echoed
back from the high ceiling as the trio
dodged to safety through the vast doorway

quick free me steinhildes voice was
still frantic let josef alone i can car-
-ry him hurry hurry theyll be back
with a whole company of guards and blast
us into nothing you took them by sur-
prise once but you cant again hurry
maybe i can reach that big door and
shut it grunted white struggling with the
wires that bound the scientist itd give us
more time

no no their death rods would cut
through these marble walls like a hot knife
through a lump of butter grab that sword
off the platform and cut these wires
whites pocket knife was already out its
keen blade ripped through the bonds that
held steinhildes ankles and wrists he
rolled off the slab to the floor fell and
struggled to his feet again with a mighty
heave he threw josefs limp form over his
shoulder and staggered toward the marble
steps

suddenly there burst through the door-
way the ominous sound of a distant moblike
roar the red flaming rage voiced by an en-
raged crowd the escaping trio were sum-
moning help a thrill of fear prickled
whites spine he turned and dashed after
steinhilde glanced back over his shoulder
and gasped

fantastic and grotesque as the whole
affair had been he could scarcely be-
lieve his eyes now through the doorway
leaped a huge strange monster that padded
swiftly across the marble floor toward him
the thing was much like a great anthropoid
ape with a nearly human face but instead
of a single pair of legs it had two pairs
squat and powerful that propelled it smooth-
ly and swiftly along it stood ten feet high
with a barrel-like body huge bulging
shoulders and six-foot arms a single pair
that swung ape-like by its sides the head
was flat and sloping with little wicked
eyes and a huge fanged mouth the body
was covered with red woolly hair

white jerked up the automatic and took
a snap shot at the thing yet quick as he
had been the moyster was quicker it
leaped sideways as the gun barked and land-
ed twelve feet away steinhilde feebly near-
ing the top of the steps with his unconscious
burden twisted his head about at the shot

vacari he gasped sort of a glad-
iator specially bred for the games for at
least thirty generations josef says this
one is from the kings bodyguard sent
ahead to hold us were lost now

white set his jaw grimly

just go ahead he growled fall into
the ball ill stop this nightmare
the world without name



the thing had dropped down to a crouch-
ing position with its knuckles resting on the
floor and its legs doubled for the leap
white measured the distance it was near-
ly sixty feet the thing was watching stein-
hilde and his snails progress as a cat watch-
es a mouse feebly the scientist crawled
over the top step and approached the ball
a foot two feet abruptly the thing
leaped up it shot from the floor forty feet
into the air whites pistol barked twice
both shots missed the darting body down
it came with a heavy thud almost upon him
a long hairy arm whipped round him pin-
ning his hands helpless against his sides
and nearly crushed the breath from his
body

he was lifted off the floor and the thing
ran nimbly up the steps and wrapped its
other arm round the frantic screaming stein-
hilde and unconscious josef then holding
all three of them helpless it braced itself
with squat legs spread wide apart and
laughed a hoarse coughing rumble of a
sound

whites stomach revolted as the fetid
stinking breath of the thing fanned his face
try as he would he could not wriggle an
inch to free his gun hand he paused to
listen

the ominous roar of the mob outside was
swelling it filled the vast marble hall and
beat on their ears steinhildes eyes sought
whites in hopeless anguish they were a
scant twelve feet fromthe doorway of the
ball and safety yet were as powerless to
move as though gripped in a vise obvious-
ly they were to be kept for torture and
death and this thing that held them would
be rewarded with a special carcass for din-
ner and a new wife for capturing them
white turned his eyes again toward the dis-
tant doorway

the roar was still growing hundreds of
people must be rushing in to the kill he
stared in fascination suddenly there
popped through the doorway a small black
ball bounding along fifteen feet in the air
at a bounce he watched it fearfully then
ogled in astonishment the ball was only
a small terrified black kitten leaping
spitting clawing in terror to escape the

roar of the approaching mob onto the
rolling slab it sprang then shot up into the
air

down it came down down straight on-
to the head of the vacari landing with a
flurry of clawing feet as it strove to keep
its balance

the thing roared in startled fright drop-
ped its captives and started slapping with
both hands at the kitten vaguely white
saw the vast doorway fill with running fig-
ures he whipped up the pistol against the
side of the thing and pressed the trigger
twice then leaped over to pull his two com-
panions out of the way of the falling mon-
ster	

swiftly he ran with one after the other
to the ball and threw them in then
turned to look for the kitten it had sprung
from the head of the now dying threshing
vacari to the top of the ball and was mew-
ing there in terror white never hesitated
rather would he die than sacrifice the little
animal now

he looked down at the howling racing
mob the leaders had struck aside two
death rods aimed at him they wanted to
save the ball from destruction white
leaped upward along the curved side of the
set his hands closed about the frightened
kitten as his feet struck the floor again
he thrust it into his pocket

the mob was rushing up the steps now
one veritable living skeleton was several
steps ahead of the rest he was brandish-
ing a sword white caught his descending
arm snapped the wrist and hurled the lanky
bcdy into the faces of the others then
leaped into the ball

again the powerful upward surge be-
fore him was a narrow doorway he leaped
through it stumbled and fell at the sudden
heaviness of his body he twisted about
and hurled the pistol into the tangled mass
of wires entering the top of the set there
followed a blinding flash as they short cir-
cuited with a crackling roar something
hit white on the head

wheres my gat you--

corporal bob henley of the inter-
planetary flying police came out of
the deadly grip of the arylian croup with
the suddenness which marks a favorable
turn of this disease often fatal to terres-
trials and known only on the strange little
planet aryl

private chuck emsinger roasting the
thigh of an unwary
leaf lizard over a crude
rock hearth heard the
premonitory rumble of
henleys chest and
hastened to the weed
pallet in the corner of
the cave turning his
superior on his chest
he belabored his back
heartily driving out
the thick green phlegm
from the bronchial
tubes his crude first-
aid efforts were effec-
tive a few minutes
later corporal henley
lay on his back again
weak but without fever
looking around with
clear eyes

feel better chuck
asked solicitously

yeah how
longve  been sick

chuck took his ser-
vice manual out of his
pocket and thumbed
the pages

never mind t h e
arylian time how
many days standard
terrestrial

about eight days

corporal

henley cursed softly that means cap-
tain jnirvo and his gang will be at the oth-
er end of the solar system by now

no i dont think so i figure nirvo
thinks were dead you know a fellow
cant see fai on this lousy planet just af-
ter he shot us down he disappeared in a mir-
age well we probably disappeared about
the same time

yeah and again we might have looked
as big as a mountain to him till we crashed
nope he didnt follow us and make
sure hed finished us did he knowing
him like i do i can only figure that we
passed out of sight

oh say henley exclaimed sitting up
with some effort the juetnecar was it
completely wrecked
chuck went back to
his roast and turned
the other side to the
fire before answering

well yes and no
he said judiciously
we came down exact-
ly on the edge of a -
foot cliff the moss
was about fifteen feet
thick and we ploughed
through that from lop
to bottom id say it
was an easy landing
but you was too goofy
by that time to know
the difference 
this is my first
trip to aryl henley
half apologized for his
sickness it sure got
me the minute we
opened the ports but
about the motors-can
they be fixed

we-ell now maybe
they can be fixed if
we had a machine shop
or two one of their
chemical rays happen-
ed to get inside the af-
ter nozzle it ripped
off all the plates
blew up the ether com-
pressor tanks-a few little things like that
henley groaned cut me off a slice of
that meal and let me enjoy my misery
his request complied with he ate his meal
with relish for his powerful body was

the hollowness of his cheeks while the dark

--this story the strange
deeds of brave men upon a
strange world the story
stands out for its intensely
vivid descriptions of the
plant and animal life upon
this world this planet closer
to the sun than mercury

the great eccentricity as
well as the perturbations in
the orbit of mercury have
for some time led astrono-
mers to believe that there
may be a planet between it
and the sun but it is pos-
sible that if there were one
its nearness to the sun might
leave it perpetually in the
suns glare and therefore
not to be seen from the
earth

our author has a differ-
ent and even more ingenious
reason why such a planet
has not yet been detected
but aside from the science
wonders of this story
which are many we have the
heart-breaking struggles of
two buddies on this hostile
world but they succeed in
their mission and mr starzl
brings the story to a sudden
smashing finish

curly hair of his finely moulded head fall-
ing over his white temples and forehead
emphasized the hollowness of his deep
brown eyes now moody over their setback

the capture of captain nirvo the daring
interplanetary pirate would have been a
feat to create a sensation even in the hard-
bitten ranks of the interplanetary flying
police although young in years that or-
ganization had already established its pres-
tige to the outer limits of the solar system
and the mere presence of one or two of its
members was usually enough to insure or-
der and guarantee the safety of life and pro-
perty in the most isolated and lonely colon-
ies along the space lanes the operations
of captain nirvo a cun-
ning and highly educated
eurasian were a direct
and not-t o-b e-ignored
challenge which had been
promptly taken up

but the wily pirate al-
ways eluded the traps set
for him more than one
f the tiny juetnecars the
standard two-man ships
used by the i f p failed
to return while outrage
after outrage made com-
merce between the inner
group almost impossible
unless strongly convoyed

corporal henley and
chuck had been close to
success they had trailed
nirvos great fighting cruiser to this most
sunward planet had almost located his hid-
den harbor when a freak of the highly re-
fractive atmosphere had disclosed them to
the pirates there had followed a short
sharp fight a sickening plunge to the still
nearly unexplored surface of aryl

at any rate they were still alive shelter-
ed from wild beasts had a fire to cook
with and the outside chance which is all
that the i f p asks of fate

you saved the ionic projector henley
usked at length

yeah i dismounted it and stowed it
away

how about the hand weapons

i left em in the ship

you didnt by any chance leave that
round head of yours in the ship did you
henley inquired politely

i left the hand weapons in the ship be-
cause when nirvo got our motors all of our
power cells went out the hole in the wall
chuck explained without rancor but i
brought the inductor compass

	useless the atmospheric currents
under the electronic bombardment from the
sun will be much stronger than the ground
polarity and variable

uh-huh chuck agreed and you cant
even see the stars and sun this here aryl
is sure the back alley of
creation

worse pass me over
another hunk of that
roast henley tenta-
tively put his feet on the
caves rocky floor the
flickering light of the
fungoid fuel threw his
shoulders grotesquely on
the vaulted roof as he
staggered to a boulder
near the fire

they munched hard-
tack and meat pausing to
throw stones at the in-
quisitive long-snouted
rabbit-roaches that per-
sisted in blundering into
the flames strange in
their cave-dwelling lives and filling the air
with the pungent odor of burnt hair

so it comes to this henley mused aloud
after a long silence were here without
weapons without food or ship on nirvos
base planet no cliance of being found in
time by our own gang

nope and we need lots of things and
theres only one way to get em

ill bite where

get em from nirvo

im laughing henley remarked grimly
well thats just what well have to do
the mouth of the cave utterly dark a lit-
tle while ago showed strongly increasing
light and the chill breezes which had been

puffing in occasionally were replaced by
currents of hot dry air as the un-homogen-
eous atmosphere tide-torn and swirling
changed its consistency it was almost equal
to quartz in its light-refracting ability so
that all vistas were constantly swaying dis-
solving changing their shapes

chuck kicked another fungus log into the
fire

 s getting a little hot now but we want
to keep the fire handy im going out to
the ship and see what i can salvage his
heavy boots rasping he strode out

he had hardly emerged into the light
when he noticed a small bird hovering over-
head as he strode along the valley floor
the bird followed him and he studied with
interest the long needle-fine horn forward-
pointing from its head its short fleshy wings
practically devoid of feathers yet adequate
in that atmosphere

as he watched the bird suddenly spread
out until it was of enormous size fully
seventy feet from wing-tip to wing-tip
plunging downward at him it emitted a rau-
cous scream its great claw-shaped ten-toed
feet spread out its bill at least ten feet
long and lined with countless ragged teeth
gaped open like an avalanche it plunged
at him

chuck realized that he had been tricked
by refraction with lightning speed for
one of his weight he dived into the cliff
moss a few feet away burrowed deeper and
deeper into the tough interlacing network
of vegetation until at last he felt the rough
stone fragments of the talus under his fin-
gers

once something hard and slender and
needle-sharp like a giant poniard passed
through the sleeve of his uniform rubbing
smoothly against his arm there were lit-
tle dry clicks all around him as the bird
probed for him witlrits unicorn-like spear
its head forced eagerly into the moss then
it gave up those tactics and rending the
moss with its strong claws burrowed after
its prey

chuck knew what the convulsive move-
ments of the tough vegetative covering
meant no doubt the bird was possessed of
a keen scent and was following his trail

under the mose the frightful cries now
changing to a triumphant gobble came clos-
er in the darkness chuck could not see a
thing but once he heard the clashing of the
toothed bill close to his side he kicked
viclently had the satisfaction of landing on
something solidly and in the ensuing hub-
bub found a new avenue of escape

fleeing along the lines of least resistance
he retreated along the face of the cliff and
in his irregular course discovered that he
was going up a fault in the rock wall he
hoped the cleft would gradually converge
until the vast body of the bird could no
longer follow him

the bird renewed its efforts tearing along
by main force so that the entire thick brown
mat was in a state of agitation fleeing
with utmost speed from a nearly successful
charge chuck brought up against a wall
with a sinking sensation he realized that
he was trapped the cleft had come to an
end but it was still several feet wide-wide
enough no doubt for the bird to reach in
and pull him out

preceded by a puff of sickish sweet odor
the bird crushed its way in the horny
hooked bill clicking noisily brushed his
shoulder

with a shout of despair and defiance
chuck plunged ahead blindly his arms
closed around a thick leathery neck as big
around as a barrel and slippery with an
evil-smelling oil winding his feet among
the short feathers he hung on for dear life
hung on while the gargantuan body threshed
in a frenzy of anger clung to his hold
though he was battered and bruised deaf-
ened by the uproar choked by the odor
which among its other faults was rancid
great claws raked vainly for him and
then he was smashed against the rock as
he lapsed into unconsciousness he caught a
whiff of smoke

the end of a monster

henley considerably refreshed by the
food the first he had eaten since his
arrival on aryl walked to the mouth of the
cavern and looked after his companions
sturdy form as he trudged toward the cliff


wonder stories

where a furrow in its thick vegetation mat-
ting disclosed the presence of the juetne-
car he saw the seemingly harmless little
bird burgeon out into giant proportions it
would have been a simple matter to dis-
patch the bird with one of the twin ionizer
hand projectors but in his present unarmed
state the i f p corporal stood for a mo-
ment rooted helplessly

he saw chuckdash into the moss and
start his frantic burrowing for safety then
he went into action himself he seized a
spongy blazing brand out of the fire ran
as fast as he dared on his as yet uncertain
legs to the spot where both man and bird
had disappeared now marked by rising
clouds of dust with all his strength he
threw his torch into the midst of the tur-
moil

the tough moss caught fire slowly but
the charred area with its encircling green
flames spread steadily

it was then that he heard the triumphant
gobble of the bird-the despairing cry of
chuck sickened he sank to the ground

after a few moments the bird started to
squawk hoarsely the heat was reaching
its body its violent efforts to escape shook
the whole tangled fabric covering the cliffs
face it was all burning now and throwing
out sparks and wisps of burning fibers
alighting elsewhere on the vegetable cur-
tain these started new centers of charred
blackness spreading behind widening circles
of green fire long lazy curls of green
smothered in brown smoke reached tenta-
tively climbed slowly up the cliff

under the burning moss blanket the birds
efforts to escape became more violent and
its shrieks deafening out of the sky ap-
pearing as out of nothingness a mate to the
first bird plunged down the wind soughing
strongly through its stubby feathers it
hurled itself straight for the body of the
man sitting on the valley floor but when
it passed through the first faint wisp of
brown smoke still two hundred feet up it
wheeled sharply climbed with amazing
speed and in a few seconds was lost in the
opalescent sky

with a violent lurch the bird tried to
throw off its flaming covering weakened

by the fire and torn loose from its cup-
ended roots a section of the moss curtain
was torn off about fifty feet up the cliff
collapsed upon itself rolled down the talus
slope the bird hopelessly enmeshed in
the long woody fibres rolled with it held
helpless as in a winding sheet

with a shout of joy henley staggered to
his feet he crawled up the slope and found
chucks body about where he expected still
untouched by the fire a long ragged gash
in his scalp seemed to be his only injury
bits of burning vegetation were dropping all
around and at any moment another section
of the cliff curtain might fall amid a
small avalanche of rocks and a scurrying
horde of white rock beetles he dragged his
friend to safety

the bird had ceased its struggles sat-
urated with its own body oil the gigantic
corpse was blazing brightly as the sky
was darkening again swiftly the light from
the great pyre was opportune the moss
fire continued its inexorable advance a
breeze had sprung up and under its influ-
ence the cliff line for miles was a glow of
green light strangely distorted mimicking
giant serpents waterfalls castles of baleful
light

if i go to hell as some people think i
ought henley remarked to himself itll
look something like that

the small water generator at his belt held
a few ounces of the liquid in combination
with a catalytic which had preempted it
from the air turning a thumbscrew he
freed the water ice-cold and chemically
pure and dashed it over chucks face so
strangely gray under its tan chuck
gasped let out a round curse and nearly
brought his heavy fist against henleys face
before he realized where he was he sat
up dizzily

so thats that i sure thought i was a
goner this time you dont happen to have
a little slug of mars-ti on you do you

you know thats against regulations
henley rebuked him then he laughed
guess i could do with a few drops of it

a malted drink originating on mar called
by the police officials tlnotine and abbreviated
by the men to mars-ti
the terrors of aryl



myself he conceded but its only for ex-
treme emergencies a change in the wind
brought the smoke of the burning bird to
them purged by the fire it had an ap-
petizing savor

im hungry again henley said they
tell me a fellow shouldnt eat so often after
the croup or itll kill him but if i dont
eat ill starve so whats the difference
have some but go easy chuck advised
feeling gingerly of his clotted head me
im going to have a bit of him just for re-
venge

they raked the glowing embers apart with
the gnarled brittle limbs of the so-called
mineral oak disclosing the flesh of the
monster delicately browned hanging on the
huge framework of its skeleton they
feasted each according to his capacity for
they did not know when they would eat meat
again if at all

see that spear on top of his skull cor-
poral henley pointed a dripping finger as
soon as it gets cool im going to have that
the hell you are this bird pretty near
spitted me with that i picked it out for
myself then

well henley rejoined comfortably i
rank you dont i whats the use of my
stripes if i cant rank you out of a spear
take off your stripes and ill fight you
for it chuck suggested

naw i dont want to fight grab one
of the thigh-bones burn one end off grind
it smooth on the rocks and youll have a
dandy club youll get all the fighting you
want before we get through

the discipline of the i f p is strong
regardless of the informality in the relations
of its members chuck selected a bone for
his club and they returned to their cavern
in complete amity the bewildering re-
fractive changes of the atmosphere had
brought on complete darkness again and
with it a chill not noticeably allayed by the
moss fire writhing in long wavering lines
high above their heads

seated once more before the blazing fun-
gus logs they talked things over the ship
was lost irreparably now a twisted mass of
wreckage somewhere in the black ashes but
there was always the possibility of stealing

nirvos ship-a desperate remedy for a des-
perate situation although they had no way
of knowing where the pirate landed his ship
had followed the line of cliffs it was not
unreasonable to suppose that by traveling
along the valley in the direction they had
seen the pirate cruiser go they might even-
tually come upon his headquarters after
that-

 but i f p men rarely trouble themselves
about future difficulties they concern
themselves with the immediate so after
piling their fire high with fuel to discourage
visiting carnivores they slept peacefully the
next nine hours

chapter ii
the battle of the tripod

lately the perihelion excursions have
made the peculiar and terrifying atmos-
pheric conditions of aryl familiar to thous-
ands of terrestrials but in  this strange
planet whirling dizzily around the sun in-
side the orbit of mercury was practically
unexplored its dense envelope of gases
allotropic forms of elements known on
earth are distinguished by their enormous
light-refracting powers-so great in fact
that they bend the light and radiant heat of
the sun half-way around the planet making
it practically invisible from earth this
same property however saves all living
matter on the planet from instant destruc-
tion by the suns heat	i

when henley and chuck started down the
valley in their forlorn-hope quest the sun
was astronomically speaking directly over-
head at the moment it was however en-
tirely invisible and a deep twilight reigned
in the valley the sky toward the southern
horizon sometimes black sometimes opal-
escent darting with prismatic colors striat-
ed or suffused with deep purple blushes
gave the only illumination there was

they had hardly been walking for half an
hour however when a monstrous lenticular
swelling bloomed up overhead bending
downward some of the fierce heat rays and
compelled them to seek the shelter of a great
rock fragment this passed and was fol-

lowed by a fierce rainstorm of short dura-
tion which deluged them with pungent
smelling lukewarm water then came
blackness and silence

they stumbled on and on guiding their
steps by the faint loom of the rocky ram-
parts against a faint green radiance that
tinged the eastern sky this vanished
abruptly and then springing into existence
against the velvet black screen of the after-
noon sky came mirages of breath-taking
beauty piled seemingly ten miles high
mountain on mountain burst out of the dark-
ness abruptly with just a suggestion of the
faint unsteady rocking motion that distin-
guishes the unreal from the real shimmer-
ing in all the colors of the rainbow of
loveliness supernal they illuminated the
valley with gliostly radiance they might
have been cumulus clouds so effortlessly
were they poised they might have been mol-
ten metal so heavy they looked and so metal-
lic they gleamed

well ive seen the mirages of the sah-
ara and ive seen better than that on mars
but this has em all batty henley exclaim-
ed with real admiration

wish theyd give a little more light
chuck complained practically ive bust-
ed my shins on every rock weve come to
since we started by the way whats that
clattering noise back of us anyway

been hearing it myself henley said
we passed the burnt section back there a
couple of miles where the dry wash cut the
cliff suppose its some of the things that
live around here

yeah what kind of things

what do you care theyre not both-
ering us

the slithering and clattering kept up
the officers kept going clumsily while the
mirages played and changed coldly after
some minutes chuck said uneasily

if i was you id get that spear handy
them things are coming closer

they are and i have was henleys
terse reply

there was no question about it they
could be seen now there were glimpses
of long stilt-like legs of round gray bod-
ies of fragile looking triple bamboo-pole

arms one of them stood on a boulder some
fifty yards ahead of them-stood still and
refused to move

holy smoke chuck gasped its a tri-
pod

it was standing on three many-jointed
legs with an odd air of ease and uncon-
cern it looked disquietingly assured and
competent

if they start anything crack some of
their knees

chuck grasped his club more firmly
what knees never mind ill crack
something

despite themselves they slowed down
when they came within twenty-five feet of
the creature the three-legged thing stood
poised

it chose that moment to leap

light as thistledown it seemed to float
through the air but when the spherical body
struck henley it knocked him dow-n and al-
most crushed him flat the frail-looking
btick-like arms became pliable coiled around
him with the strength of steel bands he
grasped a leg-it was warm and furry-
and twisted the creature emitted a shrill
whistle-apparently a cry of pain-and
henley twisted more the leg came off in
his hands

but those relentless arms refused to un-
coil and quickly the creatures purpose be-
came manifest the blunt ends of the arms
fingerless gristly began to press into his
diaphragm henley tensed his muscles and
the probing tentacle end pressed more
strongly insistently he had not yet recov-
ered all his strength and every time he tried
to ease the agony of his bursting lungs the
coils drew tighter the probe pressed harder
into his yielding flesh soon he must be
ripped open torn to pieces by the monster

chuck saw henley go down and had a
glimpse of cottony puffs converging on them
on all sides over the rocky wastes he
heard the clatter of the corporals needle-
pointed spear and then the nearest of the
round bodies floated toward him in a grace-
ful arc he ducked and in a mighty back-
hand swing he brought up his thigh-bone
club it connected with a solid thud the
the terrors of aryl



round body fell bounced rolled away amid
whipping appendages

set em up in the other alley he shout-
ed gleefully

he heard a groan from henley another
ball floated toward him he dodged that
entirely pounded his heel into the firm
round body on top of his superior smashed
the tentacle which promptly whipped around
his leg on his own shin cursed warmly
knocked down a couple of more of his
strange adversaries

good of club im batting a thousand
another furry ball rebounded and fell amid
threshing limbs

keep clear of em and well fight em
off henley wheezed at his side lunging
with the late birds spear and withdrawing
it with difficulty covered with a sticky am-
ber fluid

thats a fine thing for you to say
chuck retorted where the particularly
described blazes do these things have their
heads

never mind hit anything you see

three of the bodies launched themselves
at once henley impaled one and
couldnt get his weapon out of the wound
chuck knocked another down but the third
with lightning rapidity threw its tentacles
about them drawing them together until
chucks bullet head was jammed painfully
into henleys throat a questing tentacle
end slid over their bodies looking for a soft
place

it slipped past chucks chin ugh he
snapped at it with his teeth-clamped his
rock-crushing molars on it-gagged-bit
harder it was as tough as rubber sinewy-
of a damp earthy flavor and odor another
of the woolly bodies bumped into them-
more coiling arms sought for purchase
henleys arms went around the body hard
unyielding like thin papier mache shells
filled with pulp he pulled at the wool
searched for an opening at last he found
something a moist gelatinous nodule the
size of a mans fist he raked at it with
clawing fingers it burst in his hand and
the creature dropped dead

what was that he gasped its
brain

ugh from chuck

henley could not find the vulnerable
spot of their other antagonist but he began
twisting the warm wooly legs almost doub-
led up as they were to get down to their
level they came off with little dry pops
formed a weird tangle on the ground the
struggling men carrying the weight of the
tentacled body tripped and fell it struck
a rock cracked like a pumpkin

fooey what a smell henley pick-
ed up his spear pulling it with difficulty
out of the tough shell the heat and light
of day were swiftly returning the sky
from horizon to horizon was bright with a
silvery sheen shallow and sinister the
tripod-animals or such of them as had re-
covered from chucks club blows had slunk
away leaving their dead on the field

his face gray chuck was undeniably sick
bob he gulped if you love me youll
give me a dose of your medicinal mars-ti
hanged if i dont henley growled if
i lose my stripes suppose ill have to fill
out seventy-seven apology forms when i get
back to headquarters he handed over a
small flat flask breaking the official seal
chuck tipped it to his lips savoring the
taste as he let it run down his throat a drop
at a time	

just how much dye think is a dose
henley inquired caustically shaking the few
remaining drops in the bottom of the flask
rather than put a stopper on such a small
quantity he drank it himself throwing the
flask away

oh why is a hen chuck inquired ir-
relevantly and happily he picked up his
club lets push on

the weird perspectives of aryl were con-
stantly changing magnifying and minimi-
zing everything seen making distant objects
seem near and near objects seem distant
they conjured up non-existing lakes in the
valley bottom or standing at sharp angles in
the sky they crekted rock barriers across
their path that melted as they walked
through them or the illusion of clear
flat plains that resolved themselves eventual-
ly into tumbled seas of volcanic rocks glass-

disappeared to be replaced by a shimmer-
ing outrageous parody of the sky then
they could only wait until the kaleidoscopic
meteorological changes should bring them
back into view again

henleys belt chronometer showed that
ten terrestrial hours had passed in the
brief day of aryl it was now midnight but
the light refracted from the day side was
stronger than ever and the heat was oppres-
sive

they were chronically short of water and
longed for another of the tempestuous show-
ers of rain which though unpalatable could
quench thirst henley was weak from hun-
ger and so when they encountered one of
the arylian sludges an animal resembling
a very dull and heavy antelope with great
flat shovel-edged horns chuck stalked it pa-
tiently for half an hour just as he was
about to leap out of the shelter of a rock
to deliver the fatal stroke it vanished into
thin air but the officer walked ahead to
where he had last seen it lunged with hen-
leys spear there was a strangled cough
and the dying sludge fell at his feet

guided by his calls for chuck himself
had vanished henley clambered over the
rocks they made a fire of the drooping
thick-leaved vegetation in the seed-cycle
which they found nearby and attacked the
rather tough meat supplemented with hard-
tack and vitamin tablets they abandoned
the remains of the sludge to the insistent
-inch needle flies that lurk everywhere on
aryl

better take along one of his horns hen-
ley suggested itll make a first-rate bat-
tle axe

chuck grinned this little ol club is good
enough for me let em come is all i
ay

the monster of the flood

they withdrew into the shelter of the
branches of a gnarled old tree which for
the want of a better name has been called

the spike-cypress its long thorns lacerated
their skins reduced to still more pictures-
que rags their bright red service uniforms
at the same time its dense boughs were the
only shelter available against the great car-
nivores whose trails they had encountered
several times and also guarded them
against the unicorn birds should any come
that way with their short-bladed service
knives they hacked away enough of the
thorns to allow themselves comfortable rest-
ing places and looking up through a dense
network of drab spiny leafless small
branches at the iridescent sky they fell
asleep

henley who always slept with his mouth
open snoring abominably dreamed that he
was being drowned in a sulphurous ocean
he sat up with a startled jerk spat out a
mouthful of warm acrid water flinched as
the heavens split open with a dazzling violet
band no iridescent skies now but a black
unfathomable abyss that spewed its noisome
water at them in sheets in large blobs of
dirty brown and black thunder of stun-
ning violence equalled only on venus shook
the air

what the differentiated profanity   
chuck awoke to the comparative silence fol-
lowing the thunderclap

henley cleared his throat with a final
cough

looks like rain he remarked mildly

cr-a-a-a-a-sh another blinding in-
terplay of titanic forces over their heads
so brief and intense were the flashes that
they left impressed on the retinas of the
two men frozen pictures of gnarled limbs
motionless in gemlike sheathings of water

hey bob

-	what

c-r-a-a-a-sh

a moments pause until the echoes rolled
back

bob howd you like to be inside the
world series ball park right now
inside hell id be glad to be out-
side of it

the interplay of lightning became more
frequent lacing the blackness so it seemed
only a few feet over their heads with rib-
bons and loops of lethal fire the wind
the terrors of aryl



rising soon blew a gale screaming raggedly
through the tossing spiny branches etched at
hectic intervals jewel-like in dazzling light
presently a new sound intruded itself-the
rushing of a stream the surf-roar of storm
waters as they poured down the valley in an

	ever-increasing flood

other sounds too could be heard in the
intervals between the thunder-grunts roars
screams strange shapes nightmarish
shapes drifted past limned against brown
dirty foamy water in the lightnings glare-
gone by the next flash enormous outrag-
eous shapes plated armored horrid with
spiny growths rolled in the current caught
on snags for a moment drifted on

bob chuck shouted into the corporals
ear are you sure that mars-ti wjk govern-
ment stuff

sure henley shouted back sure its
government stuff i see em myself
okay chuck roared much relieved
id hate to see them things if it wasnt
the water had reached the lowest branch-
es and presently swimming things-well-
eels araboids sleek mottled sandrats driv-
en out of their dank underground run-
ways tried to climb in a few succeeded
but the most of them transfixed by the mer-
ciless thorns dropped off again and were
swept away

henley looked down at the squirming
bodies spat in distaste

fine company for a couple of gentle-
men  

but the hullabaloo of the thunder com-
pressed his words swept them away

something parted the water fitfully re-
vealed something with a broad shiny back
at least fifty feet long and thirty feet wide
something with an enormous domed head at
the top of which was a shuttered bony hood
it came with the current but not helpless-
ly directing its course purposefully with
quick sturdy strokes of its legs or paddles
a broad blunt snout parted the thorny
branches-parted them as easily and as cas-
ually as a lady parts lace curtains the
tree shook as the snout struck the trunk
and several of the smaller fugitives fell into

horrid means set with many points not
horrible

the water or were pierced by the spines and
died the newcomer seemed to be resting
the hood opened revealing a single hexa-
gonal eye that stared up into the tree fish-
ily

the two men had secured good holds in
anticipation of the shock and retained their
places they watched the monster anxious-
ly in the flickering light it did not seem
to be particularly pugnacious but it was of
a species they had never even heard of and
they were willing to give themselves the
benefit of the doubt

th wind died down and after long hours
the rain and electrical storm traveled away
muttering over the cliffs up the valley the
darkness gave way to streamers of elfin
light suggestive of the aurora borealis in-
tensified a thousand times

looking in any direction the prisoners
of the flood could see an illimitable
expanse of embroiled waters-water that
flowed swiftly over hidden snags-water
that dashed furiously over huge stones that
obstructed its mad career water seemed
to be dashing and foaming to the very hori-
zon probably a mirage but this knowledge
was a scanty source of comfort the flood
carried on its muddy bosom the carcasses of
thousands of its victims-mostly the small-
er animals for the larger ones-except for
the comparative few that had been trapped
in the gorges at the beginning of the flood-
had escaped

the water was rising and the enigmatic
armored beast with it

as if becoming aware of its opportunities
the animals single eye moved in little jerky
steps almost as if it had clicked into place
at each new position it surveyed the
branches among which it rested and the
small animals withdrew uneasily sudden-
ly a vertical crack appeared in the vast head
starting below the snout and disappearing in
the water

great suffocated coltoids henley ex-
claimed its mouth runs up and down

which was the truth instead of the usual
horizontally working jaw familiar to all zoo-
logists this creatures jaws flexed sideways
opening on a vertical line


wonder stories

it opened about six feet and its tongue
flashed so rapidly that the eye could hard-
ly follow it the long round corrugated ton-
gue flicked out enveloped one of the small
animals heedless of the thorns it crashed
through slid back between the jaws which
closed immediately they opened again
and the tongue poised came out a few feet

in quick succession all of the living things
on the lower branches were licked up while
the animals that had died were contemp-
tuously rejected the single eye clicked
speculatively upward

shifting its enormous bulk the beast tried
to raise its head the tongue quested
straight up falling short of their perch by a
scant two feet again and again it tried
and each time henley stabbed at it with his
needle-sharp avian lance the weapon
glanced off harmlessly and only for its ex-
ceeding toughness would have been shat-
tered the shock of the impact nearly
threw henley down

it was evident that the water was rising
fast for the lower branches that had shelter-
ed the recent small fugitives were now cov-
ered chuck staring down suggested

our only chance is to put out its eye
let me have the spear

henley shook his head no chance
youd be picked off long before you got near
enough

wham the tongue irritably threshing
at their legs had struck a lower branch
breaking it off

our only chance the corporal decid-
ed is to jump and swim for it he said
it lightly knowing well that that was no
chance at all on all sides they were hem-
med in by a maze of thorns set on slender
branches nor could they go any higher
for their perch was already as high as the
strength of the tree would bear the only
way out was down close to the trunk the
way they had come up for here was the
only secure footing and the thorns were less
numerous that way was barred by the
monster

another wall of water the contribution
of some tributary valley raised the flood to
a new crest rising with the water the
beast rubbed its horny snout six inches

higher on the trunk the two men stood up

say bob

yeah blistering remarks about the
thorns

bob you always liked those amber gal-
lopers of mine

you mean the ones you swiped from
me

the ones i rolled you for and won

yep the ones you gypped me out of
sure i liked em

well ive thought it over dont ex-
pect to need em where im going so here
they are

henley glanced at the elegant spotted
cubes in his big palm stuck them into his
pocket

that ieminds me he drawled i never
paid you the buck you won from me the time
we played jaw-bone at the deimos station
he handed over a small crinkled metallic
strip the new interplanetary currency

thanks chuck smiled

 so the men of the i f p jest in the face
of death

the rough tongue whipped at their feet
it scraped the glassy bark off the limbs they
stood on

well chuck henley remarked quietly
it wont be long now waters still going
up

chuck took his hand pressed it firmly

count on me to give him indigestion

you will henley unbuttoned a pock-
et of his soggy uniform removing a small
metal cylinder he took out a thin shiny
scroll and a stylus-prepared to make his
last report the cylinder was capped with
a radio-active substance and later when
searching parties looked for them the radio-
activity would be detected by delicate in-
struments and lead to the prompt recovery

over the falls

a shout from chuck interrupted the
report bearing down upon them with
terrific speed its long tangled roots whip-
ping through the water like innumerable
snakes was a gigantic tree torn from the
soil at some place far up the valley many
trees had passed them some close by but
this was the biggest of them all its rough
scaly bark ran incessantly with water that
was thrown up by the cross-waves its
crown had been broken off nothing remain-
ing of the upper part of the trunk but long
saffron splinters but the trunk itself fully
 feet thick and  feet long was unbrok-
en hurtling toward them an irresistible na-
tural ram

it struck their beleaguerer squarely in the
back forced the animal under ground it to
bits it tore the spiked cypress out of the
ground shearing its massive roots with the
ease of a knife cutting butter the officers
barely had time to scramble down receiv-
ing some ugly thorn slashes they fell into
the water seized the wiry roots of the great
tree which had not even paused in its thund-
erous course climbed to safety at -last
there were plenty of rifts in the craggy
bark to cling to so they were in no great
danger of being thrown off

but their crude weapons were gone once
again they faced the savage life of aryl
with practically nothing but their bare
hands

the water was carrying them along with
a speed of about fifteen miles an hour and
gradually there was a change in the sur-
roundings readily seen in a rare period of
atmospheric stability the air was clear
suffused with a brilliant greenish-yellow
light which distinguished objects with hair-
sharp definition the tossing storm waters
began to run with a deeper smoother rhy-
thm banks appeared distantly on either side

profusely covered with lush vegetation ut-
terly different from that seen in the relative-
ly sterile rocklands they had quitted

it was evident that the flood had dis-
charged into a large deep river which car-
ried them more silently but still more swift-
ly to some mysterious destination the
water slowly changed from a muddy brown
to a deep transparent purple due no doubt
to minerals in solution the cliffs coming
out of the watery mirage receded more and
more until they faded out in the hazy dis-
tance

henley sat on one of the enormous warts
which studded the tree trunk his ragged
uniform was scattered around him steaming
for the heat was again appreciable he was
his old rugged self again a young man
whose long muscles flowed under his hide
like a panthers for hours he had lolled
there soaking up the rich actinic rays which
had given his skin a healthy ruddy glow
he looked fit and was fit again

equally as naked the short heavy body
of chuck lay between two bark humps
chuck was taking his sleep while henley
watched henley rose walked over and
prodded the steadily rising and falling ribs

everybody out old timer he yelped
cheerily

chuck got up hey i only been sleep-
ing about five minutes

argue with the clock-dont chew the fat
with me henley slumped into the vacat-
ed hollow with a contented sigh

going to get on some clothes before i
start peeling chuck sorted out his rags
where the indigo blazes are we anyway
search me henley threw his forearm
over his eyes who cares were going
the way we want to and dont have to walk
yeah were going all right but how
dye know its the right way

now why bring that up henley
dropped off to sleep

it was almost pleasant there on the gently
heaving bosom of the racing purple river
there was life aplenty on all sides of them
and under them the bodies of the drowned
victims and those still feebly swimming had
been snatched down long ago by long mos-
sy jaws set with serrated rows of four-inch


wonder stories

purple-stained teeth on the shore great
lumpy herbivores munched the fleshy tree-
tops by the ton often there was stark
swift tragedy when packs of oulets tawny
embodiments of destruction flashed down
from nearby stem-palms ripping off yards
of the stiff gray hides actually burying
themselves in the still living carcases of
their victims

often one or more of the oulets which
would have made a sabre-toothed tiger seem
like a purring kitten by comparison were
crushed and killed by the clumsy attempts
of the vegetarians to escape but more often
they dragged down their prey to the accom-
paniment of cascading hideous yowls which
frightened even the big tree-leeches so that
they dropped helplessly to the rotting jungle
floor

life is cheap on aryl-cheap and abun-
dant

chuck had stood about three hours of
his watch when he become aware of a
low roar-a beating sinister diapason under-
lying and dominating the myriad jungle
noises all the way from the hoarse coughs of
ground-shaking monsters to the intense shrill
obligato of the insects which swarmed over
the nearby marshes sometimes it was an
actual sound that could be perceived by hu-
man ears-again but the mere consciousness
of its existence he waited another half
hour hesitating to awaken henley who he
knew had really stood more than a fair
share of the watch it is one thing to
grouse over a disagreeable duty but some-
thing else again quite outside the code of the
i f p to let your comrade carry part of
your load

at last however chuck did not dare to
delay longer he shook henley

sorry old fellow but i think were com-
ing to a waterfall

henley sat up diagnosed the sound in an
instant

it is he looked at the shore slip-
ping by at growing speed we better get
off here without delay

over there chuck inquired as the
flashing hide of a jumping oulet showed for
an instant

wel-ell no hardly they foamed

past a barren rock outcropping in mid-
stream more of those ahead could we
make em

ill try anything once

henley grasped a root leaned out hold-
ing his tattered coat near the water it was
promptly snatched out of his hand by an
enormous swift-water clam anchored to bed-
rock against the tugging current by a long
ligament the clam submerged with its
bright red trophy and henley scrambled into
his underwear

well ride the falls he decided get
into one of the bark channels and hang on
for life

he squeezed into a narrow crevice barely
big enough to hold him bracing his elbows
and knees the slight overhang of the bark
made his position fairly secure chuck did
the same close by

the noise of the falls was overwhelming
the river ahead as much of it as they could
see from their cramped positions was cover-
ed with a veil of mist the trees became a
heliotrope blur in the next instant they
were aware of a feeling of lightness of ex-
hilaration the fall seemed to last min-
utes though in reality it was only a few sec-
onds then the tree struck the water

it was like riding a great ship down-
hardly any sense of shock as the butt struck
the water though roots were stripped off
and bark cracked majestically the enor-
mous trunk plunged into a deep pool shoot-
ing far under a jagged overhang of water-
worn rock a full quarter of a mile from the
falls like an arrow aimed slantwise there
it jammed into a crevice from which it could
not release itself

as soon as he felt the shock henley struck
out into the water he wanted to get away
before the commotion of the great trees ar-
rival had ceased to distract the attention of
the always hungry water denizens who would
surely be inhabiting the pool he swam
with long powerful upward strokes strain-
ing his smarting eyes for the purplish glow
of the surface although the water pres-
sure soon diminished appreciably there was
only cimmerian blackness

henley had been under water over a min-
the terrors of aryl



nte and needed air badly what a miser-
able end it would be to drown like a rat
now he was whirled around in a sudden
eddy-the wake of a fish evidently he
was not yet discovered or he would not have
survived that incident

although he was in utter darkness henley
instinctively swam upward there was no
time to lose now if the overhanging rock
ledge did not leave room for air it would
be just too bad his lungs ached and he
had to exhale a little air

his upstretched hand struck something
hard and slippery-the rock roof his
head followed until it too struck the rock
water lapped at his eyes by bending his
head backward and floating henley was
able to breathe here the darkness was re-
lieved by a very faint purple glow but no
welcome streak of light showed in any di-
rection therefore the rock must dip deep-
ly into the water on the pool side he might
be able to dive under that as the log had
dipped under and carried him in-if he
only knew in which direction the pool lay

by following the slight upward slope of
the roof henley gradually found room to
swim in normally and a few more strokes
brought him to a sizeable cavern by cau-
tiously swimming around he found a place
where he could crawl out he rested on a
rock clad only in his trunks and hob-nailed
shoes his undress did not inconvenience
him for it was warm in a moment now
he would dive and try to find chuck it
was sure hell the way the service ate up
good men

he heard a scraping sound in the inky
blackness back of him it made his scalp
prickle first the scraping then a pause
then the scraping coming nearer-the
sound of heavy breathing henley stared
hoping to see glowing eyes which would dis-
close the position of his new enemy very
cautiously he crouched looked around for
a loose rock

the silence was shattered by a roar

hey corporal where the undoubtedly
condemned heck are you

chuck you lousy skunk where did
you come from bursting with gladness
henley stumbled over to him barking his

shins he hugged chuck and pounded him

	ow lay off chuck howled i got
here about the same way you did i guess
pretty near drowned at that and feel all
busted up

chuck i feel a little draft suppose
theres a way out of this

yeh it comes from a crack back a lit-
tle ways seems to lead up gradual

at headquarters

the rock they were imprisoned in was
a form of limestone and in past ages
when the river was higher it had been thor-
oughly honeycombed by the solvent action
of the water after trying several blind
leads they at last found a main channel and
for many hours they groped blindly through
galleries vast underground halls barely
passable cracks having lost all sense of
direction they tried to travel always on as-
cending grades on the theory that this would
biing them eventually to the source of the
long dried-up ancient tributary to the big
river which had made these tunnels once
they stopped in a dry warm crevice to sleep

howd you like to sink your teeth into a
steak about two inches thick smothered in
onions chuck voiced his wistful thought

henley growled one more crack like
that and youll be a casualty

they must have traversed at least ten
miles which took them  hours when they
discerned a faint light on the roof ahead
joyfully they rushed forward

the light came from a crack in the floor
they could hear the murmur of voices but
could not understand a word it was evi-
dent that there was a lighted room under
their feet the floor was about eight feet
thick at that point and the crack wide
enough at the top seemed barely a quarter
inch wide at the bottom

henley crawled down bracing his el-
bows and legs to get a glimpse of the room
he found that the crack was really in a thin
shell of plaster with which the larger cleft
in the rock had been patched it appeared
to be strong and he rested his hands on it
while chuck lying on his chest held his
ankles


wonder stories

without warning the plaster cracked and
henley dropped through chuck sagged
but held  henleys sweaty face appeared
in the strong light

let go and save yourself thats or-
ders he shouted

orders be frizzled chuck held on more
tightly

but his slippery resting place was not
equal to the occasion under their com-
bined weight he slipped off followed hen-
ley through the crack landing asprawl on
the floor both were shaken up dazzled
by the light but not really hurt

blinking they looked about them they
were in a long room obviously once a part
of the cave system but now squared up and
leveled with concrete at the further end
was a barred door and at the ceiling near
the center was a powerful light tube

about thirty feet away at one end of the
room was a group of about fifteen women
richly dressed in the fashionable clinging
metallic robes of the day more revealing
by accentuation than practically no clothing
at all it would be hard to say who was
the more astonished but some of the wo-
men gave evidence of approaching hysteria

a girl of about  wearing the blue robe
of a space ship radio operator detached
herself from the others she advanced a
few steps and scrutinized them carefully
she was about medium height slender
dark-haired violet-eyed a fillet of metallic
lace slightly bedraggled held her hair in
place her provocative features were puz-
zled but showed no trace of fear chuck
and henley stared at her and at last the
latter gasped

sally what the-what you doing
here

why-it isnt bob henley is it
sure dont you know me dont you
remember the time i rode in your ship on
the neptune course

oh bob she ran impulsively and
kissed him

hey chuck interposed he aint even
decent do you kiss me

of course you lovely brush-faced
tramps chuck closed his eyes blissfully
it seems so good to see some of the old

gang in a moment she said reall
you ought to get some clothes

ive been wondering henley agreed
where i could get some he looked spec-
ulatively at a rather stout woman in the
group that still stared at them stupidly i
take it this is a prison

nirvos place sally said briefly hold-
ing us for ransom the last batch was
ransomed about a month ago

how about the men

a shadow crossed her face

dead they started a fight

yeah both of the officers eyes were
slits some of the missing ships crews had
betlh friends of theirs

yes dead they didnt have a chance
all right henley snapped now
about the layout here any guards around
some electrical alarms outside the door
i guess guards bring us our meals
how many guards

two but theyre armed

only two chuck flexed his muscles
in savage anticipation

all right henley said i want that
fat ladys robe get her into the corner
and screen her if you like but get me the
robe

the fat woman started to scream at
once but her friends overjoyed at the
prospect of escape overwhelmed her
stripped her of her expensive garment and
left her furious with only a maze of rubber
supporting bands and a blanket to shield
her dignity henley wrapped the robe about
his tall frame throwing a burnished stream-
er over his face like a veil motioning to
chuck to stand close to the wall beside the
door he waited

the fat womans screams served a useful
purpose two bored guards with scanty
beards on their chins and cheeks who wore
the yellow pea-jacket uniforms of the pi-
rate unbarred the door and entered their
projectors were carelessly holstered

henley stepped out approaching them
swiftly they looked at his ungainly form
with amusement realizing too late that
this was no woman but two hundred pounds
of decidedly male battle and bloodshed
the terrors of aryl



s

henley caught the nearest with a blow to
the jaw that slammed him against the wall
chuck growling brought his muscular
forearm down on the neck of the other kill-
ing him almost at once

they dashed into the hall hfcnleys robe
fluttering sally with one glance at the
fainting women stooped and took a short
thin sword from the scabbard on the dead
guards body henley saw her following

get back he hissed

get on she hissed back its nip and
tuck now

somewhere muffled by many feet of rock
and concrete a siren was shrieking in
some manner they had set off the alarm
they came to the end of the passage warned
by a sixth sense henley stopped them he
lay down on the floor and carefully peered
around the corner he saw a nirvo guard
with a projector leveled at the place where
they could be expected to come dashing
around carefully he brought his own wea-
pon to bear the guard never knew what
hit him

they ran up the other passage which was
interminable then when they saw the
light of another opening they were stopped
by a metal gate chuck leveled his weapon
at the lock

wait save the juice henley ran back
to where he had seen some lengths of pipe
brought back a piece with this he was able
-to pry the lock apart

as they dashed through there came a
soundless flash almost in their faces they
stopped just in time someone stationed at
one of the small square windows high up on
one wall which were apparently at ground
level had fired a moment too soon chuck
released a flash at the window but could not
tell if it had taken effect

no use saving juice now henley said
he took chucks projector pointed it and
his own on the outside wall under the com-
bined power the stone flew into hot dust
deluging them with stinging sand and fill-
ing the corridors with a dense white cloud
they helped one another out of the narrow
hole blistering their hands on the still hot
edges and ran for life and freedom making
for a clumn of low-growing dense vegeta-

tion some hundred yards away across an
open field a guard startled reached for
his weapon but chucks weapon flashed
first sally snatched up the guards weapon
and inspected it as she ran

short-circuited she dropped it

back of the concealing growth they felt
more secure but henley with his custom-
ary forethought compelled them to drop
into a drainage ditch which ran at right
angles to their course it was disagreeable
and muddy but a moment later henleys
strategy was justified when all vegetation
where they had just been disappeared in a
surge of light

they paused under a culvert reviewed
their situation were not out of the woods
yet just because they havent followed they
may think were dead but nirvo is too wise
to take a chance on our rays when he does-
nt have to he can sit tight till we starve
in the mean time lets follow this ditch

they splashed through the shallow water
for about a quarter of a mile but never as
careful reconnoitering proved were they out
of sight of the rambling fortress the ditch
faithfully parallelled the low rock-bound
buildings

another hundred yards further on a slight
dip of the ground level revealed something
that brought a cry from them

look his cruiser hangar

there could be no doubt about it the
structure arising out of the field ahead and
to the right like a silver bubble was nirvos
hangar it glistened in the failing light
workmen were busy there for the oval open-
ings glowed golden

henleys heart leaped if the darkness
deepened they might be able to creep across
the open space overpower the ships crew
and seize the vessel then nirvo and his
crew would be marooned and would have
to await their arrest when the i f p got
around to it

the gray striations slowly faded out now
for the break

nirvo turned on his lights

there were seven of them high in the air
-so high on thin borium poles that they
had passed unnoticed now they flooded the
entire terrain with their powerful radiant


wonder stories

flood even illuminating the distant jungle

chuck raised his projector sighting at
the nearest light but henley struck it down

you lunkhead want to show em just
where we are let me handle this thing

he set his focalizer so that the weapon
emitted a thin beam no larger than a mans
finger but of maximum concentration in
that powerful glare the little beam would
be invisible he aimed at a light approx-
imately in the middle of the row about four
hundred yards back of them pressed the
trigger instantly the light flashed out in
quick succession he swept the beam over
the others but away from them this gave
nirvos men the impression that the fugi-
tives were in the darkened area and imme-
diately every weapon was brought to bear
on the darkened front this took about five
minutes but at last the pale deadly beams
were turned on and the effect was terrible
the soil itself was disintegrated flying up
in a dense cloud of dust that settled again
a dark pall through which the projectors
cut as the charge cylinders became empty
one by one the intensity of the barrage les-
sened if there had been anything living out
there it was not living now but the water
disassociated into hydrogen and oxygen
burned again with infernal heat

three lights remained those illuminating
the field about the hangar henley elected
to burn out two leaving the other to chuck
this was a matter of seconds only then
the three of them started their dash they
were at the hangar door before nirvo real-
ized that they were attacking not fleeing
the two officers charging together over-
whelmed the guards at the door who had
been interested spectators of the barrage
and whose eyes had been dazzled to the fire-
works a couple of greasy mechanics
crawled out from under a landing cylinder
just in time to be knocked cold

a challenge rang out another guard in-
side the ship had heard the noise henley
saw his shadow before he himself appeared
he drew chuck and sally close under the
side of the towering egg-shaped vessel the
guard looked out weapon ready he saw
the unconscious forms of the four men on
the floor hesitated he had strict orders

not to leave the ship after a moment h
stepped out however very alert

henleys powerful hand shot up and out
he seized the projector turned it up chuck
uncorked a punch that started from the floor
the guard slammed half across the hangar
rolled limply

inside nirvo apprised of the occur-
-rence in the hangar by his televisor spying
system had brought a freshly charged pro-
jector in line with the hangar the metal
sides curled and crumpled like tinfoil the
solid door of the battle cruiser slammed
shut the ship was armored with imperm-
ite-was therefore immune to the rays on-
ly a chance radiation directly into the ori-
fice of a lateral nozzle could hurt them

henley rushed into the control room
quickly found the levitation wheel for the
arrangement was practically standard no
time of course to open the launching top
the stout cruiser crashed up through
bounced down on the wreckage a few times
to crush the auxiliary juetnecars that were
probably under there henley took it into
the air

you man the projectors he ordered
chuck the latter slid down the manpipe
took his station at the very bottom of the
ship he turned on the impermite ray lec-
tor flooding the terrain with light they
were passing at a height of about a hundred
yards over the fortifications no need for
orders they would rescue the other prison-
ers chuck would know what to do when
the time came nirvo was futilely raying
them and chuck retaliated with his power
beam on stop  the maximum aperture
the stone and concrete flew to dust but the
projectors and their crews in impermite
turrets were not injured

the great egg-shaped fighting craft floated
slowly toward the prison end where the
dense forest encroached closely on the fort-
ress they could see the breach where they
had come out of the underground gallery
and directed by sally chuck sliced away
the rock as far as he dared

the cruiser came down on the wreckage
the gravitor at  it landed without a
jar-

just point it chuck instructed sally
the terrors of aryl



and whenever you see anything let er
flicker she took the big director grip and
peered through the sights

sheltered by the ship chuck let himself
out and doubling scurried through the
ruined galleries he found the prison with-
out difficulty the two guards still on the
floor pne of them groaned the women
were in a state of abject terror and he had
to drag half of them to the ship by main
force

once rounding a corner with a struggl-
ing charge he almost ran into a nirvo sol-
dier weaponless who had become isolated
the fellow was perfectly willing to fight
however-and delayed chuck several min-
utes before he was battered senseless to
the floor

at last the rescue was completed chuck
wiped the dirt and sweat off his brow pulled
the door shut with relief sally her pretty
face high-colored released a final blast of
energy at the pirate cohorts who were try-
ing to approach behind impermite shields
and then with swift sickening acceleration
the craft leaped into the air

  

corporal henley his lean face shaven and
clean drowsed in the navigators chair

how do i look

sally miraculously refreshed and rested
stood at the door like me

henley as at her side in three swift
strides

 do i like you why you-you-
her wonderful eyes peered at him through
long lashes

i know what you mean she smiled ten-
derly you mean you love me

henley did not reply but swept her into
an embrace so fierce that only her pliability
saved her from injury

atta boy bob chuck shaved and
scrubbed to the quick a clean bandage
around his head stood at the door strain-
ing the seams of his yellow jacket

dont i rate in on this just a little
chuck asked after a moment with odd wist-
fulness

sure you do sally said never taking
her eyes away from henleys look out in
the passage what nirvos op left in the
radio cabin for you

chuck looked picked up a lusty yl -liter
flask of mars-ti nearly full his sentimen-
tality forgotten he removed the stopper and
sniffed the stout fumes

oh well he said comfortably shoving
the flask into his pocket a woman is only
a woman but this-this is medicinal

dense fuming air was a solid wall  but still we drove on


back to  a d



to emember tom jenkins and the

cl story of the vanishing wood

will i ever forget it say i still dream
about the jed that naked gigantic brain
encased in its quartz ball floating high in
the air and ruling a
world by the sheer
power of its superhu-
man intelligence

we were in sids
laboratory a place
that always fascinated
me with its queerly
twisted shapes of glass
its gleaming coils of
wire its softly purring
motors i dont know
anything about those
things-im just a re-
porter hammering out
murders and investi-
gations and stick-ups
at so much per col-
umn inch

often enough in the
years we have palled
together sid has tried
to drum into my head
something of the mat-
ters that absorb his life
but he always has
thrown up his hands in
despair over at the
university where they
call him professor
chapin my chum is
considered a brilliant
teacher and his stud-
ents in physical chem-
istry idolize him-but
he hasnt been able to
teach me a thing

a phone call from
him had routed me out
that morning he was
very mysterious about
it just said that i must
get up to his place at once he had some-
thing important to show me he had hung
up on my impatient questions so there was

in  ad september  wonder

nothing left for me to do but get into my
clothes and chase uptown

yes i continued i remember tom
jenkins very well but did you drag me up
here at this unearthly hour to ask me that

sid grinned its
past eleven to any-
one but a night-owl re-
porter this is the mid-
dle of the day but i
wont hold you in sus-
pense any longer ive
got a letter from jen-
kins here it is he
tossed me a grimy
sheet of rough gray
paper the pencilled
scrawl bulked large
across it childish un-
formed just the sort of
hand one would expect
tom jenkins to write
-if he could write at
all

deer perfesser
the letter began i
take my pen in hand to
rite you about some-
thing i got to tell you
i hop this finds you in
good health and mis-
ter dunn the same
ma has had a touch of
the rumatics this fall
and the gray mare has
the founders but others
wys we are all ok

i am in grate trub-
ble and i dont no wat

piece about i got him
hid but i dont no wat
to do with him wil you come out heer
and advis me wat to do

i hop this find you in as good helth as it
leeves me and reman your frend thomas
jenkins

wj rno those readers who
f  read in  ad
the present sequel must be
very welcome for it not only
carries on the great adven-
tures of that fateful time
of the distant future but
also introduces newer and
more amazing experiences

when we look back over
the history of the human
 race say for the past 
years and then project it
ahead for  years more
we can get a good index of
the unbelievable changes
that will occur to us before
the year 

we know that the ten-
dency is for the race to be-
come more and more intel-
lectual and less emotional
and for it to consciously
rather than unconsciously
evolve as we control our en-
vironment more and more
arthur brisbane once said
that the man of the future
will be a cold calculating
chess player who will be al-
most all brain and little
body and he will have to be
carried around on air cush-
ions to avoid even the most
delicate of shocks to his ner-
vous system our authors
go several steps further
than mr brisbane in their
prophecies and give us pic-
tures of a future world that
i are almost unmatched for
their imaginativeness


wonder stories

i gave vent to a long whistle as i finished
the unpolished screed charlie-here i
exclaimed what does the man mean
r i should imagine just what he says
sid was bending over a metal tank of some
kind doing something to what ever was im-
mersed in the greasy fluid it contained

but-but its incredible why charlie
wont be born for  years yet be-
sides he was killed by the jed during the
rebellion that was jumbled enough but
what would you say if you were talking
about someone from thousands of years in
the future

no less incredible than jenkins story
and you believed that after all tom came
back from

	ad-
whats to pre-
vent charlie
frm travel-
ling in time in
the same man-
ner  re-
member the
farmer  a d
didnt see him
die we just
assumed that
he had

that was
just like my
chum you
couldnt feaze
him but my
poor brain
was spinning like a top one thing i
knew however hell and high water
wouldnt prevent me from going out to
blaymont and finding out what it was all
about when do we start

just as soon as i finish this test im run-
ning

how long will that be

sid glanced at his wrist watch about
forty-seven minutes about forty-seven
minutes you cant beat those scientists

whats the matter with finishing it when
you get back

pipe down young fella me lad if i
stop now itll take me just three weeks to
get back to the point ive reached jen-

arthur l zagat

kins and charlie and the vanishing wood
will just have to wait three quarters of an
hour longer -

sid was wiser than he knew had he
stopped the test then it would have been far
longer than three weeks before he could
write finis to that experiment

  

the sleepy long island town hadnt
changed an iota since six months before
we had walked up the road to the little
farmhouse that had been in the early
spring of  now it was fall- and while
the day had been warm the sharp morning
chill made me wish i had worn a coat sid
didnt seem to mind it as he strode along

though h e
weighs a hun-
dred and for-
ty pounds to
my two hun-
dred and ten

tom him-
s e  f opened
the door and
his honest face
lit up when he
saw us i
thought h i s
great paw
would crack
the bones in
my hand when
he grasped it
gosh im
glad youve
come he burst out im near looney with
worriment

whats it all about tom is it straight
what you wrote me sid drove right to the
point

jenkins grin of greeting gave way to a
worried almost furtive look straight as
god is my witness charlies here i got
him hid out in the vanishing wood he
glanced back over his shoulder but say
i dont want maw to hear ill take you to
him and tell you about it on the way

across  years

the strong reek of kerosene came to my
nostrils as tom fumbled with a lantern

nathan schachner
back to  a d



then we were walking across the fields the
bobbing circle of light making the darkness
a solid black wall pressing close about us

you see it was like this tom began
 been down to the store for some east for
ma and takes the short cut that goes along
the edge of the vanishing wood i aint
afraid of goin near it any more i know
im safe so long s i dont set foot inside
it  was hoppin right along cause i
wanted to get home before dark when sud-
den like i heard somethin moving right in-
side the wood thats queer says i to
myself there aint no creatures ever goes
in there i stopped and peered in where
i heard the noises theyd stopped too
an i couldnt see nothin  was just about
going on when i heard a voice callin kind
of low tom it says tom come here

well you coulda knocked me over with
a feather for i knew that voice i start-
ed shakin all over it cant be i thinks
tryin to hold myself from shakin hes
dead the jed melted him

but the voice comes again tom help
me and now  was sure it was charlies
voice charlie that id seen last in the city
of mothers just before karet led the crowd
of robots to fight the jed i dont take no
stock in ghosts or such but after what hap-
pened to me the last time  aint takin no
chances so i hollered come out here in
the light and let me see who you are

the rust  in came again and then i seen
somethin big movin behind the trees and
brush then who should step out but old
charlie hisself

he just showed hisself for a minute n
jumped back but he looks so scared and
so yearnin like i forgot to be scared myself
and i go right in after him sure enough
there he is the old charlie hes all
scratched and tore by the brambles and hes
thin and worn looking but there aint no
mistake about who it is

he grabs me round with all four of his
arms and he hangs onto me like a big baby
whats lost tom tom he says almost
cryin how glad  am i found you

we came to a tumble-down stone fence
and scrambled over it while tom held the
lantern high not far ahead a blacker

bulk in the darkness showed the wood for
which we were aiming jenkins took up
the story again

after i got him calmed down a bit i find
out whats happened it seems he and
three or four other of the mistakes had
kind o guessed what was going to happen
when the jed started talkin so they wrig-
gled out of the crowd quick just like i did
and beat it into the vanishing wood seems
like the power of the jed somehow couldnt
get in there and the masters dassent go
in after em cause its forbidden for thous-
ands and thousands of years charlie
and his friends were scared to death too but
they all thought there couldnt nothing worse
happen to em in there than what they seen
happen to karet and the robots

one o the bunch had a box o the little
white pills they use for food and theres a
spring in the wood so there aint no dan-
ger o their starving right away but they
dont dare poke their noses out and what
theyve got wont last very long so theyre
wcrryin considrable they all kind o
look up to charlie and make him the boss
and he feels its up to him to find some way
o gettin out o the mess

he remembers me and what  had told
him of how i come to his time so one day
he gets up his courage and jumps into the
queer twisted place i told yous in the mid-
dle o the wood

hvttien the twistin an the turnin is
  over he finds hisself on the ground
just like me he thought nothingd happen-
ed but he calls to the rest o his gang and
they dont answer then he goes to the edge
of the wood and sees the cows and mares
in old man browns meadow that gives
him a terrible scare hes never seen nothin
like em before i disrememberve told you
there aint no animals left in  ad

we shook our heads he hadnt told us
that tom continued

so he dassnt come out bout n hour
later he heard somethin coming along and

the mutakm were those of the blare class in the
world of  ad who hid been accidental en-
dowed with intelligence during the manipulation of
their egg before birth


wonder stories

when he looks out who should it be but 
me

we had reached the edge of the copse
round us in the lush meadow i could hear
the countless small scutterings and pipings
of the country night but there among the
tall trunks of the age-old trees was silence
dead silence not even the sound of a vag-
rant breeze whispering in the foliage tom
had halted and i drew nearer to my com-
panions for comfort the lantern light
made a ring of safety about us

well sirs i knowed that i couldnt bring
him out and show him around just think
what wouldve happened if the folks round
here saw a black man twelve foot high with
four arms four eyes and big flaps where
his ears ought to be theyd uv shot him
or gone looney or something i tell you

i was stumped

but after a while i thought of you
youd know what to do so i told charlie
to be calm and patient and id bring some
wise men out to see him meantime i
brought him out bedclothes and somethin
to eat it was funny to see him at his vic-
tuals he aint never had nothin but them
white pills and he aint got no teeth so i
had to cut up everything very small for him
like they do for a baby he couldnt under-
stand why he had to eat such a lot and i had
an awful time explainin to him

hes just a little ways in here lets go
in now

we plunged into the thicket the inter-
lacing foliage overhead blotted out the quiet
stars we seemed to have passed from real-
ity to be moving dreamlike in a timeless
spaceless land sid muttered something
under his breath i could not quite catch it

the waving lantern light picked out a
bulk a huge form lying motionless on the
ground the sense of unreality deepened

the actuality of this visitor from a hun-
dred and eighty centuries in the future
transcended my wildest imaginings jen-
kins description had been accurate enough
but somehow the conception had not quite
struck home writing of him i had per-
sisted in visualizing something akin to the
individuals i knew a freak but nothing
quite as far beyond experience as different

as this yet there was something oddly
human about him

the blackness of him struck me first-a
dull blackness that swallowed light and
his size twelve feet runs glibly from our
tongues but try to conceive a man twelve
feet tall a six-footer is well above the or-
dinary run seven makes a giant but twelve
feet

details became clearer in the dancing
glow an extra pair of arms sprawled out
from the hips huge shell-like structures
on each side of the head-ear flaps that
could trap the slightest sound a peculiar
excrescence over the closed eyes like a pair
of spectacles feet that were hoofs a
torn jerkin and loose fitting shorts of yellow
material covered him from neck to knees
tom leaned over and shook the sleeping
figure gently charlie charlie wake up
the eyes opened panicky fear stared out
charlie its tom dont be scared

chapter ii
the flight through time

the mountain heaved up to a sitting pos-
ture now that he was awake and the
black face was mobile with emotion i could
think of him as an intelligent being grad-
ually the queerness wore away

charlie these heres the wise men i told
you about this is perfesser chapin and
thats mr dunn theyre friends charlie
do you understand theyre friends and
theyve come to help you

the black looked at us estimatingly
seated on the ground as he was his head
was on a level with my shoulder then a
really intriguing smile came over his coun-
tenance he said something in a harsh
guttural voice the words were familiar
but i couldnt quite catch the meaning
these people of the future spoke an eng-
lish that had been distorted by long years
of evolution

he says hes glad to meet you and he
wants to thank you for coming

yes i understood sid broke in if
he speaks slowly i shant need an interpre-
ter i too found the blacks language
back to  ad



easily intelligible after a few minutes intent
listening

one thing is certain sid said after
charlie had outlined the situation to us in
confirmation of toms tale we cannot
bring the robots into our world our
story of their origin would be disbelieved
they would be treated as freaks made the
subjects of scientific study or public amuse-
ment i can see only misery and unhappi-
ness for them

 youre right old man i replied thats
no solution and yet they cannot exist for
long in their present circumstances either
the jed and the masters will find a way to
destroy them or they will starve to death
when their present food supply runs out
in that queer distorted english of his
charlie broke in eloquently he pleaded
with us not to abandon him and his com-
rades to the mercy of the jed a strange
sympathy moved me i could read its reflec-
tion in the countenance of my friend sud-
denly an idea struck me

	sid i burst out why cant we go back
with him im sure well be able to work
something out when we see the lay of the
land

i was hoping for that sids eyes
glowed in the dim light thafs just what
i want to do but i didnt suggest it i
wa afraid my scientific curiosity my desire
to see the world as it will be in  ad
was clouding my judgment what do you
say shall we go

go it is a great surge of excitement
flooded me adventure undreamed of ad-
venture called to me charlie caught the
drift of our talk and his face too beamed
with joy but tom was aghast

go there he exclaimed why aint
i told you enough about it i wouldnt go
back there for all the money in the world
oh go on tom i chaffed him you
know youre just kidding us ill bet we
cant make you stay home youre just
a-raring to go i can see it in your eyes
the lad was actually shaking with fear
he was white who me gee godfrey
whizzikers me go back not after i saw
what the jed done no sir not me
all right old boy we wont insist

you can stay home and tend to your taters
i soothed him

the arrangements were quickly made
charlie was to remain hidden we should
return to the city make our preparations
and come back to blaymont the following
afternoon then-the great adventure

and so the next afternoon we came to
the edge of the vanishing wood tom was
with us muttering dark forebodings making
last efforts to dissuade us strapped on my
back and on sids were great packs we
had a store of food and certain instruments
that my chum had insisted on carting along
there were other things too i shall not
bore you with a detailed inventory strap-
ped to my waist was the holster of a  au-
omatic relic of army days and sid tot-
tered under the weight of an elephant gun
that he had raked up from somewhere

charlie met us towering darkly all
four of his arms were waving with excite-
ment

we shook hands with tom said goodbye
to  and the world we knew then we
turned and followed the robot

a few steps between the towering arbor-
eal giants and we came to a little clearing
even as i looked beyond the story of toms
adventure flashed back to me

for across that little clearing the trees
were queer no longer did they soar straight
upward toward the life-giving sun they
were twisted strangely distorted oddly bent
as though gnarled with fear and though
there was no wind their leaves were quiv-
ering

on each side of a path the trees leaned
away curved in weird uncanny twistings
and the path broadened as it dove deeper
among the knotted trunks so that i appeared
to be looking into the small end of a funnel
the path broadened i could see its other
end-or could i  for there was nothing
there

nothing not a vast spread of sky
such as one sees ahead when mounting a
long straight slope whose crest hides the
horizon not a far spreading desert expanse
simply terrifyingly nothing

 i glanced at sid his usually smiling


wonder stories

face was grim his lips pressed in a tight
line his eyes glowing like black fire in the
whiteness of his visage come on ned
he muttered forcing the words between
clenched teeth he moved forward i
forced my leaden feet to follow

the huge form of charlie entered the
path-and vanished a moment before he
had loomed there his head brushing the
lowermost limb of a forest giant now-he
was gone-as if he had never been

sid stopped across the margin of the
clearing blinked into non-existence i
gasped a deathly fear at my heart i was
sorely tempted to turn and run for it then
i too plunged into the fateful path

a vortex of unknown unknowable forces
seized me irresistibly i whirled down the
funnelled path the trees on each side writh-
ing in fantastic giddy dance suddenly
there was no up no down no space no
time even the parts of my body seemed
to have lost relation one to the other so that
my head might well have been at my waist
my arms at neck or knees for all i knew

path trees sky sun disappeared in a vast
blazing nothingness a white nothingness
through which i slid thought itself van-
ished and consciousness was but a corus-
cating burst of white hot sparks that met
and whirled apart and met again and flared
asunder in a chaotic flashing kaleidoscope
of whiteness eternally i heaved and fell

then-i was lying flat on my back in the
little clearing and there were sid and
charlie sitting up blinking in dazed be-
wilderment

are you all right ned my chum ask-
ed anxiously

fine but whats it all about here
we are right where we started from

sid grinned yes-were tvhere we start-
ed from but were not when we started
from not by some score thousand years

why-what do you mean

just that were in the year of our lord
twenty thousand and thirty-two or there-
abouts

i stared at my chum for a moment un-
comprehendingly then i remembered of
course we had travelled in space not at

all but in time again i remembered
jenkins story he too had thought to find
his old familiar world just beyond those
trees through which we had come

charlie was on his feet wait till i re-
turn

in a minute he was back and with him
eight others eight gigantic blacks with the
same four waving arms the same hoofed
feet the same peculiar excrescences over
their eyes now at last i began to really
feel that i had reached into some other time
for peculiarly enough where before charlie
had been an abnormality a freak out of
place we knew now he and his comrades
seemed to belong and we were the inter-
lopers that feeling stayed with me as long
as we remained in the world of  ad

the robots had erected for themselves a
little hut near the margin of the wood and
they made us comfortable in it here we
rested and talked while the light faded and
the shadowy dimness of the grove deepened
into darkness at last i said sid i want
to take a look outside i want to see what
sort of place we have landed in

my pal nodded im just as anxious as
you what do you think charlie is it
safe

we often scout around the edges it is
safe as long as you dont go too far to be
able to get back quickly at any sign of dan-
ger

i parted the leafy curtain and peered out
bright moonlight flooded a fairy scene for
mile upon mile a flat plain stretched a vast
formal garden that might have been fash-
ioned for some king of kings hedge-bor-
dered paths of softly glowing gravel curved
between banks of flowers of gorgeous flow-
ers whose like i had never seen super-
nally sweet fragrance was wafted to me on
a gentle breeze soft fountains plashed in
quiet symphony and a myriad dancing
sparks of light shuttled and weaved among
the swaying blossoms

one of the paths skirted the wood its
pebbles glowing iridescent in the moonlight
it curved in a great circle and in the very
centre of the circle stood a luminous form
of glowing light that was a statue
back to  ad



the return of arkon

vague and misty as it was the sculp-
tured monument drew me to it with a
yearning to see more of it i slipped out
heedless of sids clutching hand of his low
cry of warning i slid soundlessly across
the soft carpet of sod and the cold light and
the sweet odors embraced me in a flood xf
aching beauty i drew close to the soft
shining statue and now i could see it plain-
ly-

in heroic proportion the form of a man
towered there a man such as i yet somehow
different a long grey beard flowed down
over flowing robes and the face radiated a
wisdom such as never had sage of our time
attained wisdom and goodness and some-
thing else something inexpressibly divine

almost it seemed alive that figure i
could feel those kindly eyes bend their wise
gaze on me welcome me why-they were
moving a deep voice thrilled me to the
core with its slow accents but it was a
tired voice-one that had probably spoken
this message through the ages to countless
others that stood before it

i am arkon the wise i it was who de-
vised the means by which first man shook
the dust of earth from off his feet and voy-
aged through space to other stars

when the great revolt of the machines
swept over the earth and the doom of man-
kind seemed sealed i gathered a small com-
pany and set off for outer space seeking a
new home for the race nothing more has
ever been heard from me nor from the brave
band of adventurers who departed with me
in the ship i had devised

that the memory of a wise and brave
and good man might be preserved forever
the jed in his wisdom decreed that this image
of me be created and tarom fashioned me

marvellous mechanism isnt it it
was sid at my side i hadnt noticed that
he too had slipped from the covert and
yet simple enough he continued there
must be a beam of light projected from
somewhere that the spectator interrupts
its focussed  on a photo-electric cell and
the cutting off of the light causes a change

in the potential of the current that tarts the
speaking mechanism

thats sid for you

a faint whirring drew my attention far
in the distance i could make out a speck
floating about ten feet above the ground
rapidly it drew nearer-a tiny boat-shaped
object approximately the size of a small
canoe above the gunwale i could dimly
descry a domed head a master doubt-
less sent by the jed to intercept us

i whirled calling to my chum who ws
busily examining the monument sid
quick back to the wood

we barely made it in time as we dove
into the underbrush the master had landed
was extending a tube in a tentacled hand
a thin flame spurted through the night
spattered harmlessly against the edge of the
wood not three feet from where we crouch-
ed the wood was inviolate the master
stood there and though his face was like
nothing in my experience i could read in it
a surge of baffled rage

toms description had been accurate of
the strange beings five feet of height fully
half was a great head egg-shaped hairless
i could see the staring lidless eyes with the
pouches above that held an additional lens
for close vision the triangular breathing
orifice with its pulsating membrane was
clearly defined in the moonlight and the
puckered dot below that was the toothless
mouth

the torso was squat cylindrioal and the
stemlike legs ended in huge splayed hoofs
like the robots but the most striking fea-
tures of the queer creature were its arms
and hands not more than a half-inch thick
were those arms and they writhed and weav-
ed like two elongated earthworms at the
ends they split into five thinner tentacles
waving fingers like the earthworms they
resembled those strange limbs could be ex-
tended for five or six feet or retracted so
that they were but inches long i shudder-
ed this then was the supreme evolution
of man

suddenly the creature was looking
upward interest curiosity astonish-
ment growing momentarily more vivid on


wonder stories

his countenance i followed the direction
of his gaze far far above i could see a
fleck against the lucent blue-black of the
sky swiftly it fell ever nearer and nearer
till it grew into a sphere glinting metalli-
cally a burst of flame flared from it died
away the speed tf the descent checked
the metal sphere drifted downward settled
softly on the grass

 i felt sids hand clutching my arm but i
couldnt tear my eyes from that ten-foot ball
the master was staring at it in a manner
that told me it was as alien to his knowledge
as to mine what was it where had it come
from palpably fashioned by intelligent
hands could it be a space ship a wanderer
from some other star

a portion of the spheres surface swung
open a sector of the shell a foot thick
something moved within then-a man
stepped out of all the astonishing im-
possible things from this craft from an-
other planet into an earth peopled by four-
armed black creatures twelve feet tall and
balloon-headed individuals with tentacular
limbs came a being as like man of  as
these other creatures were different no
eery shape no fantastic unimaginable
nightmare form could have astonished as
half as much as the appearance of this tall
gray bearded old man whose human coun-
tenance radiated benignant wisdom

he moved with infinite grace this man
as he turned toward the master but the
calm dignity of his face gave way to start-
led surprise for the jeds subject was aim-
ing the venomous ray tube at him  anoth-
er instant and swift death would claim him
another instant-but in that instant my gun
had somehow leaped into my hand had bark-
ed and the master sprawled unconscious on
the ground

we were out in the open sid and i shout-
ing this way into the wood for your life
hurry the stranger turned toward us be-
wilderment in his eyes but he seemed to
sense our friendliness instinctively to realize
the urgent peril of his situation for he
sped unquestioningly for the shelter of the
thicket

sid was shouting now all pretence at
caution gone charlie come here quick

a huge thrashing in the wood showed
that his calls had been heard and obeyed
he snapped staccato commands ned in-
to the wood with the master he stooped
and snatched up the ray tube where it had
fallen charlie have your friends get that
ball in and you help me with the air
boat

i slung the master across my shoulder
ran for cover sid and charlie the flier on
their shoulders followed on the run there
was need for haste a buzzing as of a swarm
of angry bees warned of the swift approach
of a bevy of masters from the corner of
my eye i saw the huge sphere heave up to
the shoulders of the giant robots that
great mass was as nothing to their strength
quickly as it takes to tell we were all back
in sanctuary with our burdens and none
too soon for outside a dozen aircraft had
landed there was a vast waving of tube-
wielding tentacles shrill screams of baf-
fled rage filled the air

was it some superstitious dread still liv-
ing in the consciousness of these supermen
some atavistic taboo that held them back
from the margin of our refuge hundreds
of centuries of inflexible law raised a bar-
rier between them and us i saw them stand
there not daring to set foot across the line
that marked the edge of the vanishing wood
there was nothing to prevent their rushing
across that line if they did we were lost
our puny weapons could avail us little
against their death-dealing rays but though
they pressed close they did not come

chapter iii
arkons story

potent indeed must have been the fear
of the jed that had forced charlie and
his companions to bring themselves to seek
refuge here	

once indeed i thought they had conquer-
ed their fear there was a concerted surge
toward the grove i raised my gun pre-
pared to sell my life dearly but just as
another step would have told the foremost
that his terror was groundless he checked
back to  a d



himself the others halted too we were
saved

suddenly as though some telepathic com-
mand had reached them all leaped into their
craft the buzzing sounded again the air
boats lifted they were gone

the newcomer was speaking his deep
well-modulated voice strangely familiar he
too spoke an english changed but intel-
ligible with careful listening a different
dialect from that of the robots but the root
was the same the language in which i write

apparently i must- voice my gratitude
for a daring rescue he said strange
that i should be so attacked at the moment
of landing and by so extraordinary a peo-
ple or are they descendants of the mach-
ines i had expected to findgreat changes
on earth but nothing like what i have al-
ready seen are you remnants of some few
who escaped the great revolt my mind is
bewildered

all this was incomprehensible to me but
my scientist friend appeared to understand
 noted that his face was lit with a glow of
discovery of wonder

as for what we have done that is noth-
ing he replied to the stranger we are
overjoyed that a most extraordinary chain
of circumstances placed us in a position to
aid you but before  explain may  ask
who you are and whence you come

the other bowed his head gravely i
am arkon the thirty-fifth and i come from
neptune on a voyage of exploration to
determine if earth is yet ready for the re-
turn home of my people

now the amazing truth flashed on me
arkon the thirty-fifth arkon the ori-
ginal of the image that had just spoken to
me must be this mans ancestor t knew
why this voice was so familiar why his
lineaments had seemed not quite strange

we were again in the hut sid had just
finished the narrative of the astounding
events that had brought us here difficult
indeed had it proved to convince arkon of
the truth of our story but somehow he
had accepted it now he was telling us of
he strange odyssey of a little band of ad-
venturers somewhat of whose tale we bad
already guessed

my ancestor the first arkon had just
completed the final testing of a vessel he
had designed to navigate space and visit
other worlds when the insurrection of the
machines broke forth they swept all be-
fore them and he became convinced that
the race of man was doomed despairing
he gathered together a dozen people men
and women and embarked for outer space
to seek a new home for mankind

for a long time the little band wander-
ed through the void they essayed a land-
ing on mars but found conditions impos-
sible for living there finally just as all
hope was gone they reached neptune
there they discovered an intelligent race of
reptilian origin and were enabled through
the genius of arkon to make known their
needs an agreement was entered into by
virtue of which the earth people were grant-
ed a small area to settle in

adjustment to the changed circumstances
was difficult but my ancestor had chosen
his companions well and the band survived
they made an abiding place for themselves
but never did they feel that they had found
a home always a yearning for earth
gnawed at them a longing to return to their
native planet

a thousand years passed children
were born grew old and died but ever
the old traditions of the beautiful earth from
which their fathers had been driven were
kept alive and the thoughts of each member
of the little community turned over to a
return but for many reasons the attempt
was never made

a year ago however notice was served
on us that the time of our sojourn on nep-
tune was drawing to a close the neptun-
ians were proliferating rapidly the planet
was growing overcrowded and every bit of
surface was needed for their own race we
were given two years to determine on our
course at the expiration of that time we
must leave or be killed

the leadership of the earth people had
remained a hereditary obligation of the eld-
est male descendant of arkon the first i
am the present ruler we had always care-
fully preserved the plans of the first space
ship and i ordered sufficient duplicates to


wonder stories

be built to carry all our people i called
a council and the general view was that
if possible we should return to earth

but we had no knowledge of what had
eventuated on our home planet had the
machines conquered as was thought had
they found a way to reproduce themselves
and overrun the earth so that we should be
repelled or massacred  or had they rusted
out leaving the world a barren unpeopled
waste or had mankind triumphed in the
end so that we would be welcomed back by
our own people these and many other
questions must be answered before our na-
tion could choose the goal for our exodus

s

	i decided to scout ahead in a small
model of our space ships to span the
illimitable spaces separating us from earth
and venturing alone to determine the feasi-
bility of our homecoming

i came and my heart is sore within
me from what i have already seen and
from what you tell me earth holds no pro-
mise of peace for my people mankind
triumphed over the machines indeed but
better had the race died than evolved into
the ruthless cruel inhuman monsters that
now people the world

we who on an alien world have kept
alive the literature the art the religion the
dreams of a golden age can find no peace
no home here in a world dominated by a
naked brain administered by soulless minds
who know no pity no love no purpose save
the ruthless attainment of their own desires
even the beauty of that garden out there is
a heritage from the age in which arkon the
first lived and dreamed

these masters are the descendants of a
little group of so-called supermen who iso-
lated in a group of their own high in the
appalachians experimented with artificial
methods of propagation with intensive in-
tellectual development with all sorts of
scientific interference with the natural evo-
lution of the race i have read their story
in one of our old chronicles but they were
left severely alone by the rest of mankind

apparently they seized their opportun-
ity during the great insurrection and made
themselves dominant over the earth with

their infernal concoctions they subjugated
wliat remained of the rest of humanity and
made of them imbecile slaves they even
changed their very form their color and
produced such poor creatures as these
he indicated charlie and his friends what
hope would we have to be left in peace
should we return

no better that we wander again
through space and drag out the weary years
of our exile in such wandering than return
here  i must go and carry back the sad
tidings to my people

he bowed his head as he finished i
was inexpressibly moved by the tale he told

i felt conveyed to me the age long nostalgia
of the exiles for their homeland the daring
of this man speeding through the far reach-
es of space all alone buoyed up by the hope
that he would find that at last it was pos-
sible for his people to return and now his
terrible disappointment a thought began
to flicker within me but before it had taken
form sid voiced it

do not return as yet arkon perhaps
we shall find a way to defeat the jed and his
cohorts and reconquer earth for your peo-
ple and for these downtrodden robots my
friend and i came to this time for that very
purpose we intend to make a try at it per-
haps your knowledge added to ours will
bring success

a faint hope kindled itself in the noble
countenance of the man from neptune even 
as he replied but how can you dream of
such a thing you tell me that this jed
has immeasurable knowledge immeasurable
power his subjects are many we are but
a handful i fear that you are carried
away by an enthusiasm unjustified by log-
ic	i

i was proud of my friend as he answered
it is true the task is a well nigh impossible
one it is true that the odds are tremen-
dously against it but-in the long history
of the earth impossible tasks have more
than once been accomplished by determined
men let us make up our minds that the
thing can be done and by god it will be
done

arkon rose his face glowing he stretch-
back to  a d



ed out his hand to sid im with you
well do it	v

and so we three so oddly assorted de-
voted ourselves to the conquest of a world

the rash adventure

by tacit consent leadership was given
over to sid he drove straight at the
essentials

in order to make any plans we must
gather as much information as possible
at present we know very little about the peo-
ple we are to combat jenkins observations
on his previous adventure here furnish the
bulk of our knowledge that is very little
his lack of education his ignorance of
science prevented him from learning more
than the most superficial things the ro-
bots knowledge of their world is also little
better than nebulous from neither of
these can we obtain the facts we must have

however due to our recent adventure
we are possessed of two further means for
gaining information we have captured a
master neds bullet by great good for-
tune merely stunned him and we have
one of the enemys flying machines trust
me to find a way to make use of it

suppose we have the master brought in
i suggested eager to make a start

very well sid nodded to charlie who
all this time had been listening silently to
our talk in a moment he had hauled our
prisoner in

what is your name sid began the in-
terrogation

the master stood defiant not saying a
single word an ugly furrow across the
top of his great balloon head showed where
my bullet had creased him

my chum took from his pocket the tiny
tube no larger than a fountain pen that we
knew could project a deadly ray

look here i have this i shall not hesi-
tate to use it if you cross me the only
thing that keeps you alive is our idea that
you can be of use to us make up your
mind quickly i didnt realize that my old
friend could look so menacing that his voice
could be so cold so deadly threatening
what is your name he asked again

tarom came the low answer

your position or function in the state
i am of the guard of the jed

why did you make such an unprovoked
attack on this man pointing to arkon

since the advent of the primitive the
jed has ordered that all beings like him are
to be summarily killed without question
what is the jeds reason for that

 the jed orders he does not explain
what means of offense and defense have
you

we masters have our ray tubes they are
sufficient we have only the robots to fear
combat among ourselves is strictly forbid-
den the jed has other weapons what
they are i do not know i only know that
when a master refuses implicit obedience to
the jed he dies within the instant and his
body vanishes without trace

how does the jed communicate his or-
ders to you

by telepathy-we hear a voice speaking
in our inner being and know it is his

can you hear it now

no jeds power does not extend into
this wood long have we known that

we stood pondering a trifle careless im
afraid for the master straightened sudden-
ly and before any one could stop him was
dashing madly through the wood we
rushed after him reached the edge just in
time to see him darting across the great
level sward heedless of everything but
rage at myself for having let him escape so
easily i was about to dash after him when
sids arm caught me dont be a fool
ned he cried once out of this sanctuary
and you are a dead man

in a rage i raised my revolver aimed after
the fleeing figure a grave voice spoke
quietly it was arkon nay we desire
no blood on our hands unless it be absolute-
ly unavoidable

ashamed i lowered the gun but our
chance for gaining knowledge of how to com-
bat the jed is gone

then we must discover other means

i pondered the remark still smarting
under what i deemed my laxity in permitting

 the designation for tom jenkins on bis first visit
gee in  ad	


wonder stories

our prisoner to escape i cast about for some
other plan something i could do to efface
the stigma now ordinarily i am not a very
brave man i am not one of your roaring
swashbucklers who love the bright side of
danger and the tang of overwhelming odds
so that it must have been a slight touch of
madness that caused me to propose the rash
adventure i did

i have it i cried excitedly the air boat
we captured

well what about it sid asked

why man dont you see it the alarm
has been given and shortly therell be an
impenetrable guard thrown about this place
so well never have a chance to break
through and even if we did what could
we do knowing nothing at all of what wed
meet charlie and the robots cant help
us much so before the jeds guards get
here again im going to get out of here-in
the masters aircraft

i was carried away by my own enthusiasm
dont you see its night now i can
scout around get the lay of the land find
out things

arkon looked at me with a smiling wonder
that made me feel quite heroic charlie
was positively worshipful there is noth-
ing more heady to a naturally timorous man
than the wine of admiration i felt equal
to incredible feats	

it was sid who pricked the bubble of my
vainglory possibly he knew me too well

most chivalric this idea of yours ned
he said half-ironically but youve forgot-
ten one little fact that would end your
scouting disastrously

what is that

dont vou remember what tom told us
that the jed is able somehow not merely to
communicate his thoughts to others but also
at will to tune in on what passes through
anyones mind within his sphere of influ-
ence how far do you think you could get
before he would know it charlie nodded
his great black head vigorously in assent

my whole bright scheme collapsed into
nothingness of course it was foolhardy
and being what i am who can say that

there wasnt just a bit of relief about my

disappointment

then arkon spoke gravely unhurriedly
never in all the desperate adventures we
were to live through together did i see him
flurried his noble demeanor ruffled or his
voice deviate from its even music

it is a remarkable coincidence that i
have with me the means to combat in at
least this one thing the subjugator of our
race know that the reptilian denizens of
neptune our outcast home also possess this
strange power for a generation the
thoughts of our people were an open book
to our neighbors a source of infinite em-
barrassment it was arkon the twelfth
who toiled unremittingly until he discovered
the remedy he invented a thought screen
that when worn effectually shields the
wearer from intrusion into his private
thoughts since then all my people wear
the golden band and once more their sec-
rets are inviolate i have one with me in
the space ship

the cold light of the confirmed scientist
glowed in sids eyes a light somewhat
clouded by a skeptical reserve impossi-
ble he burst forth how can you shield or
hide thought emanations by mere metallic
bands

arkon smiled benignly nothing is im-
possible oh visitor from an earlier age
man long ago discarded that outworn word
from his speech but come with me to the
space flier and i will show you

sid pressed behind him eagerly but truth
to tell i lagged a bit now i would have
to go through with my quixotic attempt
conceived in a moment of enthusiasm re-
covered sanity warned me of the inevitable
perils ahead

we entered into the interior of the tiny
flier from another world the walls were
of the same strange metal that glowed with a
soft radiance unusual looking instruments
were clustered on the concavity instruments
that meant nothing to me but sid exam-
ined everything with a sort of covetous eager
ness as though he would pluck out of their
very inwards the secret of interplanetary
flight
back to  a d



arkon picked up a thin metallic band
and handed it to sid i stared at it in awe
it was open at one end two small metal
filaments marked the terminals on the
other side of the circlet was a little protrub-
erance from which numerous fine wires
ran along the graved surface to the fila-
ments arkon explained

if i remember my primeval history cor-
rectly in your day you had learned that
thought is merely a series of high frequency
electrical vibrations emanating from the
neurones imbedded in the brain tissue like
all vibrations they are carried through the
ether away from the point of origin but
since they are very feeble in intensity they
do not progress more than a few feet before
they are so faint that the most delicate am-
meters would not register their presence
evidently however the jed and the nep-
tunians have discovered a method of am-
plifying and directing these faint waves so
as to send and receive the signal with un-
diminished intensity

with these fundamentals in mind arkon
the twelth set to work and this was the re-
sult imbedded in the little knob at the
back of the circlet is a very minute trans-
mitter that generates and broadcasts waves
of a period exactly corresponding to the
thought vibrations

the current flows along the tiny wires
bridges the gap between the electrodes and
set up a field of force that completely en-
circles the head of the wearer

i understand all that and i get what
youre driving at sid broke in you are
attempting to set up an interference so that
the artificially generated waves are just half
a wave length behind the natural thought
vibrations the crests of one fitting exactly
in the troughs of the other so as to create
a blanketing effect

exactly arkon beamed a bit surprised
i had not realized that your time was so
far advanced scientifically

you flatter us reporters i interrupted
its still greek to me even though sid
seems to understand

chapter iv

reconnoitering

but my chum plunged on heedless of
praise or interruptions

all very pretty but how do you modu-
late the wavelengths of your transmitter so
that it emits waves of exactly the opposite
phase

arkon smiled approvingly there is a
very delicate micrometer screw near the base
of the protuberance we examined it
more closely sure enough it was there
he continued each half turn of that
screw shifts the period of vibration by half a
wave length so that is merely a matter of
experimental individual adjustment for each
wearer

but how can you tell when it is proper-
ly set i asked

put it on and ill show you the earth-
man from neptune replied i did so the
flexible band encircled my forehead with
the knob in front the electrodes in the rear

now turn the micrometer screw until you
notice something unusual

my clumsy fingers found the little mech-
anism twisted it slowly nothing happen-
ed i was beginning to fear it was some
neptunian jest when suddenly my usually
halting thought processes clarified in-
stead of vague chaotic tags and shreds of
thought flitting through my mind consecu-
tive ideas came to me clear cut sharp
edged crystalline

i stopped short with an exclamation of
surprise never before had i felt my brain
so keen so brilliant

ah i can see you have found the proper
vibration series said arkon who had been
watching me closely

what is it how did you know when to
stop clamored sid bursting with curios-
ity

i described my sensations arkon nodding
his head the while that is so your
thought vibrations are now completely
shielded from the fest of the world you
see by forming a wall of neutralization the
waves of thought pressing behind are
thrown back upon themselves and they rein-


wonder stories

force and amplify so that the sensations the
ideas they represent are made more vigor-
ous more intense

i was ready to shout with joy at my new
found keenness of mind look out sid
i warned him jokingly from now on im
the brains of this outfit youre just my
dumb assistant

take off your disguise i know you he
mocked back

it was charlie who brought us back to a
sense of reality he had been listening to
us uncomprehendingly with a touch of im-
patience now he pushed forward tim-
idly

look masters that was the only salu-
tation of respect he knew the night is al-
most half over if anything is to be done
there is no time to lose

righto i exclaimed im off

here where are you going exclaimed
sid in alarm

for the air boat of course

nonsense i wont let you go alone ill
go too

there is only one thought-shield came
the grave voice of arkon

then im elected said sid and he tried
to grab the circlet off my head i ducked
just in time

not a chance im a reporter dont for-
get i have a natural nose for news for
prying into things besides as the scien-
tist of this party your place is here to con-
coct schemes in conjunction with our noble
friend

we argued back and forth but the more
sid pleaded the more stubborn i became
i would go and no one else finally he
saw how obdurate i was and gave in

i hastened to the boat before he could
change his mind i examined the controls
im a rather fair amateur pilot of aircraft
and it did not take me long to get the hang
of the contraption i was all set

with a final squeeze of the hand that
spoke volumes sid stepped back there
was a queer catch in his voice as he bade me
godspeed the darned cold blooded scien-
tific cuss-i never knew he could show emo-
tion 

i waved with a cheeriness i did not feel

pressed the proper button a haze of blue
light and the craft lifted softly off the
ground straight up through the trees

at about a hundred feet elevation i
pressed another button the soft blue
glow turned to a purplish red and the can-
oe shaped car darted swiftly over the plain
in a few seconds the vanishing wood was
far behind

to keep myself from dwelling nervously
on what awaited me i examined the mech-
anism of my captured craft a bit more close-
ly there was no motor no propellor none
of the manifold equipment so necessary in
our day for propulsion through space on-
ly a small oblong box in what might be
termed the prow to which the control but-
tons were attached not a whir not a mur-
mur to disturb the even tenor of our flight

i puzzled it over a bit then the answer
dawned on me even in the year 
ad people were talking of the possibilities
of broadcasting power to be picked up and
utilized by factories automobiles aircraft
and what not of course that was it some
central station sent out power we tuned in
so to speak and behold we moved along
on the crest of waves

now that i had satisfactorily disposed of
that problem and was unreasonably elated
at my unsuspected scientific knowledge-
fool that i was i forgot to credit the thought-
shield on my forehead-i glanced over the
side of my vehicle the park-line character
of the land continued but off to the west
and rapidly looming larger with the speed
of my flight lay a great cluster of buildings
the vast city of the jed

my heart beat faster i was approaching
my goal it was utterly unlike what new
york would look like viewed from a dis-
tance instead of angular monstrosities of
jumbled canyons of oblong boxes upended
here were rounded domes and undulating
curves gleaming rose and blue in the bright
moonlight inevitably i was reminded of
the many domes of the alhambra of the
taj mahal

but my aesthetic wonderment abruptly
ceased for straining my eyes i saw a
cluster of dark specks stream out from the
back to  a d



magic city and hurtle directly for me it
took but a moment to guess what they were
air boats like my own manned by masters
planning to give me a warm reception

i could have turned tail and fled back to
the wood and safety afterwards i won-
dered at myself for not having done so but
at the moment the thought did not even oc-
cur to me i was out on a mission and i
must accomplish it i had my revolver
with me of course but that would be small
protection against the ray-tubes of the mas-
ters

i took the only course possible i
swerved and shot off at an angle the dis-
tant specks turned and darted across my line
of flight i pressed the button all the way
in i was racing at maximum speed now
if only i could beat them to the point of
intersection i could then swerve around the
city and take my chances on losing my pur-
suers

it was a race faster and faster we shot
along the aircraft of the masters gaining
handily already i could see the great
bloated heads peering over the edges ray
tubes glinted evilly in the moonlight  all
pointed ominously at me i measured the
distance between us it was no go one
boat at the head of the procession would
either crash into me or be right on my tail
in short order

i drew my revolver grimly determined
to sell my life as dearly as possible faint
flashes darted from the ray-tubes the
streaks of light burnt along stopped short
yards away from my hurrying craft that
gave me some measure of comfort my au-
tomatic could shoot further than their
weapons there were six bullets six bul-
lets must mean six billets even in my
great danger i played on that little phrase

the first air car was almost on top of me
i twisted the steering knob angled off he
followed i could see the master crouched
low his ray projector pointed the flame
leaped the gap sheared off the rim of my
boat as cleanly as though cut with a knife
it whiffed into nothingness i shuddered at
the thought of what the damned ray would
io to me if it connected then a surge of

rage swept through me the dirty murder-
er

i raised my revolver sighted carefully
and let him have it it caught him square
on the bulging leathery forehead just as he
was coming up to take another shot at me
the whole head collapsed like a pricked
balloon-evidently there was not much bony
structure-and the body dropped out of
sight thefcraft left suddenly to its own
devices plunged erratically about until it
crashed headlong to the ground

the city of the mothers

the other masters beholding the swift
demise of their leader held back they
were not aching for a dose of this unknown
weapon of mine you fellows may be far
ahead of us in knowledge and all that but
youve lost some of the guts and stamina
of your ancestors i thought savagely

it was funny really this assumption on
my part of all the courageous instincts of
my age but i didnt stop to philosophize
instead i turned swiftly about the great
city and though the masters put up a half-
hearted pursuit i soon distanced them
they trailed out of sight

now what i said to myself as i car-
eened past innumerable gleaming domes
the east was paling sure precursor of the
dawn it wouldnt do to be found wander-
ing about in the daytime id pass out of
the picture in a hurry id have to land
somewhere hide the boat and lay low until
night again when i could prowl around
but nary a forest nary a grove of trees
broke the monotony of the great parkland
the city of course was out of the question

wondering what to do whether it wouldnt
be wise to turn back the question was sud-
denly answered for me neatly and effect-
ually the air boat slackened speed sud-
denly coasted a while began to drop
frantically i worked at my controls-they
were all properly set the craft went into
a tail spin strangely enough i was calm
unworried i realized what had happened
that infernally clever jed had called back
his masters then calmly cut off the power
i was the only one left in the air so natur-

ally my boat quit me just as i had worked
out the whole thing to my satisfaction i
crashed

when i came to i was lying in a mass
of wreckage bruised battered but other-
wise all right i scrambled from under
thanking the providence that protects fools
and drunkards for my miraculous escape

i looked about me in the dim dawn-light
there was no time to be lost the masters
would be out after me again in force
straight ahead loomed a huge structure
glowing with a shimmering golden light
a great central tower domed on top as
were all their buildings rose boldly into the
air a massive battlemented wall some
twenty feet in height swept in an endless
arc some hundreds of yards from where
i stood was an opening a thin slash iri the
great stone escarpment dimly to be seen
in front of it guarding the entrance was a
giant black figure huger even than charlie
a robot

how could that be i wondered hadnt
tom and charlie both assured me that all
the robots had been slain in the great re-
volt except those few who had escaped to
the vanishing wood again my brain
was working with unwonted clarity-due
as ive said before to the thought-shield

of course the mothers were still alive
the ova were still to be had the jed had
created a new race of robots larger pos-
sibly without any brains at all to succumb
to the temptation of a new rebellion as
for their quick growth it was merely a mat-
ter of activation that should be simple to
the vast brain that was jed

but this train of thought put a new idea
into my head i had wondered at the vague
familiarity of this imposing structure now
i had it it was the city of the mothers
that tom had so crudely yet effectively
described to us

a fantastic scheme presented itself tom
i remembered had hidden away in its vast
interior why could i not do likewise
but there was the robot guard at the gate
what about him he was too immense for
me to tackle physically i should have
stood no more chance than an insect under-
foot i could shoot him of course but

the idea was repugnant the poor dumb
creature had never done me any harm

i studied the situation while they gray
dawn grew ever paler in the east soon i
would be visible to all and sundry utterly
helpless there was no other means of es-
cape except into the city of mothers and
there barring my path was the unsuspect-
ing robot

not only my own life but the safety of
my friends the salvation of the earth-people
on neptune the rescue of this strange future
earth from unspeakable tyranny depended
on my next move i hesitated no longer
the automatic was in my hand a sharp
report the poor robot staggered then
like a gigantic tree laid low by the woods-
mans axe crashed majestically to earth

it was the first and last time in my life
that i shot a human being in cold blood
yet under the circumstances what else could
i do even at this late date i suffer a
twinge of conscience when i think of it

then forgetting all but the desperate
need for haste i ran as fast as i could to
the now unguarded gate i sped past the
queerly contorted body not daring to look
at my handiwork in ihrough the vaulted 
arch intricately worked in a frieze of mos-
aic

straight ahead was the great tower the
home of the mothers without an instants
hesitation i made for it passed through the
ornate entrance found myself in a lofty
hall fortunately it was deserted at that
early hour or my adventure would have
ended then and there

at the farther end was the great shaft i
was looking for there it was just as tom
had described it a circular well stretching
up interminably lit by a soft glow from
somewhere the walls of smooth shining ala-
baster i examined the rounded wall care-
fully imbedded in the gleaming whiteness
was a small round button of green jade

i pressed it

though i knew what to expect the sud-
denness with which i was lifted up into the
air was breathtaking it was an eerie sen-
sation-that of rushing perpendicularly
through space up ever up i winged the
back to  ad



smooth walls rushing past me in giddy
flight

i came -to a sudden stop floated dizzily
in thin air involuntarily i moved my legs
was surprised to find myself walking on
nothing toward the solid marble flooring
that surrounded the open wall i lunged
for it and did not pause to draw breath
until i felt blessed solidity under foot

again i was in luck the great rotunda
was bare of living beings the walls
gleamed golden from innumerable coruscat-
ing pinpoints of illumination possibly
some radio-active material imbedded in the
marble slabs

i gazed at it with a gasp of admiration
over the great concave surface were painted
murals of a magnificence of conception a
sure draughtsmanship a delicacy of execu-
tion that would put our own noblest artists
yes even michelangelos titanic vision in
saint peters at rome to shame

here was spread before my dazzled eyes
in heavenly blues yellows and greens the
whole evolution of birth from the earliest
primeval forms here were depicted vast
flowing amoebas in the throes of binary fis-
sion then in ordered array came the
method of spore formation the budding of
great tentacled hydras the first hermaphro-
dictic sexual reproduction of writhing earth
worms and up through more and more com-
plex forms until i saw with a shock of
recognition the faultless forms of a man
and woman of my own era painted as no
painter we know could have envisioned their
perfection

from that point on all was strange to me
the tale of men and women in love grew
ever more complicated while alas the glor-
ious form degenerated into bulging fore-
heads and hideously foreshortened limbs as
our modern civilization went on relentlessly
to its coldly logical end then there was
no more differentiation in the pictures neu-
ter looking beings made their appearance
man had found a way to reproduce without
sex it saddened me that thought all
of love all of the romance and generous
warmth of life had passed out of a world to
cerebral too intellectual to waste its time
in such youthful illusions

the painted representations of masters
and robots completed the panorama the
end and aim of all our striving

but even as i stared something happened
as though at an invisible signal the great
paintings broke into seeming life the pic-
tures glowed and began to move dum-
founded i watched thinking i was the vic-
tim of a strange hallucination for each
individual picture quivered and changed
before my very eyes the amoeba thrust out
its pseudopodia attenuated itself grew
slender in the waist and broke up into two
forms eh complete that swam about on
the golden walls looking for food

the human male and female approached
each other with lovely gestures the mas-
ter gesticulated and the robot humbly obey-
ed the whole vast scene of life was mov-
ing and living on the great surface of the
rotunda

chapter v
the voice of jed

how i wished sid was here to explain
the seeming miracle long after-
wards when i talked it over with him he
suggested that the rotunda might have been
composed of innumerable thin sections each
bearing a consecutive painting that were
slid into position over each other with the
speed of a motion picture mechanism it
may be so but somehow it leaves me un-
convinced

i would have watched the enthralling ever
shifting drama forever had not a grating
noise brought me to a realization of my
whereabouts senses once more on the
alert i shifted my errant gaze down to earth
again a door at the farthermost end was
opening

i looked wildly about for shelter some
ten paces to the right was a door leading
-where it was no time for idle specula-
tion i had to chance it i sprang for it
pulled it open darted in and closed it softly
behind me

i was in a great cerulean-hued room lux-
uriously appointed beyond my wildest imag-
inings the floor was covered with shim-


wonder stories

mering silken rugs the walls were hung
with rare tapestries depicting unending love-
ly vistas divans damask covered in
strange geometric patterns were scattered
about in profusion at the farther end a
fountain gleamed

the leaping water sprayed in a million
broken sparkles of iridescence back into a
rose-colored marble pool gilded birds
with bright plumage flew circling overhead
and from their blue tipped beaks issued
forth entrancing melodies something about
the regularity of their flight the unceasing
flood of melody caused me to examine a
bit closer they were mechanisms in the
very similitude of life actuated-i know not
how a bower of delight a mohamme-
dans dream of paradise only the houris
were lacking

but were they for even as the compari-
son occurred to me a figure arose from a
divan half hidden by the plashing fountain
i stared frankly-bereft of words of all de-
sire for speech for the first time in my life
my heated imagination had conjured up a
veritable houri

tall and stately she was overtopping me
by inches and i am no dwarf exactly a
human creature compact of fire and ice a
glorious being whose warm features melt-
ing blue eyes hair of burnished gold made
me search desperately in my memory for the
felicitous phrases of the poets but there
were none to do her justice-for the very
good reason that nothing like this ravishing
being had ever existed in the world i knew

there was alarm consternation in the
great blue eyes the full quivering lips were
opening to cry out to give the alarm the
gun was in my hand but though my life
might pay the forfeit i did not dream of
shooting instead i essayed a stage whisper
into which i threw every bit of imploring ac-
cent i could dont shout- please dont
 wont hurt you ill be killed if you be-
tray me-

the beautiful creature stopped short her
eyes wide with surprise she spoke in the
soft slurred musical speech that once was
english her voice shaming the liquid gold
of the birds that whirred in unceasing flight
above us

who are you oh being that resembles me
so closely and yet are so strangely differ-
ent and what do you here in the city of the
mothers where it is death to jenetrate
i am a human being like yourself come
from another age when the earth was peo-
pled with beings like ourselves

an eager puzzled look appeared in those
limpid eyes say you so i do not und-
erstand what you mean by talking about
another age but are there really others who
possess our forms and lineaments others
beside the few who are the mothers others
who are not dumb brute robots ugly mis-
shapen masters or like unto the jed

a shudder of repulsion shook her then a
sudden passion went through her like a
flame oh human whom it is good to look
upon-i believe i had the grace to blush-
oh unknown from i know not where have
you no thought no pity for the pitiful state
of us mothers-mere animal breeders for a
populous earth compelled to watch the cal-
lous masters with foul chemicals evoke out
of the flesh of our flesh the bone of our
bone monstrosities like themselves or robot
beasts of burden while we yearn for the
sight of babes with rosy tinted limbs to
press and cuddle against our hearts

she ended in a storm of passionate weep-
ing it is cruel inhuman what they have
done to us many a time i have peeped out
into the great rotunda and devoured hun-
grily the glowing shifting pictures of life
and love in the past how i trembled with
strange emotions how i yearned to be a part
of that i saw but it is not to be for i am
but a prisoner bound here inexorably by
jeds decree-a mother

every fiber of my being responded to
that pitiful lament-how i longed to
draw that golden head upon my shoulder to
soothe that normal instinct of womanhood
but the memory of my mission my own pre-
sent danger forbade

i have told you i have come from the
past-the very past portrayed outside-
where  women there are-like you though
not so beautiful and men like myself where
women are free to live as they deem best
where there is love and not cold chemical
back to  a d



solutions where babes are borne by their
mothers and are cherished and protected
by them

her face lit up with a rapturous hope
she clasped her hands beseechingly what
you speak of sounds incredible-but your
very presence here is even more incredible
so i must believe you if it indeed be so
take me away from here take me with you
i too must be free free from this wretched
bondage but take heed of the jed lest
he-

her panting voice trailed off into silence
a look of horror of panic fear suffused the
beautiful countenance a moan burst from
her the jed-he has heard

i did not understand alarmed at the
sudden change that had come over her the
broken phrases i was hurrying to her side
when i too was brought up short

a voice was speaking-a deep vibrant
voice that flooded me with its tones i
whirled around to meet its owner but there
was no one i looked vainly about in all di-
rections there was something curious
about that voice for all its clarity its vib-
rant resonance it seemed to lack body it
was soundless it was something that
echoed from within me that was why i
could not place it

realization came flooding it was the
jed speaking-speaking to me in the inner-
most depths of my own brain-communica-
tion by telepathy even though tom had
prepared me for just this the actual hear-
ing of this strange inner voice sent queer
shivers tingling up and down my spine but
as i listened to the ominous message i was
overcome by a deathly dread

the cold inhuman voice was saying
visitor from an age when the earth was a
place of primitive savages not far risen
from the ape do you think to escape the all-
seeing the all-knowing jed once before
a denizen of your times appeared among us
he was treated courteously though he was
a primitive but he chose to involve himself
in karets puny revolt karet is dead and
so are most of his dupes some few eluded
me in the wood where time and space are
warped the primitive was among them

now you and another appear you have

aided and attempted to protect the fugitive
robots from my just wrath you have kill-
ed a master with a toy you have slain a
robot at the gate of the city of the moth-
ers

the cold voice grew inexorable you
have achieved the distinction of arousing
my anger i shall crush you like a loath-
some insect even as you are able to hear
my commands i am watching you who
deem yourself secure in your hiding place
i read your thoughts as easily as you hear
mine i know exactly ivhere you are

a cold sweat burst from my pores while
the mother stared at me affrighted i ran
toward the other end of the room panic-
stricken seeking an outlet somewhere to
hide from the infinite brain that was jed

once more the cold tones faintly tinged
with mockery echoed within me i paused
in my aimless flight

i know every move you are making it
is useless for you to attempt it there is
no place on the earth or deep within its
bowels that i cannot follow and pluck you
out even now my guard is hurrying to
your place of concealment to seize and bring
you before me it shall go hard with you
then

yet because i am merciful because you
are a poor blind primitive whose mind is
still groping childishly i shall grant you a
last chance come out into the open be-
fore the guard reaches you give yourself up
voluntarily and i shall graciously permit
you and your comrade to depart in the wood
to your own time but the rebellious ro-
bots and the earth-man from neptune must
be delivered over to me i have spoken

jed defied

my knees were wobbly as the dread tones
ceased their strange echoing within me
the woman had seized my arm was urging
me with passionate whispers

quickly give yourself up before they
come the jed will do as he says he does
not break his word you will be killed oth-
erwise

in this hour of danger i was sorely tempt-
ed to heed her to abandon this quixotic at-


wonder stories

tempt to be a participant in a world and
time not my own that should not exist for
me except as an unimaginable future my
own familiar world the accustomed sights
and sounds were suddenly overpjweringly
dear across the wide waste of time no
doubt i had succumbed issued forth to sur-
render myself had not the jed seen fit to
tack on conditions

i thought of charlie the poor robot ac-
cidentally encumbered with intelligence the
others of his group more vague in my mem-
ory and then came the vision of that noble
earthman and all his fellows doomed to die
here and on the neptune that wished no
more of them all this would happen be-
cause of wretched fear for my own safety
i knew instinctively the right course to adopt
but as you may have remarked by this time
 am by nature not exactly brave so i hesi-
tated

the beautiful woman was in a frenzy of
alarm she was scanning my features
stupid in their indecision very likely she
sensed the struggle taking place within me
there was anguish in her tones

stranger from another time obey the
jed and save yourself you cannot hope to
defy his might go back to your own fair
world and live the happiness denied to me
a sob interrupted it is i-eona who
beg you i would not see you die

the passion the pleading of the lovely
girl decided me my path was clear yet
strangely enough the appeal of this flushed
goddess had forced a decision on me direct-
ly contrary towhat she had cjesired

i would not leave the others to a horrible
fate i could not leave eona how liquid
it was on my tongue i must chance the
wrath of jed i would fight on to the last
breath which grandiloquent effusions i
promptly translated into suitable words

no i said striking an attitude i can-
not shall not surrender to the jed i can-
not give up those who have become my com-
rades i cannot leave this far time to groan
under his tyranny i shall fight him if
necessary single handed

at this late date i blush to record this
bombast so foreign to my timid nature but

i doubtless had fallen a victim at the lime
of a species of auto-hypnosis and-the
spell of bright approving eyes for in
spite of eonas concern i detected a gleam
of admiration and that would have been
sufficient to have changed a rabbit into a
raging lion

but even as i spoke i was afraid des-
perately so already i heard in my heated
imagination the stealthy approach of the
guard and so i changed my tune abrupt-
ly however i must hide from them is
there no place

the mother shook her head vehemently
there is a passage which leads down to
the bottom of the tower but what good is
it the jed can read your thoughts wher-
ever you are and so compel you to disclose
your hiding place

then it came upon me in a blinding flash
i struck myself on the forehead

fool stupid fool that i am no wonder
sid always insisted i was not quite bright
to think that i almost let myself be taken
in by a clever dodge

eona stared at me uncomprehendingly
i do not understand you but i know that
if you do not hurry to do something soon
it will be too fete

not at all i said calmly unhurriedly
masking the intense quivering relief within
then i explained you see i had com-
pletely forgotten until your chance remark
that i was wearing this i tapped the thin
gold circlet on my head in a few words
i explained its function so you see i
continued the jed couldnt possibly know
where i am by reading my thoughts

but i have to hand it to him for infernal
cleverness he knew i was about that the
thoughts he willed could reach me the
vibrations of his mind having a different
frequency from the tuned blanketing of
the thought-shield have no difficulty in
penetrating the protecting radiations he
tried to scare me into giving myself up and
i must admit he almost did that was why
he pretended to have become suddenly af-
flicted with a strain of mercy

i shook my fist vaguely you are clev-
er jed but i ned dunn am just a bit too
much for you
back to  a d



vainglory goeth before a fall hard-
ly had i uttered this silliness when the
sound of many feet outside in the rotunda
brought me to my senses

eona grabbed me by the arm the
guard of jed-they are coming for you he
has heard then without giving me a
chance to say anything she almost pulled
me along toward the rear of the room im-
mediately behind the fountain in frantic
haste she pressed button after button on a
panel set in the wall until a section slid
silently open disclosing a gaping black hole

quick in there she fairly screamed
it leads down underneath the tower out
beyond the walls she snatched up a hand-
ful of white pellets from a crystal dish at
the fountain edge here take these they
are food and she fairly shoved me into the
opening

i resisted but what about you eona
theyll kill you for hiding me

do not fear i am a mother-and too
precious to be harmed there was bitter-
ness in the suppressed tone

i was going to argue further but hands
were on the outer door it was opening i
just had time to tumble in when the panel
slid over me blotting out the light and the
sound of the approaching guard

it was pitch black i was groping cau-
tiously about to find a wall so as to guide
my footsteps down what i assumed to be a
flight of stairs when without warning i felt
myself precipitated into an abyss vision
of a dizzy fall the ultimate crash far be-
low flashed across my agony when to my
utter surprise i found myself cushioned in
my headlong flight and then i sank slowly
and comfortably down down to an infinite
depth

when i finally came to a gentle stop
and felt the substantial ground beneath me
i arose hastily from the recumbent position
in which i had been deposited and took note
of my surroundings

i was in a darkened chamber palely lit
by a patch of brightness from the farther
end of a tunnel i made my way cautiously
through the narrow aperture until the patch
grew larger and brighter it was the early

morning light and beyond was the keen
fresh air and freedom

i hastened my footsteps delighted beyond
measure to be clear once more some in-
stinct halted my errant feet on the very rim

accordingly i peered very cautiously out
keeping my body within the shadowed tun-
nel my heart almost stopped beating
almost directly in front of me barely a
yard away stood a master his great mem-
branous head just turned away from me a
wicked ray tube clutched tightly in his cur-
ious tentacled hand

i ducked quickly into the saving darkness
but i had had sufficient time to note that
the sky was dark with numberless aircraft
each with its master pilot all converging
on the city of the mothers

a cold sweat beaded my forehead as i
realized the significance of what i had seen
the jed was obviously determined to fer-
ret me out i should have felt flattered by
the unceasing attention granted me an in-
conspicuous primitive from  ad by
the mighty ruler of this fantastic world of

	ad but to my shame it must be
confessed that i did not react that way at
all rather i evinced a lamentable eager-
ness to sink indistinguishably back into
anonymity to be one with millions of others
just like me

there was not much time for deep
thought too well i knew what would hap-
pen the entire edifice would be searched
all exits blocked every person in it sub-
jected in turn to the piercing scrutiny of the
jed when eonas turn was reached her
thoughts willy nilly would betray me my
hiding place discovered as for her-what
would the jed do in his wrath i ground
my teeth in impotent rage

chapter vi

the rescue

precious moments were passing i
awoke to that face with a start i re-
traced my steps and found myself back in
the vaulted chamber into which i had fall-
en

i was searching for the perpendicular


wonder stories

shaft when my eye was attracted by a denser
black in the dim-lit surface of the wall i
went closer

it was the opening into another tunnel
that yawned ominously before me where
it led to what the dangers lurking within
i had no means of telling but i determined
to chance it outside of this slim possibil-
ity of escape there was no other

with a fearful heart i entered for what
seemed endless miles i groped my way
stumbling in the palpable darkness bark-
ing my shins on unseen obstructions at
last when i had given up hope of ever reach-
ing the end of this interminable tunnel i
was seized in the grip of a current of air
and swept upward

i managed to extract my automatic from
its holster as i floated helplessly in the
swift current the feel of its stubby handle
was some measure of comfort as i did not
know what to expect next

a radiance flooded me from above and
the next moment i drifted into a chamber
of blank polished walls whose brightness
dazzled my gloom enshrouded eyes when
i had somewhat accustomed myself to the
sudden transition i gazed curiously about
me

the room was not large and bare of any
adornment the walls the ceiling the
floor were all of the same strange metal a
blinding white with the shimmer of shifting
quicksilver somehow solidified

even as i stared a curious fancy came
over me-or was it fancy i seemed to see
the solid surfaces shift and melt before my
gaze and the whole gleamed and swayed
with white metallic cloud masses i remem-
ber i was idly wondering at the moment
what sid was doing and the others

as in a dream the shifting clouds cleared
and to my astounded sight or was i in truth
dreaming i saw before me the edge of the
vanishing wood illuminated in a blaze of
sunshine i stared and gasped for a head
cautiously peered out of the sheltering trees
and ducked instantly back from view for
there were hundreds of air boats each pilot-
ed by its inevitable master floating motion-
less a short distance away an impenetrable
cordon and at the sight of that quickly

moving target the air was instantly a criss-
cross of stabbing golden flames

panic seized me for in that short instant
i had recognized the head as sids wher-
ever the deadly rays struck the ground the
foliage the grass the banked blooms
whiffged out of existence only smoldering
patches of bare brown earth remained but
somehow for what reason i did not know
then nor have any of us ever been able to
discover the lightning darts recoiled visibly
from the very edge of the wood not a
branch not even a leaf dancing in the breeze
was disturbed by the blazing death

i stared and stared in unappeased eager-
ness but the vision or whatever it was slow-
ly faded from the view and once more the
dazzling metal walls took on their solid
shape and form

i rubbed my eyes had i been seeing
things no that scene had been too real
too vivid to be the product of a disordered
imagination in my puzzlement somehow
i forgot the ever present danger of my sit-
uation

my thoughts turned to eona what had
happened to her

as the thought struck me again the solid
walls seemed to dissolve and i was staring
at the huge tower of the city of the mothers
an air boat was issuing from a great cen-
tral window it was larger than the ordin-
ary craft a master was at the controls an-
other was seated behind him my heart
gave a great leap for huddled in the bot-
tom near his hoof-like foot helplessly
bound lay eona her long golden hair
streaming wildly over her face the vehicle
was flying directly toward me

with a shout of fury i sprang forward
heedless of everything except that this
glorious girl was captive brought to some
hideous fate because of me my fist that
had been raised in an insane gesture collid-
ed with hard metal with such force that my
knuckles were battered and bruised

i recoiled as the scene faded from my
view once more enclosed in blank polished
walls i looked dumbly at my bleeding
hand then a cold rage enveloped me if
only i could lay my hands on that fiendish
back to  ad



brain they called the jed id smash the in-
fernal mess into a pulp so at least i fum-
ed in my helplessness

for there was no possible exit from the
chamber in which i was only blank
gleaming walls met my fevered gaze even
the place where i had been catapulted
through was hermetically sealed beyond all
finding

in my frantic anger i turned to sid and
his strange comrades as my only hope i
had great faith in sid and in that noble
earth-man from neptune perhaps they
could rescue eona i was beyond fear for
myself such is the power of awakened love
over an essentially timid nature

and then once more to my astonished
view appeared the wood the grim serried
craft of masters eternally on guard alas
no sign of life was stirring from within
had they all been killed or captured no
for then there would have been no need for
the encompassing army had they aban-
doned the task as impossible and dispersed
the neptunian back to his planet sid back
through the warp in time to the familiar
world of 

a sudden qualm of homesickness struck
me but again no not if i knew sid what-
ever his faults he would not desert me
stranded among unimaginable dangers
and that cold scientists brain would not so
easily give up a problem to be solved he
was a plugger was sid

the vision held something high up in
the heavens caught my eye it flashed diag-
onally across the sky a blazing portent a
moment it seemed to pause over the wood
then like a plummet it dropped squarely in-
to it vanished from sight

i was a little sick was that some new
weapon of the jeds that had overcome the
strange inviolability of their sanctuary des-
troyed them i strained my eyes to see
but the walls once more confronted me

what was this uncanny television that
seemed to flash the scenes my thoughts were
directed to i pondered the mystery and
slowly the probable solution grew on me
it was television but a form undreamt-of
in our present day

my thought processes-the vibrations i

emitted how scientific i was becoming im-
pinged on the strange metal of which the
walls were composed there by some meth-
od dont ask me to explain it though long
afterward when i talked it over with sid he
went patiently into obscure scientific jar-
gon the vibrations activated a delicate
television apparatus that automatically
tuned in on the light vibrations coming
from the subject of my thoughts the pic-
ture was cast upon the metal surface acting
as a screen it may be explicable but to
me it has always remained something magi-
cal

while i was engaged in this effort of pure
scientific reasoning and you must imagine
the tremendous strain it put upon my purely
reportorial abilities another thought struck
me with overwhelming force i was going
good then

if what i had just so beautifully worked
out were true why did my thoughts impinge
on the apparatus for you see i was
wearing the thought-shield and according to
my experience and the explanation of ark-
on no least thought vibration should escape
through the barrier of its field

instinctively i put my hand to my head
i touched a twisted electrode bent some-
where in my stumbling through the dark
passageway

a panic seized me the apparatus was
not working then my thoughts must even
now be an open book to the jed i jerked
the contraption off my head worked franti-
cally at the damaged electrode i managed
to press it back into its old position was
lifting it in great haste to replace around
my forehead when a slight whirring noise
caused me to turn

a section of the burnished metal wall was
opening and two masters were leaping
through ray tubes pointed directly at me
i thrust the narrow circlet into my pocket
tugged at my automatic

the jed attacks

it was too late for as my fingers tight-
ened around the butt one of the masters
pressed his tube a pale blue flame shot

out streaked across the intervening distance
hit me square in the chest

a sensation of glacial cold cursed through
my body i stiffened in a strange paralysis
literally frozen in my tracks i would have
fallen had not the two of them sprung for-
ward to catch me there was no triumph
in those queer unwinking eyes only a cold
passionless superiority as though i were but
dirt beneath their hooved feet

the one who had struck me down whistled
a high whine immediately a gigantic rob-
ot passed through the open panel came to
a halt before the master his polished
ebony countenance was blank devoid of any
human feeling the weird flesh-spectacled
eyes stared straight ahead curiously set

the master whistled again not quite as
high-pitched as before the robot moved
forward seized my rigid unresisting form
slung me across a huge shoulder as though
i were a child

even in my strange predicament unable
to move an eyelash even a thrill of horror
shot through my consciousness the jed
had learnt his lesson in the last revolt

there would be no more semi-intelligent
robots to fan a flame of discontent these
new creations from the chemically-treated
eggs were mere automata mindless animals
reacting like mechanical things to variations
in whistled notes

what a horrible thing the jed had done
in his cold lust for power i tried to scream
aloud and could not he had used the ac-
cumulated wisdom of the ages to degrade
the human race to these pitiful abortions
rather than civilization should come to this
better that the earth and all its inhabitants
perish

my poor frozen body was slung on the
shoulder of the robot flanked by the mas-
ters and we were on a whizzing platform
that sped swiftly through winding corridors

the platform came to a sudden stop a
wall slid silently open and warm sunlight
blazed on us before us stretched a path
bordered with gorgeous blooms directly
ahead was a mighty palace a great gleam-
ing blue circular structure topped by a rose-
colored dome on the walls were mosaics
of supernally beautiful scenes above the

arched entrance flashed a golden sun whose
gleaming rays streaked through the deep
blue glaze

we started across the parkland i was
gradually regaining the use of my limbs
but i lay quiescent just the same there
was no sense in trying to struggle now the
odds were too overwhelming

we were half way across when something
swooped down upon us from the heavens
i caught a glimpse of a shining metal globe
as it catapulted directly toward our party
instinctively the masters threw themselves
flat on the ground the robot however
automaton that he was kept on moving
no one had told him to stop with a quick
wriggle i broke his grasp dropped heavily
to the turf flattened myself i had no de-
sire to be smashed by this thunderbolt

not more than fifty feet above us the
strange craft checked its headlong flight
drifted gently to the ground a section of
the metal ball opened and out stepped -sid
and charlie then i recognized what my
befuddled senses had failed to take in be-
fore it was arkons space flier

sid gave vent to a great glad shout when
he saw me and started forward just then
i saw one of the masters raising himself
with his ray tube pointed directly at my
friend i screamed a warning and some-
how as though it were a live thing the
automatic in my pocket found itself in my
hand spat viciously

the master crumpled up in a little heap
and lay still sid came out of his daze
there was a tube in his hand the one he
had captured on the edge of the wood
the flame darted from its opening just a
split second before the other master could
press his weapon there was a horrible
odor of burnt flesh and an unrecognizable
mass lay quivering charlie his honest
face aglow with happiness leaped at the
poor dumb robot knocked him down in a
flurry of flailing hands caught me up and
was bounding for the space ship sid fol-
lowed on the run

already the sky was clouded with the
converging aircraft of the masters and
back to  ad



the great palace of the jed was slowly
swinging open

charlie was almost gibbering in fear
quick master sid he screamed the jed
is appearing we shall all be destroyed

we half fell half stumbled into the sanc-
tuary of the ship the slide whirred shut
and instantly the flier soared swiftly up

through the quartz porthole i saw the
palace wide open and a great white gleam-
ing ball suspended in the air it was slow-
ly whirling and even as i gazed an irides-
cence of shifting colors played over the
smooth surface the jed heartsick with
fear i watched the casing of that supernal
brain

could we get out of the range of his
frightful power in time the air boats of
the masters were scattering madly like a
swarm of frightened bees one fellow
whose enthusiasm to attack us had brought
him in too close could not maneuver fast
enough he was caught by deadly heat em-
anations and commenced to glow and melt
the next second he was -hurtling in a cloud
of smoke to the ground

within our ship it grew stifling hot the
emanations were upon us but the noble
flier accelerated to tremendous speed it
was nip and tuck the wood rushed into
view below us and we dropped like a plum-
met into it just as we were gasping for
breath

so rapt had i been in the excitement of
the chase that  had not noticed the other
occupants of the flier before now i looked
around me at the controls was a stranger
i gazed at him in astonishment he was
an earth man noble in bearing his dress
and demeanor like that of arkon i turned
to sid to question him when my eyes met
another figure emerging from behind the
black grinning bulk of charlie

eona i cried my heart pounding away
like mad my arms flew wide and that
glorious girl just moved into them as though
all her life she had known the answer

it is indeed i oh ned her voice came
musically as i tightened ijiy hold on her
your friends saved me from a terrible dan-
ger i am so glad they rescued you too
from the jed

i looked to sid to thank him but that
cold-blooded individual never did have any
flair for romance he was callously beck-
oning me to step out of the ship the oth-
ers were already gone with a sigh i re-
leased eona

we found ourselves in the clearing im-
mediately in front of the funnel path that
led through the warp in space-time nest-
ling next to us was a huge gleaming ball
another space ship triple the size of ours

a number of the strange earth-men were
scattered in the clearing

i grabbed hold of sid just as he was head-
ing away to where arkon was standing he
is just like that saves your life and then
forgets about you drops you into an in-
explicable setting and leaves you there with-
out explanation if you dont know what
its all about thats your hard luck

but this time i determined not to let him
get away with it i shook him thoroughly

here you i cried give me the low-
down on whats happened here since i was
away who are all those strange people
who resemble arkon and how did they man-
age to get here and how did you get hold
of eona and know where to find me

he stopped with a snort of disgust
hey let go cant you see im busy

i gripped him more firmly no sir i
cant and youll only waste more of your
precious time if you dont come across with
the story

very well then he said resignedly if
youre that kind of an ass ill make it
snappy after you left arkon and i start-
ed planning how to fight the jed couldnt
make much headway at it though you see
we didnt know much about his powers ex-
cept what tom and charlie had told us and
there wasnt much nourishment in that

while we were racking our brains ark-
on heard the buzz of his radio in the ship
wondering what it was he hurried to tune
in the set crackled and whined in some 
mysterious code his face lit up- as he lis-
tened then he spoke into the microphone in
the same incomprehensible code

i was bursting with curiosity he turned
to me friend fate itself is on our side
that message was from one of our great


wonder stories

space ships a week after i departed from
neptune the reptile people delivered an ul-
timatum six months and no more would
our race be allowed to live in peace the
largest and fastest flier was armed and
equipped and with a crew of a hundred
youths despatched in haste to bring to me
the fatal edict

even now they are rapidly approaching
earth i warned them of the dangers con-
fronting us and ordered them to land here
in the wood within the hour the great
ship was here

i remembered the flashing meteor i had
seen in the television chamber and under-
stood

chapter vii
the volunteers

sid continued i was getting worried
about you so i proposed taking the
smaller ship and searching for you charlie
insisted in coming along arkon gave us
one of his men to navigate while cruis-
ing about we saw an air boat skimming
the ground with a bound figure in it think-
ing it might be you we attacked it the
masters put up a fight but the ship carries
an atomic disintegrator that soon put them
hors de combat

judge our astonishment to discover a
mother eona as the victim we unbound
her and learned from her the story of your
sudden appearance in her chamber and
the ensuing flight

we were cruising hopelessly about when
we saw you being carried toward the palace
of the jed the rest you know

i stared at him uncomprehendingly
but werent you afraid the jed would know
of your plans by reading your thoughts and
destroy you

sid laughed a fine reporter you are
blind as a bat look

i stared at him again and was never more
shamed in my life for encircling his fore-
head plain for all to see was-a thought-
shield so befuddled had i been that in all
this time i had not noticed this obvious

adornment on the heads of all who were
congregated there

sid smiled indulgently at the foolishness
that must have been writ large on my face

the neptunian party brought along a
sufficient supply and we used them

then characteristically he dismissed
what was past now come along and you
and i and arkon are going to go into a hud-
dle seeing the jed actually at work has
given me an idea

i hated to leave eona but her smile urged
me to go holding a subtle promise for my
return so i went with sid

we found arkon engaged in earnest con-
versation with charlie and a youthful nep-
tunian evidently the commander of the sec-
ond ship charlie was volubly explaining
what had happened

arkon extended his hand to me with a
grave smile i am happy to see you again
we had given you up as lost

just the luck of a blundering reporter
i replied

sid favored me with a scathing glance
dumb luck is right but lets get down
to business youve heard arkon how the
jed almost put us out of commission
arkon nodded

well sid continued as nearly as i
can figure it out in the few minutes i saw
him in action that great mobile brain must
be a highly charged magnetic field as he
spins himself around the lines of force cut
across the network of electric conductors in
the bodies of all living beings in his path
the maze of nerve filaments the minute
currents already passing through these fila-
ments are stepped up tremendously the
enormous surges of electric potential at ex-
tremely high frequencies are too great for
the conducting tissues to carry they be-
come heated to incandescence in the effort
the currents seek other paths-the veins and
arteries-tendons and muscles-till the en-
tire body melts in the terrific temperature
you have seen the armatures of dynamos
run at too great a speed melted into one
block of metal-that is exactly the effect
its just as simple as all that

say sid i interjected i remember we
ran an item in the paper not long ago about
back to  a d



some doctor discovering that exposing the
human body to high frequency currents
raised the temperature two or three degrees
he was talking about treating certain dis-
eases that way

precisely sid snapped his eyes glow-
ing it was my memory of that very ex-
periment that gave me the clue

i looked at my friend with awe casual-
ly without the slightest hint of boasting he
had tossed off the explanation of the jeds
power arkon too had a touch of respect
in his eyes

arkon nodded very very good my
friend that  doubt is the answer but
how may we avail ourselves of this know-
ledge to defeat the jed

sid hesitated before answering then he
spoke with a peculiar intonation we
know his brain is a magnetic field and he
must spin to induce the rays  we could
force him to spin indefinitely the reservoir
of his magnetism would eventually be ex-
hausted  see no method by which he could
restore it while spinning

arkon pondered that long finally he
nodded i see that but how can we
force him to keep rotating interminably
sid said nothin but looked at him
strangely

charlie who had been listening to a con-
versation that we all thought way over his
head broke in eagerly i understand you
master sid you mean that one after an-
other should go out alone with your terrible
weapons in their hands to fight the jed
to kill that one he must spin otherwise
that one will kill him as soon as the first
one is dead and the jed thinks he is through
another one shall step forward to do battle
so the jed must spin again you are right
master sid and i charlie who am only
a poor robot and good for nothing shall be
the first to go and all my robot compan-
ions after me

again sudden shame descended on me
i had not thought of that sid was nodding
slowly arkon snapped out of his amaze-
ment

verily this is a strange world to which
we earth men from neptune have come back

first there are primitives from a time we
harked back to with contempt then degraded
humans robots of the present day and
both put us to shame with knowledge and
understanding of which our proud race is
not possessed

authoritatively he spoke you charlie
i thank for willingness to sacrifice yourself
but i arkon cannot allow it there are
only a few of you robots a strange and pe-
culiar race that must not be allowed to die
out you sid and ned are not of this
time this is not really your quarrel but
we earth men we who must conquer the jed
to find a homeland or perish miserably in
space it is our right and duty to sacrifice
if necessary every one of us so that our
great race may live on i myself shall be
the first to go

the other neptunian whose name was
nerkis broke in with a fury of expostula-
tion no no oh arkon we shall not
allow you to do this who then shall lead
the earthlings back to their homeland a
thousand times no but we mere ordinary
persons whose lives are of no particular
value to the race shall sacrifice ourselves
that earth shall once more be a haven and
a refuge 

a light of exaltation shone in the youthful
eyes sid and i added our pleadings to
that of nerkis until arkon was forced re-
luctantly to consent only charlie sulked
at his proffer being rejected

with a glad shout nerkis sped to tell the
news to his comrades we saw him gesti-
culating eagerly heard a gathering murmur
that rose to a triumphant roar from the ser-
ried ranks as one they turned and raced
toward us formed in solid mass before ark-
on their leader

nerkis stepped forward his voice rang
out exultantly oh arkon they have
heard and they are prepared

arkon gazed at the noble band sadly a
twinge of pain in his fine eyes

faithful loyal comrades heed well be-
fore you bind yourselves irrevocably it is
certain death for all of you

as one came the mighty response we
are prepared

a quiver of emotion darted through me


wonder stories

as i gazed at the glowing faces the light of
high resolve in the eyes of these devoted
youths an insensate desire to join them
in their mad sacrifice impelled me almost
to shout aloud instead i murmured to my-
self morituri te salutamus

even sids eyes flamed as though a vib-
rating cord had been struck in his unemo-
tional breast arkon stood there his face a
mask that hid all emotion then sadly
wearily he spoke very well then be it
as you wish you are about to die the nob-
lest of deaths for the benefit of mankind
through all the ages your unexampled sac-
rifice shall ring out clear and heartening
who shall be the first to go

the power of jed

as one the hundred stepped forward
but nerkis raised his voice as com-
mander of the expedition i claim the honor
for myself oh arkon

a twinge passed like a shadow over ark-
ons face nerkis was dear to him the
post is yours he said simply

just a moment sid interposed first
we must clear away the masters who no
doubt are once more guarding the wood
let every man take his portable disintegra-
tor and also his thought-shield the jed
must not be able to discover our plan it
may be if it were unwarily disclosed he
could find means to forestall it

you are always right arkon responded
gravely do as you have been told earth-
men of neptune

the youths hastened to the great ship to
obtain their weapons and shields in a trice
they were back as thought they begrudged
a moment from gazing on the bright face of
death

the march to the edge of the wood was
on we soon came to the end of our strange
safety zone i peered out cautiously
thousands of masters hovered in their air
boats like wasps about to sting the palace
of the jed was open the great white quartz
ball that housed the brain hung motionless

we who are soon to die salute thee

in the sunlight he was ready had anti-
cipated that we would move against him

our band was carefully distributed hid-
den from view a low command from ark-
on and each disintegrator was brought to
the ready another command and long
slithers of golden flame darted out they
caught the foremost rank of the guards and
before my very eyes that rank was gone
whiffed clean out of existence by the dead-
ly rays again the flames sprang forth and
the second line disappeared from sight

panic seized the masters at the invisible
deadly execution haphazardly they flashed
their ray tubes but the distance was too
great for them to be effective another
blast of pouring death and the masters
broke in wild confusion they were cow-
ardly too long accustomed to depend upon
the might of the jed like wounded birds
they fled from the scene of disaster in an
incredibly short time the great park was
clear except for the sinister ominously mo-
tionless globe of the jed

arkon turned to nerkis fidgeting im-
patiently at his side it is time was all
he said but there was a world of sorrow in
his tone

silently we all shook hands with the
dauntless youth who was going to his death
but there was no fear in his clear eyes only
the great exaltation of a martyr who sees
paradise ahead of him

he walked boldly out of the protection of
the wood disintegrator ready we watched
him go when he cleared the trees he
started to run straight for the jed

the glistening ball began to spin slowly
at first then faster ever faster the sky
darkened weird purple streamers of light
wavered and danced across the heaven a
great wind sprang up that swept howling
over the parkland the very sun dimmed
to a blood red sphere paled and was blotted
out

only the white globe of the jed shown in
the gathering gloom spinning around and
around the white took on a tinge of pur-
ple iridescent colors played and melted on
the revolving surface faster and faster he
whirled around until the myriad colors
merged into one continuous blur
back to  ad



chill fear gripped my heart with an icy
clutch something terrible was going to
happen had we rightly gauged the dread
might of the jed without knowing what
i did i screamed to nerkis to turn back to
give up this mad venture but the daunt-
less youth kept on running at top speed try-
ing desperately to get within firing range of
the foe

suddenly the jed blurred disappeared
it became pitchy dark strain our eyes as
we would we could see nothing through the
impenetrable black nerkis was gone swal-
lowed up

but no there he was again a hundred
eager voices shouted the news jubilantly
the exultation was short lived however a
great cry of incredulous horror arose from
us all for nerkis had been caught in his
headlong pace frozen into a straining sta-
tue poised for the next leap his tall lithe
body was glowing softly a weird phosphor-
escence on the shrouded earth

then before our helpless sight we saw
the glow turn cherry red a blazing trans-
lucence against the pitchy darkness toms
awe-struck words flashed back across my
consciousness-they looked like ghosts
red ghosts- the phantom-like body of
nerkis began to sag melt at the edges
across the expanse of the meadow i could
feel the heat radiated from him then he
ran together into a shapeless shining mass
for all the world like a molten puddle of
metal

shrieks of execration burst from us at
the ghastly sight we shook our fists
in utter fury and would have rushed from
the shelter of the wood had not the cooler
heads of sid and arkon restrained our thirst
for vengeance so instead we waited grit-
ting our teeth

nerkis all that remained of him was just
a blotch on the scorched blackened earth
suddenly the sinister jed appeared whirling
still from deepest violet back to gleam-
ing white the iridescence ran while the speed
of his spinning slowly slackened i could
almost feel the sneering triumph of that
brain

the globe came to a halt hung motion-
less

arkon spoke his voice almost inaudible
the next man goes now and may the eter
nal have mercy on his soul

a gallant youngster sprang out of the
wood like an unleashed hound right
bravely he went to his rendezvous with
death straight for the jed he headed
the great brain case quivered commenced
turfting slowly

a nausea seized me i averted my gaze
from the terrible doom that was overtaking
the lad i dared not looked until once more
i heard the choked voice of arkon repeat
the infinite pathos of the formula the
next man goes now and may the eternal
have mercy on your soul

once again the dread drama was enacted
and again-and again-until i must have
swooned out of sheer pity wtien i awoke
it was to see the world gradually brighten-
ing again and the jed slowing to a motion-
less but that white was not the gleaming
purity with which i had been first dazzled
it was a drab dirty gray it seemed a tired
color

i heard the sound of voices in argument
i looked weakly around the noble com-
pany of neptunians was gone vanished
over on the battered smoking plain lay
countless little heaps that once were men
but there were two who were but half melted
as though the power of the jed had been un-
equal to the complete task i shuddered un-
controllably

charlie was gesticulating violently ap-
parently in heated argument arkon was
answering him slowly gravely

no charlie it is but meet that i shall
follow my brave comrades to their doom
my race will live on if i should perish and
some day repopulate this fair earth but
there are only a handful of you robots and
you must not be permitted to die

the blacks honest face was shining with
the intensity of his earnestness he was
about to retort when a robot flashed by out
of the wood into the death area before
any one could stop him

charlie made as if to rush after him but
arkon laid a restraining hand upon him


wonder stories

there was a sad smile on his gentle coun-
tenance while you and i have been argu-
ing your comrade has devoted himself to
his destruction

the giant robot was literally flying over
the ground once more the jed commenced
his interminable spinning but the dirty
white did not quite run through the gamut
of colors to the fatal violet the globe
wobbled a bit as though it were mortally
tired

the brave black was almost directly be-
neath the jed his disintegrator was raised
before he was caught then he too went
the way of the others but it was a long
struggle and when he finally fell he was
charred and smoking but still a recognizable
human form

at no time had the jed disappeared very
slowly he returned to a russet gray quies-
cence and the great quartz sphere wobbled
drunkenly overcome with fatigue

arkon spoke quietly but with a ring of
steel to his voice it is now my turn to
go and let no man say me nay

with that very steadily he walked out of
the wood charlie gave vent to a short cry
and darted after him sid was at my side
his eyes shining with a blaze i had never
seen in them before he looked at me
queerly by jove its gotten me too
and with that he too was out in the arena
of death

the end of the jed

i shouted to the fool to come back but
he ploughed on unheeding something
snapped within me i couldnt let the silly
ass go alone to his fate like that and the
next minute i was chasing after

a shrill scream of despair sounded behind
me i whirled to see eona running and
stumbling ned ned if you go i go too
i seized her rather roughly urged her to
go back

no she moaned you will die and i
cannot bear to live then

but you must you are too precious too
wonderful to die

but all she answered was wherever you
go i go too

in despair i looked about wildly my
eye caught sight of a robot gazing out of the
wood i beckoned and he came i nod-
ded significantly and to my great joy he
understood he picked up eona with his
four huge arms as easily as if she were a
child and carried her struggling and kick-
ing back to the safety of the wood

relieved in mind though saddened at the
thought that this might prove an eternal
farewell i hastened after the others

already the jed was turning but with
painful slowness he was teetering vio-
lently the reservoir of magnetism was fast
being exhausted the sky darkened but on-
ly slightly

hello cried sid i believe hes almost
reached the end of his rope maybe if we
rush him fast we can get within firing
range before he is able to work up full
power come on

we ran faster than weve ever run before
shouting to the others to follow charlie
broke into a trot but arkon kept up his
dignified even walk he would go to death
grandly nobly

the ground flew beneath -our feet one
hundred yards two hundred-the heat was
growing fearfully intense

three hundred yards and the perspiration
oozed from every pore the jed was spin-
ning faster now

four hundred yards and our hair our
clothes were scorching from the terrific
heat we were gasping for breath the
ground was smoking underneath great
blisters rose on our fevered skins the
dense fuming air was literally a solid wall
at which we threw ourselves just a hun-
dred yards before your weapons could be-
come effective but still we drove on

i was somewhat delirious i staggered
and fell arose and stumbled further my
brain was a mass of fire but one fixed idea
almost insane in its intensity beat and ham-
mered within a few more steps and
youve got him-youve got him-youve got
him

the sky was quite dark now the jed was
approaching the dreaded purple hue the
ground rose and heaved drunkenly beneath
me the fiery torment penetrated to my very
back to  a d



vitals i was losing consciousness when
dimly a far off voice seemed to whisper
let him have it now give him hell
with a great effort i managed to open
my heat seared eyes saw a dim shape close
by me pointing an atomic disintegrator at
something aloft it was sid

how i did it i dont know but a weapon
was in my hand and i pressed it two long
flames leaped like live things through the
swirl of steam caught the violet-tinged spin-
ning sphere squarely

 the bright threads of fire flickered over
the surface slid harmlessly aside the jed
was winning as in a horrible dream i
heard sids desperate tones keep on
shooting for him ned his magnetic field
is shunting off the rays but it cant last
forever weve got to wear him down be-
fore he gets us

still in a dream i keep the tube flicking
out its stream of death i felt rather than
saw charlie and arkon four rays darted
interminably playing and crackling over
the quartz surface	

the ground heaved up to me i swayed
dizzily in the awful heat

suddenly i heard a voice within me the
strange voice of the jed passionless cold
as ever

strangers from an earlier day you have
conquered the great jed is defeated my
store of power is exhausted soon your rays
will not be diverted and then- but i
shall not grant you the boast of having
destroyed me i myself shall will my own
departure this earth shall never see my
equal again farewell

the great quartz globe swelled and
strained and the next instant shattered from
within into a million tiny bits the jed
had cheated us at the very last our aveng-
ing weapons were raised futilely in our
hands the end of the great dominant brain
had come by his own will

almost immediately the infernal heat
relaxed its grip once more the world
was bright and vivid no longer a place of
torment

we four stared at each others blackened
smoking carcasses and laughed insanely i
swayed and would have fallen had not eona
come stumbling for me catching me in her
arms just as i was almost down the last

i	remembered was the cool feel of her soft
flesh on my blistered skin the sweet endear-
ments she lavished on me

they tell me i was delirious for days that
it was only the devoted unremitting nursing
of eona that pulled me through i can well
believe it

when i finally came out of it weak but
whole again i found that the others had
decided on their course of action

arkon was leaving for neptune in the
one-man flier to organize and bring back
the earth-men to their rightful home
charlie was to remain in temporary com-
mand with his robots over the world
had forgotten to state that the cowardly
masters aghast at the death of the invul-
nerable jed had abjectly crawled to make
their peace

sid said well old man its time were
going back to new york ad  ive
a batch of rather important experiments
waiting for me that is sid all over

but i-what could i say naturally i
was homesick for the familiar sights and
sounds of our own time but-there was
eona i could not would not leave her

eona saw the distress in my eyes why
of course youre returning ned and i am
going with you i know now that your time
is what i have beeu longing for all these
years-your time and you in it and so
it came to pass

back east with whom i had kept up a some-
what desultory correspondence and was ov-
erjoyed to receive his prompt answer

your letter he wrote came at an op-
portune moment our organization has



just been in receipt of a communication
from doctor jacobs the physicist who also
resides in tucson asking our help in finding
a competent chemist for some routine work
he wishes done i do not know whether
you have ever heard of doctor jacobs or
not perhaps he was before your time but
years ago he held the chair of physics at
yale and was accounted a brilliant though
somewhat erratic scientist

however owing to the ridicule and bit-
ter controversy his wild theories aroused
among his fellow professors and in the sci-
entific world in general he resigned his
chair at new haven and dropped from sight
you will probably find him an eccentric

something looming something monstrous menac-
myself at this figure   


wonder stories

and very queer but he offers a good salary
and the work is in your line i have writ-
ten him warmly recommending you and
enclosed find a note of introduction

needless to say i lost no time in ap-
proaching doctor jacobs he was an el-
derly man his great height offset by the
decided stoop of narrow shoulders in ap-
pearance he was not
attractive having a
sharp feral face rem-
iniscent of a fox an
effect heightened by
the brush of reddish-
grey hair which swept
back from a high slop-
ing forehead the
work he required was
of a private nature in
the laboratories of his
home on speedway

the big house sat with-
in low stone walls in
untidy lawns burnt out
and gone to seed

a tangle of bushes
grew in the rear of the
house and a giant pep-
per tree in front the
house was a large one
but only a few rooms
were in actual use the
rest being shut away

my own bedroom on
the second floor and
across the corridor
from the doctors was
big and cheerless mrs

reynolds tried bright-
ening it for me with
a few cretonne hang-
ings and knick-knacks

at first i paid little
attention to mrs rey-
nolds she did not sleep on the premises
but came to work every morning at eight
and left for her own home after the even-
ing meal but as the weeks and months
passed her quiet charm and well-bred poise
grew on me however this is not a story
of my romance with mrs reynolds

suffice it to say that i soon grew in the

habit of walking with her to the bus ol
offering to take her to the theatre she
told me that her husband had died of tu-
berculosis occasionally she accepted my
invitations but our real intimacy did not
develop until after the terrible and uncan-
ny occurrences i am going to relate

quickly discovered
that by nature and
training doctor jacobs
was a quiet secretive
man he spoke little
and had no friends that
i could see but this
jibed with my own
temperament perhaps
i had better make it
plain that i am not of
an inquisitive or in-
quiring turn of mind
though i had spent
years of my life in a
chemical laboratory i
had not the least in-
terest in chemistry ac-
cepting my job and
profession merely as
means of making a liv-
ing in the research
establishment i had
been one of a half hun-
dred other routine men
who received orders
compounded chemicals
without bothering as to
the meaning of it all

but i am a consci-
entious routine man
and a conscientious
routine man was what
doctor jacobs wanted
i mixed his prescrip-
tions according to for-
mulae noted the results and passed the in-
formation with the compounds along to
him the work was light and the hours
far from arduous generally i was through
at one oclock and the doctor at that hour
taking over the laboratory and dismissing
me

once i noticed him regarding me curi-

 nr he true test of a won-w
der story is the an-
swer to the question de-
spite the strangeness of this
yarn does it seem realistic
does it have the touch of
truth about it

in the stories of frqjicis
flagg the answer is inevit-
ably yes for our author
has the undoubted ability to
convince us even against our
will that the strange things
that he describes so well
could really happen

we are getting too close
to the production of proto-
plasm in our laboratories to
scoff at it any more from
both america and mexico
at the time of this writing
there come authentic stories
of technicians coming closer
and closer to the secret of
what is organic life we
cannot of course tell what
the learning of this secret
may mean to us it may not
mean that we can produce
living things of a high com-
plexity such as man but it
will mean in any case that
our prosy world will be dis-
turbed in a manner suggest-
i ed by mr flagg as it never 
has been before	p
the synthetic monster



ously i think now that he was hungry to
confide in some one that if i had shown
more interest more scientific curiosity he
would have unburdened himself of his plans
and intentions

do you never wonder what the purpose
may be of all those experiments i have you
make he asked i shook my head with
a smilej

none i answered that is your busi-
ness sir he made no reply at the time
but one day he called me into his private
laboratory and workshop a place i had
hitherto never entered situated on the sec-
ond floor and pointed at a strange ma-
chine which stood in the center of the
room what do you think of that ed-
wards he queried

i examined the mech-
anism perfunctorily it
appeared to be a haphaz-
ard arrangement of crys-
tal and glass tubes elec-
trodes a carbon-arc de-
vice and a container full
of dark metallic fluid
with a slightly yellow
tinge

that fluid said doc-
tor jacobs quietly is the
result of all your labors

then he turned from the
machine and drew atten-
tion to what appeared to
be a viscous mass of jelly
lying on a white-topped
table and that he said ah if you
knew what that was and if the stupid dolts
who ridiculed my theories knew

he spoke the last sentence with concen-
trated passion and seized me by the shoul-
der it was the first time i had ever ob-
served him show much emotion perhaps
if i had responded to that emotion with
some display of eagerness he would have
confided in me there and then but truth
to tell the thought ran through my mind
that he was a harmless old eccentric a
crank and perhaps the thought registered
on my face

at any rate as if ashamed of his excite-
ment he dropped his hand and in his nor-

mal voice said you might get after that
number three formula edwards ill be
needing quite a quantity of it

i waited a moment after his palpable dis-
missal but the opportunity of winning the
doctors confidence had passed never to
present itself again though i worked with
him day after day sometimes under his per-
sonal direction and always with him tramp-
ing in and out of the laboratory we were
as much strangers to one another as on the
day i entered his employ i believe that in
some obscure fashion he despised me for
my lack of scientific initiative however
that may be his one outburst was his last
and i never saw the inside of his private
laboratory again until   

a gruesome sight

it was acold and rainy
evening in december
i had seen mrs reynolds
as far as the bus return-
ing i let myself in at the
front entrance and walked
up the wide staircase i
made no particular effort
to be silent i was think-
ing to be exact of laura
mrs reynolds of how
sweet and desirable her
face had looked smiling
at me from the bus win-
dow before the vehicle
whirled her away the
rain had dampened her hair-she wore no
hat-and the wind had whipped a glowing
color into her usually pale cheeks

it came over me with a wave of self-
pity that i was returning to a cheerless
womanless habitat why i wondered had
i lacked the courage to accompany her all
the way home perhaps she would have
invited me in i would have met her sister
and the little niece she often mentioned
there might have been an hour or two of
delightful talk an hour or two of watching
the vivid emotions coming and going on
her lovely face while her eyes forget-me-
not blue now and then met my own

immersed in such thought i say

wonder stories

climbed the stairs and stepped onto the up-
per landing it was in darkness save for
a stream of light which came from the half-
open door of doctor jacobs private lab-
oratory passing the door i glanced in
the doctor was standing with his back to-
wards me bending over a long low table
outside the wind was beating the branches
of the pepper tree against the house with
a great deal of force doctor jacobs neither
saw nor heard me i knew that he was
growing quite deaf and the noise of the
wind and the tree was certainly loud enough
to cover the sound of my approach to even
keener ears

i glanced in i say and saw the machine
mentioned once before standing to one side
of the room i saw the tables littered with
all kinds of laboratory paraphernalia i
saw the doctor as i have described but it
was not the sight of these things which
brought me to an abrupt stop staring with
opn mouth no it was the sight of the
body lying on the table over which the
doctor bent and which with long gleaming
surgical knives he was busy carving and
mutilating

	it was only a moment that i stood glar-
ing then as the doctor straightened and
made to turn i fled along the passage to
my own room good god i asked myself
what could it mean for while the body
had been too mutilated for me to grasp
but the vaguest concept of its outlines there
could be no mistaking the nature of the
clear pink skin which covered its dissev-
ered portions the doctor had been cutting
and slicing flesh-human flesh

 i will not attempt to describe my chao-
tic emotions the man is mad i told my-
self stark staring mad he has murdered
someone if this first thought of mine sounds
somewhat bizarre you must recollect that
from the moment of entering the doctors
employ i had thought him a little touched
but as my first horror subsided i began to
think more sanely

what i had seen was the doctor dissect-
ing a corpse-a dead body he had probably
obtained from some graveyard or poor-
house such cadavers could be obtained
i knew though with some trouble but why

was the doctor dissecting and how had he
managed to smuggle the body into the
house the latter part of the question was
easy to answer mrs reynolds often went
away for two hours in the afternoon and i
myself generally took long walks but it
was gruesome to think of the body of some
poor devil being carved into pieces next
door to where one slept the sight of those
gleaming surgical knives had made my flesh
creep filled me with a species of loathing

the impulse did come to seek the doctor
tell him what i had seen and ask for an
explanation if i only had but the truth
is i am by nature a timid person not a
coward exactly a coward would not have
rushed to mrs reynolds rescue on that
last fatal evening but certainly i lacked
determination and initiative at any rate
i put off interviewing the doctor that night
and when i me him in the morning he was
his quiet secretive self so much so that
every time i opened my mouth i lacked the
courage to proceed

what is it edwards he demanded
once rather irritably the impatience show-
ing not in his voice but in the way he
lifted his brows if he had displayed any
emotion out of the ordinary acted in any
singular fashion i believe i should have
blurted out what i wanted to say but as it
was what business of mine could it be if
he chose to dissect a body doubtless the
dissecting had something to do with the
experiments he was engaged in better keep
still and not risk losing a perfectly con-
genial job and employer by unwanted in-
quisitiveness

so i reasoned and so to my everlasting
regret i acted-or failed to act i believe
now that if i had approached the doctor
questioned him that he would have taken
me into his confidence and that the
knowledge so gained might have been the
means of saving him from a hideous fate
and mrs reynolds from an experience that
almost unseated her reason however it is
too late to speculate on that now talking
to mrs reynolds the next evening i men-
tioned what i had seen the previous night

but indeed mr edwards you must be
mistaken she exclaimed
the synthetic monster



no i said it was human flesh

but how could that be the doctor
called me to clean up for him in his labor-
atory this morning-he does that about
once or twice a month-and the knives you
mention were lying on the table dirty and
the table itself i cleaned i saw nothing of
any body besides if you saw what you say
you did there would be blood on the knives
and table would there not but ere
wasnt

i suppose so i said wondering if by
any manner of means or trick of lighting
my eyes could have played me false real-
ly i never dissected a dead body so i cant
say did you clean the sink closet too
yes

and there was nothing to excite your
curiosity

only some sticky and jelly-like sub-
stance on the table and adhering to the
knives with a peculiarly bad smell there
was a lot of it in the sink i turned up my
nose at it and doctor jacobs laughed
which is more than he ever does for
me i bantered changing the subject

shadows in the night

the thing was a mystery i gave it up
and had almost forgotten the incident
when a still more uncanny occurrence threw
my mind into a turmoil about a month
after that i have related on a clear sunny
afternoon i was returning from a walk and
about to enter the house when glancing up
at the upper hall window immediately over
the front doorway i was frozen in my tracks
by seeing the face of something dreadful
staring down at me

i cannot describe that face i saw it but
momentarily but it was flat and white
and hairless with a wide protruding
sucker-like mouth-that was the impression
-which writhed and glued itself to the win-
dow-glass and made blubbering noises i
did not hear those noises but have you
never seen objects which you instinctively
connect with and change into sound for
perhaps twenty seconds this nightmare coun-
tenance glared into my own then with a
jerk it was gone and released from the

spell which had rooted me to the spot i
staggered around to the back door and made
my way into the kitchen mrs reynolds
looked at me with concern why what
is the matter she asked in alarm i did
not mention the cause of my condition 
bad no wish to frighten her needlessly
the heat i murmured

but it isnt hot today its quite cold

i cursed myself for a fool

just a dizzy spell i said as calmly as i
could perhaps a drink of water     
but she made me sit down and sip a cup
of hot coffee that she hastily brewed the
color came back into my face the beverage
imparted some courage to my heart final-
ly i summoned enough resolution to climb
the steps to my room

nothing was in the upper hallway i
met the doctor descending the steps he
looked at me sharply there seemed to be
a suppressed excitement in his manner or
perhaps that was only my imagination i
couldnt decide i sat on the edge of the
bed and wondered if i could really be los-
ing my mind first there was the matter
of the doctor carving human flesh alnd now
this could my eyes be playing me tricks
but my eyes had never given me any bother
i had in fact always enjoyed excellent
sight no i felt sure that i couldnt lay
the blame on my eyes but still there was
the face i had seen

ghosts was the place haunted

i laughed at the idea i did not believe
in ghosts and anyway ghosts could not
harm me it was creatures of flesh and
blood that frightened me-or so i told my-
self yet passing down the darkening cor-
ridor and staircase to my dinner i was con-
scious of that prickling sensation which runs
over the skin and the scalp when one is in
a nervous and jumpy mood at the table
i came almost near questioning the doctor
-almost not quite

i must be seeing things i said with a
nervous laugh he raised his head with a
jerk and stared at me from under forbidding
brows faces i said watching him
closely for the effect of my words flat
eyeless faces with mouths but his ex-
pression did not aher


wonder stories

indigestion he said bruskly some-
thing doesnt agree with you better watch
your diet

two nights later i awoke to hear some-
thing in my room the night being close
i had foolishly left my door open to create
a circuit of fresh air from the window

whats that i called sharply there
was no answer but i heard the slithering
sound of something being shuffled not lifted
along the floor leaping from bed i fum-
bled for the light-switch losing precious
seconds in my frightened haste while the
sound of slithering retreated rapidly

at last i found the switch turned on the
lights and ran into the hall the hall of
course was in darkness the light streaming
from my doorway only partially dispelling
the gloom the sudden radiance had also
dazzled my vision yet i thought that i
saw something gliding into the doctors pri-
vate laboratory the door of which was
ajar

even as i sprang forward with a shout
the doctors bedroom door opened and he
came out in his pajamas the electric light
back of him framing his tall stopped figure
and chasing the shadows from that end of
the hall his face however was veiled in
obscurity

whats the matter edwards he de
manded excitedly why are you chasing
about at this hour

something i said was in my room
nonsense he declared but i sensed the
agitation his voice could not conceal

but there was i persisted i heard
it moving around and what is more i
saw it too whatever it was entered your
laboratory

i think said the doctor in calmer tones
that you have had a nightmare but to
show you that you are mistaken i will look
into the laboratory of course

he stepped forward swiftly switch-
ed on the lights from the doorway en-
tered and closed the door after him after
a few moments he came out again this time
springing the yale lock which automatically
locked the door as he pulled it shut

there is nothing in there he said brief-
ly the place is empty

i did not believe him for i had seen what
he without his glasses had evidently over-
looked a track of dampness as of water or
oil which led from my chamber to the labor-
atory entrance however i said no more
but retired to my room all my uneasiness
as to supernatural visitants vanished that
trail had been made by some living creature
doctor jacobs was concealing something in
his laboratory-something which he desired
to keep from my knowledge

i tried to conjecture what it could be a
monkey a dog but a monkey or dog could
not have made that continuous track they
would have left the impress of paws that
track had been left by something that slith-
ered scuffled along something that crawled
-like a snake but here i brought myself
up with a jerk the thing i had glimpsed
however briefly and in the gloom had cer-
tainly not been a snake

from pondering the nature of the con-
cealed creature my thoughts turned to a
consideration of the doctor himself i be-
gan to wonder about his mental state after
all could he be called entirely sane a
man of an introspective and brooding tem-
perament without friends or intimates who
had evidently given his life over to a pur-
suit of that which had become a mania with
him

geniuses were like this of course but so
also were madmen from the first i had
thought the doctor queer but sensible
enough but of late there could be no blink-
ing the fact that his queerness had increas-
ed even mrs reynolds had commented on
the change in his manner as quiet and
secretive as ever his quietness and secrecy
had changed radically from that of the first
months i spent in his employ and seemed
now based on a suppressed excitement which
showed itself in a certain tenseness of fea-
tures of abrupt movements punctuated every
so often with irritable explosions

sometimes for hours at a time the floor
of his private laboratory was the ceiling
over the main one where i worked i could
hear him pacing restlessly back and forth
back and forth when he came to his meals
the synthetic monster



he ate little i knew that he was sleeping
less

what was he seeking to discover that kept
him many hours and sometimes all through
the night experimenting  working  but
now that my curiosity was aroused the op-
portunity for gratifying it had passed doc-
tor jacobs had no intention of confiding in
me and before the intimidation of his man
mer my courage shrank until it was actually
impossible for me to question him

and in relation to his own work there was
the matter of my own at first the com-
pounds had varied and i had produced them
by the ounce and pint but towards the
end during the last six months a certain
amount of those compounds became stand-
ardized and of these i mixed not ounces
and pints but pounds and gallons yes
pounds and gallons which poured into his
private laboratory

what did he do with it all i remembered
the machine he had shown me the viscous
jelly-like mass on the table his words came
back to me ah if you knew what that
was and if the stupid dolts who ridiculed
my theories knew

what had it been i cursed the stupidity
which had led me to rebuff the doctors con-
fidence by lack of interest whatever it was
 assured myself it was not what the poor
deluded doctor thought it to be palpably
was laboring under a delusion as long
as that delusion took a harmless form there
was no cause for worry but when it caused
him to secrete strange creatures in his labor-
atory creatures that prowled around at
nights and disturbed people then it was
something else again the creature how-
ever was not big and plainly timorous at
large only through accident and fleeing at
the sound of a voice

nonetheless i retrieved my old colt re-
volver from the bottom of my trunk where
it had lain for years wrapped in oily rags
and loaded it with care and after that one
experience i locked my door for i remem-
bered the face i had seen looking out of the
window and i wondered if the creature had
that face 

in the morning mrs reynolds asked me

if i knew who had made the oily tracks all
over the dining-room and kitchen

ugh she said it smells like that
greasy stuff in the doctors laboratory

n i saw that the tracks were the same as
those running between my own bedroom and
the laboratory door

and someone she went on aggrieved
has eaten practically all the bread and the
roast i prepared yesterday for tonights din-
ner

perhaps i said the doctor got hungry
during the night

thinking of the doctor made me ask her
a question

when did you last clean the private
laboratory

a week ago thursday gone

and there was nothing in it to excite
your curiosity-no animal for instance
she looked at me in amazement why of
course not what makes you ask such a
question

nothing i stammered nothing at all
i did not tell her of what had happened
during the night  there was no need i re-
flected to alarm her unduly she slept at
home and through the day i vowed to be
always within call if only i had suspected
the terrible thing which was to happen with-
in the week but then if i had suspected it
it would probably never have happened

the face    the face

the week passed without further alarm
but i noticed the increasing change in
doctor jacobs demeanor he had become
more than ever engrossed in his experiment
calling for larger and larger quantities of
standardized compounds his manner be-
came feverishly nervous and intense and
when once i ventured to ask him if he were
ill he replied explosively that his health
was no concern of mine

he missed many of his meals entirely and
mrs reynolds remarked that he was making
himself ill i must admit that to all her
inquiries he returned courteous if somewhat
impatient answers yet in that last week
he did an unusual thing for some time
mrs reynolds had keen missing loaves ol


wonder stories

bread overnight now the doctor ordered
six loaves of bread daily and many pounds
of cheap cuts of raw meat which he carried
to his laboratory

but what is it for questioned mrs
reynolds of me it cant be possible that
he is eating it himself

i shook my head i was afraid that the
strain of too intensive work had unseated
the doctors reason i contemplated beard-
ing him in his den but testified for lack of
courage i wonder if i can make it clear
just how intimidating a man doctor jacobs
was i did think of discussing the situation
with some third person outside of our house-
hold but i had few acquaintances no inti-
mate friends and it was easy to procrastin-
ate and let the days glide by

that i am sorry now for my lack of de-
cision and courage goes without saying but
the ordering of bread and meat in large
quantities really went on only over a period
of four days from wednesday to saturday
this phenomenon did alarm me more than
i dared confess to mrs reynolds besides
the sight of the doctors haggard face was
disturbing

i am doubtful if he slept at all during the
last week sometimes i heard him mutter-
ing to himself once he gave a sharp laugh
and clapped his hands yes i decided he
must be crazy now i know that he was
only expressing his triumph triumph
over 

many a time i crept to the private labora-
tory door and listened intently if there
were something confined in there it kept
reasonably quiet i could hear the doctor
moving about even hear what seemed to
be a stamping and slithering sound but
these latter noises could be ascribed to the
machine to the wielding of a hammer yet
there must be something inside the room
with him something alive that could eat
for there was the meat the bread the crea-
ture that had aroused me one night so i
watched and listened and waited and then
on saturday night it happened

after dinner on that fatal evening i had
gone to my room to shave and change my
clothes for i was going to take mrs rey-
nolds to a talkie at the fox theatre

the doctor had not come to the table
much disturbed and without telling me her
intention mrs reynolds arranged some food
on a tray and carried it upstairs to the lab-
oratory it was getting dusk the hall-light
not yet turned on but there was sufficient
light coming through the big hall-window
for one to see his way through the corridor 
she knocked on the laboratory door
found it ajar pushed it open and entered
i was fastening my collar in front of the
bureau mirror when i heard the crash of
the tray and its contents as they struck the
floor mrs reynolds voice went up up
in a terrified scream even as i threw open
my door and leapt into the hall she scream-
ed again a scream that expired in mid-
utterance again and again in her delirium
she told what happened the face she
babbled the face and then  god its
got me got me but that was later

i heard her scream from the laboratory
i say and thought the doctor had at last
gone violently insane and was killing her
i thought  but even as i thought i
hurled myself down the hallway through
the laboratory all cowardice swallowed up
in the danger of the woman i loved

laura i mouthed calling her by the
name that so far i had dared only utter to
myself sick with fear my heart leaping like
mad laura

she did not answer mercifully she had
swooned

the monster in the dark



moment before there had been suf-
ficient light by which to see but at
that indeterminate period between day and
night darkness comes swiftly and already
the interior of the laboratory was shrouded
in gloom yet through that gloom i saw
something looming something monstrous
menacing i hurled myself at this dimly
seenfigure i beat at it with my fists

i was creaming cursing then a flailing
limb of what i now realized was not doctor
jacobs but the hideous creature he kept
secreted in the room the creature that de-
voured the bread and meat felled me to the
the synthetic monster



floor i fell across the body of mrs rey-
nolds

dazed and on hands and knees i dragged
her to safety through the doorway and into
the hall behind me i could hear blubber-
like noises noises horrible indescribable i
think the monstrous creature was rooting
for the food spilled on the floor perhaps
that was what allowed me to gain the hall-
way without interference

even as i did so the lights in the hall
came on and i saw the doctor standing over
me with wild distorted face it has since
been my guess that he must have been worn
out mentally and physically from his days
and nights of constant experimenting and
gone to his bedroom for some needed rest
in his utterly exhausted condition he must
have forgotten to lock the laboratory door
-as he had forgotten once before-and so
left the way open for mrs reynolds to
enter

damn you i screamed look she is
dead it is your fault your fault youve
killed her with your damnable monster
killed

but he dashed past me without a word
entertaing the laboratory slamming shut the
door after him the yale lock catching i
heard his voice rise as if in a rapid stream
of curses then there was a crash it sound-
ed like the machine toppling over came
the noise of interlocked bodies swaying
struggling tre blubber-like noises rose
rose intermingled with shrieks with gasping
groans and cries which could emanate from
no one but the doctor himself the doctor
was fighting for his life but i thought only
of mrs reynolds

the doctor must do the best he could to
attempt going to his rescue might loose the
terrible monstrosity on the woman i loved
so i picked up her still unconscious body
and staggered down the steps in the hall
below was a telephone taking down the
receiver i yelled into the mouthpiece mur-
der murder police police murder

at last the police came it seemed like
hours until they did but in reality couldnt
have been more than ten minutes when
they broke into the laboratory the thing was
already mortally wounded dying and the

doctor  but before i tell what happened
to the doctor let me seek to give an inkling of
the origin of the creature which was to be
his death

i know that the explanation will sound
wild and incredible learned doctors of
science will probably point out the absolute
impossibility of such a thing as for the
average layman he will believe me a raving
fool but there is my own experience for
what it is worth and the evidence of the
doctors diary found in his chamber the
diary is quite exhaustive but unfortunately
the doctor had failed or been too careful
to give any but the vaguest reference to the
construction of the machine destroyed in
his battle for life

from it however i have taken the fol-
lowing widely separated entries perhaps
they will serve to make clear the seemingly
incredible thing the doctor accomplishedand
establish once and for all the origin of his
murderer the first entry i quote was made
in  a few days before my employment

june th i am on the right track af-
ter years of laborious research and disap-
pointment i begin to see light doctor
hammets experiments with proliferation of
root tips and with the stimulation of re-
production in paramecium prove but one
thing sulphur is the basic constituent i
have been looking for sulphur

have manufactured synthetic protoplasm
god what would they say-they who flout-
ed scorned me and my theories it was
very simple after all infra-red and ultra-
violet rays filtered and diffused through
certain arranged crystals and prisms the
reaction on the compound has created the
basic stuff of life itself protoplasm 

august st i have shown edwards the
machine the protoplasm he does not
recognize the latter i was tempted to take
him further into my confidence oh if
there was only some one to whom i could

fifty hours of relentless torture was the price he must
pay if he refused the secret

a room of bare concrete two men stood
to face the black bearded man

our countries are at war-
you and i are enemies and let
of you to tell them what they want
to know for i would not willingly condemn
any human being to the torture you are
about to undergo

the other whose face was white and
whose jaw was set smiled grimly

sir you are a hypocrite i happen to
know that the device is of your own inven-
tion

true i conceived it myself-true it was
built under my supervision but i acted
under orders they told me to devise a
method of extracting information from cap-

tured prisoners and i have done it the
council has sent you to me and i will not
hesitate to obey its orders i love my coun-
try sir-as much as you do yours

the noble council that must torture a
helpless man mocked the other

the black-bearded man flushed but re-
mained calm

a little after the beginning of this cen-
tury he said seriously the nations of the
earth joined against each other in a struggle
which we still know by the name of the
world war it was a struggle of brute
force tens of thousands of men clashed
together hacking each other with knives
called bayonets or disembowelling each
other at short range with gunpowder pro-
jectiles true they made rudimentary t-

ki

tempts to smother each other with gases-
true they engaged in petty squabbles above
the ground in their suicidal flying planes
but these were merely side-shows the bas-
ic principle of the affair was the man-to-
man combat at that time therefore-

you can spare me your history lessons
i hope interrupted the other impatiently

the man raised his hand i have good
reason for saying what i do he insisted
at that time therefore the importance of
any particular man-even of one in com-
mand of his fellows-was not great and
his capture was an event of no particular
significance he might have some minor
information on strategy but the method of
attack was so cut and dried as to be never
in doubt if a captured man were a spy

his captors usually were contented to threat-
en him with death and if he told them
nothing to stand him against a wall and
shoot him

in  however it is different in
these days of scientific warfare the import-
ance of the individual has been greatly en-
hanced the destructive knowledge that one
man can hold in his brain is enormous--
awful

the council has reason to believe that
you know the particulars of an attack which
is to be launched against us every destruc-
tive agency has its antidote-every attack
its defence and that is why you must tell
us what you know

that is why i will not tell you what i
know

we found you rolled up in a corner and
beside you was the strangest machine i
have ever seen
wonder stories

that we shall see dr thorne

thorne remained silent for the last
two days since his capture he had heard
nothing but threats and now they irritated
rather than frightened him for hours at
a time he had been
heckled and browbeat-
en by the most vigor-
ous members of the
council but not one
scrap of information
had he divulged as
a last resort they had
sent him to bjornsen
the great scientist and
inventor whom two
short years ago-be-
fore the outbreak of
the war-he would
have been proud to call
his friend

a hot anger gripped
him friend never
could he forgive
bjornsen for this hum-
iliation of a fellow
scientist after trying
his other methods of
browbeating him they
had put him in this
place of bare concrete

and now bjornsen had
come with more
threats hate gleam-
ed in his eyes	

bjornsen i will
never tell you what our
attack will be you
will never know until
it comes and you are as
helpless as a child in
our hands-you your
wise council and your
whole nation

you began this
war but we shall end
it he continued tauntingly and you are
helpless we shall not use anything so old-
fashioned as poison gas so childish as pro-
jected disease bacilli or so unsatisfactory
as destructive atomic force no our
plans are made the day is set and-

enough bjornsens face was working
with fear and fury he pressed a button in
the wall by his side

i think you are a little too sure of your-
self dr thorne i have warned you i
have tried to be decent
to you now all of that
is at an end

heavy muffled

footsteps sounded
in the corridor two
muscular negroes ap-
peared pushing gin-
gerly between them a
strange machine it
was squat and heavy-
looking like an up-
right eggsmall end up-
permost and resting
upon three broad rub-
ber-shod wheels the
top was surmounted
by a small sharp
spike other spikes
stuck out maliciously
from the body and all
of them were colored a
dark green shiny rad-
iant malignant

thorne was silent
staring at the contri-
vance in utter amaze-
ment

at a guttural word
from bjornsen they
released it in the mid-
dle of the floor across
which it started slow-
ly moving one of the
negroes handed him
what appeared to be a
belt made of oblong
iron blocks chained to-
gether this he cast
clanking into a corner
and then thorne felt a cold sensation in
his stomach he gazed wide-eyed the
crawling thing was turning slowly-turning
in the direction of the belt

the black-bearded man regarded it lov-
ingly you are surprised i think he

tlfan as he progresses
upward is supposed to
become more civilized not
only in the general conduct
of his life but also in his
dealing with his fellowman
but that has not been true
in the case of warfare for
the horrors that the average
soldier was exposed to the
last war was unsurpassed
it was only in the treatment
of wounded and mangled
men that we were able to
demonstrate at all that
civilized qtethod

the great war differed
from the others in that men
were killed in greater num-
bers and more quickly
and because we have learn-
ed that new science allied to
the old method of making
war with bomb bullet and
bayonet destroys not only
the vanquished but also the
victor future wars may be
fought upon saner methods
after all it is not necessary
for two armies to decimate
each other in order to deter-
mine a victor science
should be able to provide a
means to put men and arm-
ies hors de combat without
inflicting more than tem-
porary damage upon the
soldiers our author has
conceived of such a weapon
and upon it he has built a
n truly prophetic story
the green torture



aid with a mocking smile his fury had
abated and he spoke maliciously-cruelly

i will explain to you my pretty crawling
thing it is powered by a battery which
will propel it for fifty hours you see that
it is moving towards the metal in the corner
that is mysterious-eh

thorne said nothing from the belt of
the other hung a small ray pistol a sud-
den leap might get it   

that is mysterious only to you bjorn-
sen continued the metal yonder is high-
ly magnetized within my toy is a magne-
tic needle which controls its movements
thus it has-ah-it has-an affinity that
is good-eh he chuckled and it is
so shaped that it will not
lie upon its back like a
turtle ah no that
would make it helpless-
eh

also i should warn
you very earnestly-for
it concerns you-that the
prongs are needle-sharp
and are coated-pay at-
tention-are coated with
a peculiar poisonous veg-
etable substance from the
region of the amazon
river there the natives
use it on the missiles
which they hurl the
slightest prick 

he laughed-but did not
complete his sentence

thorne was scarcely listening to this har-
angue although he vaguely realized its dead-
ly import he was tensing himself for a
spring

i had thought of an alternative the man
continued conversationally i had thought
of attaching a compartment filled with one
of my poison gases which would be released
when my toy met with any resistance but
i prefer the prongs the gas seemed too-
too-what shall i say-too anesthetic
you see i-

at this point thorne leaped the man
jumped back

seize him he shouted like two great
cats the negroes were upon him and his

struggles were useless

hold him ordered bjomsen ha walk-
ed over and picked up the belt towards
which the strange thing was relentlessly
moving this he pulled around the waist
of the struggling thome he snapped a
padlock and stood back rubbinghis hands

you and my toy he said calmly shall
play a game of hide and seek together-in
the dark to aid you you will notice that
i have placed a small green light at each
end of my toy i hope that you will watch
it carefully i have found that it requires
about twenty seconds to cross this floor
oh yes it has been used the last man
that played the game told us what we wanted
after twenty hours a
sad case though he is
now completely insane
shaking his head sadly
he spoke to the negroes
they released thorne
and went into the passage-
way thome stood still
he could think of nothing
to say or do the black-
bearded man bowed cere-
moniously

i hope that you will
not be cold he said
i am sorry that i cannot
let you have more clothes
however you will find
yourself becoming warm
naturally when you
want me you have only to
press this button in the wall you should
shift your position soon goodbye 

he slipped into the passageway and
slammed the heavy door

the torture begins

thorne felt a sensation of relief that
he was alone he looked around him
curiously the room was square about fif-
teen feet across and absolutely bare the
walls and floor were of concrete in the
ceiling gleamed a white dome of light

slowly he became conscious of a soft
whirring sound behind him he looked
down less than three inches from his leg

wonder stories

pointed the green prongs the light sud-
denly went out absolute blackness envel-
oped him he stumbled blindly forward
and crashed against the wall he faced
around panting and shaking

and then as his eyes became accustomed
to the darkness he saw the green light it
was small and dim it cast no gleam eye-
ing it intently the man felt his way along
the wall to the farthest corner of the room

he sat on the floor for he knew that he
must conserve his strength and the iron belt
was very heavy he was not frightened
now the ease with which he had evaded
the thing gave him confidence twenty
seconds to get to him it would take   

he sat about reviewing in his mind the
conversation with bjornsen he shouldnt
have lost his temper that had been a mis-
take still he hadnt told them anything
useful they could never guess-never
his mind travelled back to the time of his
great discovery-over a year ago now

he remembered how he had been exper-
imenting in his laboratory with new high
frequency radio waves for the control of
air-torpedoes how by co-ordinating a ser-
ies of oscillators he had achieved high fre-
quencies never before dreamed of-a mil-
lion kilocycles and more how his whole
body had been gripped as by an awful pow-
er how the world had gone black before his
eyes and he had known no more

vividly he recalled his recovery two days
later in the hospital and his consultation
with the puzzled doctor who said he had
suffered complete paralysis of the nerves
but could suggest no cause

with typical scientific curiosity thorne
had set to work to solve the mystery the
fact that his laboratory assistant had suf-
fered in exactly the same way was the clue
that finally led to his astounding discov-
ery-that radio waves passing through the
body within a certain range of very high
frequencies attack the nerves producing a
temporary complete paralysis

and yet it was not unbelievable as he
had pointed out many times since then
electromagnetic waves affect the optic
nerves only within a very narrow range of

frequencies there are many other colors
than those that we see such as red violet
blue green   

green

as he thought his eyes had been fastened
upon the green light it was the only use
for them the darkness was so complete
that he could see no part of his own body

he grew puzzled then uneasy it should
be moving he knew yet it appeared to be
perfectly stationary the whirring sound
had never ceased

suddenly nervously he leaped to his feet
the realization of what this meant had come
to him he could not see it move the
only tool of perspective left to him-that
of change in size-was gone he felt his
way hurriedly along the wall turned a cor-
ner and moved on until he could see no
green light at all he knew that he must
be opposite the side of the machine he
stood absolutely still straining his eyes

a speck appeared-moved-he could tell
that it was moving slowly sideways-then
it became stationary and he knew that
the thing had turned and was once more
coming steadily towards him he remained
motionless as long as he could but the
thought of being in that direct line was un-
nerving again he stumbled along the wall
he sank to the floor in a corner only to
struggle to his feet again and move un-
easily on he was losing his sense of the
passage of time twenty seconds to cross
the floor bjornsen had said two minutes
-twenty minutes-an hour-it was all the
same

the room was a room no longer it was
an endless wall which scraped his skin as
he fled-which bumped and jarred him at
its corners

hunted by a relentless green death in a
timeless and spaceless darkness the man
trembled the palms of his hands were
clammy he moved in spasmodic jerks
breathing unevenly

the man became tired the realization
that he was wasting precious energy slowly
calmed him

i must keep my head he muttered
 must
the green torture



for the first time his thoughts turned
on the jjiachine itself surely a sense-
less thing could not hunt a man to his death
it was inconceivable he struggled for a
minute to remove the belt but realized the
futility of that no he must attack the
thing itself	j

he followed the wall until no green light
was visible breathing heavily he crept out
across the floor he tried to guide himself
by the whirring sound but it seemed to come
from everywhere suddenly a green light
appeared clenching his fists and setting
his teeth the man walked deliberately tow-
ards it as far as he dared then he circled
quickly and knew that he must be almost
at the side of the thing he thought that the
whirring was louder he leaned over and
reached down

with a cry he leaped back in the nick
of time he had remembered the deadly green
spike on top he must approach it from
below calming himself he got to his
knees he reached his hand along the
floor-farther-farther   

he touched something hard and smooth
it was vibrating softly feeling his way
carefully he maneuvered until he had a
hand on each side-his fingers beneath it
he was going to lift it as high as he could
and dash it to the floor he got to his
feet and pulled upwards with all his
strength the thing was unbelievably
heavy he raised it a few inches then his
fingers gave away and he fell backwards
there was a loud bump but the soft whirr-
ing never ceased

nerving himself he returned to the at-
tack he would turn it on its back per-
haps bjornsen had lied to him by a series
of careful maneuvers he got both hands
under one side and heaved he leaped
back against the wall trembling the thing
had righted itself so quickly that the cold
metal had grazed his ankle he remembered
a toy he had once like this it would rest
in no position except on its base

he would try once more he stood with
his back against the wall his legs wide
apart and waited he could not tell how

long he waited but suddenly the thing wag

very near the light was almost beneath
him now he could see its slow advance
he tensed himself he was terribly afraid
but he did not move and then as it seemed
about to press itself upon him he jumped
sideways and then what he had hoped
for happened the whirring ceased the
light stopped in its advance and he knew
that the deadly prongs were against the
wall

he knew that there were prongs at the
other end he knew that the devilish thing
could reverse itself but he blindly hoped
that because it was stopped it would not
start again he crossed the floor he held
his breath to his ears came the soft
steady purr he sank to the floor sobbing

he knew that he could not leave the wall
again never again could he approach that
awful machine voluntarily he must flee-
flee continually-how long fifty hours
his tormenter had said that meant noth-
ing what was an hour how   

light-dazzling blinding he clapped
his hands to his eyes it was some minutes
before he could see-see the thing approach-
ing from the center of the floor-squat im-
placable quickly he looked away on
the floor by the door lay food and water
in a paper cup he knew that he was
being watched

high in the door was a porthole of heavy
glass faintly he heard a laugh a mad
anger gripped him he ran at the mach-
ine and beat its hard sides with his fists
the light went out his terror returning
with the darkness he retreated hit heavily
against the wall and fell

he tried to close his eyes to shut out the
green light but he could not he must
watch it it held him he felt that he could
not move he heard his heart-beatsblend-
ed with the soft purr behind that dull
green menacing eye it was coming-com-
ing   

with a shuddering sigh he t staggered to
his feet he couldnt stand it-he didnt
care what happened he felt along the
wall--there he had it his finger was
on the button

t ales that no one be-

the lore of the aztec race

all they knew-and give

how much truth is con-

fully into the muzzle
of his ancient gun and
saw him tug at the
hammer with his gnarl-
ed thumb

realizing that the
man meant to kill me
i watched almost in
terror the hammer
came back perhaps a
quarter of an inch and
stuck there on the safe-
ty catch feebly he
tugged at the death de-
vice his strength wan-
ing rapidly the ham-
mer refused to move
further so weak was
the thumb behind it

with a guttural re-
signed groan he low-
ered his gun and
sagged finally to roll
over on his side his
efforts had sapped his
reserve strength he
began blubbering like
a child in broken sob-
bing words

y-y-youve got me
at last he mumbled
as i lowered my tired
arms and glanced
around for the others
but i-i-didnt do it i
swear i didnt do it
theyll never h-h-hang
me theyll never   

spotted you a half-mile back and came up
here to see what was wrong you look all
in old timer

the automatic pistol hanging at my belt
caught his gaze for a few seconds he ap-
praised it blankly then the clatter of the
others coming up the float caused his eyes
to become even more hard i gaped fear-

as members of a scientific expedition
exploring a newly found canyon in
death valley california for the remains
of a prehistoric member of rhinocerotidae
which we knew by petrified bone fragments
recovered from the float lay somewhere
ahead in the blazing silicious walls we came
upon a man aged withered and almost
dead from thirst and
telling years

at first glance we
grasped that he was a
prospector of the old
school for somehow he
had managed to cling
to a shovel pick and
empty canteen even in
the face of death that
yawned wide for him

i was the first mem-
ber of our parly to
reach his side as he
lay waiting for death
to overtake him per-
haps he was thinking
seriously of the new
world he was soon to
visit for he had not
heard our approach
until i was within a
dozen feet of him

then with the swift-
ness of a striking fer
de lance he suddenly
found some hidden re-
serve strength in his
brittle bones and snap-
ped himself into a set-
ting posture to cover
me with an old 
model pistol aston-
ished at the unexpected
display of hostility i
halted in my tracks
holding up my hands
wildly in a fearful ges-
ture to impress him with my harmlessness
his eyes half-closed and filled with sand
eyed me from head to foot then i spoke
in a trembling voice

take it easy old man i urged forc-
ing a smile we mean you no harm we

the gun dropped from his withered fist
and slid down a short incline of gravel i
motioned wildly for my companions they
broke into a run led by dr frapin paleon


wonder stories

tologit in charge and soon reached the
mans side  

as i bathed his wrinkled brow with wa-
ter from my canteen i wondered what he
had meant by his suspicious words my
conclusion was inevitable that here was a
man who had committed a crime who had
accepted us as officers come upon his trail
to finally apprehend him

after a time he ceased his blubbering
whereupon he informed us that his name
was jerome ackerman but i could see
that it would not be very long until he car-
ried it to his grave his aged hands trem-
bled and his lower jaw sagged weakly as he
reiterated again and again that he had not
committed the deed which had caused him
earlier in his life to be-
come a hunted man a
fugitive from justice

time after time he asked
us if we were officers
searching for him in-
forming him that we were
scientists with no interest
in his case beyond casual
curiosity his tongui
dampened with our watr
gradually loosened and
as though realizing that
his end was near he began
to unfold what i first ex-
pected to be a confession

frequently dr frapin
plied him with leading
questions on each occa-
sion the dying man now
convinced that we were friends the only
ones he had met in many years of constant
dodging his fellow beings replied intelli-
gently even with death standing in the
fifing hovering over him like a grim spec-
tral shadow he seemed to have full com-
mand of his faculties if not over his atro-
phied body

knowing that the man was soon to die
frapin felt that whatever story he told
would interest the law and perhaps clear up
an old mystery and dr frapin was the
kind of a man to pry into the deeper things
being totally unsatisfied with surface indi-

cations alone he was somewhat of a crim-
inologist as a hobby and handling the man
deftly drew the admission that he would
have killed me in cold blood believing that
i represented the law had it not been for
his weakness

i offered a silent prayer of thanks that
the hand of god had prevented that and
listened as under frapins urging as he un-
folded one of the most amazing tales that i
believe has ever come out of the mysterious
desert wastes of the valley of death being
the secretary of the expedition i jotted
down in shorthand like a court reporter
every word the man muttered

presently dr frapin ceased questioning
the man he offered him
another drink of water
which he refused with a
feeble nod of thanks
then from his parched
lips came this tale of pri-
vationdeath and horrible
terror of a pursuing
menace that had plunged
down upon him

i tell you he began
as soon as his waning
strength would permit
him that i did not kill
my three friends gundel-
finger crank and bright
how can i convince the
law and man that i did
not kill them as i have
been charged  i have
told the true facts of the case only to be
laughed at sneered at and cursed i will
tell it again to you for as scientists you
may believe in me you may understand
that such a thing that brought doom to my
friends could materialize i implore you
to accept my word before god that my story
is true from beginning to end i did not
kill gundelfinger crank ami bright re-
member that

i first became acquainted with them at
tombstone arizona they had prospected
many miles of desertland thereabout for
gold with little or no success thereupon

ed eari repp
from out of the earth



i befriended them taking to heart their
stories of bad luck and gave them money
until my pockets were almost empty

i took them into my confidence and we
made plans to prospect in death valley but
gundelfingers wife lay ill and interfered
with our departure i knew that gold could
be found in death valley and was anxious
to be after it

finally the woman recovered her strength
enough to travel at my expense we put
her on a train bound for san bernardino
we followed it on horseback arriving at
the california town two weeks later from
there the four of us went into hell leaving
the sickly woman in good care

it was she incidentally who made the
first charges that i had murdered her hus-
band and my other two companions to hide
for myself the rich vein of gold  this
woman whom i had befriended whose ex-
penses i had paid with the last dregs of my
own money was the one who falsely be-
trayed me into the hands of the law 

for weeks and months we wandered over
death valley digging here digging there
the will-o-the-wisp  gold always beck-
oning us to peck at the burning earth beyond
the next searing ridge

the heat was terrifying the sun beat
down upon us without mercy causing our
tongues to become parched and leathery
on more than one occasion between distant
water-holes

day after day we struggled onward up
blind canyons over searing fiats and blis-
tering mesas down through dazzling coulees
and out over the burning levels again al-
ways the yellow lure beckoned us to fol-
low to the next saddleback death seemed
even as now to tread the desert beside us
we drank sparingly of our water half-dead
with thirst to save a few precious drops to
dampen our leathery tongues when we at-
tained the next ridge on and on we went
pursuing the mirage of gold

at night we heard strange sounds weird
grotesque sounds like the breathing of a
monster bull which at times sent us almost
into stark insanity but we managed to
keep up our search day after day my com-
panions helping me i in turn helping them

we shared together the terrors of death
valley we lay close together at night for
warmth for the desert nights are filled with
a chill that bites to the marrow of the bones

eventually we came upon a great streak
of red table-land that stretched for miles
terrible merciless miles in either direction
we mounted a slight incline and entered
upon it as we gained the top it seemed
that we had walked deliberately into an
open oven so hot was the terrible blast that
struck us before long the heat of the soft
red asphalt burned through our boots cook-
ing the soles of our feet

our water began to evaporate in the can-
teens each time we removed the caps for
a sparing drink white wraiths of steam
danced forth and escaped into the flaming

the tracks

he paused for a long moment to get his
breath his ancient lungs seemed to
play out almost entirely every few minutes
and he was forced to fight for wind frapin
handed him a canteen and he drank spar-
ingly from it as though hoarding the con-
tents for a time of greater need finally
he continued

for two days we trekked across that ta-
ble-land toward the distant horizon that
loomed up gray and ghostly in the eastern
haze toward evening of the second day
we came upon great claw-marked tracks
stamped deeply in the asphalt	j

they were the foot-prints of some tre-
mendous beast that seemed to have dropped
from the sky like a bird landing on what
must have been eight feet and went away
again after a moments pause each of its
eight prints were imbedded inches deep in
the asphalt showing the great weight of
the mysterious creature

 thats damn strange ackerman gun-
delfinger said to me as we tarried to inspect
the prints i never heard of a critter as
large as this

 nor i jim i told him frankly and
it had eight legs

crank and bright appraised the tracks
carefully walked around them and measured


wonder stories

the distnce between the rear and the front
prints they looked up in astonishment
their faces pale despite their deep tan

 twenty-three feet apart partners they
chorused

 whatever made those tracks mustve
been a giant crank said gundelfinger
looks like some prehistoric eight-legged
beast has landed here from the air an took
away again i think maybe the tracks were
made thousands of years ago ive seen
some tracks in arizony made by dinosaurs
millions of years ago

 i think youre wrong said bright
shaking his head look here

he walked the full length of the tracks
paused and pointed down to the hot asphalt
we followed and stared gundelfinger pok-
ing lightly at a conical heap with the toe
of his boot the stuff was soft

droppings he said baffled and
no more than a few hours old else theyd
be dry

 and another thing jim stated bright
to prove that the tracks are not more than
a few hours old is that theyre still sharp
and clear if they were old the asphalt-
would have dripped oil into the holes cov-
erin the prints an the edges would have
overlapped by now

 i guess youre right bright gundel-
finger acknowledged theyre young prints
by jingo

 but we are getting nowhere partners

i reminded them harshly i was impatient
to get off that streak of red table-land it
was too damnably hot too ghostly and our
water supply would hardly last to the next
salt-hole

we departed at once and after a half
hours steady hiking we came upon another
set of the tracks shortly thereafter we saw
others until eventually we came upon a sec-
tion of the table-land that was punctured by
countless prints making the going mighty
hard it was hard to go on without sinking
arkle-deep in the holes in the bottom of
which were exposed the clear imprints of
the giant clawed feet

the monster from hell must have done
a dance of death there else it was some
kind of a roosting place for many of them

we hadnt a doubt in our minds but that
the monster was from the air the first set
of tracks told us that much if the thing
had not cpme from the air it would have
left a steady trail as it walked across the
blazing asphalt streak as it was it seem-
ed to have landed here and there for a short
period and then take off again leaving con-
ical piles that at times reached waist-high
wherever it had come down

fearful lest we encounter the monster
itself we banded close together and sped
as rapidly as we could across the table-
land night was falling fast the sun was
setting in the west like a blazing ball a
stiff breeze as hot as the breath from a
furnace was sweeping over us on it was
an odor tainting the air with a sickening
sweetness becoming at times almost nau-
seating

long after the sun had vanished behind
the funerals we kept on but the hand
of the devil seemed to interfere with our
-progress and we were forced to stop for the
night on the fringe of a heavily tracked
area to go on in the darkness would have
meant broken ankles for the night was al-
most pitch-black and we could not have
seen the deep holes

we did not build a fire for the evening
meal though we carried sufficient fuel to
boil coffee from the cans we ate cold
beans that had long since been dried by
evaporation after that we placed our blan-
kets close together on the asphalt but we
could not sleep

terrifying sounds reached our ears men-
acing hisses that cut the blackness like es-
caping steam and dismal sighs that sounded
like wind threshing through giant wings
made sleep impossible the noises would
cause any mortal to tremble in his books
they were blood-curdling

it must have been exhaustion that finally
forced my eyes to close in a troubled aw-
ful slumber how long i lay in the throes
of dreadful nightmares i do not know but
i suddenly awakened with a start

  t knew that it was a beastly scream

jl that jarred me to life so human and
terrible was it that my heart leaped into my
from out of the earth



throat as it came again followed by a thun-
derous roar sounding like stampeding cat-
tle in the blackness not far away i thought
i glimpsed what appeared to be a ghostly
monster hovering in the air but laid the
ghastly vision to exhaustion and fear then
gundelfinger suddenly spoke

 wheres crank he asked in a low
terrified whisper

 isnt he lying beside bright i replied
with a shiver

bright emitted a frightened groan be-
fore he spoke no hes not here he said
hes gone  slipped away for his gun
is lying beside me

 good god i breathed fearfully do
you mean that he slipped away with the
monster prowling about

 he probably went to investigate the
noises said gundelfinger whispering soft-
ly hell come back

u no my friend i argued crank would
not wander around here without his gun
unless something lured him away

i felt gundelfinger tremble suddenly as
his hand searched for his pistol

lured away he inquired like a man
dazed lured good god i felt some-
thing trying to entice me away from here
but i fought it off i felt a terrible urge
to go wandering around looking for the
thing that seems to be hovering around us
i recall the sensation now i must have
been dozing when i felt it it was like some
invisible power coaxing pleading with me
to follow an irresistible lure

 oh crankll show up in time said
bright trying to bolster his courage in the
thought though realizing full well that
crank would never be seen again alive

for the rest of the night we lay in breath-
less terror and listened to the terrifying
sounds i heard no more screams such as
come from a human throat i had no doubt
but that crank had been lured away and
sent to his doom with the death cries that
had jarred me to life we listened tensely
for sounds of his return and heard no human
footfalls

finally the desert became aglow with
the rainbow colors of early morning with
the first streaks of dawn we stared around

us amazed that we had lived the night
through

the table-land was deserted therl was
nothing in sight that could have made such
awful sounds as throbbed throughout the
night in our ears and crank seemed to
have been swallowed for he had vanished
entirely leaving no trace

what had been his actual fate we could
not know then we did know that he was
gone we could see thirty miles in either
direction and not a speck bespoke his pre-
sence anywhere on the flat i did not
doubt but that something awful had befal-
len him though with the arrival of daylight
we felt somewhat secure and at a loss to
know what to do next we began hiking
away from the spot

the new day was begun almost as the
rising sun came over the eastern ridges it
seemed to pop up suddenly then the desert
became an oven as we went away hur-
riedly we ate dried prunes for breakfast
washing them down with a scant drink of
water

the tracks were everywhere now the
conical piles of droppings were like prairie-
dog mounds though somewhat higher and
more pointed at the top somehow gundel-
finger stumbled over a pile of the dung fell
on his face and swore

but in falling he had kicked off the top
of the pile we were mystified to find ex-
posed a great egg-shaped object weighing at
least twenty pounds so hard was it that
the butt of a gun could not smash it the
thing was like an oval stone and as white
as flour

after trying to smash the shell with a
gun-butt bright finally succeeded in break-
ing it on a chunk of red rock to our utter
surprise we found within the thing tiny
animal scarcely larger than a new-born pup
with eight legs a dragon-like head and thin
almost undeveloped wings on its sides like
the membranes of a flying squirrel

it was a vicious little devil and very
much alive as bright discovered when he
tried to fondle the little beast it opened its
savage little mouth and sank needle-like
teeth into his hand with an oath he hurled
it from him killing it instantly

the strike

i i i t think i know what its all about
jl partners he growled some giant
beast possibly from another world has
been planting its eggs here on this table- and
to hatch under the heat of the sun this is
the hottest place this side of hell and from
the thickness of the shell it would take a
helluva heat to hatch the filthy critters
lets get away from here before we follow
poor crank

youre suffering from hallucinations
jim i managed to laugh the heats got
you by the ears it is not possible for a
beast to come here from another world

 dammit jerome he snorted heatedly
where else could such an egg-laying mon-
ster come from

 i admit it is a mystery partner i told
him yet it does not seem possible i for
one do not believe that it came through
space to this spot

 maybe crank was so scared that he
just up and bolted put in jim gundelfinger
squinting at the distant horizons

 no i said crank would not dare
start across the desert without water

 thats right acknowledged gundelfin-
ger he did not take a canteeen

after another five hours of continuous
hiking we came to the end of the table-land
below us stretched the eastern rim of the
desert as far as we could see our water
had given out at noon and now we were
burning up with thirst

we made our way down the buttresses
and started across the scorching sand in
the evening we encountered a spring run-
ning pure water as cold as ice it was hid-
den in a little box canyon and we had acci-
dently stumbled upon it while searching for
an easy way out

gundelfinger his tongue as hard as sun-
toughened leather made a dash for the little
pool i yelled at him to wait until we had
tested the water before he drank

having been born and raised in the
desertlands of the west i knew well the
danger of drinking water that bubbles up
from saline soils my companions raised
in the east could not know that nine out

of every ten desert springs contain the dead-
ly arsenic poison

 jim i called do not drink the water
until we have tested it

you go to heh he rasped back his
voice sounding ghostly as they formed on
his dry leathery tongue you want it for
yourself

despite my warnings he drank deeply
and as i watched him for convulsions he
buried both his hands suddenly in the spring
and shouted like a mad man

gold gold gold he cried frenzied-
ly dousing his hands in the precious water
time after time letting the silt of the bot-
tom dribble through his fingers the spring
became a hole of mud before we recovered
from our astonishment and made for it

and true enough the silt was thick with
sands of glittering gold we had accident-
ly stumbled on life and wealth at the same
time lying together in the bowl of a bub-
bling spring of pure untainted water it
was as pure as any i had ever tasted but
we drank it red with mud

after a time the spring cleared we
filled our canteens from it then with heavy
hearts over cranks disappearance we be-
gan searching for the mother lode from
which the particles of gold had come after
a little work we located it several feet above
the spring and right under eight inches of
volcanic shale

it was the richest strike ever made i
know it the vein where we encountered
it was two feet wide and only god knows
how deep it ran we patted gundelfinger
on the back and gave him credit for the
strike he accepted it modestly and to-
gether we staked out the claims including
one for crank bright made a map of the
location and stuck it in his pocket then
we started to work on the vein of yellow
virgin gold

with my knife i peeled off long slivers
of the metal how brilliantly it glistened
in the light of the westering sun never
had i beheld such a yellow shining wealth
it made our blood run high in spite of what
had befallen our party on the table-land
but crank was gone and it was beyond our
power to bring him back to us
from out of the earth



dr frapin eyed me curiously as the
prospector and murder suspect paused
again for a drink of water i shook my
head dubiously and tapped my temple sig-
nificantly with a pencil to denote my belief
that the man was perhaps more than a trifle
cracked the scientists eyes hardened for
he nodded in defense of the mans story
then the dying man resumed his tale draw-
ing our attention to him	

for five days he continued in wheez-
ing gasps we stayed at the spring dig-
ging like mad men into the yellow vein
we watched our pile grow from a few mis-
erable nuggets and scrapings to a heap that
would require a mule to transport it then
to our disgust and chagrin we discovered
that our provisions were almost gone with
only a few cans of beans remaining to see
us to barstow

we debated on the question of one of us
returning to barstow for more provisions
and a string of burros but each was so
eager to return to civilization that we de-
cided that all should go

hurriedly we covered our discovery with
shale and piled rocks over the spring to
hide it from any wandering prospector
after posting our location notices all along
the vein we filled our canteens and started
once again across that teyible red table-
land weighted down with as much gold as
we could carry

night and day we travelled until finally
exhaustion halted us in the middle of the
vermilion streak scarcely had we lain
down than we were fast asleep

suddenly we were awakened by the most
hideous roar that ever grated on the ears of
man the ground under us seemed to
tremble from the terrific concussion of the
sound

good god gundelfinger exclaimed
sitting erect 

bright beside me gave a snort of ter-
ror and shot a hand for his gun his eyes
glittered with an ungodly fear and his
teeth clattered in his mouth he seemed
speechless i was appalled

it must have been close to midnight when
we awoke but a crescent moon standing

in the heavens to the eastward bathed the
blistered table-land with a pale ghostly
light stars glimmered overhead like fiery
pin-points the tableland seemed to roll
and sway as though under the influence of
some dreadful underground upheaval

in stark terror we sat deathly still on
our blankets pistols ready to get our bear-
ings the streak with its monster imprints
and piles of dung was aglow with the pale
ghostly light of the dim moon and stars
not a living thing was visible on it yet we
knew that something awful hovered peril-
ously near the terrifying roar thundered
down again and again causing goose-flesh to
stand out on me like itching hives my
blood curdled in my veins

almost together we gathered our legs
under us and stood up each holding his
gun ready for instant use then brights
eyes searched the air above us what he
saw there caused him to recoil with a fear-
ful scream he hurled himself flat on his
face and buried his head in his arms we
looked up appalled

directly over us huge membraned
wings flapping dismally ready to charge
down upon us was the monstrous beast
whose tracks had punctured the red asphalt
all around us it loomed overhead like
som gargantuan thing of a forgotten age
its eyes bulging and flashing fire jaws
dripping with red flaming saliva

god what a terrible thing for a man to
behold what a terrible smell for a mans
nostrils to inhale the beast stunk like the
dead but with a nauseating sweetness that
made us violently ill

i hope to god that none of you gentle-
men will ever see such a beast even now
as i tell of it i recoil at its haunting vision
dancing before my eyes my stomach re-
volts at the smell which has never quite left
my nostrils i can never get that vision
erased from my mind it is stamped so
firmly there that only death which beckons
to me now can erase it

but so huge was the flying monster that
it cast a black shadow over us it floated
lightly between us and the moon engulfing
us in a terrifying gloom yet we could


wonder stories

make out distinctly almost every detail of
the thing

it was much like the little creature we
had taken from the great egg previously
but how could a tiny little savage like that
grow to such monstrous size we asked our-
selves

- the beast opened its dragon-like jaws
rolled its horn-studded head and roared at
us the concussion nearly knocked us flat
on our backs then the monster flapped its
great wings slowly and slid through the air
circling us it dragged a monster tail be-
hind it

flight

  ijascinated we watched insanity
j striking threatening blows at our
reasoning bright began to blubber sud-
denly like an imbecile then he arose from
the ground and stood trembling beside us
after a moment he seemed to crack under
the strain and began to run wildly

instantly the creature lashed out its long
flat tail it curled around brights body
like a python lifted him high in the air and
as we pumped shot after shot into it hurled
him to the asphalt with a sickening thud
hardly had his broken body ttopped rolling
than the brute was upon it

too appalled and stupefied to run we
watched the beast swing downward and land
on all its eight feet jabbing the asphalt
deeply with them it stood over brights
body and proceeded to gobble it before our
very eyes

i have always been a religious man and
i got down at once on my knees to pray
some strange powerful influence urged me
to do so sobbing i offered my prayer for
safety

shut up gundelfinger hissed at me
keep shooting the thing prayin aint go-
ing to save our hides shoot its eyes out

the beast was facing us now watching
every move we made but gundelfinger
snapped up his gun again and fired straight
at the creature with a savage roar it lifted
its head its eyes flashing like twin fires
from its jaws hung what remained of bright
a mass of bloody horrible flesh

gundelfingers gun blazed again i
knew that his aim was true for he had been
known to shoot silver dollars out of the
air but the eyes of the beast still flamed
he could not have missed his mark because
of his excitement no better marksman ever
lived than jim gundelfinger but the crea-
tures eyes must have been protected by a
shield of thick transparent bone of a
strength to resist even a bullet from a 
it was like trying to shoot out a light pro-
tected behind a slab of transparent steel

i aimed quickly and fired again and
again thumbing the hammer in a way that
had won me the title of expert gun-fanner
as true as my aim was no damage had been
done to the brutes flaming eyes they con-
tinued to spray us with a deadly light that
seemed to overcome to hypnotize me

slowly the winged terror came toward
us it hovered perhaps ten feet above the
asphalt its scaled legs almost dragging its
flat tail writhing like a serpent in the air
from its jaws dripped vermilion ter-
rible shreds of flesh and bone clung to its
saw-like fangs

i must pause here to comment upon the
nerve of jim gundelfinger if ever a man
possessed the courage to stand before such
a terrifying assault jim gundelfinger was
the man i cannot praise him too highly for
his bravery in the face of almost certain
death

he stood his ground as the beast ap-
proached holding his fire for a killing shot
i backed away fearfully then his pistol
cracked three times i saw him draw his
arm back to hurl the empty weapon into
the awesome face of the brute the gun
collided with the bony nose bounced off
sharply and clattered on the ground his
bullets ineffective he turned on his heels
and ran off to the side

instantly the beast lashed out its tail
and hurled him flat i saw him lifted high
in the air and thrown with a thump to the
asphalt he writhed in the throes of death
for a moment and then lay still

in stark terror i began to run it did not
matter where with my pockets filled with
gold the going was hard my canteen was
almost full and further hindered my race for
from out of the earth



safety yet i managed to run filled with
a deep-rooted horror and fear that brought
insanity to my brain expecting with every
step to feel that awesome tail snap around
my body like a steel spring

then it came it seemed to lash out for
me like the tongue of a monster ant-eater
flicking for an insect i heard it drone
through the air with a menacing wail and
then it snapped like a whip-lash just behind
me i was hurled flat on my face but the
tail had missed i was a scant foot beyond
its reach

quickly i arose blubbering like an im-
becile and continued my frenzied flight
glancing fearfully over my shoulder i
glimpsed that terrible tail again the beast
was curling it up for another thrust at me
i saw it on second glance spring outward
again it snapped just behind me as though
some monster was in my rear snapping a
black-snake whip at my back it missed by
a mere fraction nd once again i glanced
back i saw the brutes jaws close over the
prostrate form of gundelfinger it began
to gorge on its victim now apparently un-
mindful of me knowing evidently that my
capture was but a matter of minutes

like a madman i ran as fast as my legs
could carry me i leaped over narrow gaps
tripped in holes and prayed often for deliv-
erance from the horrible creature that had
so suddenly blasted our lives

   t resently in the dim moonlight
jl i saw a narrow gap loom up i
bunched my muscles to make a leap over it
as i sailed through the air i had a sudden
thought it came to me like a voice from
the air

crawl into the chasm jerome some-
thing advised me plainly crawl out of
sight and the beast cant get you

i paused and looked back at the yawn-
ing abyss

 hurry hurry the strange voice urged
crawl into the abyss and you will be de-
livered  

i shot a hurried glance at the star-stud-
ded dome of heaven and mumbled my
thanks with lungs ready to explode from
exertion veins threatening to split i ran

along the edge of the abyss searching for a
place to go down

finally i discovered a narrow shelf of
rock five or six feet from the top without
hesitation i leaped down to it slipped and
almost rolled to my death in the bottom
far below

the moons pale light struck the shelf
just right revealing it to me clearly far
below i could see the bottom of the gorge
widening into a great pit the shelf grad-
ually descended down to it taking my
life in my hands i raced downward hugging
the wall closely it was sheer and smooth
but frequently great boulders projected out-
ward to interfere with my escape i had to
pause and wiggle under them like a snake
on one occasion a rock was hidden in a
black shadow i did not see it until too late
 my pounding feet collided with it and i
went sprawling  clutching madly for a
hand-hold to save myself from falling into
the abyss by some miracle i saved myself
even as i fell over by clutching at the edge
of the shelf how i managed to pull my-
self back onto it i shall never know

from overhead came a sudden burst of
thunderous roars that lashed my faculties
into a maniacal madness the terrifying
sounds crashed through the abyss like the
explosion of a thousand cannons echoing
and re-echoing on every side the horrible
beast was on my trail at last

a dark hole yawned presently in the
sheer wall of the shelf it was the entrance
to some underground cavern leading from
the shelf and created probably by some freak
of nature i dashed into the inky blackness
without hesitation far within the tunnel
i crouched the heat was unbearable and
little wisps of sickening sulphurous vapors
played around my nostrils causing me to
cough violently when i wanted only to be
silent and still

where was i i had lost all sense of di-
rection and might have been at the entrance
of hell for all that i knew as i lay i de-
cided that somewhere near must be a sleep-
ing volcano from which probably flowed
the red asphalt that formed the vast blister-
ing table-land

the place was filled with savage bestial


wonder stories

roars i shrank fearfully against the hot
steaming wall gun in hand ready to blow
out my brains should the beast manage to
get at me

suddenly at the opening of the tunnel
i beheld a snake-like object sliding gliding
along the moonlit shelf it was the long
flat tail of the beast searching me out

i placed the muzzle of my gun to my
temple hammer back to send a messenger
of death crashing through my brain how
good it would feel to die by my own hand
rather than follow my three companions

i waited and watch the outcome of the sud-
den appearance of the creatures tail

it curled restlessly into the tunnel
searching blindly for me the beast seem-
ed to know that i crouched there somehow
and was trying to ferret me out with its
long terrible tail but something whisper-
ed to me that i was beyond its reach

fascinated i watched the serpent-like
thing it curled and uncurled like the sensi-
tive feelers of a butterfly searching here
searching there ever reaching out to clutch
me in a grip of doom it could drag me
out of my hiding place with little effort and
lift me into those awful jaws i shrank
farther away from it

on sudden impulse i levelled my gun
at it and fired the tunnel trembled under
the explosion my head swam my senses
reeled yet i saw the ghastly tail jerk back
suddenly and then lash out toward me again
it seemed to glow with a strange phosphor-
escent luminosity where my bullet had
struck it must have been the creatures
blood that caused it to glow like that

but closer and closer it come toward me
from it radiated a sickening odor that i
could detect even above the sulphurous
stenches engulfing me 

 oh god i cried out feverishly as the
tail came within five feet of me and paused
writhing frenziedly it seemed alive with
an undying craving to clutch me and haul
me out of my place of terror

watched it as i would the ugly head

jl of a rattler it writhed stretched and
lashed out but after it failed to reach me i
laughed insanely madly then gradually my

senses cleared and i realized that it could
not touch me i was beyond it finally
it withdrew slowly and limply like an in-
jured reptile i breathed a stream of pray-
ers and intoned my thanks to the invisible
protector

all night i crouched in the tunnel fre-
quently i dozed off with a certain sense of
security awakening again and again with a
jerk as i heard the terrible roars reverberat-
ing through the abyss the earth shook
when the raging beast stamped along the
edge of the chasm filling the skies with its
seemingly disappointed bellows while it
searched i thought for an opening large
enough to admit its gigantic body

gradually the mouth of the tumfel
brightened with the approach of another
day slowly the cave filled with murky
light i listened hard for sounds the
desert with the dawn had suddenly become
quiet and still then i realized that the
beast must have gone with the first light of
day

where had the great interplanetary
beast as it must have been gone had it
left the table-land to bed down somewhere
until the arrival of another night to lay its
great eggs or had it flown into space to
another world beyond our own was it
safe to venture into the open or was the
beast lying calmly waiting for me to ap-
pear

i could not remain in hiding forever
my water could not last and hunger was
already crying to be appeased i must get
out i must get back to san bernardino to
tell gundelfingers poor woman what had
happened and give her some of the gold
from my pockets

cautiously i emerged from the cave and
stood upon the shelf the abyss was bathed
in the brilliant sunshine of the new day
the sun was dazzling blinding and it made
my eyes smart i felt the weight of the
gold in my pockets but the wealth was
remote from my mind now life was more
important i could come back later with
many men and guns if i was spared

 as i looked down the abyss along the
wall my blood seemed to coagulate in my
veins for there was that appalling tail in
from out of the earth	

full view though the beast itself was hid-
den the tail was curling and uncurling
like a writhing reptile i recoiled in fear
and shrank against the wall lest the beast
sense or see me

but the winged terror was sleeping its
body hidden from my eyes by the curve of
the walls its tail lashing sharply from side
to side as though watching for me to come
out of my hiding place

it dawned upon me suddenly that i had
taken refuge right in the lair of the beast
but after a few moments of breathless sus-
pense i decided that i was reasonably safe
for the time the creature could not i
realized crawl down into the chasm from
above and it was too far down to reach me
with its tail which must have been at least
seventy-five feet in length the beast must
have entered its lair by another entrance
but was i safe i wondered

the desert seemed as deathly quiet as a
lifeless world not a sound stirred the
stifling air slowly and silently i picked
my way along the shelf glancing often into
the abyss to keep an eye on that writhing
tail it seemed unaware that i was escap-
ing the beast evidently slept during the
day and prowled about only when evening
came

finally after what seemed hours of tor-
tuous stealth i reached the highest point
of the shelf and glanced over the table land
it seemed as deserted as the chasm it was
silent and ghastly the asphalt surround-
ing the abyss was beaten into a jagged field
the great tracks were everywhere

 a little pile of rags not far away held
my gaze for a moment with a start i
recognized the trousers that had been worn
by crank they had been of checkered
weave but now they were blood-stained and
ragged after devouring my partner the
beast must have later coughed up the cloth-
ing

 it struck me then that the location of our
precious claims had been lost in the destruc-
tion of bright but seeing those ragged
shreds of clothing spurred me to the grim
realization that i had not yet escaped the
possibility of a similar fate sick and afraid
i crouched down for an instants rest sight

of the stained garments completely un-
nerved me i glanced again to the bottom
of the abyss the writhing tail was still
there awakening me again to the fact that
my life was still in terrible danger

i pulled myself up from the shelf and
entered upon the red streak of table-land
without a pause i started due west away
from the sun i had a vague sense of direc-
tion now and felt more secure in the day-
light for it seemed that the beast was about
only at night

more days of torture followed the sun
beat down upon me with the fire of hell
but i kept on toward san bernardino avoid-
ing even barstow in my haste to reach gun-
delfingers wife i selected a short-cut
through the blazing hills and with a leathery
tongue in my mouth and my body weighted
down with many pounds of gold i finally
reached the town and went straight to the
home of the woman

there i was given water to drink and to
wash the sand from my eyes then i told
my terrible story to the woman and gave her
half of my gold i could see as i related
my sad tale that she disbelieved me cer-
tainly i had no witnesses or anything to
substantiate my story and i would scarcely
have believed it myself had it been told to
me

but she became more and more suspici-
ous of my weird astounding narrative and
suddenly she accused me of murdering her
husband and the others to gain possession
of the mother lode for myself

 my dear woman i told her frankly
had i murdered your husband and the
others for possession of the claims i would
riot have come here to share my gold with
you no i would have remained away
forever

 you are trying to protect yourself by
your actions of generosity she snapped i
know what you did you cold-blooded killer
you all found the gold and you werent
satisfied with a share so you killed three
men in cold blood for all of it

 but my dear mrs gundelfinger     
i stuttered appalled at her accusations

you are a murderer she blazed heat-
edly your silly story is really amusing


wonder stories

but not convincing you shall hang for
your deed and i shall laugh in your face
as you die

such was my reward for my charity and
generosity toward the woman and her hus-
band the hands that i had aided the
mouth i had fed had turned suddenly against
me before i recovered my senses she had
called a man from the street and i was
arrested

i was charged with the murder of my
three companions and tortured by unscrup-
ulous officers who sought to learn the loca-
tion of the gold strike but i could not tell
them for no man had ever been there be-
fore and my sense of direction was totally
gone i would not have yielded even had
i known where the strike lay

my story was branded a lie i was
charged with the triple murder and lan-
guished in prison waiting until the search-
ing parties sent out ostensibly to find the
corpus delicti but really to locate the gold
mine came back to report

but public sentiment flamed against me
principally because i would not reveal to
these hungry greedy people the source of
my wealth

finally on an agreement to tell where
the strike was i was spirited away from
jail by a band of men i even gave them
a false map by which to locate the place
shoufd anything happen to us

it happened as i expected they got me
into the desert and then one night abandon-
ed me leaving me water and food to last
only a few days what happened to them i
never knew probably they perished fol-
lowing blindly the lure of the desert and the
false clues i gave them perhaps they re-
turned realizing i had played them false
to hunt for me

so i escaped into the valley and here i
have been for years i have been a hunted
dog i have watched the valley year by
year becoming inhabited until i felt that
soon there would be little place for me in
which to hide i have become like the coyote
hiding by day and prowling about by night
seeking always seeking for the mine 

now i am done out  my friends
he breathed heavily let me have another

generous drink from your canteen so that i
can go on with ease the nearest spring
is forty miles from here and i cant make
it

the dying narrator tipped the tin to his
lips his adams apple bobbed up and
down as the water trickled down his ancient
throat i studied him carefully during that
moment and his gaunt weather-worn face
was pitiful to behold and i suspected that
that would be jerome ackermans last drink
on earth

he waved a feeble hand at dr frapin
who held the canteen for him his hands
had grown suddenly weak and the container
would have dropped to the ground but for
frapins alertness

let me repeat friends he smiled a
ghost of a smile and squared his jaw firmly
that i did not kill those three men nor
will i hang for it the same invisible pro-
tector who saved my life on the table-land
and who interfered with the hanging is
again stepping in i will not hang for i
am at last a free man for deate releases us
from all obligations in this life

but before i go id like to learn where
that beast come from ive tried hard to
figure it out and concluded that it had
flown here from the moon you men are
scientists cant you enlighten me

dr frapin looked at the prone prospector
for an instant and then nodded

i think we can partner he said with
a shrug it is the theory of many scientists
the world over that the earth on which we
live is hollow marshall b gardner in his
papers a journey into the earths inter-
ior points out the possibility of life with-
in the- earth with the earths polar caps as
possible entrances many of us believe that
this is correct and your narrative tends to
some extent to prove it  

you believe me then the prospectors
eyes flashed dully

of course dr frapin patted his gnarl-
ed bloodless fist

then i can die in peace ackerman
wheezed

but to go on continued frapin watch-
ing the mans wrinkled face it is entirely
possible that the great beast to ijjfhich you
from out of the earth



refer entered into death valley by earth-
faults or fissures leading from subterranea
or the earths interior from your descrip-
tion i can recognize no such a creature as
ever having existed on the surface it must
therefore have come from within and was
unable to return probably because the fis-
sure might have closed up behind it due to
earth movements thus making it a surface
inhabitant by necessity

i do not believe that there is anything
to fear from it or from the creatures within
its eggs as a menace to humanity they
have probably died out in the intervening
years

the old prospector emitted a weird
groan across his withered visage flashed
a sudden pallor

i guess thats all gentlemen frapin
said in a whisper hes gone    dead
well bury him here

you-you believe his story doctor i
inquired folding my shorthand record

the others in the party searched his face
quizzically frapin eyed us solemnly

i do he said emphatically from
what ive heard from this man he never told
an untruth in his life he strikes me as an
honest man  now let us get busy weve
got to find that streak of red table-land

but a months search availed us nothing
yet we live in hopes of locating it eventually
we are preparing now for a more extensive
search this time by airplane but some day
some how we believe we will find it limit-
less wealth and close to it the bones of the
terror that came from within the earth when
we do we will bring them back to san ber-
nardino and present them to the city as a
memento of a tale that no one believed

for the april issue

we offer
an adventure in futurity

a new masterful time travelling story by a master of words and situations

clark ashton smith

mr smith is aware of the heated controversy in our readers columns ever the possibility
of time travel he has his own view on this subject and he weaves them into a story
of the far future that will sweep everyone away from this age and place them in an era
that is truly different

our popular team of authors

schachner and zagat

come to a new triumph in their story of another world and another dimension in

the emperor of the stars

we have a combination of a dimensional and interplanetary story do other worlds exist
all about us do they meet our world at a tangent in space so that if we were to meet
one of these tangents we would be whirled into another dimension if we were would
we have adventures unbelievable to ordinary prosaic man our authors give the answers
to these questions in this unusual story

what causes us to evolve physically and mentally what changed the original one-celled
animals mto a million different species each one still changing continually what sort of
being will man eventually evolve into will he be all brain and no body will he have emo-
tions will he be warlike

edmond hamilton in
the man who evolved

gives us a strange story of evolution with an ending that no one could guess

the last installment of

the return from jupiter
by gawain edwards

is by far the best a race is enslaved suffers untold agonies a world	the earth is being

made habitable an old king suffers the tortures of the damned to see	his people beneath

the green torture

continued from page 

fifty hours

then realization came and he paused
he dr thorne who had already been
hailed as the savior of his country was now
its betrayer he who had supervised the
construction of the great broadcasting mach-
ine which was to make helpless the enemies
of his country was now about to make it
useless

his hand dropped from the button and
clenched by his side rather than do that
he would cast himself upon those deadly
prongs

and yet even as the thought came to his
mind he knew that he could never approach
the thing his eyes fixed upon the green
light and a horrible fear in his heart he
backed slowly away

	  - 

the man lay huddled in a corner star-
ing-fascinated by the point of green it
would get him now time after time he had
forced his failing body into action there
had been periods of calm when he had
paced slowly along the endiess wall until
his feet were abraded and sore there had
been periods of madness when he had lurch-
ed to right and left bumping and bruising
himself but he had grown weak he had
eaten the food and no more had come

for an interminable time he had fought
off drowsiness in spite of all his efforts
his eyes would close he had counted sixty
times sixty and had dozed-warned by a
sixth sense he had awakened to a green light
very near had leaped up in terror had rush-
ed headlong against the unyielding wall
had sunk down helpless it would get him
now

the green light grew and grew it be-
came immense-all encompassing the
steady whirr grew louder and louder with
a piercing pain in his side he was sinking
-falling headlong into a great green roar-
ing void-down-swiftly down   

sunlight on a white coverlet bending fig-
ures and

feeling better doctor

thorne turned his head upon the pillow
he recognized the voice of rand his assist-
ant and strove to speak

please lie quietly you are in a hospi-
tal and you are all right

thorne stirred uneasily his body was
very sore-especially one side he wet his
lips with his tongue

please dont try to talk i will tell you
everything that happened because of your
capture the attack was made ahead of sche-
dule and it was a glorious success when-
they recovered they begged for peace at any
terms the war is over

thorne smiled weakly he was very hap-
py there were other things he wanted to
know however he opened his mouth but
the other continued

well an air squadron was sent over
right away because the first thing everybody
wanted to do was to find you if you were
still alive and i went along with them of
course when we got there they took us to
a big house and in the cellar we found you
ou were all rolled up in a corner and right
beside you was the strangest machine i have
ever seen three prongs on the front of it
had pierced your side a sort of iron belt
around your waist was all that kept it from
killing you but with that and the radio
paralysis on top of it we thought you were
surely gone and i congratulate-

thornes eyes were wide with wonder
but the prongs-the poison he whisper-
ed

poison nobody saw any poison the
prongs were painted green but why anybody
should want to paint them we couldnt im-
agine maybe-

thorne closed his eyes and sighed then
he laughed brokenly triumphantly   

of course he didnt want to kill me he
muttered the devil the clever devil

and nobody knew what he meant

the detective who had been sleeping in the
chair by the door of steinhildes laboratory
standing over him with clenched fists
white stared at him dazedly and gingerly
felt the bump on his throbbing head

i said wheres my gat the detective
was obviously in a rage what kind of a
shenanigan business is this anyway

white struggled to a sitting position and
swayed there grinning feebly as he pulled
something from his pocket

i even saved the kitten he observed
steinhilde said it was unlucky i say it
was the luckiest thing that ever happened
to us

the detective spat wrathfully whites
laugh was shaky

youre drunk accused the detective
shaking his fist listen you cheap bum
you get my gun back here pronto or ill run
you in

steinhilde who was lying sprawled out
nearby struggled to his feet at the threat
and pulled out his wallet

here officer he mumbled extracting
a fifty dollar note take this and buy
yourself a new gun forget about us

the detective frowned and muttered but
finally accepted the money and moved away
he paused at the door

how about them ashes in the ball he
demanded

wood ashes from the torture fire to tell
them when our set started to receive ex-
plained steinhilde wearily

the detective still hesitated then opened
the door

i know one thing he declared in part-
ing you birds better sober up and get at
it now one peep about any disturbance
around here tonight and youll find the
wagon backin up to the door

  

neither white nor steinhilde paid any
attention they were wrapping josef in an
old blanket and started for the door with
him white had already phoned for a taxi
outside the storm was breaking the
clouds overhead had parted to reveal a bit
of black velvet sky in which the planet
mars glowed as brilliantly as some rare
flawless jewel steinhilde shook his fist at
it

curse and rave you fiends he cried
swaying unsteadily struggle for your
lives rot and die on your dying world
send out your a aaouk till doomsday
and be damned our set is destroyed
youll never get through here

he collapsed suddenly beside josef while
white dashed back to phone for an ambu-
lance instead of a taxi

the return from jupiter

continued from page 

ing the pleidans to assemble but the wo-
man from tellus was too quick her fol-
lowers dashed in and swooped down among
the space-craft from every side slashing
cutting thrusting the pleidan soldiers
bewildered by this return to hand-to-hand
fighting having no equipment or training
for it could do little but run among the
attackers or mill in groups of badly fright-
ened men surrounded by screaming half-
crazed women armed with kitchen knives

into the thick of this fearful maelstrom of
battle went nina her presence serving to
spur the neinans to even greater fury and
valor

but nina knew that the battle was not yet
over even though the pleidian soldiers ap-
peared unable to draw themselves together
in fighting trim with a small handful of
militants she turned from the general melee
and made her way as rapidly as possible to
the space car that sheltered salvarius carde
the return from jupiter



he saw her coming and with a shout or-
dered the heavy iron door closed the nein-
ians had almost reached him before the
order could be obeyed but when they ar-
rived there was nothing left to do but beat
helplessly against the tough metal of the
ship and scream their defiance

it was while matters were thus that sal-
varius carde sprung his trump skeleton
crews had remained in all the fighting ships
at the edges of the landing place quickly
he ordered them to close up

nina saw this move and had a premoni-
tion of disaster in the middle of the square
the neinians were still struggling furiously
it was clear that if matters were left in their
hands they would be victorious

but matters were not to remain so sud-
denly there spurted from the sides of the
fighting cars the same withering flame that
had earlier attacked buildings and burned
the very air at the sides of the landing field
this time however it was directed inward
against the melee of hand-to-hand fighters
among the transports salvarious carde had
decided to destroy even his own soldiers and
machines to reduce the neinian mob

the flames leaped out passed into the
struggling crowd with a furious hissing

sound the air was suddenly filled with
black smoke the sickening smell of burning
flesh nina in precarious safety close by the
flagship of salvarius carde marveled that
there was no crying out no screams or
groans of agony it was as if the flames
coming so quickly had seared into the
throats of the victims the cries of pain or
anger or reproach they might have uttered

an instant only the fire leaped out and
covered the landing space then it was
shut off but nina after one glance could
not bear to look at the shambles it had left
half a minute earlier the area had been full
of struggling humans the squat awkward
cruel people of pleida and the graceful
winged creatures of the satellite now it
was like a square of fly-paper on which
thousands of flies had given up their lives
most of them were dead curved by the
flame into innumerable grotesque postures
some still moved uttering shrill cries but
they had lost all semblance to humanity
were like unearthly lizards burned beyond
recognition unable themselves to compre-
hend what had happened to them what was
happening groping with stumps of hands
writhing in oceans of pain too great and
deep to survive in

of powder and the bullet be the rocket fuel and the
pistol itself be the rocket when the primer cap is
struck the powder explodes and becomes a gas which
exerts a tremendous pressure in every direction it
does two things it pushes the bullet out of the gun
and conversely it causes a recoil in the gun itself so
the pistol suspended in a vacuum will kick back and
if it were not held by the siring it would move back-

sex and life

editor wonder stories

i was interested in the letter from mr donald
hcndrickson which appeared in your february num-
ber he is right-sexual education without a sen-
sual influence is what is needed the editorial
comments are both sane and decent unlike a con-
siderable amount of scientific opinion on the sub-
ject i think the difficulty is not so much that a
solution is hard to see but that we refuse to see it
because of the ancient superstition that we can
have our cake and eat it too  the human race has
gotten into a frame of mind where a place is given
to the sexual instinct which is not accorded any other
natural appetite

everyone admits that hunger and thirst have a
natural function necessary to the continuance of the
race as well as the continuance of the individual
all admit at least theoretically that indulgence in
any of these appetites beyond the needs delineated
by nature leads to degeneracy clogging up of the
faculties ill-health and an early death on the
other hand we have in sex a function which draws
tremendously upon every vital force and has ramifi-
cations and effects through the whole constitution of
man beyond the exercise of any other instinct

yet we never stop for a moment to take a lesson
from nature as to what proper exercise may be that
habitual indulgence in sex is not intended by nature
is sufficiently shown by the rarity of its use in the
animal kingdom and the fact that it follows certain
natural seasons in the human race its seasonal
aspect has been completely destroyed by the use of
memory imagination and anticipation the char-
acteristics of a natural and healthy appetite are that
the desire rises only when necessary for the contin-
uance of life is intense while the necessity is un-
fulfilled and is completely absent from the con-
sciousness at other times we know perfectly well
that this is the case with the appetite for food and
drink except where there is some abnormal perver-
cion

if we cannot see from this plain and irrefutable
reasoning that the state of consciousness of civilized
man in which sex is more or less ever-present and
is constantly seeking new outlets and titivations is
abnormal unnecessary and unhealthy-well then lets
try the simple experiment of remaining continent men-
tally as well as physically for a few months and note
the difference in quality and keenness of all our facul-
ties as well as in our bodily health i the unreason-
ing multitude is imbued with the idea that sex may
be considered as an idle amusement for personal

old-fashioned brick bat all are equally welcome
all of your letters as much as space will allow will
be published here for the benefit of all due to the
large influx of mail no communications to this de-
partment are answered individually unless o in
tamps to cover time and postage is remitted

gratification under the shelter of matrimony in the
case of the most conventional but the attitude is
basically the same for all

they verily take the stand that the voice of the
people is the voice of god and that morale are deter-
mined by the prevailing ideal of the people in that
case the state of mind of the degenerate romans in
the days of the vomitorium which was used to
expel a recently acquired meal in order to enjoy eat-
ing all over was perfectly natural justified and in
accordance with right thinking well we know
better we know the terrible sequence of physical
ills which follow upon gluttony civilized life has
become a sex-vomitorium i have no doubt that the
roman sybarites used exactly the same arguments to
prove the hygienic quality of six or seven meals a day
that our modern apostles of degeneracy use to
prove the necessity of sexual relations ad lib in
order to maintain health

of course anyone who engages in unrestrained
imaginings must ultimately either succumb or find
himself in the midst of a nervous breakdown and
the advocates of sensuality point to thib as proof that
frequent sex relations are necessary to health  cer-
tainly they can be made a necessity to health in the
sense of the lesser two evils both unnecessarily
created by ourselves the whale race due to the
aforesaid misuse of mental powers to intensify an ap-
etite and thereby to pervert it has been sexually
egenerating for many milleniums races fall as
much by enervation and general slackness of mental
moral and spiritual fiber produced by sex license as
by any other cause

and then a new race has its pioneer period during
which life is too strenuous and too dangerous to leave
the time or energy for mental or physical sensuality
then sex life is comparatively pure but when mater-
ial prosperity is reached the animalized reasoning
power begins to get in its deadly work again and
we have the old cycle of degeneracy and destruction
monotonously repeated every race meets the sex
problem as we are meeting it and every race is
destroyed by it because when it attempts a solution
at all it is by the method of licentiousness in one form
or another

what then is the real remedy  it is implied in
what i have said rigid selfccontrol and the direction
of the personal energies into other channels except
at intervals which ought to be progressively length-
ened instead of the reverse as the race goes higher
any such attempt of course is useless without the
mental self-discipline which is the prerequisite to it

if the parents of today would attempt to set a
proper example to the best of their powers and at
least hold up the ideal successive generations would
get further away from perversion and nearer to con-
formity with nature the craving for variety which
is the cause of present unhappy relationships between
the sexes would disappear and the finer and spiritual
side of marriage which is a sealed book to most of
our people would become the rule and not the ex-
ception the cold truth is that nine-tenths of our
people cannot see in a sex-restrained life anything
but a dreary desert-so far have they fallen

they cannot see the far more splendid things in
life which come with self-control and the corresponding
enhancement of all powers hence they do not be-
lieve in that side of life and their dulled faculties
cut themselves off from knowing it so that there is
a vicious circle indeed a wheel rolling ever down-
ward to the mire of irredeemable bestiality which has
engulfed every great nation since the end of that

period known in india as the golden age  years
ago when right practice and teaching prevailed

scientific fiction has its faults and much of it is
as yet painfully crude but it remains almost the
last island of decency in the midst of the sewer litera-
ture of today if you can do nothing else than keep
it so you will have rendered a service to the race
by taking mens minds off their curse and obsession
love stories by all means where the author has suf-
ficient talent to blend their love motive with the scien-
tific theme -artistically and homogeneously but love
is not lust and cannot exist in toe unrestrained pres-
ence of the latter even though in reading most con-
temporary literature it is sadly evident that the
words are synonymous to the authors

this letter from one of our more mature authors
an engineer highly educated and a profound thinker
is recommended to our readers for their comments
we would be glad to hear other points of view pro
and con with mr endersbys he is correct in say-
ing that modern man believes that he is distinguished
from the lower animals in that his sex life is not
concentrated in mating seasons but extends through-
out the year mr endersby hints fhat this is a sign
of degeneracy we believe his point of view is open

editor wonder stories

while on a week-end visit to a friend i happened
to pick up a copy of the november  issue of
wonder stories that week-end was a total
ios as far as my friend was concerned but i had
the time of my life i read that number from cover
to cover and then came up for breath only to yell
for more

mv friend grinned and said that it was a pretty
hard job to find any old copies of wonder stories
around because they were read by so many in the
family that they usually dropped to pieces by the time
the next number was out but he did manage to rake
up the september issue and in that i found in

i note that you said that the editors were thrilled
when they first read this story you couldnt have
been anymore thrilled than i was it was certainly
a piece of wonderful writing far different than any-
thing i have ever read before i have read jules
verne and wells and some stories of the future by
cummings and farley but those writers simply go
ahead a few hundred years a few steps farther in
the development of things we already know about
schachner and zagat arent afraid to leap 
years into the future and picture beings and civiliza-
tion that only real dreamers eould imagine

yet so vivid do they make their ideas that one
doesnt question for a moment the reality of the
thing

gosh i was ail in a cold sweat i know one or
two farmer boys just like tom i can just picture
them going with open mouths in the country on tne
other side of the space warp in the vanishing wood

answer to a reader you tell that you are going to
have a sequel reserve a copy of that issue for me
it must be a masterpiece i want to thank you for
the intense enjoyment from the two issues of your
magazine that i read

the sequel to in  a d which appears
in this issue will probably be greeted by our readers
as superior to the original story our authors seem
to take hold of their readers in the first paragraph
and refuse to release them until the last word is
written

there is teally no way of telling what the man of

	a i will be like certainly if we were to
see our ancestor of  years ago we should hard-
ly recognize him as belonging to homo sapiens yet
the evolutionary changes that took place over the past

	years will be small as compared with that

period in the future the reason is this-that change
is proportional to the change in environment our
prehistoric ancestors lived in an environment that
hardly changed at all in thousands of years hence
his evolution was quite slow but in our world our
environment changes practically every generation
hence evolution is probably working on us ten or a
hundred times as swiftly since the changes of -

	years will be so vast and the mind becomes
dizzy at contemplating them our authors are all tho
more to be admired for daring and succeeding in
their daring to present a picture of that far distant
world-editor

from a rural minister

in the december issue of wonder stories
there was an author from missouri who stated that
by the reading of wonder slorles it had broad-
ened his view of the universe and gave him a new
theory of religion you invited him to write again
and i looked for his letter in the january issue but
it was not in there nor any other letter that per
tained to what he was talking about

it is to be wondered that more people do not cross
swords with you because you are continually crossing
their theology can it be possible that your magazine
is not read by several ministers versed in the old
school theology i

may i say here that i am a minister of  years
standing and a graduate of theological school i am
working among people in the ozarks very few of
my congregation ever were in high school most of
them quit school when in the fifth grade there
are no telephones very few radios very few news-
papers and no magazines needless to say that their
religion is very personal and in the most cases so
narrow that they exclude the whole world except their
own sect from the benefits of a future life

it is any wonder i am starved for companionship
while i take  papers and magazines yet they eaunot
talk back i should like to correspond with someone
who believes in both science and religion i do not
believe there is any contradiction between them if
both are understood in fact i believe that science
will solve many of the fondest dreams of the theolo-
gian

religion has dreamed of a utopia where there is
no evil no criminals and all is good and lioly it is
only through science that this can come about reli-
gion has dreamed of the resurrection of the dead but
science through tho use cf adrenalin has actually
brought dead persons back to life true they were
only dead a few minutes but it is a good beginning

i hope someone will write me even to bending some
brick-bats for that might even keep me from men-
tally sleeping between issues of wonder slorles

we are orry to hear that we have crossed the
theology of any people we do not intentionally an-
tagonize any people or groups we aim to present
truth to allow our readers to present their views of
the vital questions of today and tomorrow and in
general to stimulate the mind to search out from tho
mibtb of deception illusion superstition and narrow-
ness those paths of existence that will promote their
personal happiness

in connection with this we can say that the second
letter from mr newton appeared in the february is-
sue mr newton explained his personal religion and
to this we offered the following religion is a per-
sonal matter that one can bum up by saying if you
know the truth of existence if you have an under-
standing of the world and are freed from superstitiou
and ignorance then any religious faith that you em-
brace no matter what its nature even the lack of a
faith is the best thing for you 

this btates quite definitely that we do not at all
attempt to change anyones religion both sides of the
religion-science controversy those who are die-hard
atheists and those who are dif-hard theologians have
attacked us stating that we favor the other side
that has given us new courage to believe that our
point of view is sane and liberal

we can feel with our correspondent it is unfor-
tunate that such conditions do exist in our prosperous
highly-developed country as rev johnson pictures

we venture to state however that the publication of
this letter will entirely remove rev johnson from
his intellectual isolation we know that a great
number of our readers will be happy to correspond

it is some time since we have printed a tally of
readers preferences of stories the list seems quite
complete and inclusive

the turning of a rocket in space will have to be
done quite gradually possibly if the rocket is
travelling at a speed of  miles per second to ef-
fectively change its direction will take hundreds of
miles of maneuvering one way to do it is to hut
off some of the rockets that are firing thus if the
rocket tubes are distributed over the rear of tho
ship and it is desired to turn to the left the rockets
on the left will be shut off those on the right will
continue firing and thus an unbalanced force will
bo created on the right this means is suggested
because the firing will be done along the axis of the
ship but as stated such a turn will be very difficult
inasmuch as there is no friction to sustain the ship
on turning the analogy is akin to a skater trying
to make a sharp turn on ice where there js little
friction in order to pivot he must have a point on
which to maintain himself and to halt at that point
requires friction if ice wore entirely frictionless
turning at all would bo next to impossible-editor

a vision of the future

editor wonder stories

please permit me to throw this little monkey wrench
into the dicuebion about time travelling let me
state that i think that time travel is possible though
not for anything in the physical state but here is
one experience

i was standing on the balcony of a midtown hotel
in new york contemplating the throng of traffic be-
low me when suddenly  felt the presence of a second
personality inside my mind a picture formed itself
which transformed tho automobiles into bugs and a
voice asked are theyt i answered no and en-
visioned the inside of a car in my mind forming pic-
tures of the different parts and their functions then
i asked who are you

another picture formed itself i flaw a wide coun-
try with here and there a high spire and lots of small
bungalows dotted through the park-like landscape
now and then a big airship passed overhead on my
questioning how they worked i was shown the inside
of a ship it was of all metal construction and as
solid as a battleship passengers were in cabins and
lounges as on a liner of today big cargo spaces
were filled with grain and piece goods

the engine central was a small room in the centcr
of the ship with a box on a inbuiated table in the
center surrounded by coils and bulbs inside that
box was a cube of material around which a purple
glow undulated the navigating room -was simple-
in the nose of the ship with wide windows add switch-
boards between one man was standing watch and
he bad a easy job as everything was automatic lift
and propulsion was from heavy plates in the hull

my guide tried to explain their action but im afraid
it was a bit over my head the lift plates for in-
stance were on the topside of the ship and my guide
explained that gravity was not a pull but a push and
shielding from that push provided lift and propul-
sion it had something to do with lines in space lie
then took me to one of the big buildings covering
about ten acres and reaching more than  feet
in height with an astronomical observatory on top
but allow me to describe my guide a man of seem-
ing middle age healthy and agile as a sleek cat clad
in a silk-like tunic and nothing else we met some
women too and they were dressed the same only
their form and bobbed hair distinguished them in
that building we went up an elevator and came out
into a wide hall filled with cases and exhibits of which
my guide seemed to be the guardian it was an his-
toric museum

he led me to a case of rifles and inquired the use
of them i explained and requested that the part
showing the stamp on the barrel be cleaned i point-
ed to the year  it was a german mauser and
named the year  as the present whereon he
pointed ut to me a card bearing the sign -
b f and pointed out to me a card bearing the sign

-- when i asked how he could travel m
time i was shown a room in one of those bungalowb
where my mentors body lay in deep sleep we then
went back to my time and i showed him phases of
our life our modes of transport and manufacture our
social life and customs monetary systems justice and
government international relations wars and peace
the different creeds and religions the geographic con-
figuration of the continents

i	went to the public library and looked up a lot
of reference works and nearly drove the attendants
mad with my rapid-fire demands one girl asked
me why i wanted bo many different books and only
looked at certain pictures when i told her that was
just it she gave me a queer look but thought it bet-
ter to humor me in that manner i gave all the
information i could to my guide and which by now i
dont doubt fills a ponderous volume as my men-
tor was the typical professor

it was a crowded afternoon i have put down
here less than one-tenth of all i saw and experienced
and now it seems all a dream but was reality itself
whilst it lasted i asked quite a lot about time
travel and gathered that material things can not be
transported through time as it is possible to put ma-
terial things only through a fourth dimension where
it is possible to go no farther than a hundred years
for greater distances one has to go through the lutn
dimension which is purely mentat

one fact may be interesting the earth had
picked up a second moon at that time one of the
asteroids had fallen into the net of gravity of our
planet his time of revolution was a little more than

	days and in reverse direction to our present moon
also there was intercourse with venus as the only
planet with human beings in the solar system a
humanity uncounted miileniums older than our earth
humanity there was also another race on earth
which was not human but equivalent in every way
to man though utterly different from mankind in its
aims makeup and development i could not quite
make them out as they were absolutely outside my
experience but i was told that there were many
more buch races in the universe though in other

our correspondent has submitted hia name with
this very interesting incident but wishes it withheld
we really think tnat he bad travelled in time of
course in his imagination and that his imagination
is very active and intensely vivid naturally it is
not leal time travelling for we have no way of know-
ing that his vision of the future will be a reality

no doubt all imaginative people have been able to
more or less a degree to project themselves into an-
other world perhaps a world in accordance with their
innermost longings that is our method of escaping
from the torments and tribulations of present day exis-
tence some people call thib imagination dope or
an opiate or akin tc drinking liquors perhaps but
who can condemn itf if it enriches ones life and
makes the enduring of present troubles and disap-
pointments possible then it has served its purpose
we are very grateful to our correspondent for this
lrank revelation of an unusual vision-editor

neither hot nor cold

editor tvoider stories

i have been a reader of wonder stories since
its inception and have derived more enjoyment and en-
lightenment from its perusal than from any other
magazine in print and the science questions and
answers section of your magazine is the most inter-
esting and instructive department of any magazine that
i have ever read

however i find myself distinctly in controversy
with your most estimable editor-in-ohief mr hugo
gternsback in regard to certain statements that he
made that i will quote from his editorial wonders of
the vacuum published in the january  issue
if my letter proves of general interest i would like
to have its contents and your answer published in this
magazine- 

the following quotation is the one alluded to in
the foregoing paragraph

this idea is open to some controversy for tho
writers have left the terrific cold encountered in open
space out of their calculations it is my opinion that
if you eject a human being without protection from
a space flyer he will not have sufficient time to ex-
plode because he will probably be frozen solid instan-
taneously

i disagree with the above opinion specifically in re-
gard to the temperature of the absolute vacuum that
is called space and the following simple syllogism
will illustrate my point

any element or chemical substance iu the whole uni-
verse is either hot or cold	

a vacuum is the complete absence of any element
or chemical substancc		

therefore a vacuum can be neither hot nor
cold	  

now as to definitions a vacuum as defined in
websters standard dictionary is space entirely de-
void of matter it seems then that if my premises
are correct my conclusion must be correct also and
from this conclusion i have come to believe that spaco
flyers of the future will not have to insulate against
the supposed absolute zero temperature of outer space
but that they will merely have to provide a means
to keep their space ships from radiating heat that
they already have

torial and those of our correspondent the difference
is one only of terminology from a strictly literal
point of view empty space can be neither hot nor cold
as mr kitue states but it is useful in practice to
speak of space being cold meaning that a body in
space no matter how cold it is already will radiate heat
away instead of reoeiving it or maintaining its statna
quo that is all bodies in space if they do not receive
heat from any suns or planets etc will tend to become
colder than they are thus space has a cooling in-
fluence

a space flyer will of course lose heat continually by
radiation and as mr kittle rightly states it will have
to insulate itself against such loss there is no doubt
however that the outer shell of the ship away from the
sun would ordinarily reach a temperature of almost
absolute zero because it would radiate its heat away
so quickly it would not reach absolute zero because
as it became colder and colder it would radiate more
and more slowly and therefore it would in practice
always retain some heat

another angle of this question is presented when wo
ask what absolute zero is the answer is that it is an
entire absence of heat since there is an entire ab-
sence of heat in empty space-it may for the purposes
in question be considered at absolute zero and if the
rate of radiation of a body were to be figured the tem-
perature limits used would be between the temperature
of the radiating body and absolute zero this question
is a very interesting one and we invite the comment of
our readers-editor

england and science fiction

editor wonder stories

i wish to inform you of a movement recently started
in ilford ebb ex lngland by myself in cooperation
with a fellow reader of your excellent publications
mr l a kippin which will certainly interest you
and all your readers especially the british ones with
whom we are anxious to get into contact

i have been an extraordinarily interested and in-
tensely enthusiastic supporter of bcience fiction since
i first came into contact with your earlier publica-
tions however our new movement evolved out of a
communication in wonder stobiks and we soon got
together und developed thidgs which we hope will be
even further developed

enclosed is a pull of our initial activities which i
wrote for my paper the ilford recorder as i am a
representative of this we are at a distinct advantage
as regards publicity

i hope you will give us your support at present
our meetings are confined to the readings of the
earlier examples of american science fiction and dis-
cussion upon it but we want all english enthusiasts
to support our movement and to organize similar
circles in all districts so that a thriving national
eociety for the promotion of scientific literature will
gradually be evolved

all readers whether regular or no if in sympathy
with our cause are asked to communicate with me

may we consider you as a patron ol our movement

walter h gillings

hon sec ilford science literary cud
 grove green road laytonstone
london e  england

ab the result of a letter published in a recent issue
of the recorder to which there was an immediate
response the inaugural meeting of the ilford science
literary circle was held on monday evening

the club has been formed in an attempt to bring
together in ilford all local residents in sympathy
with the furtherance of scientific knowledge and who
themselves possess a keen interest in the progress and
especially the possibilities of scientific achievement

its object is the promotion of scientific literature
in great britain its members aim to popularize
locally at first and then on a more ambitious scale
the reading of fiction into which is introduced in an
attractive manner strict scientific fact and unlimited
imagination	

unfortunately baid mr w h gillings who in
co-operation with mr l a kippcn is the originator
of the new movement this type of literature has
never been very popular in england apart from the
works of jules verne and mr h g wells perhaps
however this is because of the lack of suitable authors
to furnish it for when one has read all the available
material of these two writers the supply is practically
exhausted

but wo surmounted that difficulty some time ago
the americans with tljeir greater capacity for specu-
lation introduced it into their literature four years
ago and now there are several thriving popular maga-
zines which cater solely for the science fiction fan

these circulate practically throughout the world
and have many enthusiastic readers m england we
are always encountering sceptical people who seem to
regard us as having peculiar and rather offensive
literary tastes but wo are all unanimous in that al-
though our favourite type of story looks rather ex-
travagant and fantastic at firt sight there is nothing
more entertaining instructive and thought-provoking
than is scientific fiction

their american periodicals which incidentally are
almost entirely devoid of the familiar yankee slang
have evolved from humble beginnings into a veritable
feast of literature such as is unobtainable in british
publications

altogether some two hundred authors contribute
to them including many medical men a well-known
explorer and beveral others prominent in the field of
american science many ordinary bound volumes of
this type of fiction are also published in the united
states in addition to the magazines which are im-
mensely popular there

the reader speaks

contimied from page 

what wo aim to do however continued the
speaker is to make scientific fiction popular on this
side of- the atlantic and create a sufficient demand
for it that the english publishers may be induced t
pay more attention to its development

an ambitious project yet one that will merit soma
success we are sure as soon as we start the bsll
rollingf we enthusiasts in ilford intend to organize
a series of scientific readings and discussions and to
get others in different parts of the country to follow
our example thus we hope will an interest in
scientific fiction grow space materially assisting tho
progress of science itself by the advancement of scien-
tific knowledge as concerns the average mau and add
ing to is imagination which we all agree is a most
valuable factor of human life

the circle the recorder is informed still has
room for some more members whether or not they
are familiar with scientific literature such as will be
the chief subject of its activities especially weloomo
are those who are desirous of something different
to read modern scientific fiction offers everything
that is novel and original in literature and whether a
reador is inclined to take it seriously or no it is at
least something new to most people

it has been decided to hold meetings each week

we believe that the english response to the science
fiction movement now sweeping the world and bogun
in an auspicious way by the editor of wonder
stories many years ago is now arriving

england the birthplace of h g wells is now ac-
knowledging the meaning and the significance of
science fiction and we oelieve that this movement
begun by mr gillings will spread rapidly we want
to accord it our enthusiastic support

of late many splendid stories have been coming
out of england men like george b beattie and ben-
son herbert carrying on the wells tradition with an
ever-enlarging reader interest stimulated by the liter-
ary circle reaching each other through wonder
stories and more and more englishmen of talent
turning to science fiction we believe that old eng-
land will closely follow amerioa in its devotiou to this
new art the circle is invited to use our discussion
columns as a means of spreading their good world
throughout the united kingdom and the british em-
pire as a whole-editor

interesting as the subject may be our ability ts
travel into the past or future with a time machine
presents seemingly insurmountable scientific difficul-
ties i am excluding our present known time mach-
ine the telescope as unworthy of consideration ploaso
check my brief conclusions for possible errors

as we go through our daily life we throw off into
infinity a succession of light reflections and sound
vibrations which for sake of argument we will say out-
lives our earthly bodies and awaits detection by a time
machine fi is logical to assume that they travel at
terrific speed and do not pile up within our own at-
mosphere in layers like pancakes to catch up with
these emanations one would require a machine capa-
ble  of traveling at a far greater speed suppose
somewhere out into space a time machine could oatoh
up with these light and sound emanations of a certain
historical time period would it be possible to inter-
rupt as it were lives that and action that had already
transpired-the force back of it having died

that which one would see and possibly hear would
be but the empty images and sound echoes of that
which was but is no more only as an imprint on tide
itself to mingle with those of the past or future
and take part in the life of that period would necessi-
tate tho provision of time-space for introduction of the
action therein and make allowance for the resulting
action of the visits

if one could go into the past and converse with those
of the past one could visit himself as a boy and oh

in his recent book the mysterious universe sir
james jeans one of the mokt conservative and influ-
ential of present day scientists unconsciously lends his
prestige to the possibility of time travelling we do not
create events by which we measure time nor in a real
ense do they happen to us according to jeans we
happen across events and thereby we measure time by
the succession of events such as the movement of the
stars but in a real sense we are like the fly who
moves wo-dimensioually across a painting as he per-
ceives the various parts of the painting little by little
the fly may think that he has created that painting
but in reality we know that he is only happening
over various part of it if the various parts of the
painting are events that occur to us the analogy is
complete	

we see therefore that there is no order in which
events must occur they are rather a matter of chance
or probability of what part we will happen across
and that the future and the present exist together
with the past our sense of time is merely that which
we have already experienced we call the past and
what we have not yet seen we call the future but they
exist nevertheless mow if our two-dimensional fly s
progress across the painting were suddenly interrupted
and we were to raise our wings and jump to another
part of the painting we would have travelled in time

the subject is so vast and we are having so many
of our fixed notions upset that the best we can do is
to shake our heads and say almost anything is pos-

the mysterious universe by sir
james jeans  pages illustrated
size x published by the macmillan
company new york price 

this volume a sequel and in the plan of the
author an addition to his universe around vs was
written in order to provide some of the ground work
for the construction of new philosophical theories about
our universe that are in tho air there is a wide-
spread conviction says sir james in the foreword

	that the new teachings of astronomy and physics are
destined to produce an immense change on our out-
look on the universe as a whole and on our views as
to tho significance of human life the question at
issue is one for philosophic discussion but before the
philosophers have a right to speak science ought first
to be asked to tell all she can as to ascertained facts
and provisional hypotheses 

to accomplish this task of science the author in
four chapters entitled the dying sun the new
world of modern physics matter and radiation
and relativity and the ether presents the most
modern of our knowledge of our physical universe
and in the last chapter rightly entitled into the
deep waters he sums up this knowledge into his own
symbolic picture

it is not an easy book to read nor are his conclu-
sions simple to grasp he believes that the world we
live in and perceive has the same relatiou to reality
as the shadows cast upon the wall by three dimension-
al objects in other words events that occur to us are
probably only the projection on a three-dimensional
screen of events in a world of higher dimensions to
that super world we are as the earth worms are to
us

although through our feeble sense and feebler exper-
ience it is almost impossible for us to grasp the uni-
verse in its entirety jeans to sum up believes that
the universe appears as though it were the work of a
muster mathematician a pure mathematician
