   amp towels are dangerous hamper companions

for chiffon blockings

when delicate silks are put in a hamper with
the towels sheets and colored cottons of the
weekly wash they wear out long before they
have given the service you have reason to
expect of them

  why because even though not obviously
soiled they contain perspiration acids from the
skin which are kept moist by the hamper damp-
ness and destroy the silk fibres

  so to preserve fragile garments and prolong the
  length of their service many women have made it
  a habit to tub them in ivory suds as soon as pos-
  sible after they are worn whether they look
  soiled or not

tn this way acid action and the fading and
streaking that come from tossing such garments
into stuffy hampers are all prevented all delicate
things reward this simple care with far longer life

  of course a soap that is the
slightest bit too strong will
spoil your whole effort by in-
juring the fabrics and colors

  ivory cake or flakes is safe

for as you know ivory has

for  years protected the complexions of
millions of women

  the best test we know of for determining
the safety of any soap for delicate silks and
woolens is this ask yourself would i use it
on my face

how to wash blankets safely

harsh soap rubbing and extremes of tempera-
ture cause sensitive wool fibres to mat down
shrink and become hard and scratchy

  keep blankets fluffy by squeezing lukewarm
ivory suds through the fabric rinsing in luke-
warm water and airing well

  the ivory suds assures you of beautiful safe
results and absolute cleanliness

 common sense horse sense as we say
 the practical view of life is a fine and
 necessary thing people who lack it have
 got to have a tot of talent in various ways
 to get by in any degree without it and
 yet like many
 other good things
 even common sense
 can be carried too
 far it can be car-
 ried to the place
 where life loses all
 color and joy it
 can be carried to
 the place where
 you make of your-
 self a machine do-
 ing an endless
 round of seemingly
 necessary things-
 and nothing else

 that of course is
 not living it is
 only existing and
 the useful things
 you are doing are
 becoming your
 master

   so it becomes
 necessary for us to
 know when the
 point of common
 sense has been
 reached and when

 hugwater wallie

by clem yore
author of mac of the tumbling k a son of the circle etc

chugwater wallie and the men who had hired him for his dan-
gerous work had thought his advent into the valley would
be unnoticed instead his arrival was awaited his welcome
was a bullet and that bullet was but a hint of what
was to come before chugwater could ride in safety again

lettie buford had been asleep
on the window bench in the sit-
ting-room of the t hanging
box when the drowsy murmur
of voices coming through an
open window aroused her she heard the
late afternoon breeze stirring the tops of
the blue gums caught the faintest tinkle of
running water from an irrigation ditch
and listened langourously to the drone of
bees coming from the virginia creeper
climbing the heaven-tree those voices
they nettled her then she heard the rush
of a running horse a sudden stop a strain
of leather the plomb of boots as they
struck the gravel of the ranch-house yard
sleep vanished

  whence come you caballero andante
she recognized the sneering voice of luis
perez the foreman of the t hanging box
which adjoined her fathers ranch the k
seven quarter circle fifteen miles away

  caballero andante the arrival repeat-
ed and she caught the bitter hurt he hurled
in the repetition of the phrase meaning
knight errant i am a new mexico
mexican he shot and care nothing for
your high-blown talk i am american by
birth i vote i belong to-

  you rode in fast talk the same way
gringo 

  lettie was an adept at border spanish
the voices grew in excitement then calmed
to a hum she knew tidings of grave na-

ture had arrived after a moment she
heard a complete speech

  i tell you he is on the way now he
leaves the freight train at querida and
comes here by horse he is fine por dios
but they say he rides like a god and is as
handsome as a matador if you move
now it must be now

  again thou gnat tell me his name
chugwater wallie from chugwater
wyoming and he rides as a hireling to
the cattlemens association we had it
from fort collins by wire my brother and
myself i have as you know two cousins
there in the sugar factory they know
many things and are sly as toads bu-
fords man talked i wager that

  he will ride from the railroad into this
valley is that so

  si luis perez now if all you want
is a few days this is your chance buz-
zards cover a trail like nothing else
lettie arose and went to the well drew
a bucket of cool water and filled a pitcher
on her return to the house she saw the men
who had been talking they were luis
max and a swarthy mexican she did not
know a horse lather covered stood
chomping a bloody bit under a pepper tree
she washed her face tidied up her dress a
bit and her hair then strolled onto the ve-
randa the talk of the mexicans per-
plexed her she did not like it after a
while a woman came out of the house and


	short

said something to her in a low tone she
hurried through the wide hall across a
patio and into a room where a man of sixty
reclined on an elbow in a bed

  lettie he said painfully i want to
thank you for the attention you have
shown to me its been downright neigh-
borly but manuela and i have decided
you neednt stay any longer the fevers
gone

  are you sure 

theres the thermometer but i took
my temperature a moment ago ninety-
eight and a half-thats what it read even
and the wound she asked does it
ache 

  a-little but when the cool of the eve-
ning comes ill get relief go honey your
dad must be worrying about you some
of the boys are coming up tonight sure
ill go then mr worley for i know
father needs me

  at the door she turned back and said
i just heard luis talking to a strange
mexican and they said something about a
rider the cattlemens association was send-
ing in here today his name is chugwater
wallie what do they mean

  the blood drained from the sick mans
face

  they said that

  yes and the black mex insinuated
that buzzards are fine to hide a trail i
dont like that kind of talk in this valley
mr worley

  you know mexicans my dear some
woman i think is at the bottom of that
you understood the words they spoke to
mean cattlemens association  maybe
they were something else

  maybe she said and turned to leave
at the door she looked back and smiled
ill come right back if you need me
dont hesitate to send for me will you
adios he replied get luis to hook
up your pony and when he is done send
him to me

  as the girl clattered away luis perez
entered the room where the wounded man
lay

  well  he said a diabolical twinkle in
his eye

  when you talk do it low that girl
heard every damn word you said tell it
quick spill everything pronto

  and luis repeated what his messenger
lad conveyed to him

whats on the tapis asked worley
im riding our east fence then down
through the wagon mound hills across
the big pear-patch and laying there till this

stories

 baby comes along he must never get into
 engle

   thats right fly at it what did you
tell the boys in town about my wound 
you was hanging up a gun when it fell
and punctured your hip nobodys seen a
thing nobody knows nothing

    slide out you got to hurry to beat the
 sun to that pear

    ill be there im picking up a change
 of horses in our big ditch pasture that
 blues all right now huh

   hell carry you so long

   luis opened the door and almost
- knocked manuela down she was picking
some potatoes which had fallen from
her apron as he collided with her

    luis didn-t like the look he saw in that
 kindly old face

    if ever you open that trap of yours
 he sneered in spanish ill slit it for you
 did you hear  greasy snake

   you mean about your two wives i
 am from valencia these many years
 ah que one cannot blame lovers

   he spat close to the hem of her dirty
 old dress

   valencia where all the women are
 false and pretty where theres a church
 a long pavement worn by the dirty feet of
 lying women and a dead man

    she smiled

   go she said what a temper you
 have

 chugwater wallie dropped
 out of a caboose on a siding near
 querida and by the aid of the train
 crew worked a tall sorrel gelding down
 some bridge planks and out of the car in
 which it had been riding with a string of
 other horses quickly he threw his outfit
 on the animal atid jogged away from the
 railroad when the train was nothing but
 a clot of dust with a topknot of white at
 its fore which he knew to be the escaping
 steam from a safety valve he pulled a pa-
 per from his shirt pocket and staring at it
 raised his eyes and searched the horizon
 grimly he smiled and put the sketch back
 in his shirt

    this is shore one easy country to map
 he mused if all them hills aint twins
 then im prohibition i reckon all i kin
 do is keep a-ridin till i runs into some-
 thin that looks human or maybe a string
 o wire come on hayburner im crav-
 in distance the horse flecked an ear
 and increased its slow lope chugwater
 warbled a song urged to music by a deep
 gnaw at the pit of his stomach

an a-cravin for a can of java too

  now beans is what i means

  just a shovelful of beans

now come along pie-trammer

  these yere chaps is my pa jammer

an im empty from the belly-band to heel
  just deal em off yore arm

  sling em slick an sling em warm-

  oh oh hayburner i seen it too
he said ending the ballad abruptly a
flash of dust swirled in a tangle of heat
waves on the crest of a distant rise it
lingered a fraction then vanished chug-

water lost all
thought of
hunger

  ill bet he
turned that
b r o o m-tail
around on less
ground than

jhis hat wud
cover in about
twenty minutes
im a-thinkin
ill shore be a-dreamin its the fourth of
july

  he loosened the - carbine in the
saddle scabbard carefully he drew it
out held it against the side of the horse
and wrapping the lines around the pom-
mel tested the gun and saw that a shell was
in the chamber as he rode he carried
the saddle-guns muzzle hooked in the top
of the stirrup taps and half concealed in
the flap of his texas-wing chaparejos

  imperceptibly he guided his mount by
knee pressure and body-leaning in a gen-
tle curve away from the region where the
burst of dust had appeared

  the same pace was maintained however
and the miles slipped gradually away of
a sudden the magic of the heated air un-
wound and he saw before him a vast field
of detestable vegetation it looked like a
region of lost souls

  hayburner he chuckled old lara-
mie county never learned yu nothin about
pear but in fifteen minutes yu better keep
them laigs o yores just so pears hell
on hosses fool bosses

pi-ing yzeeee a stab of pain
chugwater slumped in the saddle threw
his body on the off side of the horse and
clutched desperately at the horn with a
hidden heel he jammed a five point rowel
to

into his ponys flank and the animal tore
forward at a desperate pace his back
burned

   now boy he said his face turned up
along the geldings neck do yore stuff
when i quits yu shove on i tells yu an
shove on some mo

  when a dense thicket of prickly-pear
was reached wallie dropped clear of the
flying legs and rolled along the sand his
rifle was thrown just as he fell and a mo-
ment later was covered by his body which
lay huddled in a limp heap the head partly
under an extended arm the face buried
in the sand and the feet asprawl chug-
waters left hand was hidden beneath his
chaps and in it he held a bone handled six-
gun

  after a minute he heard the sound of
galloping hoofs then the threshing of a
moving horse in the cactus the sound
came closer and closer then ceased and was
replaced by the unmistakable crunch of
boots running in slipping soil a hand
grasped at the neck of his shirt and he
was flung over on his back from this
position he jerked his gun into the air and
fired then he rolled rolled toward the
boots now so close to his body there
was another discharge and he felt powder
sting along his neck the figure above
him crumpled a single-action colt dropped
to the earth and a mexican doubled up
and buckled backward into a pear tree
chugwater emitted a long shrill whistle
and the gelding rushed to his side kick-
ing sand over the fallen colt he grabbed
his carbine touched the horn of his sad-
dle mounted on the run and disappeared

  desert coyotes hayburner an they
runs in pairs he cried as he bent low
down on the neck of his horse les go
old sweetie we just gota go now they
burnt yore daddy

   making the top of a small rise he looked
back and saw a fleeting horse dashing
toward the spot of his encounter he
caught sight of a lurid shirt it was blood
crimson with wide double line checks
about the arms he thought he glimpsed blue
garters but he was dead certain that the
hat was an el stroud stetson with a five
inch brim and a seven inch crown and
around it was a diamond-design bead hat-
band

   he flung a bullet ahead of the flying
horse as it entered the clump of cactus
then flew into the vegetation before him
at the end of thirty minutes he came out
on a loose gravelly floor which rose abrupt-
ly toward a greasewood slope


short stories

  picking out one of two arroyos he rode
up it as fast as he could and reaching the
top hesitated long enough to take a look at
the paper in the shirt pocket then he
headed directly for a sugar-loaf hill stuffed
the carbine in its boot and settled the geld-
ing to its long and accustomed stride

  if that aint a greetin he mused
somebodys leaked somebodys wised
up these centipedes but i introduced my-
sef hayburner i an yu oldtimer we
shore took our seats right now didnt
we

  his back burned and after a while it felt
sticky

  aint i the doggonest old son of a gun
he said aloud i aint never goin to show
that on the chugwater them hoss thieves
always wud swear i was jack-rabbitin it
away when i got that nope ill change
my shirt out in the harness-shed or i wont
change it

  shortly after nine oclock he drew rein
at the k seven quarter circle ranch and
shouted at the house a door opened and
a middle-aged man stood in the light
who is it he hailed

  is this mister buford

  yes sir

  im gotta note to yu an if yu dont
mind id like for yu to come on out yere
an loan me the loan of a shoulder if i
tries to leave this saddle im goin to
bounce shore

  the man in the door hurried across the
porch and assisted chugwater from the
saddle slowly he limped into the house
where the first thing he saw was the face
of a girl very white and very beautiful
staring at him as he was helped into a chair
what is it father she asked

  this gentleman is hurt it seems now
my boy what can we do for you

  read that and wallie brought out a
slim envelope and gave it to the ranchman
tearing it open buford held out his hand
chugwater he smiled im glad to know
you and youve just arrived in time

my brothers direc-
tions were success-
ful

  yaas suh an-
swered chugwater
i wasnt expected
much neither i
reckon or maybe
i was some hom-
bre made a right fine shot at me i reckon
it must a bin a good three hundred yards
an he burnt me too

  why hes wounded dad cried the

girl cant you see that take off his
boots and lets get him on the sofa while

i	run for some water and a first-aid

  dont touch them boots suh spoke
wallie

   why asked the girl

  that left ones plumb full of blood
lets ramble out on the porch an thay
wont be no mess in yere

  the room whirled the girl floated
away in a mist the center of which was a
crazy lamp that revolved with a sickening
motion then a vast ringing came into his
ears and he settled limply in the chair

  when next he opened his eyes the same
beautiful girl was seated by an open win-
dow beside the bed and she was fanning
the flies from his face

   why maam its plumb day aint it
were the first words he spoke

   she jerked about in the chair and fixed
him with a curious look how do you
feel she asked

  lordy he grinned just like santa
claus done drove up an left me in the lap
of old lady luxury howm i corn-
in

  fine she answered you have lost
a great deal of blood but the bullet passed
through the flesh along the shoulders dad
didnt send for a doctor for after we
looked at the wound he decided it wouldnt
be necessary then he doesnt want any
one to know youre with us he thought
that would be your desire too

   thats right

   i am lettie buford she said

  daughter of the colonel he re-
marked

  un-huh she smiled but he isnt a
colonel

  oh yaasm he is im from kentuck
an all them bufords is colonels except
them as is genrals yu better not never
call one of em captain no sir my
gracious i wudnt like to make such a
blunder

  you are better she laughed after
what i know you went through chug-
water i fancy you could call a man most
anything if you felt like it

   shucks he replied in confusion if
ever yu seen a fella leave a country that
was me when them boys began slammin
lead at me i an hayburner shore took
no pity on that pear an i wants yu to
 know maam-miss-

   lettie she aided

   lettie he went on that when i an
that horse starts high-tailin why we leaves
town i leaned agin that landscape down

                                                     
chugwater wallie



there till i bet i bulged it wide

  are you hungry she asked

  am i what say miss lettie if it
was raining rations an i was standin in
a forty acre field thay wudnt a blade o
grass get hit by so much as a bean

  then ill get you some of the broth
from the stew we had dinner

  stew what kinda stew

  irish stew this is the seventeenth of
march

  st paddys day lord yestiddy i
thought it was independence day an we
was givin the british hell never mind
the broth just bring in the stew-ill get
the broth ill just nacherly use that to
grease the stew with

  and that was how chugwater wallie
came to the k seven quarter circle while
lettie was gone for the food he turned his
head and looked out of the window across
the fields of alfalfa now growing green
and in blossom close to the house a calf
bawled down in a corral a humming-
bird whisked like a veil across his vision
and fluttered for honey about the holly-
hocks a mocking-bird warbled in low
rich minor from the top of a cotton-wood
and a vagrant wind stole through the win-
dow and fanned his cheek

  this country is shore hell-for-pretty
he murmured an if i ever leaves it why

i-i hope somebody romps on my neck

ii

in two weeks chugwater was up and
around in three he was sound as a
dollar and fretting to be at his work
-the breaking up or ferreting out of the
gang that was in charge of the entire coun-
ty its outlawry its politics that was his
enterprise

  his convalescence had been a dream to
him a vision of the most exquisite loveli-
ness he had ever known

  lettie and he stood near the corral gate
while wallie rubbed down his gelding with
a currycomb and brush after a while
the girl spoke her silence prior to this
had been formidable and he fancied some-
thing grave was troubling her now as
she spoke a quality in her voice made him
whirl and glance at her face

  you think a great deal of that sorrel
dont you  was what she said

  oh yaasm he answered relieved
i bought him from a fella who was said
to be the wisest hoss trader in wyomin
he said hayburner oughta be worth ten
dollars of any mans money fifteen if the
coin was stole so i haggled a bit an


give him seven-fifty he was wise that
fella yaasm if yu pulled one of his
wisdom teeth yud yank out a shoulder
bone

  what made him under-rate the horse
well he never seen the pony cept in
winter when the snow was so deep yu had
to use a pitchfork to find a haystack an
then all the range stock was as pore as
bees runnin on alkali water an their
spirit was gone hayburner looked like a
kansas preacher dealin monte but that
fella was a fool now for me gimme a
good man goin off half-cocked sometimes
a smart thief that looks it a bang up
twenty-four carat six-day-a-week stem-
windin hypocrite but lord miss lettie
deliver me from a damn fool if ever a
white man took a cheatin it was that
scoundrel as sold me hayburner

  lettie was silenced by the outburst
chugwater thought he had offended by the
use of the expletive damn im lurid
he smiled when i uses hoss-talk yu
had oughtnt let it though bother yu none
im quittin it right soon

  she smiled i wasnt thinkin of the
words i was just forming an opinion
perhaps you are right about that kind of
fool you mentioned im afraid daddy
comes under the classification

  now shucks miss lettie i wudnt
let nary one but yu talk thataway what
yu mean

  the day you came to our house i was
nursing a neighbor rancher and i heard a
mexican tell his foreman another greas-
er that chugwater wallie was to arrive by
way of querida then luis was told that
buzzards hid a trail they said and im
sure they knew that the cattlemens asso-
ciation had employed you to ferret out the
members of the rustlers gang i told
father and dad hasnt done a thing yet
he isnt afraid but i dont know what it
is i think he hates to start a war hes
been through two

  is this luis a ganglin long windin
stoop shouldered blond mexican

  hes tall and thin yes and is rather
light with gray eyes

  does he wear fancy shirts an a classy
stetson 

  yes

  an was ary one of them other fellas
with the foreman tall and a real black
mexican-what i means is black

  yes i should judge he was five feet
eleven the whites of his eyes showed
horribly his face was like a negros
yuve shore classified him-sound to


short stories

go without a blemish to sell and his notch-
es all even up miss lettie them was the
birds what started to burn me out the
country

  i thought so she answered but
father rather figured it was the gang from
across the rio grande but you would
know them again if you saw either of them
wouldnt you 

  know em  why if i was froze up in
hell id grade both of em through forty
feet of red hot ice an when i see em
im goin to give em hell-an-repeat an
yu neednt guess twice about that neither
whos that cornin down the road 

  father cried the girl and hurried
toward the house

  buford ran his pony into the yard and
yelled for chugwater and when the
young rider had put away his horse the
two men and the girl went into the living
room where the elder man spoke swiftly

  my boy he said his voice quavering
there is trouble abroad now and its
open warfare on this range im afraid
last night the five horse thieves we had in
the county jail escaped do you know
what that means 

  i reckon theyre dustin landscape
now

  it means that some man in authority
allowed them to go free gave them the
saws to break jail and then went away
from the court house while they did it
they are headed for the country west of
hot springs up in and around the old
nigger-diggings

  who were they suh 

  buck tilley hes the leader the hot
tamale kid a half-breed mexican and
apache one-eye john a large norweg-
ian  big foot alec and abilene al heres
a description of them all and a photo re-
production of their faces

  chugwater studied the reward notice for
a few moments

  i reckon i kin keep this he said
when  was a kid i knew this abilene
al he useter be a railroad cop for the
u p at cheyenne an he was strict why
hed run yu two miles if he smelt whisky
on yore breath first thing i heard hed

gered is this this luis an his boss is in

rancher

announced lettie looking from the win-
dow gracious i didnt expect them for
another week

  yore men suh asked chugwater
yes theyve been hunting strays mend-
ing fence and branding they left here
the day before you arrived

   is they all right 

  as far as i know

  lettie left the room to get food for wal-
chugwater wallie



lie while buford sought a bed roll and just
as chugwater was ready to ride away
ten k seven quarter circle boys rode into
the yard

  chugwater pulled down his hat humped
a shoulder and was edging around the grain
shed with his horse when a pair of gray
eyes caught and held his he recognized
that face knew it at a glance it belonged
to sandy stuart a man with whom wallie
had quarreled in the browns hole country
of colorado there was malevolence of a
violent character in the glance stuart gave
wallie and the look stayed with him until
the ranch-house was lost to sight that
night he camped on a high flat among the
pinon-pine

  the following morning as he ishook
some coffee out of a small bag into his
stew pan a piece of paper caught his eye
coming out of the sack he literally
grabbed it and read a few lines written in
pencil

  please dont take too many chances
  and depend on it if zee find you
  have been traced we will get the
  signal to you i will ride myself
  and place it on the bridge remember
  what you told me about a d- fool
  and come back to the ky-soon

                                  l

  doggone he ejaculated and read the
note again his horse was hobbled near-
by and cropping the grass beneath a small
tree hayburner yelled wallie the
horse raised its head boy if i felt any
better id have a runaway come yere
the sorrel hobbled over to the little fire
chugwater put an arm around its neck
then loosened the gunny-sack hobbles
does yu know sweetie that im just that
larrupin fine that ill be feedin the but-
terflies all this day an ill bet right this
minute i cud fall five hundred feet with-
out dirtyin a shirt dern yu didnt i
learn yu to eat oats  then lissen  hay-
burner rubbed his cheek against wallies
shoulder quit that hear me in my
haid thays somethin thats millin to beat
hell an is tryin to bed-down dont look
at me like that if ylt kin understand talk
then hear me one look at that lettie
girl wud make a panhandle onion taste

lieve my mother wasted milk on me as a
kid besides if i study about that much
an it dont grow hay why id cave in like
a wind-house go on now an eat soons


i get this java brewed ill drink to her an
yu honey to her an yu

  hayburner strolled away and after a
few minutes raised his head chugwater
stood before the fire a steaming can of
coffee held beneath his lips

  heres mud in yore eye he said

  after breakfast wallie packed up and
rode away

  and that night he camped on the west
side of the rio grande he noted as he
crossed the river on the bridge that the
water was roily and that the spring freshets
in southern colorado were being carried
swiftly to the gulf soon that stream would

be a raging torrent in this event the only
passage in a hundred miles would be the
very bridge on which he stood no man
could ford that dirty rushing current which
now at quarter flood looked murderous in
its seething beds of sucking whirlpools

  he built a roaring fire directly on the
highest point of a steep pine ridge and sat
beside it smiling vacantly and staring into
the flames soon he heard hayburner
emit a loud snort wallie knew what that
meant a human being was coming up
the slope out of the pines a voice hurtled
stay squintin just like yu is

  come on yelled chugwater i dont
know what yull do but i shore know
what yu is

  a mans laugh broke the stillness
well a voice cried he aint no bum-
bola anyhow put down the gun an lets
all slant a eye over him

   five figures circled the fire

  howdy greeted wallie shall i move
over or kin yu boys find plenty room on
this rim-rock

  where yu from asked a vicious look-
ing man whom chugwater recognized
from the reward notice he had studied as
buck tilley

if i was to tell yu all them things the
first thing i knew yud be gettin my mail
we seen that road-eater of yours corn-
in down from the san jacinto-way late
this afternoon

  yep we was

  been to san felipe too
io

short stories

  yep

  one of the men jumped back he was
the half-breed the hot tamale kid

  let him alone thays small pox at
felipe he cried i gotta enough give
him orders an lets get goin

  i circled that air town said wallie
i jams into a fella afore i gits to that sin-
hole an he was as white as a tombstone
runnin agin the country i says whats
wrong podner small pox he says
theys dyin like rats black small-pox
an he was gone all i seen of him was
his old fryin pan puttin four feet up and
four feet down an leavin twenty feet in
between

  buck tilley sat down

  when didja leave wyomin he asked
round about thirty days ago maybe
borrowed something before yu quit
say if yu is the law id like right well
to look at yore jail ive inspected an
condemned mo jails than most anybody i
know if yu hombres is the law all i
kin say is nobody pays taxes down yere
buck locked his fingers around a knee
and tilted backward swaying to and fro
and scrutinizing chugwaters features

  up to that instant wallie had refrained
from glancing at the other members of the
band but as tilley fixed his eyes upon him
he estimated th faces of the other men
just at the end of the circle he saw abi-
lene al he looked boldly into the face of
the man and laughed aloud

  i got yu placed anyhow he said

  al moved toward him

  meanin which

  the last time i seen yu i was slippin
down between a string of empties in the
yards at cheyenne an yu was wearin a
pie plate on yore bosom as would dazzle a
headlight

  tilley laughed

  didnt i tellya al i kin spot these
fancy guys as far as sand shows this
kids broke an lookin for some place to
lay out a lotta police gossip am i right 
deal me a hand remarked chugwater
casually all ive got off this country
for the past ten days is a big bundle of
laughs

  kin yu ride

  yure a cow-hand or yu wudnt be
eatin yore neighbors beef

  rope

with both hands all the way to a
sixty-five foot piece of twine an i kin
build em an braid em too-injun raw-
hide silk-manila or monterey maguay
are yu known in engle

  hell no all i understands about that
town is that its got four wheels an no
brakes aint thay a place there called
the cow daddie saloon 

  several of the men glanced at buck
yep he answered the sheriff of this
county runs it

  thats the place a friend of mine
from over on the sweetwater was down
there two year ago an he said the boys
rode in one door took a drink an rode
out the other if a fellow got down off
his horse to drink he cudnt get back on
agin

  everybody laughed

  come on kid said tilley genially
lets all of us be gettin up to our lay-out
yure shore in among christians now
an if yu knows a good fast game when
yu sees one right heres where yu can
get a change of shirt entirely to yore lik-
in well tell yu somethin when we get
the whole crowd in one room

  lets go remarked chugwater im
shore tired of sleepin in this san antonio
duck

  and while hayburner was being sad-
dled the men stood off and admired him
by the light of the fire

  thats a plumb road hoss boy com-
mented buck tilley

  yep the hombre dont live that kin
fork a hoss an camp alongside me an this
baby night in an night out if we dont like
the way he makes pancakes i got him
off a fella in wyoming for a little lessn
six bits an ill bet he thinks creation
done played him for a white chip ever
since

  yull need just such of a pony i aims
to run yu ragged between here an engle
at least till election time

  wallie swung himself into the saddle
and followed tilley

  hey chief jibed chugwater as the
men reached their horses im right anx-
ious to know how yu placed me as from
wyomin how come

  i knew that little old cheyenne saddle
the roll in the seat looks like a bee stung
it id just as soon be in the middle of thg
atlantic in a rowboat as sittin a livin hoss
in a stingy thing like that

  chugwater felt relieved

  huh he laughed if i rode a bear-
trap like that thing yu got id have cal-
louses on my knee-caps but ill bust a
thirteen hundred pound sacred-cow bawl-
in it for the fields of satan with this slick
rollin pin an yu wont see no fork come
out of her neither
chugwater wallie

ii

  thats why i knew yu was a rider an
a roper said buck have a town boy
cigarette 

  wallie took a smoke lit a match and
leaned from his saddle he cupped his
hands over the light and tilley bent his
head and started his cigarette in that
swift and fleeting action chugwater had
glimpsed the features and poise of the ban-
dit leader and for the rest of the journey
to the rendezvous he had no fears buck
did not suspicion his identity

if chugwater had been loquacious
upon meeting the captain of the gang
he was surely cured of the excess
when he found himself seated among the

member-
ship this was
made up of
twenty of the
hardest counte-
nances and
toughest fig-
ures he h a d
seen in many
a day he met
them all met
them with an
iron grip in his fingers a chill repulsion in
his greeting and a stolidity of demeanor
which carried away all antagonism to him
yet he knew he was on trial

  he drank sparingly often not at all of
the jug which went around the room from
time to time narratives were spun
reminiscences told of old episodes on many
frontiers of the cow-country wallie
seemed an interested a charmed listener

  well how does she lay boys said
buck after an hour or more of casual con-
versation whats yore likin does he
stay an throw in with us or shall we give
him a fresh horse an guide him up in the
black range

  id like to see him lay a loop on some
beefsteak commented the hot tamale
kid im shore stuck on him the way he
sits down

  thats me too added one-eye john
un-huh muttered a third others
nodded then buck summed up

  kid tomorrow well send yu out to
bring us in some meat an well tell yu
just where to get it two of the boys will
go along leadin a coupla packhosses if
yu brings down the cow we wants where
we wants it then i reckon ill send yu into
engle to nose around in the meantime
whats yore name

  they calls me criss cross most places
    te

but thats not the name my mother give me
i reckon yu aint interested in them
things 

  criss cross is good enough if yu kin
do it now lets bed down one of them
boys tamale will do will show yu whert
to flop big foot its yore night on the
dog-watch go out an let snaky come in

  big foot left the room and the band
sought various cabins where they tumbled
into bunks arranged along walls chug-
water was given a bed above the hot ta-
male kid

  just before he went to sleep he leaned
out of his blankets and said to wallie im
shore glad yu didnt hesitate in felipe
god im nigger-skeered of black small
pox ive seen it rage an man thav
aint nothin kin break its strangle-hold on
death once it hits yu an carry say
its worsen musk on a mex woman for
spreadin over a country

  im afeared of it too replied wallie
with a yawn

  but in his mind a thought was revolving
it made him smile then he remembered
the note from lettie which he had hidden
in the band of his stetson he reached
to the peg on which the sombrero hung
and quietly removed it and laid it in a cor-
ner beside his head then he nestled into
the covers and went to sleep

ill

the next day accompanied by two
members of the band he made an
excursion into the hills to the south
and toward noon came upon a stragglin 
herd of fine white faced cattle here after
some maneuvering he roped a yearling
steer threw it and hog tying it cut its
throat quickly the three men cased it out
and dressed it and then cut it up into con-
venient pieces for packing and after load-
ing the pack animals started for camp

  during the process of skinning chug-
water managed to cut the hide in such
manner that he left the unhealed brand
burn on a hind quarter this he read as the
reverse b l and on the way home
while he was following his companions
with one of the packhorses he loosened a
knot in the basket-hitch which the thief had
employed to pack the beef on the horse
and after a few hundred yards the load fell
and dragged along the ground

  hey he shouted which one of yu
fellers done this job better come back
an let me learn yu how to braid one of
these lousy squaw hitches never mind
he added as one of the men started toward


short stories

him i was just a foolin ill yank her
up in a jiffy an be with yu soon

  the men continued on their way
quickly wallie removed the hide con-
taining the brand and jammed it deep in a
saddle-bag then threw a single-diamond on
the meat and hurried ahead they reached
camp toward late afternoon where the re-
mainder of the band stood watching them
approach

  hell do shouted one of those with
chugwater he shore aint a stranger to
that kinda toil an when yu sink a tooth
in this sirloin yull imagine hes a right
good judge of eatin meat

  buck was visibly pleased and after the
animals had been unsaddled and the meat
carried to the kitchen tilley told wallie
he wanted him to take charge of the cows
the band had hidden in the hills

  we got an election on yere soon kid
he said an its us kind of hombres agin
the law an order bunch im workin in
with some of them fellas on the other side
of the rio grande such as worley tuck-
er moorhead ashton billings an others
yu see im edgin yu in right deep spill-
in it all now sos yu kin see where were
at pecos willie wainright who runs the
cow daddie saloon in engle an is sheriff
of this county is takin orders from them
ranchers over there who are tryin to run
some of these other guys like buford an
the association men out of the county
we does the dirty work an is allowed to
get a few cows out of the country for doin
it

  why thats as handy as a pocket in a
shirt expressed chugwater seems like
top an bottom dealin to me where kin
yu lose 

  we come dern near it a while ago
five of us got caught drivin two hundred
calves up sausalito way i just bin outa
jail a short time pecos willie give us a
box of hack saws an we went buford
was the fella what done it brought spe-
cial men from the governors office an
they high-tailed an got us now what

moss with them two an a few cases
of right good rustlin im a-thinkin bu-
ford will quit buckin us an sell if he

  where do i come in 

  im expectin a greaser in from san
marcial any day now and when he comes
hell have the names of three hundred vot-
ers which we wants registered yu takes

maybe ill have yu take over the feedin
end of em i want em able to walk to
the railroad anyhow

  i cn do that maybe yu better have
some wagons bring in a little feed

  what ever yu say

  and the next day wallie saw the cows
they were first class range cattle and in
extraordinary condition all of them had
passed through the operation of brand-
blotting the burns of which were almost
healed he counted in the neighborhood
of three hundred head

  a week went by a week of thrilling
excitement for the young puncher every
evening of which he strolled to a high
knoll above the headquarters and looked
at the bridge over the rio grande no
white signal met his eye at any event his
presence in that end of the county had not
been suspected by luis or worley

  to hasten the healing of the altered
brands he had applied axle grease to the
sores and many of the animals were now
singularly in condition to pass any inspec-
tion the work had been done well the
old method of a wet gunnysack and a me-
dium hot iron had accomplished the alter-
ation and then one day-

  carrying a bucket of the grease into the
single cabin where the and the tamale kid
now slept which was a little apart from
the other houses a curious expression
wreathed wallies face it had seemed to
him as though the repulsive mass of
splotchy-colored lubricant in the bucket
had conveyed to him a startling thought
doggone he mused i shore think it

will work
but maybe
thay wont be
no call here
goes just the
same

 he took a
handful of the
sticky stuff and
moulded it into
the chinking of
the logs in a
dark corner of the room

  if i wants yu there yu is he thought

                                                     to
chugwater wallie

i

then he heard a hurrying of hoofs coming
up the slope and saw a mexican rider dash-
ing into sight from the west

  huh he thought i bets four dollars
im headed toward engle in the mawnin
and sure enough he was the messen-
ger arrived with the list of names to be
registered and chugwater set out early for
the county seat toward noon he began
to see horizon formation which he knew
outlined the ranch of buford in a slowly
converging half circle he wound toward
the boundary of the k seven quarter
circle and as he rode daring and aston-
ishingly singular ideas filled his racing
mind what if he could stop that election
then what would it serve his purpose
wouldnt wainright m or ley and the rest
of the conspirators still be in the same rela-
tive position what would his testimony
be he had received a list of names from
a fugitive of justice he had been a mem-
ber of that band  that wasnt evidence
no those names must be entered
then crashing through him went a plot
and a plan that set his blood tingling and
over and over it revolved in his mind and
stood the test of every assault he made
upon it

  buford had influence at santa fe fine
great

  maybe he could get the governor to ask
the united states department of agri-
culture to send some men down that
was the scheme if he could do just that
get the names on the election books and
get something from pecos willie to prove
that he had delivered them to him person-
ally chugwater went suddenly hot and
cold assurance came upon him with the
same lassitude with which failure would
have smote him a silly sort of smile
twisted his face into a boyish grin he
thought of lettie it was confusion 

  yep he mused i gotta lay out in the
hills long enough to let the sun go down
then slide in an see her an her dad oh
oh chugwater yu knows damn well
yu aint a-thinkin a thing about her old
daddy aint yu the snake-twistinest
sneaky devil what is now aint yu
hayburner cocked an ear at a strange
note in his masters song then forgot about
the rich baritone for in the distance he
had caught the sight of another horse it
was winding slowly in and out of the cool
scrub-timber high up in the hills

  wallie sang on

what will yu be when the round-ups
  done

   

   cowboy

where will yu be when they ring the bell
an what are the tales yu then xvill tell
will yu be a bronc on the range of hell
cowboy oh cowboy

i likes the cut of yore sunburned jaw
    cozvboy

an doff my hat to yore code an law
yure the whitest man i ever saw

an im plumb delighted to share yore paw
    cozvboy oh cowboy

  whatcha see honey he remarked to
his sorrel trying to pierce the plain be-
fore him for the object that had caught the
attention of hayburner then he made it
out a pinto pony winding along the west
slope of the far hills that marked the west-
ern line of the k seven quarter circle

  a recognition went booming through
him

  come on hayburner lay down them
feet an take yore time but if yu takes
too much of the same watch yore step
daddys in no mood for dee-lay yu
knows who that is dont yu  the horse
literally raced over the earth it too had
felt the contagion of that moment then
a marvelous thing happened the pinto
stopped faced into the west and from the
shrapnel like puffs of dust which arose
from the slope of the hills down which it
traveled chugwater knew that the paint-
horse was coming with a sliding and slip-
ping down that abrupt decline he felt a
tightening of his throat muscles dog-
gone that pinto he ejaculated if he
tangles them feet an so much as busts her
nose ill whup him ill whup him-

  but the pinto came on it flashed in
beautiful style away from the steep hill-
side and out across the level greasewood
and mesquite plain

  lady lettie he exclaimed rising stiff-
legged in the stirrups i shore mighta
known that no buford ever lived what
cudnt ride a hoss lord aint that a
sight hayburner id rather see that gal
forkin a hoss than see lord dunravens
yacht race yes or hear old pat gilmores
band shucks chugwater an yu bin
dreamin about her say yu aint in her
class slies princess-bred an yu why
yu-yu belongs to the poverty aristocra-
cy  an yu caint even talk her language-
never learned no grammar at all

  then he saw her and waved his hat in
wide circles about his head they came
together with a rush and she reined in the
spirited pony to a perfect stop at the


short stories

same time her flushed cheeks loosened
hair falling about her face her eyes aflame
and laughing lips sent a sensation to his
heart that thrilled him utterly she reached
from her saddle and caught his hand the
touch of her palm was like a caress

  oh im glad im glad she cried

  me too miss lettie im shore pleased
to see you

  ive-dad and i have worried ourselves
sick over you we made up our minds
last night that one of us would ride to the
river and hang that signal just to watch
and see if you were alive what have you
been doing

  stealin cows an healin brand-burns
now im goin into engle to talk with
pecos willie wainright if yu is want-
in me for the next two days my address
is the cow daddie sayloon

  she literally guffawed as she turned her
horse around then they started off to-
gether occasionally she caught a strange
furtive glance in wallies eyes it was
one of appraisal filled with admiration
and something else she did not know
what it was but it intrigued her greatly and
caused small spasms of joy to lift up from
her throat

  she listened to the narrative of hisad-
ventures and seemed to think his recital
humorous for at frequent intervals she
burst into silvery laughter when he had
told all she gushed into words

  really chugwater i think it is the most
ridiculous story i ever heard the idea
that you were able to get in with those
men the way you planned it by build-
ing that large fire on the ridge so that
they would be sure to find you the steal-
ing of that reverse b l yearling i
think it is great dad will be tickled to hear
that lets hurry

  but miss lettie i reckon yu dont get
me quite yet i aint goin in to yore place
im goin to engle

  absolutely not you have the evi-
dence in that list you know where those
men are and now well get our side to-
gether and end this thing

  not a bit to do what yu wants
means blood an a lot of it why them
boys lay up in them hills an theys got
glasses which makes a lizard ten miles
away look like a alligator theyd see
yu before yu got within five miles of the
river nope miss im playin solo on
this game an im headin back to buck
tilleys gang day after tomorrow

  she became silent she looked away
toward the sun scorched plain out of which

chugwater had ridden then after a while
she said and her voice was tremulously

serious do you
know that youre
notb ing but a
boy a big clean
minded boy with
a lot of cock-
sureness about
you  do you
know that
yaasm im
stuck up

  i didnt mean
that i meant that it is your youth and
your supreme contempt for danger that
makes you think you can play this game
alone why wallie-it was the first
time she had ever employed such a tone
toward him and he caught the infection of
her mood-those men would kill you like
they would a snake if they even suspected
who you were take charge of the posse
if you will get into the fight that must
come but dont go back there single-
handed any more im a ranch girl born
and bred on this land and i know all the
things that make a man do what you are
doing but dont go back please

  she saw him avoid her pleading eyes
she saw his strong face fall into hard grim
lines and then his lips drew in and she
knew that his jaws had set despair
clutched at her heart she realized that
he had reached an unalterable decision
which no word of hers could change at
last he said

  miss lettie im right proud to feel the
interest yure takin in me

  interest she exclaimed why its
more than that its the regard the friend-
ship that sprang up during the days you
were sick dont i know what you suf-
fered and didnt i see how game you
were didnt i see the light in your eye
when you rode away around that grain-
shed  it was desperate thats what it
was desperate gratitude you think i did
something that helped you get well

  yu did maam

  dont you maam me you big blind
- a sob was precious close to her throat
at that instant im a friend of yours
im almost as old as you are and im
lettie to all my friends

  thanks he said i like that lettie
seems like kentucky mountain folks when
yu bufords takes up with a runt like me
it shore does yu never will know girl
how much yu tickled me by puttin that
note in the coffee

                                                     
chugwater wallie



  the anxiety fled from her features

  ill bet you thought it mighty funny
she said

  ill bet i thought it mighty sweet hay-
bumer figured i was a bit teched by the
sun i read the thing eighty-two times
between them pinon hills an the slope this
side of the rio grande looka yere let-
tie he pulled off his hat and exposed
her note under its band

  you foolish thing she flouted throw
that away it might be the very cause of

your death if they found that-

  throw it away say wild horses
cudnt yank that from me no nor all
the yankee cavalry yu kin believe it or
not but this yere paper is the first note i
ever got from a girl in my life

  i suppose you regard that as a love let-
ter 

  no lettie there was something
sober in his words something that lacked
any degree of triviality no i aint no
kind of dog that thinks just cause a lady
is kind an good that he had oughta think
shes in love with him i aint that kind
my daddy wud a lammed hell outa me
if he thought i was thataway when i was
at home i knows my place lettie dont
yu mistake that

  i should say you do she commented
and he fancied there was intolerance in the
reply he looked at her sharply but her
face was an unrevealing mask

  then yu said thay was somethin fun-
ny in the way i looked when i rode away
from yu an the colonel thay wasnt
no sech thing sandy stuarts workin
for yu an i an him had a fight one time
up in colorado i came mighty close to
killin him hes just as crooked as the
canadian river t seen him just as he
seen me that was what made me look
thataway i reckon im right poisonous
appearin when i shore enough gets riled
where is he now 

  why come to think of it i passed him
and some of the other boys mending fence
on the other side of this ridge right
ahead of us do you think chugwater-
that he could be mixed up with bucks
gang 

  well i heard him say once that all
calves belong to all the people an any
mans got a right to go out an stick a iron
on any of em an call em his own he
thinks a cow that feeds offn open range
grass might belong to her owner but her
calf is anybodys what discovers it if he
aint with this other crowd ill bet its be-
cause he aint never knowed about it
to

  then perhaps we had better fly into
these trees those hands were going to
stretch wire to the top of the ridge and he
could easily see us from there youre
determined to go through with your
plans 

  oh yes lettie he laughed as they
broke into a gallop my ways the short
trail to jail for them fellas without lettin
no blood i just gotta hunch itll whittle
em down calm an gentle but yu gotta
hep willya

  you try me

  then meet me yere day after tomor-
row at four in the afternoon right up
by that big dead pine thats a-slantin over
agin that clump of pinon

   ill be there

  an bring twenty-five pounds of cop-
peras i wants it plumb fresh-an pul-
verized

  copperas  are you going to make vit-
riol

  i aint a-goin to say i gotta hunch
an wants yu to be my podner blind

  she closed her eyes the very words
to her heart were like a prayer his pard-
ner blind she heard his voice continu-
ing

  i dont want even yore dad to know
then i wants colonel buford to get out
tonight for santa fe an talk with the gov-
ernor remember this ask him to get
the department of agriculture of the u s
to send two men down to the bridge just
an even ten days from today not one
hour sooner ill be on the spot to meet
them tell them inspectors that i knows
thays diseased cattle in that country an
they ought not be allowed to cross over
that bridge tell them to wait an inspect
all cows as will come across the river
then heres another thing have yore
daddy get the governor to quarantine evry-
thing in an out of san felipe cause of
the black small pox i have a idea thatll
stop some votin up yonder

  wallie

  have yu got it all

  why she cried i see what you are
trying to do i see it isnt this it
you want that copperas because-

  never mind yu is my podner
blind

  once more the shock of his words again
the tightening of the cords of the throat
she paled a little

  didja hear about the man i hit in the
pear he asked

  yes and luis had to take him to el
paso and evidently hes getting better
i

short stories

 for luis isnt back yet father thinks
 that they are afraid to leave him for the

 reason that he
 might talk
 why dont you
 want him
 jailed 

  not yet
ill tend to
them fellas
they shot at
me an the law
aint got nary
thing to do
with that

   there was a chill grimness to the man-
 ner in which he dismissed the idea of ask-
 ing for warrants against his enemies it
 seemed to the girl that the very nature of
 the man had changed in that swift flash
 of vindictiveness it numbed her and
 she said to him very quietly wallie i
 dont like you to say that i dont believe
 it is ever justifiable to take a human life

 	out of revenge

   yaasm

   again she felt a shudder of revulsion at
 the click of that single noncommittal com-
 ment

   i never thought of you as a killer be-
 fore wallie really you have seemed to
 me as a good natured boy who ought to be

 around me all the time but now-

   yu see lettie i an yu is some dif-
 rent i bin on my own since i was ten
 i was just left to rustle my ideas of life as
 i did my hash pretty much as i found em
 no woman ever told me it was wrong to
 smoke or chew or swear thay wasnt
 any women men why they thought it
 was funny to see me per-formin i
 breshed up agin life an found that the
 man or the hoss what does the most defen-
 sive an offensive is after a time let alone
 ive had it hard my first lesson in the
 out of doors was keepin my dads powder
 dry under my coat while my hands grew
 blue an numb outside next i knew what
 fight meant an how to tell when it was
 cornin by lookin in a fellas eye eyes
 dont lie ive learned to read em
 expertly she asked but he did not
 catch the query

   yore dad an his friends through mis-
 ter bufords brother heard about me
 from the front range cattlemens associ-
 ation an the work i did around on the
 poudre they bargained with me they
 knew i was handy with a gun an had a
 tolable amount of nerve to take a chance
 the letter i gave yore dad was this agree-

 ment i was to get a top-hands wages
 an expenses for mysef an hoss if i come
 down an tried to break up this gang an
 five thousand in money if i done it thats
 what the dicker was an it goes as it
 lays they knew thay might be killins
 they hoped it wud be bucks boys but
 they figgered it might be me i lit in this
 country an got plugged before i got set
 somebody squawked i hate to think it
 but i believe it was yore daddys brother
 i know he got drunk in collins an if he
 did well these mexicans down yere aint
 mind readers an thays lots of mex por-
 ters an sugar-hands in fort collins now
 the fella what dropped me settles with me
 thats all when im done with my work
 maybe he wont get killed but if hes a
 fightin fool an loves povder one of us is
 a-headin for kingdom come when we
 yanks the first gun otherwise ill man-
 handle him with my hands

  you make me shudder when you ex-
press yourself like that wallie

  it aint altogether me lettie its fam-
ily after family of mountain bred men back
where i come from where thays a bible
weighing twenty pounds an bound in the
heart of white oak trees brung over from
england an what the good book says is
given to yu at every meal all the time
thays the latest model rifle a-hangin on
the wall i know some of these fellas out
yere think a lie is a abomination in the
eyes of the lord an a ever-present help
in time of trouble but among my folks
a lies a fightin name an a liar is four de-
grees lowern the roustabouts in hell an-
other thing is when a man tries to fight
yu gun knife or go-as-yu-please an
yu lets the white feather wave in the air
shucks yu best just leave the country
pride thats what it is lettie nothin
yu kin sell swap or give away but when
yu got it lord how it eats out yore
heart

  but suppose you knew that the exer-
cise of your pride caused someone else
pain would you still go ahead in a stubborn
way 

  i dunno i never had nobody tell me
anything id do wud hut em except
when some bad-hombre hollered for me to
let loose his eye or something

  im asking you now not to follow up
the fight with luis and his man they
wont fight fair theyll shoot you in the
back like they did before oh wallie
im afraid-

  why lettie what in the world does
yu mean

                                                       it
chugwater wallie

i

  she stopped her horse and it seemed to
chugwater that her lower lip drooped a
bit and sank at the corners and that a curi-
ously rapid blinking of her eyelids held
back tears but before he could formu-
late an opinion she had swung the pinto
around and was pointing with a hand
toward a small hog-back ahead of them

  alongside of that little saddle youll
come across a trail that drops into the road
to engle about four miles from here
good-by till day after tomorrow she
said

  i hope i navent made yu feel bad
he said to her and she turned in the sad-
dle and smiled at him through her tears

  you said something a while ago and i
dont believe a word of it

  what

  eyes she exclaimed and touched her
pony with a spur

  chugwater watched her vanish among
the pine then rode on

  three figures high on the ridge above
him watched wallie gaze a long time after
lettie then canter out of sight

  aint that the fella we seen the night
we was cornin in home from that three
weeks trip of brandin asked one of the
figures

  yep thats him replied another

  he shore sits a saddle dont he sandy 
yu knew him up noth didnt yu

  yes an hes one killin devil also
fast either hand an plumb expert too
when it comes to any kinda fightin id
like to see him get his plumb center

  what sandy stuart saw quickened his
pulses and for the rest of the afternoon he
planned and plotted how he was to get off
from the k seven quarter circle long
enough to pay a visit to the cow daddie
saloon at engle destiny however
dropped his ponys foot in a badger-hole
on the return to the ranch and in the spill
that followed sandy was rendered un-
conscious and did not come-to till late at
night at that time he was in his bunk
and a great throbbing pain compelled him
to roll over and forget all else save his
misery the next morning he was so
stiff he could hardly move

iv

before entering the headquarters
of pecos willie wainright chug-
water surveyed the town laid its
methods of egress and ingress clearly in his
mind located the livery stable the hotel
the principal streets and the railroad then
he walked into a store bought two hand-


 kerchiefs and went to the hotel

   in his room he took a shriveled object

from a parcel wrapped it inside the hand-
kerchiefs and writing a brief note to let-
ties father sealed it and walked to the
post office where he stamped and mailed
it

  in that package he had furnished bu-
ford with the brand which he had cut from
the flank of the reverse b l steer this
enterprise over he strolled across the street
and entered the cow daddie saloon pe-
cos was watching him as he came through
the door

  chugwater sought a secluded part of the
lower bar and signaled with an eye to
wainright the proprietor got up from
his seat and joined him

  whatll it be asked wallie

  raw licker replied pecos

  add that an carry one mo smiled
chugwater at the bartender

  what kinda paper 

  thats what im wonderin what
kinda paper kin yu sign for a raw deal
like that yu aint perzactly altogether a
half-wit chugwater smiled im just
new yu know maybe he thinks id go
to tamperin or somethin but if the pa-
per yu has is what yu was to get maybe
he thought yud say somethin to him in
pencil

  pecos examined the list of names care-
fully noted curiously marked lines at the
bottom of the list and when he looked into
wallies eyes he smiled

  all right kid ill give yu somethin
buck says yure not pewter an ill tie to
his gradin any time whatcha doin to-
night playin calico or green-cloth 
say ive heard about this town an
they tells me its day all day in the day time
an thay aint no night a-tall im pound-
in my ear to quit feelin like i was pound-
in leather right now im gaited like a
man with a plaster-paris laig an a cork
nose if thay was ary place in town where
a fella cud feed i believe id go in an
buy four thousand duros worth o hawg
meat an hen pickles

  lets feed chuckled pecos over at
the broad-daylight restaurant is where
theyve got t-bones as bellow an cove-
oysters as crow

  during the meal chugwater sized up the
man before him and looked him squarely
in the eye at every opportunity that pre-
sented itself when the apple pie was fin-
ished pecos pulled a note book from his
pocket and wrote	

  three hundred received	is some

addition

  he flipped it to wallie who read it and
smiled

  part of its in chinook aint it
them marks is yore name kid i criss
crossed it so the devil hissef cudnt read
it if anything happened to yu

  aint i the turtle-headed boy-wonder
yu know what i took that for

  what

  the double cross

  go on to bed an drop around some-
time in the afternoon itll take us pretty
much till that time to get these names scat-
tered over them sheets an they got to
go to the votin places inside the next three
days

  the next morning pecos reported that
all was well and that the head of the cattle-
men was out of town he had seen bu-
ford take the cannonball for the north
that assured the court-house crowd that
there would be no protest of any kind

  at noon the following day chugwater
rode out of town and at four oclock met
lettie as agreed she removed several
small sacks of copperas from her saddle
bags and wallie stuffed them into his
then he gave her the receipt wainright
had written for him

  when i went to town yesterday she
said i saw you entering your hotel
wallie i had a lump in my throat as big as
a bellflower apple before you leave i
want to have an agreement with you

  if yu asked me to dust the moon id
do it

  no but a day or two before those mex-
icans cross the bridge on their way to
vote ill be up in the hills somewhere east
of the river and ill have a camp outfit with
me i intend to be around you some-
where

  dont yu think of such a fool thing
but it isnt a fool thing im as good
as a man when it comes to roughing it and
i want to be on hand to see that nothing
happens to you and to rush for help if i
think you are discovered

  but yu caint cross the river except
at the bridge an the waters gettin higher
all the time this side will not have a man
from anywhere west unless he gets this
way on that bridge thats my scheme
he smirked openly at her but she
evinced no concern in his attempt to arouse
her curiosity

  remember ill be east of the river
within a mile north of the bridge two days
before the mexicans cross thatll be the
day before the election wont it 

  yies buck figgers on placin them
chugwater wallie



greasers twenty-four hours before they
vote dad got away all right wainright
told me

   yes and he has such faith in you that
hell make the governor do what you want
hes in love with you wallie i think
youve bewitched him he called you my

boy

   chugwaters face was a study of turbu-
lent emotion all he could do was to rub
a palm on his saddle-horn and chuckle
after a spell of strangulation due to rapid
smoking he said lettie girlie please dont
come out thataway but if yu does dont
bring nobody along an keep out of sight
that pinto agin them red chalk cliffs to
the east of our camp wud look like the
court house burnin down

  ill be alone oh wallie i forgot
the most important bit of news sandy
stuart fell with his horse and was laid up
for two days now he wants to be taken
into engle i remembered what you told
me and i have told the foreman to delay
sending him till i got home

  uh-huh he seen i an yu the other

day an yu kin
bet now hes
wantin to see
pecos or luis
if yu have to
break one of his
laigs keep him
out of engle
can yu depend
 the fore-
man

   absolutely
then tell him that thays five hundred
on him for calf stealin up at hayden col-
orado an to keep him solitaire till i gets
back lord itd shore be my luck to have
him make a call on me right over on the
river yu cud use me for a clabber-
strainer two hours after he spilled what he
knows on me

   wallie

   he had headed his horse west

   wallie please dont go all the cattle
in this valley arent worth the risk you
are running

   at the feet of yore grace an go with
god-as the mexican women say

  then hayburner tore madly into the
west

for three or four days after he re-
joined the outlaws chugwater was
given to spells of moodiness the
anxious lines he had seen in the face of
lettie and a strange fluttering suggestion

       

of her meaning to his life would not dis-
appear from his intuitive processes he was
a creature half mad at times with the fan-
tastical workings of some vague hope and
at others a numb staring automaton that
circulated among the cows with a lagging
step and a formidable unconcern

   this state of affairs aroused the fears of
the hot tamale kid he didnt like it
he watched wallie saw a hot flush creep
up along his throat and change suddenly
into a ghastly pallor saw the fine eyes of
his room-mate glow with a rich flaming
fire and fade to a dull listless haze

  many times he muttered half aloud i
dont like it i just shore dont like that
kids actions an if i thought-god an
me a sleepin with him too

   one morning three days before election
chugwater arose an hour earlier and step-
ping to hot tamales bunk shook him and
said im goin to give them cows that
special feed this mornin an yu can take
care of them this afternoon

  the kid grunted and went back to
sleep

  chugwater hooked up a team and piled
the wagon with the mixed chop sent by
pecos under the front sacks were the
bags of pulverized copperas

  an hour later as he was putting the
horses away hot tamale came up behind
him suddenly and stood straddle-legged
immediately behind him

   criss cross he said in such a low and
startling tone that wallie swung around
on the pivot of a single heel

  oh yu kid he said that aint no
way to do

  i wants to know something

  go ahead

  is yu well plumb well

  yes why

  lemme feel yore haid

  he advanced his hand laid it on chug-
waters forehead then jerked it away with
a whip fever he exploded in a loud
toneless voice fever

  no that aint fever thats just yore
warm hand after turnin outa them blan-
kets i aint got nothin wrong with me
that a very little lump of the dinero wont
heal

  the kid walked away perplexed

  that afternoon hot tamale fed the
cows

  and each of them received a small
amount of the copperas which chugwater
had sprinkled in the feed boxes and thor-
oughly mixed in the morning his work
was done in this regard and he had not


short stories

been caught at it two doses had been
given

  when tamale came back he and chug-
water sat in their cabin playing a game of
seven up buck tilley came to the shack
and joined them and during the game
the rustler appeared in high glee he ex-
pressed himself as fully confident that the
care wallie had taken with the stolen stock
would enable him to get five dollars a head
more for them than he would otherwise
have obtained he promised chugwater that
he would have charge of the drive and the
hour for starting the cattle was settled on
as ten oclock in the morning the day be-
fore election when the game broke up
tilley said that on the following morning
he wanted all the cows brought down to a
corral close by the bridge from this po-
sition they could be driven across the river
quickly without any delay and with a min-
imum loss of flesh due to the excitement
always attendant upon a drive

  a hail was heard down the hill and buck
arose hurriedly and left the cabin in a
short time hot tamale picked up a bucket
and went to the spring he was gone for
what seemed to chugwater to be a very
long time and when he returned he glanced
at wallie in a furtive fearful manner

  then he began to roll down his shirt
preparatory to shaving

  chugwater sat down to a table and was
riffling the cards preparatory to a game of
napoleon solitaire when he heard the voice
of the kid rasp behind him and felt some-
thing cold at the base of his skull

  stick up them paws chugwater an
dont monkey with me

  wallies hands went into the air hot
tamale yanked a gun from chugwaters
holster then walked backward to the door
flung it open and yelled come on in hes
tame

  the room filled immediately

  back of buck tilley wallie saw sandy
stuart pecos willie wainright a tall
mexican whom he estimated by the same
shirt he had glimpsed in the pear-patch to
be luis and around these were members
of the gang on whose faces were venomous
expressions of curiosity and loathing buck
fixed his eyes on him and then spoke

  go through him

  two men searched wallies clothes
they found nothing

  maybe its in the hat suggested pecos
and hot tamale picked up wallies stet-
son and pulled out a sweat soiled piece of
paper this he handed to buck who read
it aloud

  well sneered sandy that buford
gal knows now that hes traced an the
next thing well see is her a-headin this
way if it hadnt been for luis yere id
bin there yet that notes from lettie
buford buck

  some of yu boys take some hoss-feed
grub an a bed roll an cross the river an
watch them red bluffs if that gal shows
up bring her yere

he named three men who left the cabin
willie said buck are yu daid shore
this hombre didnt meet nobody in engle 
not a fella he went to his hotel an
stayed there when he come out i was
with him an after the first fifteen min-
utes i had pablo on his tail all the time
he never spilled nothin in engle
chugwater sneered

  yu knows whats a-comin dont yu 
shot tilley

  lead yore ace ive played my hand
replied wallie

  pecos does yu reckon- began tilley
when sandy stuart interrupted

  this magpies a cute fella dont go
wrong that he aint but if he says hes
all set behind him id lay even money hes
jammed i wudnt believe nothin he
volunteered my guess is that we got him
just in time

  thats me too offered the hot ta-
male kid and he told of the strange moods
of chugwater this was taken to mean
that wallie was on the point of escaping
and that the band had detected him at the
right hour looking through the open
door chugwater saw an old mexican wom-
an passing into a cabin opposite luis
saw her at the same moment and shouted
manuela come yere the woman en-
tered the cabin

  this old dame introduced luis is
the sister of the mexican woman who was
a nurse to lettie buford and shes thick
with the girl now tell the captain what
the girl told yu

  when i am on my way to engle a few
days ago i meet senorita buford i ask
her hows the good luck and we talk cliar-
lamos un poco maybe ten minutes then
i say when i go on wheres the good
senor buford and she tell me he is
gone to trinidad for to look at two prize
bulls that is all i know hones

  thats right remarked pecos the
station agent told me he bought a ticket
to trinidad manuela managed during
the next few seconds to hold the eyes of
chugwater an infinitesimal length of time
but in that swift and somehow penetrat-


chugwater wallie



ing stare she conveyed to him a feeling
that she was in sympathy with him her
words to the bandit chief had pleased wal-
lie totally at a nod from luis the old
woman slipped out of the room

  big foot alec at a command from buck
left the cabin and when he returned a pair
of hand-cuffs were snapped on the wrists
of chugwater and he was thrown on the
bed the hot tamale kid was given the
key and left as a guard all the other men
filed out of the cabin

  later tamale locked chugwater in and
went to supper

  when he came back he carried a tin
plate filled with food and a cup of coffee
he laid the food on the table tossed wal-
lie the key to the
manacles and told
him to unlock the
wristlets and eat
while he himself
sat near the door
with a drawn gun
in hand after the
meal wallie locked
the hand-cuffs on his wrists and the kid
examined them to see that they were se-
curely closed he stuck the key in a shirt
pocket

  that night wallie was roped in bed and
the cabin door locked on the outside

  twice during the night he awoke the
hot tamale kid with nightmarish screams
in the morning he said he did not feel like
eating and refused the meal the kid
brought the day passed slowly and no
one approached the cabin hot tamale
spent a great deal of time looking from the
window and alternating this with a word-
less staring at chugwater

  shortly before sundown wagons began
to arrive bringing in great loads of mex-
icans and from the babble of sound out-
side chugwater knew that a meal was be-
ing served in the open presently as the
kid looked from the window he turned to
chugwater and said theyre bringin the
buford gal up the hill i reckon that
plumb tickles yu dont it

  chugwater made no reply but a rising
gulp in his throat almost choked him fear
of a numbing and loathsome nature filled
his mind he knew that unthinkingly he
had been the means of making it impossi-
ble for relief to reach lottie he recalled
her promise to tell no one where she was
going and to bring no one with her now
-god her note had sent them after
her

  come on over to the window fella

   

jibed hot tamale an yu kin get a right
good look at her shes passin now if
she dont land in bucks lap yu kin eat my
liver class all over her

  chugwater rushed from the bed and
pressed his face against the glass of the
window and as he did so lettie saw him
for a fraction of time her eyes widened
stared at him incomprehensibly then she
turned her head in a door directly before
her and staring at the girl stood manuela
the end of an apron was held in the old
womans mouth and a white pallor beneath
the tan of her cheeks gave to her counte-
nance a miserable aspect

  lettie passed out of sight and chug-
water returned to his bunk hot tamales
eyes were windows to a fear-filled mind

  a deep racking groan escaped from
chugwater in the confined interior of
the cabin it sounded like a death agony
he raised his cuffed hands and swept their
backs across his forehead once more the
groan hot tamale couldnt endure the
sound

  whats the matter he asked did
the sight of that gal give yu the belly-
ache 

  i dont know what it is give me a
drink of water

  the kid brought a dipper and gave it to
wallie who drank and fell back on the pil-
low i reckon- he began then ceased
to talk

  what yu reckon

  chugwater did not reply again ta-
male put the query no answer he
came to the bed and stared down on his
prisoner

  fainted he said then walked to the
door opened it and passing outside locked
it as his footsteps died away chugwater
sprang from the bunk and picked up some
matches from the table next he secured
some of the axle-grease from the loosened
chinking and placing this in a piece of
newspaper hid it under his blankets then
he lay down on the bed he was inordi-
nately famished yet when hot tamale
brought him his supper he refused to eat
the night wore on hot tamale was
away from the cabin for two hours when
he returned chugwater was sitting on the
bunk looking disconsolately at the floor
the kid lit the lamp

  better he asked

  yes replied wallie i must have
caved a little

  an that aint all bo tomorrow we
moves out them cows an when theys

the cattle drive began the follow-
ing morning at a little after six and
at nine-thirty pecos and his aids had
them fairly well strung out and headed for
the bridge over the rio grande through
the clouds of dust rolling before the herd
wainright made out a wagon on the east
side of the bridge  he spurred his horse
around the cows and crossed the bridge
on the last steel girders he saw three log
chains had been stretched and locked with
padlocks the river-crossing was effect-
ively closed

  he flipped back his vest and exposed his
badge

  im sheriff of this yere county he an-
nounced who are yu birds  anwhat
is it yn want with them chains where they
is

  a little gray-haired man who had been
seated on the concrete abutment of the
east approach arose and looked into the
eyes of pecos willie

  yu knows im united states marshal
up at gallup dont yu pecos he
drawled his voice full of a resonant men-
ace

  of course i knows yu replied wil-
lie yure cool charlie kibbe evry-
body knows yu but what is it yu want
down here

  these men said kibbe pointing to his
companions have been sent down here to

inspect all cattle coming across this river
theyre animal health-inspectors of the de-
partment of agriculture are those dog-
ies cornin this way 

  they was

  well have to look at them said one
of the health-officers ducking beneath the
chains

  sure replied pecos then he shouted
a command to some of the punchers flank-
ing the herd and within a few moments
seven of the leaders of the band of cattle
had been roped thrown and hog-tied the
government men examined them carefully
for black-leg then pried open a cows
mouth and instantly dropped the head

  whats the answer asked wainright

  i condemn all this herd and order you

men to drive it into the nearest fence at
once not an animal can cross this bridge
what

theres hoof and mouth disease of a
flagrant character running through this
stock and i will have to kill every animal
the mexicans came up in their wagons
at that instant

  pecos turned to the chief inspector and
said take down those chains an let these
boys through theyre goin home to vote
an got to ride forty miles some of them
no animal can cross this bridge to-
day  and whats more no man either until
we can get some fumigating houses erected
on this side of the river i quarantine
all you men and order you to stay within
sight of this place

  a mutter hurried through the ranks of
the outlaws a chattering began among the
mexicans the face of wainright was
that of a man stricken with utter stupefac-
tion  then he roused rode to one of the
band and told him to ride back and tell
buck the bandit tore away toward the
hills

  come on pecos shouted one of the
riders unhooking a carbine lets go
are yu a-goin to let two hoss doctors an
that old coffin-fodder- from gallup run a
sandy on yu like this

  cool kibbe flashed two guns set them
squarely against his hips and shouted at
the cow-boy

                                                       
chugwater wallie



   bring that hand up off that boot quick
an let it come empty too

  the rustler obeyed with a ludicrous
haste kibbe continued to talk

  now let me tell yu birds somethin
this aint new mexico yure tantalizin
its the u s an that means us me an
sixty millions mo an two troops of the
seventh at wingate an all the tel-ee-
graphin an railroadin we wants to feed

yu-sos turn them cows slant-wise an
back em up the river i kin perforate
twelve of yu fellas moren likely before
yu gets me after that somebody else
will get the rest of yu start stringin
em out

  pecos dropped his head on his breast and
the cattle were milled about and prodded
up the back-trail the mexicans held a
parley and headed their wagons for san
marcial more than one of them had
gazed into those gray-green eyes of kibbe
voting was exactly what they didnt want
none of they had their money or some
of it and now they craved traveling
they headed home in an utter rout

  im shore sorry sheriff mocked
kibbe but if yu aint quarantined then
im a liar that never heard of that sorta
thing before

   pecos rose in the stirrups glanced across
the river and saw a great cloud of dust
coming toward the west one look was
enough he fled after the cattle

  an hour after the drag moved the
mexicans started away -from the
j jlcabins and thirty minutes after they
were gone tamale left chugwater as
soon as the kid was fifty feet from the
shack wallie arose pulled out the grease
and standing before a piece of looking-
glass dipped a match in the repulsive stuff
and daubed his face with it

  he built up splotches pimply cone-like
formations a lone mound of black and
brown and faint yellow and when he had
finished to his satisfaction he lay back on
the bed

  in a short time tamale returned

  get up he commanded

   i caint get up

  whatcha mean yu caint get up

   tamale i lied to yu boys

  how

  about san felipe i got drunk in that
town an stayed till i sobered up i slept
next to a fellow the small-pox got while i
was gettin nacheral now-

       

  now what whatcha mean
chugwater moaned edged backward
from the bed and then weakly standing
took several steps which placed his body
between the door and the kid and turned
suddenly and squarely into the light

  hot tamale took one swift look and his
jaw dropped

  then he jerked his gun

  back away from that door or ill sali-
vate yu he cried

  unlock these cuffs for the love of god
an let me get the air i want to die in the
air im suffocatin in yere

  get outa the way the hammer of
the gun slowly rose

  shoot ill get my hands on yu be-
fore i go i just know i kin last that
long yure too close yu cant beat me
outa one grab anyhow an ones shore a
plenty an when i does this face goes
right agin yore mug do i get the key
to them cuffs

  god yes shrieked the kid and reach-
ing into a chaps pocket brought out the
manacle key and flung it on the floor
wallie jumped behind the wall away from
the window and tamale unlocked the door
and fled in his haste to get away from
the scene and while he attempted to shove
a padlock through a hasp-staple the lock
flew out of his hand instead of search-
ing for it he inserted an iron pin hanging
on a piece of wire beside the door casing
and ran for the main-buildings

  buck was standing beside a door and
saw the kid rushing toward him

  whats up he yelled

small-pox he screamed small-
pox  chugwater is broke out all over an
i been sleepin in there he lied about
felipe got drunk an sobered up there
i wish yu cud see his face

  he was nearly alongside of tilley when
the rustlers gun jumped out of its leather
and covered him

  back up sang out buck back up
an take any hoss yu want an high-tail
away from yere yure done plumb done
with any of us git

  tamale stopped stared and started on
the dead run for a corral where he mount-
ed his horse and tore away through the
timber at that moment buck heard the
rider pecos sent in an instant the chief
and his aid had entered one of the cabins
and the horseman was telling his leader
what kibbe and the inspectors had done

  across from chugwaters cabin old
manuela stood looking out of a window
she had heard the loud words between


short stories

wallie and the kid and comprehended ex-
actly what she was doing when she flung
open her door rushed into an adjoining
cabin and took down a carbine and car-
tridge belt which belonged to luis and
then turned and hurried to chugwaters
cabin where she slipped the pin and called
on him to come out

  as he sprang from the building she
pressed the gun into his hands and gave
him the belt

  where is the senorita he asked

  there she replied in that small cab-
in at the b i g
pinon go i
have the key
the old feet
reached l e t-
ties shack im-
mediately b e-
hind chugwa-
ter and in an
instant the man
and woman
had entered
and closed the door

  quick yelled wallie come on lets
be gettin lettie

  manuela at the window screeched back
into the room too late senor here they
come

  chugwater pumped the lever to the gun
half way saw that a shell was in the bar-
rel tried to stuff a cartridge in the maga-
zine and found it already full then peer-
ing out of the window saw buck one-
eye john big foot alec abilene al and
the man wainright had sent to tilley
standing with their backs to him staring at
the open door of the cabin he had just left

  he saw they were non-plussed and
with a bound he reached the door of the
cabin and flinging it wide shouted paws
in the air yu coyotes the man that is
last in gettin up his hooks drops first

  five pairs of hands flew above heads

  yu buck fling that iron on the
ground then back to the sky with that mit

  bucks gun was tossed to the earth

  now one-eye follow suit if yu re-
nig any o yu boys itll be just once too
often for yu thats all

  another gun was thrown aside

  the remaining men were similarly
treated

  now get in that shack pronto an slam
the door

  shoot damn yu shoot yelled buck
id rather have it thataway than to go in
there

  he reached for his discarded weapon

but at the crack of wallies rifle he fell in
a side whirl and grasped at his right hand
which was now a mass of reddened flesh
the other bandits jumped into the cabin
get in there tilley sang out chug-
water looka yere

  the rustler raised his face and saw
wallie wipe a hand across his countenance
the pimply visage was transformed into a
ghastly smear out of which issued the il-
luminating grin of chugwater

  i dont go in for fancy face lotions
he shouted this yere recipe of mine calls
for i x l axle grease

  by god groaned tilley and getting
to his feet jumped into the cabin

  close the door

  the door slammed instantly

  wallie rushed to the cabin pulled the
hasp into place and finding the lock
snapped it through the staple this done he
gathered up all the sixshooters and carried
them back to the cabin where manuela and
lettie stood waiting for and watching him
wash it off dear

  what chugwaters knees suddenly
shook the armful of guns clattered to
the floor

  wash off that horrible stuff wallie
oh he said and stepped to a basin
and washed his face and wiped it on a
brown towel

  letties eyes were aflame as she saw
chugwater looking at her and when he
stepped toward her they closed and she
swayed suddenly as though she were about

to faint then-

  from far down the slope there came the
intermittent bellowing of bulls the bawls
of mother-cows seeking their calves the
ow ooo ooee of the herding punch-
ers the herd was returning

  he forgot lettie forgot manuela stand-
ing there with a rosary in her hands her
lips moving and her eyes closed fear
gripped him

  he brushed the women aside and leaped
through the door and as he reached the
outside he heard lettie exclaim manuela
isnt he stupid  did you see how he treat-
ed me

  ill be back he yelled reaching the
carbine leaning against the wall and when
i does yu better not try that once mo
he was gone

  down to the corral he sped whistled
for hayburner and as the horse came to
him he found his saddle and quickly
mounted and rode away at the crest of
the hill which permitted him to see the
road all the way to the river-crossing a

                                                    
chugwater wallie



sight greeted his eyes which made him
grow chill there right there on the salt
flats was the entire herd and it was on the
run and behind it men many men

   and not a mile away was a clot of dust
 rapidly rolling along and coming pell mell
 after the cows he watched it entranced
 soon he saw a solitary horseman break
 away from the drag and dash ahead at
 breakneck speed then another rustler
 darted from the bunch but he took an
 angling course to the west and headed for
 the trail which led to san marcial and the
 railroad rapidly the men driving the
 cows left them and in a few seconds they
 were strung out like steeple-chasers along
 an extent a mile wide their pursuers
 gained a puff of smoke flew out of the
 mist of dust a faint flick of sound reached
 wallies ears

   buffalo gun he commented mentally

  the lone horseman was approaching
him rapidly

   it was pecos willie wainright

   wallie led hayburner behind a clump of
 juniper and secreting himself along the
 trail waited for the sheriff when pecos
 came through the trees wallie stepped out
 and threw down his gun on him wain-
 right collapsed and fell from the saddle
 willie disarmed him took handcuffs from
 his saddle-bags and manacled his arms
 around a tree

   then he looked down the slope

   a part of the horsemen he estimated it
 at thirty was in pursuit of the rustlers
 who had fled across the wide swale the
 remainder was coming up the road toward
 him and in the lead was the lean long form
 of buford

   when the men reached him he halted
them and exhibited pecos

   lettie where is she  asked buford

   shes safe sir replied chugwater
how come yu to be so plumb prompt

   last night we found the body of a fore-
 man of one of the ranches east of engle
 who had been missing since two days be-
 fore you arrived in this country he had
 been buried between my place and that of
 worley in his body we
 found a copper jacketed old
 style remington slug of the
 british make that told us
 something there worley is
 the only man in this county
 who carries a remington six-
 gun we gathered a posse
 and called on him he was
 out but the greaser who shot
 you in the pear was there and we put it
 

up to him square it was either come
clean to us or decorate a pepper tree he
told us that he was present when worley
shot the foreman because this man had
caught them red handed cutting the brand
out of one of my calves before the man
died he got one bullet into worleys leg
i had been told by my foreman that he
thought lettie had gone to the river at
daybreak we were getting close to the rio
grande and had found her trail we
saved our horses and jogged in slow till
we saw the dust around the bridge then
we came ahead on the run

  how about worley didja get him
no but we sent some men to engle
with that mex and we knew that worley
was in town the two of them ought to
have left for tucumcari on the early morn-
ing express

  chugwater released pecos and forced
him to lead the way into the retreat of the
rustlers

  arrived before the cabin where he had
been a prisoner he jammed his gun-barrel
under the hasp and with a quick pry tore
the steel band with its screws from the
door

  come out he said

  tilley and his companions issued from
the building

  buford and the men with him literally
tossed back their heads and cheered

  lettie rushed up and as her father dis-
mounted she threw her arms about his
neck and gave way to tears

iater in the afternoon the posse re-
turned with fourteen prisoners
vsome of the rustlers had shown bat-
tle and were killed at close quarters herd-
ing the outlaws into several buildings and
placing guards at the door buford and
chugwater were about to join lettie and
manuela when wallie saw cool kibbe and
an inspector ride out of the trees

  some of yu hombres come down an
drive them damn cows shouted the mar-
shal i quit punching twenty year ago
let em alone charlie greeted chug-
water i reckon yu is owin me a right
good snort

back to their own feed-grounds


short stories

  ill have to kill every one interrupted
the inspector they have hoof and mouth
disease among them

  in chugwaters eyes a dancing light
grew and his lips wreathed in a silly grin
cool kibbe who had been staring at him
suddenly wheeled on the united states
man and yelled wait a minute ill make
him chatter

  he whipped out a gun and stuck it into
wallies side

  talk he said talk yu aint got
that grin on yore map just to be laughin
spurt out the history

  them cows aint diseased

  but i saw the raw blotches and the
purple and pink areas in their mouths
there was every indication sputtered the
inspector

  yaas sir replied chugwater yu
see i give them cows or some of em three
doses of that air stuff called copperas
mixed with the feed then when they
belches up their cud why yu see sir that
air old green vitriol went sure-enough-for-
hell to work on the mouth lining it was
a plumb good scheme i figgered to stop
them mexican votes from gettin across the
river i wasnt aimin on bein able to do
what colonel buford done went an did

i	thought theyd be a lotta killin that-
away

  well by god wailed kibbe now
aint yu played hell on the old u s
yu oughta be ashamed o yosef

when the moon came up that night
lettie and chugwater walked out
among the trees and he pointed to
the roaring rio grande flowing full-
banked below them like some luminous
monster highlighted and wriggling through
the hills

  shore is pretty he said

  the girl made no reply

  how come manuela to be with these
crooks he asked out of sheer shyness and
for the want of something to say

  luis perez compelled her to follow him
for he was afraid of her when she was out
of his sight and he had reason to be
it was luis who killed the son of her sis-
ter who was my old nurse wouldnt you
like to know how old that boy was the
color of his hair and where manuela
was christened and how long she has
been an old maid and what father said
when he got that bloody piece of hide
and what i have done with the criss cross
joke willie wainright wrote and if the

law and order citizens will elect their tick-
et tomorrow oh-

  she struggled half-way to her feet when
wallie laid a hand on her arm and forced
her back at his side

  when i heard them cows a-bawlin
yu said something as i hot-footed from the
cabin if i aint got the lyinest ears of
any white man out of kentuck then i
dares yu to repeat them words ill show
yu i shore will show yu

  look into these two eyes

  she upturned her face and expanded
her eyelids

  you told me once that eyes never lied
now do they

  let me see he murmured and lit a
match as its light flared up a new uni-
verse was revealed to him

  he flung away the match and folded her
into his arms

  how long they sat in that delightful
madness they never knew but the moon
traveled on and on till it dropped the tree
shadows in long and purplish images upon
the ground at their feet

  buford missing his child came in search
for her and as he stepped gingerly over
the earth he saw how greatly she was occu-
pied he stopped suddenly as he heard
wallie say no maam lady lettie

his arms

  oh dad she cried out of an exuber-
ance of emotion say something daddie
cant you see how happy i am 

  my boy spoke the old man with a
trace of a gulp in his voice as he reached
out a hand

  out of the pinon there came the wail of
a dwarf-owl

  who it moaned who

  me yu feather-whiskered wise old
son-of-a-gun laughed chugwater and
grasped bufords hand in the powerful
grip of his fingers


the cricket

by holman day
author of barrateers a case at castonia ctc

he was a woodsman was the cricket and looked on life as a joyous

adventure but one thing he forgot-the tenacity of a man

     with a bulldog grip on a grudge yet even that grudge was
     to die away in the shadow of the forests and the great trees
     were to look down on a miracle in the working out of destiny

i

ut of the black forest of
riviere du loup leaped young
chariot belleau

  he emerged from the sha-
dows into the broad valley of
the chaudiere whose waters fretted by
boulders and boiling in pools at the foot of
cataracts had suggested the rivers name
to the pioneers

  and like the waters did the blood of
chariots yearning body boil he sought
adventure opportunity life gaiety he
had rebelled all of a sudden he had
broken away from duty self-imposed in
order not to think backward he merely
looked ahead for the moment assuring
himself that he was doing the right and
proper thing after all

   out in the sunshine of the chaudiere he
permitted the glory of new prospects to
flood out of him the shadows of repentance
and why should he harbor repentance
had he not slaved for others until he had
almost lost the right to his nickname the
cricket who could feel like leaping and
dancing and singing after the long days
with the ax  and the big trees were laced
overhead to keep out the sunshine and the
great trunks seemed everlastingly march-
ing and countermarching like grim soldiers
intent on barring his escape to the world
outside chariots fancies made them
such he was imaginative volatile sub-
to	

 ject to prankish whims his thoughts
 were leaping in lively fashion just like
 crickets

   and now he had rushed out past the
 threats of the barrier of the solemn trees
 he laughed when he waved them a taunt-
 ing adieu

   he looked up smilingly at the sun and
 then gazed thankfully across the rolling
 meadows of the broad valley he eased
 his knapsack upon his shoulders and from
 a velvet sack side-slung pulled his violin
 its music was the jolly chirp of le cri-
 quet

   his collie ran frenziedly around him
 rolled over and over arose and scampered
 some more transported with delight at
 this his first experience in the open fields

   chariot responded to his comrades show
 of exultation with his violin against his
 breast he danced down the long slope of
 the lea and sang his liveliest chanson

   so he came to the broad ribbon of the
 highway the kings road the interna-
 tional thoroughfare which extends from
 the border all the way down the lauren-
 tian slope to point levis opposite que-
 bec he was absorbed in his joy he did
 not note that automobiles were halting in
 the highway that their occupants were sur-
 veying him with interest

   he danced down to the side of the road
 singing and was startled when he beheld
 the strangers-overwhelmed with confu-
 sion when they clapped their hands


short stories

more they called men and women
more music

  he shook his head and swapped apolo-
getic glances with joie the collie for
whom jollity now seemed a misnomer
the dog cowered frankly afraid of the
strange vehicles

  come here son called a man beck-
oning when chariot stepped meekly to
the side of the car the man stuffed a bank-
note into the youths hand now go to
it

  i play for the fun msieu only for
fun stammered chariot brokenly

  dont do anything in this world for fun
only when you can get cash for doing it
warned the man make that your
motto

  and as chariot had come from the big
black woods to seek fortune as well as to
see the world he paid deference to this
advice from the wise man of the outside
who could afford to ride in such a won-
derful machine and could carelessly give a
crisp bill to a stroller who took his fancy
chariot let it be understood was not seek-
ing money for himself by this adventuring
into what lay beyond the woods he hoped
to find money-yes but it was so that he
might salve with it the situation he had left
behind him in the woods

  he tucked the money in his sash and
swept a deep salute arms extended violin
and fiddle-bow in his dipping hands

  look how graceful-and the way hes
dressed chattered a woman its like
something on the stage or in a picture

  chariots heart jumped and there was a
flush under his tan how silly it had been
to wait so long before testing the world
outside sunshine and green fields
money from a man and compliments from
a woman almost before his eyes were wont-
ed to the sun-glare surely he had been
wise to fare forth now he could do
much in the right and better way for the
folks he had left behind him it had been
wisdom not desertion of duty he could
make them glad back there in the woods
thankful because chariot knew the best
way and was not merely the thoughtless
cricket they had twitted him with being

  so the joy of life flared in him again
the fires had been fluttering and dying
back there in the dim woods

  he played for the strangers his best
tunes and sang to the music and danced
on the meadow sward beside the great
highway and other cars halted and the
folks tossed money which he did not hurry
to pick up his dog sniffed at it and

frisked around the leaping master and
barked joyously as if he knew that for-
tune was at last on its way

  then the motors hummed and the merry
folks rolled on

  it is all very good and wonderful this
world outside joie bon ami laughed
chariot putting the money away so
soon the fine things have begun to happen
for us and now let us skip along on our
tiptoes to see what we shall see it will be
gay eh my jollity

ii

keeping discreetly to the extreme
side of the road josue laliberte
trotted his little white nag taking
to the fair at st chrysostome in bis two-
wheeled cart the wooden toys which he had
whittled he too dwelt in the big woods
of riviere du loup

  he scowled and muttered when he be-
held chariot and joie on the highway
ahead of him

  he spoke out when he pulled his horse
to a walk overtaking the young man so
at last you have run away from your duty
eh i do not ask you to ride with me i
will not help you in the bad thing you are
doing

  chariot flung the sunshine of his gay
smile into the scowl on the old mans wrink-
led face he danced along beside the
slow-moving cart but anyway i would
not cramp my legs in your foolish little
wagon josue see they are too lively
he leaped high and kicked above his head
and whirled about

  bah le criquet sotto growled jo-
sue

  yes the foolish cricket who has stayed
too long in the dark woods

  how can you dance and grin friponf
yes you are a rogue you leave your
honest brother to fight alone so weak and
sick he is and always will be so unless the
good saints give him back his health he
and his wife and the seven children-how
will they find food now have you no
shame 

  yes confessed chariot sobering
its a cloud that keeps whisking across the
good gay sun up there i keep pushing
the cloud away

  then he brightened his quick emotions
always tumbling over each other brisk
hope ever wrestling with sombre thought
he pulled money from his pocket bills
and coins see josue so soon all this
and therell be much more
the cricket



  not honestly do yon get that money so
soon protested the old man though his
keen eyes gleamed avariciously one
must work with patience to get honest

money

  like you whittle all day and half the
night on your toys
some silly bauble
to sell to a child
not for me
taunted chariot
in just a few min-
utes i earn all this
only by dancing
and singing and now i go to earn some
more

  it is not honest money got that way by
your prancing legs and not with your
hands insisted josue it will bring
much trouble-that money now you
chirp very high msicn lc criquet you
will mourn very low a bit later

  pooh for your cawing old crow i do
you stay at st chrysostome all the days of
the fair

  yes admitted josue i must sell my
toys

  ill have money and many tilings to
send back to my brother elie by you and
ill pay you for taking the things-if youre
not afraid and think the black magic is on
my money said the young man vaunting-
ly and widi sarcasm you will see me at
the fair yes you will hear much of me
they all will like my dancing and my mu-
sic and maybe he added in his boast-
ful confidence in the future ill buy the
toys you have not sold and i will toss them
to the children-like this he pirouetted
and flung his hands gracefully

  josue grunted his disgust and whipped
his horse into a trot

  he is like all the others who stay too
long in the woods declared chariot to
jolhty grinning widely into the attentive
visage of the dog whose extended jaws
seemed to give a smile in response he al-
lowed the collie to sniff at the money un-
closing his palm it will bring trouble to
me eh old fool josue only because
it was not earned with the ax only be-
cause i did not stay in the woods and earn
it for elie and flore and the children i
will earn more for them out here they
shall see come along joie we go to
find money and have much fun

  old josue turned to look as he went out
of sight over a dip in the broad road

  le criquet leaped high and waved his
arms intent on teasing die gloomy ancient
who had reproached him

c harlot sauntered at last into the
village of st chrysostome he ad-
mired the great arch which spanned
the highway it was wreathed with bunt-
ing and in letters made of the evergreen of
shrubs was spelled bienvenue

  thank you he said flinging a salute
to the word your welcome makes me
feel much at home

  it was all so festal everywhere there
were rows of booths and tents he loved
music it sounded all about it was a
rude melody almost cacophony but his
woodsmans soul was thrilled by the emo-
tions that such prodigality of melodies
aroused a hoarse mechanical organ
squalled in the midst of the flying horses of
the carousel inside tents the flutes
squealed and tom-toms were beaten his
blood responded to the primitive appeal of
this exciting sound he did not know
what was the matter with him this was
surely a new and wonderful and stirring
world after the silence of the big woods

  the dog was apprehensive and carried
his tail low and glanced about with evi-
dences of much concern

  but chariot was exalted-felt very bold
-became eager for derring-do and real ad-
venture there was so much in the world
-he became thirsty in his craving for all
-he desired to drink deeply of this new
experience he went where there was as-
sembled the largest crowd-to a platform
in front of a striped tent several girls
were standing on the platform and a loud-
voiced man was extolling them coarsely

  chariot blushed when he saw their short
skirts he was a true man of the woods
and his gallic chivalry respected all wom-
ankind he frowned as the man talked
on

  then he was shocked almost horrified
he recognized one of the girls she was
elisiane fortier she had been his neigh-
bor in the woods her folks were honest
people

  chariot had felt no regret when she had
gone into the world he was glad be-
cause she had courage enough to venture
she had merely put into action what he
had long wanted to do

  he felt no thrill of joy when he beheld
her here he was conscious only of grief
there never had been anything except
careless friendship between him and eli-
siane there never could be anything else
he was sure but she was from the woods
-his own home place he resented the


short stories

leering glances of the crowding men she
had daubed paint upon her face he was
sorry to see that what a shame for the
fortiers old gabbling josue would carry
gossip of this be sure of that

  chariots emotions were keyed high that
day he took no heed in his concern for
her of place or occasion elisiane he
called run and hide yourself or your folks
will be shamed tattling josue laliberte
is here

  the crowd howled laughter the bar-
ker cursed the girl hopped in sudden
panic then she got control of herself and
simpered at chariot and shrugged her
shoulders

  i am sorry for you he persisted it
will be a bad story to go back to your good
folks

  she made up a face at him go and
squeak somewhere else le criquet

  the throng took up the nickname and
made much of it in ridicule and sarcasm

  the girl joined with them and come
up here msieu cricket and do your danc-
es  oh gentlemen he is very lively with
his feet all his wits are in his toes-so
tis said about him in the place from which
he comes

  men seized upon chariot and kicked
away the growling snapping dog who tried
to defend his master they heaved their
captive high and tossed him upon the plat-
form some of them commanded him to
dance others called to the girls to kiss him
and cure him of his foolishness

  to chariots horror they obeyed and
smeared their carmined lips on his cheeks
the onlookers guffawed when he fought
the girls to keep his lips from theirs then
the barker interfered and pushed chariot
off the platform he fell upon a burly
man and bore him to the ground in his fall

  the man rose first and dragged up the
cricket and cuffed him soundly

  chariot pulled himself away and made
sure first of all that his precious violin
was not harmed

  i have a mind to crack that fiddle over
your head snarled the burly man to
pay for half cracking my ribs you blun-
dering fool

  i couldnt help it-i was thrown on
you stammered chariot

  a man was anxiously and cautiously
feeling the big individual over asking
questions the subject of the investiga-
tion kept growling oaths working up more
fury

  you came near making it a very bad
job on a man who needs all his bones safe

and his muscle good confided a bystander
to chariot thats the great champion
tom moriarty who has promised to meet
all comers at the fights of the fair

  the pugilist winced and cursed under
the prodding fingers of his manager and
did you hear the shrimp butting in and try-
ing to get my girl off the hooks-telling her
the folks would be ashamed of her

  he gave chariot a vicious stare the
young fellow did not flinch his cheeks
were smarting cruelly his pride was
stinging him too he was getting back
some of his courage and poise recovering
from the confusion of his involuntary ap-
pearance before the public and his treat-
ment on the platform the onslaught by the
girls had upset him more than had the cuf-
fing by the pugilist

  how do you dare to speak to my girl
demanded moriarty insulting her
you do her the insult allowing her
to be gaped at by all these men retorted
chariot stoutly

  lookit roared the fighter the dam
grasshopper-or whatever it is they call
him-dares to talk back to me he
broke away from his manager and lurched
toward the young man i guess you dont
know who i am

  this gentleman has just told me said
chariot lifting his chin and meeting the
glaring eyes he
broke in on the
others ferocious
oaths if i hurt
you i ask pardon
it was not my
fault though but
for warning elisi-
ane fortier i ask
no pardon
msieu

  and thats the
main point and its for that you are going
to ask pardon retorted moriarty sneering
the last word

  dont hurt him tom pleaded the girl
suddenly serious

  now jealousy was added to the flame in
the brute this fellow for whom she
asked mercy was from her home eh  her
lover in the woods was he  probably

  moriarty doubled his fists then he
grinned evilly cast side-glances at the by-
standers and unclosed his hands he lift-
ed his broad open palms oh i wont
risk cracking a knuckle on you little
cricket im saving my fists for my real
business but come here and take your
spanking

                                                      
the cricket

i

  this jovial tolerance caught the crowd
they had begun to mutter their protests at
a threatened fight between antagonists so
illy matched there was much hilarity
take your spanking cricket was the
chorus

  a strange pallor settled on chariots
tense features

  he had acted for the girl only in the
spirit of friendship and natural chivalry
now they were making a jest of it all
his woodsmans pride was hurt in the
woods a real man did not take a beating
without doing his best for himself in the
affair

  and now the uplift of new world-adven-
ture was in his blood here and there the
tom-toms were beating it was old stuff to
moriarty-it was strange incitement for
chariot look here msieu two-fists
you are making the fight i do not want to
fight

  youll get down on your knees and beg
me for pardon about the girl then youll
also beg her pardon for your saying she
has done anything to be ashamed of

  no msieu i have said my say as to
that

  then youre due for the licking of your
life

  chariot paid no heed to warnings and
urgings by the bystanders

  when moriarty lunged at him the young
man slipped off his knapsack upon which
joie promptly flung himself as guardian

  chariot dodged around and entrusted an
onlooker with the violin moriarty was
reaching for his victim with eager clutch-
ing hands chariot eluded the pursuer
and jumped backward doubled forward
the pugilist rushed at him disdaining to
maintain any defense of his person

  chariot was shod with pacs a sort of
moccasin of heavy rawhide without hard
soles

  he leaped high in air half turning and
struck moriarty full in the temple with the
right foot the prize-fighter grunted fell
on his face and rooted his nose in the soil
partially stunned he lay there for a mo-
ment when he struggled to his knees he
bellowed what kind of fighting do you
call that you damnation barnyard roos-
ter

  you have your way to fight-i have
mine replied chariot

  the pugilists manager rushed forward
and helped moriarty to his feet call it
off tom dont risk getting hurt what
in the devil does this quedaw know about
ring rules  his tribe fights with their

feet they have a name for it

  yes msieu volunteered a man in the
crowd its the coup de pied

  i dont care what you call it raved
moriarty feeling his reputation at stake
who would pay money at the gate of the
arena tent in st chrsostome to see a man
who had been worsted out there in public
by one who had been laughed at as the
cricket he shouldered the manager
away i can lick any man any way i
dont care if hes got more legs than a cen-
tipede

  you aint going to make a fool of your-
self for nothing clamored the manager
sticking to his professional ethics be-
sides running a risk of getting out of con-
dition 

  chariot had not lost his pallor he was
breathing quickly msieu i ask you to
call it square between us now

  damn you i havent started yet
bawled moriarty lashing up his rage he
flung his manager away with such force
that the man went rolling under the feet of
the crowd again he rushed at chariot

  this time the pugilist was more wary
when chariot leaped moriarty was ready
to grab the right leg but chariot merely
feinted with that foot seeing ahead the
intent of the adversary he kicked with his
left foot squarely in the face of moriarty
and sent him reeling backward the man-
ager was in the way on his hands and
knees moriarty was tripped and fell
heavily on his back

  in a flash chariot now flaming with an-
ger fairly beside himself in the surging of
his quick emotions leaped on the prostrate
figure and began to pummel moriarty with
fists which toil with the ax had hardened

  the manager full of alarm for his chief
asset leaped to his feet and kicked chariot
the crowd howled protest at this combina-
tion of two men against one men rushed
on the manager and hustled him to one
side out of the press as he was dragged
away he yelled over and over come
along tom dont waste yourself like
a fool

  moriarty getting back wind and wits
easily heaved chariot away only the young
mans agility saving himself from a blow
which would have cracked his skull

  the pugilist after having been rolled
twice in the dirt was not much less than a
maniac when he was again on his feet

  now i warn you msieu cried char-
iot his shrill tones quavering i want no
more fighting

  you bet you dont growled the chain-


short stories

pion settling into the grim ruthless sav-
agery of a bulldog

  if you keep on ill stop at nothing
shrieked chariot

  mister hes become one o them crazy
frenchmen-and you must have heard
about em warned a man in the crowd
youll show good sense if you quit

  what kind of a dam nightmare is this
anyway snarled the prize-fighter some-
body telling tom moriarty to quit after
ive been kicked down twice

  then once more the girl pleaded this
time with the pugilist tom dear listen
to me dont get hurt

  this advice served as the bellows
draught to make the brutes fury white hot

  he had been striving to swagger in front
of the girl to increase her pride in his
prowess her plaintive interference in-
dicating that she was afraid for him in this
contest with one whom she had been laugh-
ing at as the cricket served as a madden-
ing goad roaring like a bull he rushed
at chariot

  the nimbler adversary ducked under the
swinging arms and before moriarty could
halt his rush and whirl to defend himself
chariot leaped high and from behind drove
both heels against the thick neck

  the plug-ugly had become unpopular
there was no questioning the fact the
managers act had started the resentment
the fighters coarse oaths and his vengeful
persistence in pursuing this little chap who
had been dragged into conflict fanned the
resentment into anger no arms were
reached to save moriarty from a fall when
he staggered forward he tumbled on his
face

  pouncing like a wildcat no longer think-
ing but acting on the instinct of the forest
creatures among which he had dwelt all his
life chariot relentlessly made himself safe
from further attack he came down with
all his weight on moriartys arm extended
on the uneven earth and the bone of the
upper arm cracked with a muffled porten-
tous sound blended with the hog-squeal
of the victim were the oaths of the man-
ager held on the sidelines the girl
leaped down from the platform and ran
and kneeled beside the squirming pugilist

  chariot turned from them his mien
was ominous he had allowed himself to
go to the extent of his fury even after his
victory he was controlling himself with dif-
ficulty they who looked on him marked
his dangerous qualities they muttered
among themselves

  if any msieu now has anything to say

to me let him speak it out

  they shook their heads

  when he retrieved his violin the man
who had held it patted chariots shoulder
he asked for what he got son i guess
theyll lay offm that nickname of yours
from now on

  joie wagged an applauding tail and sur-
rendered the knapsack to the master the
two walked away

  behind them mori-
arty bellowed his
anathema was hide-
ous he rang changes
on his vicious de-
termination to get the
damnation canuck
good and plenty if he never did anything
else in his life

  and it looks like hed have plenty of
one thing-and thats time away from his
regular job to attend to private matters
grumbled a man who followed chariot out
of the crowd what the blazes im going
to do now in the way of a show i dont
know damme if i do

  then his forehead cleared of wrinkles of
puzzled despair and he hurried and over-
took chariot and clapped a hand on
the strollers shoulder the young man
whirled posturing against threatened at-
tack

  youre a smart one all right stated
the man with a grin i can show you how
to earn a good lot of money youre after
cash of course we all are

  yes msieu i want to earn money
my name is connick thats my big
tent over there its where tom moriarty
was going to meet all comers but you
have spoiled my show an idea has just
come to me you are much talked about
right now theyll all want to see the man
who has licked the champion i reckon i
can dig up some other lads who are good at
this foot fighting ill give out word that
youll meet em all what say

  chariot shook his head no msieu
i fight to save myself from harm ill not
fight for a show and for pay

  but ill give you a hundred good dol-
lars right now in your fist later ill hand
you a slice of the receipts

  chariot walked on no msieu id
be ashamed to fight for money

  then what else can you do queried
connick following you have become a
good attraction all at once youll draw
a crowd but youve got to do some-
thing

  i can sing the chansons-all the cana-

                                                          
the cricket



dian boat songs i can play on this he
patted his violin i can dance very fine

  oh yes i heard that girl say some-
thing about it he made up a wry face
its a devil of a shift from a good fight
but i can make up a fighting bill out of the
second-raters who were going against the
champ and you can do your stuff youll
be worth a hundred to me even if you do
nothing but your fiddle tunes and your hop-
and-skip youll pull in the crowd to see
you all right heres fifty-the rest
later

  chariot trembled with delight when he
took the money more money than ever he
had seen all at once before he promised
to be in the tent that evening

  then he sauntered on while he talked to
joie so quick have all the wonderful
things happened bon ami why did we
hide in the woods so long

  in his joy he gave small thought to the
analysis of his situation fortune was
flooding in on him that was enough

  he would have been puzzled if some-
body had pointed out that he had taken on
the trials and perils of life in the outside
world along with the premiums in the
few hours since he had leaped into the sun-
shine from the shadows of the woods of
riviere du loup he had become involved
in the coil which makes a drama of exist-
ence he had made his fortune so it
seemed to chariot he had won fame in a
world which had never heard of him till
then only a moment ago the man in the
fine clothes had said everybody wanted to
see chariot belleau but the drama of life
cannot be rounded out without an enemy
however le criquet was giving little
thought to the enemy had there not been
a wonderful victory  that ended it

  but the enemy while the surgeon at-
tended to the hurt gave all his thought to
chariot

  it was not malevolence which merely
flamed high and furiously promising to
burn out soon the fuel was too plentiful
moriarty piecing his maledictions with a
few nouns and verbs itemized his reasons
for getting the canuck good and plenty
those reasons comprised about everything
which could make for implacable grudge
loss of prize money loss of prestige his
girl insulted without redress an arm which
might keep him out of the ring for all
time and all on account of a bouncing
bantam who fought with his feet

  in the midst of the diatribe came con-
nick demanding fulfilment of the agree-
ment as to the return of the forfeit money


which had been posted by both sides to
guard against a broken contract

  moriarty and his manager begged to be
allowed to take back their money they
showed their empty pockets they were flat
broke they needed the money to get out
of town

  connick railed at a pugilist who was so
much of a fool as to risk the fortunes of all
concerned he heartlessly insisted on the
terms of the contract

  i can only half square myself by get-
ting a new attraction ive signed the
quedaw for his song and dance stuff
connick was not afraid of a pugilist with a
right arm in splints even that shrimp
will draw a bigger crowd than you can pull
after this moriarty

  get me a gun the fighter commanded
the manager when they were alone ill
shoot that canuck when he steps into the
ring tonight

  want to get hung on top of all the
rest  sneered the manager what youll
do is give me your watch and that diamond
ring well cash in and buy railroad tick-
ets im no good at hiking

   ill have you arrested if you touch em
im going to stick around in this section till
i can eat a bantam-broiled declared the
fighter grinding his teeth

  stay if you want to youre no good
to me any more hope youre hung ill
sell my own watch and get out good-
by

  alone sneaking into a rear seat that
night moriarty watched chariot dance and
heard the simple songs

  he growled his disgust

  and the crowd in general did not seem
to be entertained particularly that men
were there to see the second-rate fighting
such as it was did not serve entirely as an
excuse for their lack of interest it was a
tame performance there in the big tent-
chariots untrained voice and the faint
squeaking of the violin their curiosity
regarding this man who had felled the
mighty moriarty was soon appeased

  those songs and the music of the violin
belonged in the open demanded pictur-
esque settings and the air of the unconven-
tional-such as when chariot came danc-
ing down the lea sincere and unstudied in
his exuberance the men and the women
of the motor cars caught by the spirit of
the thing had been the right kind of an
audience

  chariot frowned when the men in the
tent yelled for him to kick high and show
how he licked moriarty when they


short stories

drowned out his music by their clamorous
demand that he fight somebody connick
stopped the show and gave chariot the rest
of the money agreed on

  so chariot went out into the night he
was not a bit discouraged the money
was in his pocket those men who wanted
everybody to fight who were they to judge

his songs

 they are
only fools jo-
ie he assured
the dog we
are the wise
ones we get
much money
now we- go to
find much
more where the
folks hate fighting as you and i do

  moriarty slipping out behind loomed in
the darkness when he hurried to intercept
chariot i cant do to you what i want to
do not here not now but im going to
do it later im a fair fighter canuck
they have always said that about me i
dont dare to talk about whats happened
id lose myself and go blooey all is look
out for yourself im going to get you
good and plenty

  ill fight no more with you insisted
chariot

  it aint going to be as you say youve
had your square steer from me after
this any kind of a punch goes see  that
was a mouthful when you said it-you
have your way to fight i have mine and
there wont be any more talk i aint
much of a talker

  he marched away into the shadows

  just as he had dodged lightly from un-
der discouragement in the tent so now did
chariot put off dismay shrugging his
shoulders as ever he made a confidant
of his dog

  un coup sur la tcte joie one two
three fine cracks on his head did i give him
his wits are still rattling pooh hell
forget after his sleep

  chariots emotions were quick tricksy
shuttling he could not understand the na-
ture of moriartys one track mind-the
tenacity of a bulldog grip on a grudge

  so chariot forgetting all troubles in the
pleasing dreams of the night went gaily
about his projects the next morning with
money burning in his pockets he was
wholly absorbed-he did not even show es-
pecial interest in the ominous shadowing
by his declared foe

  moriarty drew his own conclusions from

what he saw of chariots doings the ca-
nuck was stocking up for a return to the
woods

  for chariot was buying recklessly not
necessaries le criquct in his gallic
flareback intended to make elie flore and
the children happy with the things his own
nature suggested-buying what he himself
had always longed for in the forest a
talking machine first with many songs and
jolly tunes pictures too and lace cur-
tains for the windows of the log house-
it should be made pretty and plenty of
ribbons and some gay fabrics for flore and
the children then a generous sprinkling of
knickknacks and gewgaws

  moriarty saw in these purchases proba-
ble material for some of chariots adven-
tures among the woodland queens and the
thought suggested elisiane then his grouch
grew more bitter the girl had flouted
him that morning having no more use for
a maimed and discredited champion feel-
ing sure that he understood what char-
iots future movements would be and
knowing he could locate his prey in the
riviere du loup woods moriarty went to
the village inn to ease his aching arm

  chariot making several trips to josues
little booth deposited his wrapped treas-
ures and secured the old mans grudging
consent to deliver them

  josue hefted the various bundles and
estimated them as shrewdly as their wrap-
pings would permit if its foolishness
i will not take them if its food for their
hungry mouths in the woods its my duty
to carry them even if they have been
bought with money not honestly earned

  its all food good josue pledged
chariot carelessly flinging the lie-a lie
that would sweep in its wide arc as so
many lies do and deal disaster later on

  but prudence prompted chariot in the
matter of the grim moriarty whose espion-
age had at last stirred apprehension during
the morning joie hes a very black
cloud the master confided to the dog
if he follows us he will keep away the
good sunshine from us

  therefore chariot sauntered slowly past
the inn singing from the corners of his
eyes he beheld the ugly face of his foe at
the window

  chariot trod briskly and openly  the
way back toward riviere du loup when
he made sure after a few miles that the
black cloud was not following he took to
the fields and avoided st chrysostome in
his back tracks by a wide detour going on
toward the great river of which he had

                                                       
the cricket



heard so much he had only a few coins
to jingle in his pocket but he was glad
because the pocket was so nearly empty re-
flecting on the happiness he was sending
into the woods

  moriarty was taking his own time about
following he remained in st chrysos-
tome for several days

  he wanted to come across his foe later
in a place where there would be less haz-
ard of witnesses who could swear a man
into the hangmans noose

  the fact was moriarty was living in
sort of a nightmare it had begun when a
gnat had vanquished him it persisted in
his small mind now that he had little else
to do except meditate on revenge he had
been so high now he was nothing the
loafers laughed at him when he ventured
forth from the inn

  he wanted to hide himself away from
ridicule the forest would be a refuge
at any rate and he had a grinding hank-
ering to come upon that canuck in the
woods

  moriarty paid his inn reckoning and set-
tled with the surgeon and fared forth for
the woods of riviere du loup

iv

hope for his fortune and faith in
his way of getting it died hard in
chariot but he came at last to
know that fortune is fickle when one de-
pends on favor instead of toil he re-
flected on what old josue had said and ad-
mitted that many years make for practical
wisdom and he realized too that his lit-
tle songs and his dances belonged in the
open instead of in the saloons of levis by
the waterside

  the autumn frosts had come and there
was no longer any hope of interesting the
passers along the broad highway their
ears were muffled and they hurried in
the saloons indifferent men threw him pen-

nies such gifts were doles as if he were
a beggar it was not pay for honest music

  chariot confessed to joie that he was
ashamed the world was not at all what
it had seemed to be on that first day of
sunshine

    

  the clouds came dragging across the
skies and the rains lashed the great river
chariot sought for employment but in the
big town he found no work for the un-
skilled  there were no trees to be cut
down in the way of tools he knew only
the ax

  to get bread for himself and a bone for
the dog he went the rounds of the taverns

  seeing so many men he at last saw david
roi who was headed toward the mistas-
sini country in the north because the trap-
ping in the region of riviere du loup was
no longer good david talked with char-
iot but the trapper stumbled awkwardly
in his speech looked aslant at the young
man and mumbled when chariot put eager
questions about elie and flore and the
children

  at last david became snappily wroth
showing the air of one who thinks he is
being mocked why do you make be-
lieve you dont know the bad thing what
has happened 

  chariots goggling eyes and open mouth
and paling face served as mute appeal and
for proof that he did not know

  roi blurted his facts ruthlessly your
brother is in jail for murder and you
didnt know that hey 

  no gasped chariot

  sacre you have been about here and
there roi waved his arm and you dont
hear that news so much talked about

  i sing and dance i talk so little with
men wailed the other

  lc criquet always so busy about
your foolishness scoffed the trapper
well tis said your brother shot and
killed munson the traveling paymaster
for the crews of the three rivers timber
company for his money so they say
chariot swayed on his feet and sat
down at the little table opposite roi in the
saloon but elie did not do that-by the
sacred thunder no

  oh i do not much believe in it myself
agreed roi setting down his glass but it
shows up bad against him and he cannot
hire the smart law chaps to hunt up the
proof that its not so elie needed money
so many mouths to feed after you left him
sick and in the lurch and then they
found in his camp so many things he could
never earn money to buy there was a

talking machine and-

  i know mumbled chariot groping for
the words trembling all but fainting i
bought those things myself i sent them
by josue laliberte he knows why has
he not spoken out


short stories

  he says you sent only things for them
to eat he swears thats so-you told
him that

  the lie-how wickedly it had dealt with
the little family in the woods

  so they are keeping elie in the jail at
st francois said david naming the
county seat nearest the woods of riviere
du loup they will have his trial soon
i think they will hang him he is only a
poor man and the three rivers company
is rich poor men cant hire smart law-
yers and elie had too many fine things
in his camp-more than a poor man could
explain away

  then roi went along on his journey be-
cause the bell was ringing at the levis
ferry house he was in a hurry to go
north before the big snows came

  chariot stood up and sifted through his
fingers the few coins in his pocket he
bargained with men in the saloon for the
sale of his violin one of them bought
it but he was not willing to give much
the sum was not enough to buy a ticket to
st francois so chariot learned when he
went to the wicket of the railroad station

  he looked down into the plaintive sym-
pathizing eyes of joie

  a nice dog said the man behind the
wicket i see you need more money
ill buy him

  chariot had long trod the road of sacri-
fice it had been hard to do so in the
woods he had rebelled and now see
what had happened his simple mind
found rightful punishment in his present
plight he had leaped out into the sun-
shine to follow the tempting ways of ease
and selfish delight and now elie was in
prison because chariot had been thought-
less as he always had been in spite of re-
proach chariot was in a mood to do his
penance to the bitter dregs i must get
the money msieu you may have my
dog

  the man paid and came out with a rope
and dragged the dog away

  chariot was glad because his tears
blurred his vision he could not see joie
in the mist he shut out the dogs pitiful
cries hands over ears and hurried to the
waiting train

  it went jerking slowly out of the sta-
tion it halted soon for a switch to be
turned

  chariot close to the door m the smok-
ing car suddenly beheld an eager appeal-
ing face at the door through the dingy
glass the dog was on his hind legs and
was pawing at the glass the master

rushed and opened the door and received
joie in his arms as the train started on

  you must put that dog in the baggage
car said the surly conductor

  yes msieu ill go there and stay
with him if youll allow

  suit yourself

  thank you

  so chariot rode sitting on the floor in a
dark corner the dogs head on his knees
joie kept whining softly while chariot
sobbed unknotting the broken rope from
the dogs collar we have not been hon-
est with the man who paid the money
joie but i cannot take you back to him
now i must hurry to elie at st fran-
cois you and i we broke our ropes to
run away-and its bad very bad joie

v

in st francois trotting along the
street toward the jail chariot felt the
goad of desperate resolve he was
taking on himself the responsibility for
elies plight therefore he was on fire
with zeal he would smash the walls of
that jail he would get elie out

  but by the time he was inside those
walls-he had begged so frantically to be
allowed to see his  brother-the sight of
bars and bolts and clanking keys and iron
doors had thoroughly bashed in him hope
and spirit he had never seen a jail be-
fore he had not dreamed that such pains
were taken to pen prisoners

  he wept with the abandon of a child
when they brought elie into the guard-
room elie was a woeful figure the
poignant worry for a wife and children
left to make shift for themselves in the
woods had prostrated him more piteously
than the illness aggravated by this con-
finement which wore cruelly upon a man
accustomed to the open

  elie you will die unless i get you out
wailed chariot

  the guard growled and searched the
visitors pockets all over again no more
talk about getting a prisoner out-or out
you go yourself my fine fellow

  they allowed elie and chariot to sit on
two chairs which were held three feet
apart by an iron rod

  i have been thinking much ehe whis-
pered chariot we have good friends in
the woods there are the beaulieus the
labbes and many more ill bring them
here well find some way to break through
and take you out

  no i would not have it happen that
way protested the prisoner i never
the cricket



could go home thats all i want-only to
go home could i be happy running and
dodging and hiding here and there in the
world 

  i had not thought about that part
mourned chariot

  elies temper flared after being strick-
en with grief for so long he needed the re-
lief of righteous anger and here in his
presence was the real culprit according to
elies indignant belief you never do
any thinking about sensible things le
criquet did you think before sending us
all those things which josue brought
yes i thought how happy they would
make you and flore and the children
and what do you think now seeing all
the trouble those folderols have piled on
us 

  i can tell the truth to the law men
ehe	

  but honest josue sticks to what you

told him you
are my broth-
er and theyll
say that now
you lie to save
me

  oh elie
they must set
you free -
theyll find you
did not do any
bad thing
the law has its paid men to fasten the
thing on me i have no money to hire
those who can find the truth for my sake
i have a little money in my pocket ill
give it all to you

  no ill not take it if you have
money carry it to flore go to her quick-
ly chariot i stay awake all the nights
so crazy it makes me to think the children
may be hungry

  after a pitiful silence the prisoner con-
tinued why have you been so long in
coming why did you not hurry to ri-
viere du loup

  i heard only this very day david
roi told me in levis now chariot de-
clared stoutly that job of finding the
truth for your sake is mine

  he spoke almost joyously he might be
able to serve and to repair his fault after
all

  i tell you you shall not commanded
elie then flore and the children will
have nobody to work for them promise
me chariot you will go to them as quick
as you can work for them think only of
them if they keep me here away from


the woods and my home in this slow jus-
tice i shall die but dont let me live in
hell by not knowing you at least are with
them what would they do without you
promise me chariot you owe me that
much to pay for your thoughtlessness
see i call it by no worse name

  so chariot promised in order to soothe
an anguished soul but he knew when he
looked on his brothers wan face and
realized what confinement would do that
again he was swearing to a lie ready
to do penance he would have gladly taken
his brothers place in prison enduring sto-
ically in his thoughts seeing only conse-
quences he was insisting on his soul guilt
in bringing about the catastrophe he felt
he must solve the mystery of the real mur-
derer and expiate that guilt

  this dread punishment of the innocent
roused in him a tumult of emotions and
when the time of his visit was up he went
stumbling out to join joie whimpering at
the iron gate

vi

to charlots credit was it that
he walked from the open fields back
into the shadows of the woods of
riviere du loup without regret he was
even glad because he was again among the
sturdy trees and they seemed to be pro-
tectors instead of sullen soldiers who
barred his way

  his return struck a fleeting fire of joy
from the flint of woe when he flung open
the door of the log house but dolor and
tears quickly dashed out the flash of joy

  flore had no harsh words for him out
of her own volatile temperament she had
always understood chariot and had sympa-
thized with his fancies her only refer-
ence to the incriminating gifts was in her
appeal to him to take them away and sell
them you meant all for the best char-
iot but i cannot look at them any more
so he went the rounds of the settle-
ments scattered houses and sold all the
articles though some of the folks shud-
dered a bit as if they were trafficking with
things bought by blood but on the other
hand they avowed their belief in the inno-
cence of elie

  chariots real stumbling block was josue
laliberte whittling at toys like a santa
claus and shaking his head and wagging
his white beard no chariot i shall
stick to what you told me was in the
wrapped packages i am one who prays
to the saints and i could not kneel with a
lie on my soul


short stories

  but elie has been nowhere to buy such
things

  the old man squinted inimically at the
rattle-brain who had sauced him -so many
times oho so say you who do not
know well elie borrowed my horse
and cart to go to the ornis tract after
stock for his ax handles and yokes so
he said and a day or so later the body
of the paymaster was found in the woods
where it had been lying under the fallen
trees for a week or more so you see
you dont know all things you who have
your wits in your toes instead of in your
noddle

  and youll say all that at the trial will
you demanded chariot hotly

  i dont tell any lies returned josue
creasing with his sharp tool a simper into a
dolls face

  chariot yanked the grinning toy from
the makers hand and flung the taunting
image violently into a corner of the shop
it was only partial satisfaction of his ire
but he could not bring himself to cuff the
ears of a man so old as josue

  this sensible control of rampant desire
brought a reward to the cricket of a sort
old josue came to the door and called to
chariot when he was stamping away across
the yard of the shop

  josue crooked an inviting finger and
winked significantly and the young man
obeyed the summons returning in a sullen
mood

  the old man was more amiable he had
satisfied his pique he had as he put it to
himself set the bumptious young chap
where he belonged but you know im
sorry for elie he has had to put up with
so much from others not calling names i
dont think he killed the paymaster even if
he had the chance to do it but the law puts
much weight on a killer having the chance
and needing money

  of course elie did not kill a man
stormed the brother

  i always stick to the truth though it
may be bad for others now i give you
some more truth i too was after hard
wood one day in the omis tract i heard a
gun shot then i heard two men having a
great fight with tongues and fists so i
hid in a tree to be safe

  then in a little while i saw one man
go limping his face all bloody ah he
had a fine whipping then i saw another
man go off another way it was the big
fighter-man ah you made a fine fool of
yourself with him at the fair

  then you must go to the law-men-you

must say all that at the trial urged char-
iot with fire

  the crafty old man winked he shook
his head those two wicked men are still
loose in the world i do not run the
risk

  and my poor brother is locked up and
cannot harm you when you swear against
him  youre a bad old man josue

  im old and feeble and i cannot fight
bad men who are loose

  how about your truth-telling you brag
so proudly about

  if i must lie at times to save myself
from harm then i do my penance as the
cure orders that is all i have to say to
you le cnquet you go find those two
bad men and make them tell what is the
truth thats a fine job for you that
you can save your brother-as you ought
after getting him into such a mess

  josue slammed the door of his shop and
dropped the bar

  le criquet looked out into the sunshine
above the trees and got no comfort from
the glory

  two bad men to search down and from
them wrench the truth

  he was glad because one was moriarty
as a creature moved always by impulse
he instantly plunged into the quick belief
that the savage swaggerer who would fight
in the ring only for money would do almost
anything else for money he lashed him-
self into full belief that moriarty had killed
the paymaster it was good to have one
object on which to center all his furious
attempt to save his own people thus
two men were abroad in the world both
filled with the spirit of vengeance

  the sale of the incriminating articles had
brought enough money so that the children
would not be hungry while a search for the
truth could be made in the world and
chariot gave all the money into flores
hands

  then he put himself to asking many sly
questions in addition to those he had al-
ready put as he made the rounds

  yes the big man had been seen in the
woods of riviere du loup here and there
many times he said he had grown to
like the woods excusing his staying on
when the splints were off his arm he had
practiced with the ax then he had hired
as a chopper from one and another
chariot gleaned these bits of information
it was guessed rather than known that the
big man had hired for the megantic cut-
tings he was very sly in his going away
he had not told anybody what he intended

                                                      
the cricket



to do but such a blustering cursing man
would be likely to pick upon the megantic
cuttings so the talk ran because wild jock
britten was boss of a camp there and in-
vited just such
savage men as
moriarty seemed
to be it was the
boast of britten
that he liked to
welcome law-
breakers because
that kind would
be obliged to stay
with him and
work they were
safe with him he
declared to all
therefore his attitude was well known in all
the region he boasted that never had his
crew allowed a law officer to take out a man
from his camp

  all this did chariot learn-and he had
heard of jock brittens vicious crews

  nevertheless he went down to the edge
of the woods of riviere du loup to the
hiring-office of the megantic company and
presented himself with his ax and made the
chips fly handsomely when he tackled the
much-hackled test stump at command of
the agent

  youll do said the man i always
like a really spry frenchman for the
woods you may take your pick of our
four camps theres jock brittens-

  ill go there

  youll be in a tough gang young fel-
low theres even a prize-fighter who
wants to tackle every newcomer so as to
keep his muscle up

  but ill go if youll allow

  suit yourself said the man carelessly

  then chariot pleaded the cause of flore
and the children and asked for an advance
of wages

  well if you havent broken a law and
dont need jocks camp as a hiding place
i may as well nail you to the job by an
advance assented the agent

  chariot hurried back to flore with the
money he gave her a written order to go
to the agent for more of his wages as
earned perhaps he would be obliged to
work for a long time it might not be
easy to get very soon what he wanted from
moriarty but he felt glad that he could
be on his trail and still keep his promise to
his brother he said nothing at all to
flore about the big man and she perceived
only the natural thing in his hiring as a
chopper

       

  he went away with the grateful kisses
of the family on his lips

  he was able to leap gaily and send them
back a cheerful laugh before he turned into
the lane of the big trees

vii

it was not gay that trudging for so
many miles along tote-roads and by
tortuous trails

  the skies were slatey and there were
hard steel-gray banks in the south promis-
ing the first snows very soon and at the
end of the trail so chariot knew would be
waiting something very grim and grisly

  he looked over his shoulder every little
while the trunks of the trees crowded
themselves together so it seemed making
serried ranks to close in to shut off his re-
treat but more and more the hatred for
moriarty burned in him and he fed the
fire with fuel of assurances to himself that
the enemy must have done the deed which
had brought so much woe on elie and the
family

  he came upon other men who were
bound from here and there into the me-
gantic cuttings they warned him sym-
pathetically when he said he was heading
for brittens camp this one and that
sheering off the trail to brittens urged
him to come along

  youre a little chap you seem to be
a good man those bad fellows will eat
you up

  but he lifted his chin valorously and
kept on

it seemed quiet enough when char-
iot came into brittens clearing just
as the twilight was settling into black
darkness he had trotted for several miles
in order to distance the night

  he was panting for breath when he pre-
sented himself before britten in the office
camp and tendered his credential slip
from the agent

  you sure act like a willing chap ca-
nuck running to get here to your job you
may not be so glad youre here-a fellow
of your size averred the grim britten
but maybe youre like all the rest-ready
to run their legs off so as not to miss a
meal

  he put the paper in his wallet and
what are you running away from who
have you killed 

  i have never hurt anybody im an
honest man msieu

  you dont fit in this gang then but i
see the agent has nailed you by an advance


short stories

if you try to run away from me youre a
goner remember that youre here to
work out your time canuck no matter
what kind of a razz you get from the
gang

  the cookees shrill call cut the silence
outside gru-u-u-b on the ta-a-a-able
who-o-o-oo grub on the table

  better hustle in and get your setting
else youll have to dab and pick over
somebodys shoulder

  but chariot disobeyed his first command
from britten delaying about entering the
meal camp

  when the young chap was out in the
darkness trepidation shook him warn-
ings-warnings it had all been warnings
even joie was whining now at his feet

  had this been merely his own affair-
only himself to suffer-he would have
slunk away into the night and he knew it

  but limned there before his staring eyes
was the memory-picture of his brother
wan and shattered surely to be killed by
confinement in the slow course of justice
and the uncertainty of a murder charge
unless chariot made his best haste

  no he said to joie by the good
god i will stay here to do what can be
done

  but he lingered many minutes in the
shadow of one of the horse hovels before
he could gather courage to go into the pres-
ence of the crew

  joie dodged in at the masters heels and
went to take a patient post in a corner
waiting for a dole

  chariot stood for a few moments meek-
ly surveying the double rows of eaters at
the long table searching for a crevice
where he might squeeze in the men
grinned and muttered and shouldered to-
gether on the benches evidently they in-
tended that any newcomer should make
his bigness by a show of prowess of some
sort

  but chariot was more interested in a foe
than in food his eyes sought and found
moriarty the young man was nerving
himself for instant trouble he expected
to be assailed by oaths and threats if
moriarty had leaped across the table and
attacked then and there chariot would not
have been surprised

  but on the big mans countenance after
a twist of a queer quick expression there
was slowly creased a grin anybody except
chariot would have found it a friendly
smile but chariot believed he knew what
sort of ugly menace crouched behind that
smile and he found the grimace sinister

however moriartys tone was welcom-
ing and hearty when he called to chariot
to come around the table

and crowd over you snapped mori-

arty roughly tipping over the men on
either side of him where n ells your
manners all of a sudden

  it was plain that the prize-fighter had
won his standing there in the camp the
men hastened to move

  step in here stranger hurry up
commanded moriarty when chariot came
slowly youve got one friend in the
gang you see

  the newcomer straddled over the bench
and in spite of his test efforts to seem at
ease he cringed beside the burly man who
kept up his grin looking sidewise at the
chap he ostensibly befriended

  chariot had always dealt sparingly in
guile he did not understand such methods
this attitude of his foe wrought upon the
young mans frank nature more cruelly
than curses and direct attack which he
would have understood

  promptly all the others were interested
only in gobbling their food and gabbling
their clamor of talk table ware rattled
and voices were high they paid no more
attention to the new man in the crew

  under cover of the noise moriarty seized
his opportunity didnt know i was
here hey some surprise for you hey
cbarlot was too much perturbed to do
crafty lying and he had been finding lies
dangerous i knew id find you here
msieu thats why i have come

  a few minutes later there was a general
roar of laughter roused by a coarse story

  you didnt come up here to get killed
canuck growled moriarty taking advan-
tage of the covert of hilarity whats
your real reason for coming out with
it youve come for a reason he laid
down his knife and fork and strove to bore
chariot with a demanding stare but after
a few moments his eyes wavered under
the steady gaze from the other youll
find out why im here yes i think you
know already

  the fighter went back to his food but

                                                      
the cricket

i

his hairy hands shook he grew pale he
glanced up and found chariots eyes accus-
ing him

  something strange was working in mo-
riarty and chariot perceived it a mans
level look and his few words had set the
something in motion

  the two men went on with their food in
grim silence

  hell a dawg yelped the cookee on
his way to the table with a big can of tea
whose he knew perfectly well to
whom the dog belonged but he was im-
pelled by an impish desire to rasp the new
man to start something

  who had the gall to bring a dog in
here where gents are eating shouted a
man affecting great indignation kick
that mutt out cookee 

  its my dog cried chariot if he is
not liked in here ill take him out

  i order him kicked out insisted the
objector then hell know bettern to
come in here again

  the cookee set the can on the table and
started toward joie in the corner

  chariot leaped over the bench and made
all haste intercepting the cookee barring
the way with an arm the cookee a
husky young fellow struck the arm down
a chorus of voices declared for the kick-
ing it was only a pretense of dislike for
the dog of course it was seizing an op-
portunity to set two young fellows at each
other for the sake of providing mealtime
entertainment it was a chance to give a
new man some of the razz that was coming
to him

  you heard the orders quedaw blus-
tered the cookee and orders go for me
get out of the tote-rod he kicked at
chariot in the way of practice the
cricket was not at a loss in all quick-as-
flash tactics he grabed the swinging foot
and at the same time leaped forward and
with his free hand drove a staggering blow
under the cookees ear with blow and
the quick hoist of the captive foot he
piled the attacker heels over head and the
cookee fell with a violence that knocked
breath and sense out of him chariot
stood over him when he opened his eyes
is it enough  demanded the victor

  i guess so admitted the cookee get-
ting up stiffly when he went limping
back to his duties he called to moriarty
you havent been giving me any line on
that kind of fighting in your lessons
dont you dare to call them tricks by
the name of fighting roared moriarty in
protest the damnation canuck

     

  hi look-a-here big un admon-
ished one of the crew what has hap-
pened to that friendship all of a sud-
den

  with difficulty bethinking himself mo-
riarty managed to work rage out of his con-
torted features and substituted his grin
oh it makes me mad to see ring rules
knocked a-hooting no matter who does
it but as to my new friend-canuck i
adopt your pup along with you come
over here and get him a plate of grub
he pounded his fist on the table when men
muttered being a friend of mine that
dog is classy enough to eat over there in
the corner what i say goes see

  but the other men continued to mutter
apart from moriarty when they were back
in the bunk house it was plain enough
that the prize-fighter had won his way
there by violence and not by inspiring any
liking

  hes gitting too cocky averred a
critic always wanting his own way no
matter how the rest of us feel now that
hes fell so much in love with frencliy
hell probly try to stall us off if we want to
give the freshie the reglar britten bazoo

  we aint going to break the biggest
camp law only to please moriarty said a
man and he was endorsed in his stand by
all

  and this special bazoo will need to be
a boomer declared the spokesman his
voice incautiously loud else the freshie
will think hes running the place because he
has licked the cookee

  moriarty overheard he came thrust-
ing forward nothing doing see
there aint going to be a bazoo for the new
chap

  why not  was the surly query men
swapped a lot of understanding scowling
at each other saying no word this bump-
tious moriarty fairly new in camp him-
self was certainly doing too much boss-
ing why not was the general de-
mand now that the issue had been made

  moriarty merely cursed them his ideas
were somewhat mixed just then he
realized that he was having some difficulty
in explaining to himself just why he in-
tended to keep the young fellow from the
hazards of a bazoo now that they were
making plans for a boomer in order to
teach the newcomer a lesson the hazards
were real a poor chap had been killed
only a few days before in the britten camp
-a death reported out to the authorities
as an ordinary tripped-timber casualty
but hands had slipped from the edges of


short stories

the horse blanket in which the fellow was
tossed

  moriarty did not intend to have his man
subjected to any such perils just then his
notions were confused-but he venomously
declared that what he said went this
career-wrecker this fellow who just stirred
in moriorty a still mightier tumult of
emotions by a few simple words and an
accusatory stare was not meat for amuse-
ment of that gang of
roisterers moriarty
had serious business
of his own with the
man who on top of
all the rest had in-
vaded the sancitity
of the law-defying
refuge

  moriarty was in a
frame of mind to
mix it with the
whole of them by
getting his ferocity out of his system in
that manner he could content himself to
take his own good and torturous time with
the single victim i tell you nothing do-
ing and thats why not

  how many of us do you think you can
lick all at once moriarty asked a man
vengefully

  all of you come on he backed
to the wall of the camp rolling up the
sleeves of his mackinaw

  his constant assumption of more and
more authority in the camp had made him
feared and had won for him a standing
but the grouch against him had been slowly
developing his sneer when he declared
he would meet all of them suddenly torched
the laid tinder of the grudge they massed
for a concerted attack then they thought
of better strategy and spread out in knots
of two and three

  im going to punch to kill roared mo-
riarty

  rage now whirled in him like a torch
he did not wait for their onslaught he
dove away from the wall the scattered
knots suggesting his opportunity to him
he struck down men right and left before
they had a chance to herd their blows
glanced off him as he leaped here and there
he picked up victims whom he had
knocked down and made missiles of their
bodies hurling them against his grouping
assailants then he flung himself back to
the wall to gain a respite panting sweat-
ing cursing

  there was quick mumbled conference
among the men who were left standing

there was malignant ruthless agreement
moriarty was using his tongue on them
threatening to kill ive got a right to do
anything with these odds he yelled
and ill do it so help me he
stooped quickly and picked up an oak sap-
ling it was the poker for the barrel
stove the stick had been kicked about
the room in the struggle

  the men rushed on him in a concerted
attack the leaders carrying a long deacon
seat as a shield he struck over the
shield knocking down man after man

  it was a dizzying swirl of struggling
fighters a piling forward a tangle of re-
treat and new charges nobody could see
what the other man was doing

  all at once there was a porcine shriek
from moriarty im stuck youve got
me im knifed hell on this kind of
fighting

  instantly the crowd fell away from him
it was a tumult of retreat the guilty man
and the innocent associates were equally
anxious to avoid the responsibility for a
dirty trick

  moriarty fell on the floor and writhed
screaming for aid

  chariot had held aloof from the struggle
he was poised on a bunk holding on to a
stanchion

  anguished fear swept through him now
was he to lose this man on whom all the
desperate hopes were placed that was
his first thought-his initial spur to action
then he felt something like pity for this
wretch abandoned to his fate at any
rate the big man had been brave taking on
such odds

  chariot leaped from the bunk drag-
ging his belt from its loops he flung
himself beside his enemy blood soaking
through the trousers below the knee gave
the samaritan his grim hint for action
he dragged up the loose cloth and applied
the tourniquet of the belt he twisted it
taut with all his strength while the victim
wailed the limb had been cruelly
slashed chariots poor knowledge of sur-
gical aid stopped there he pleaded with
the other men they shook their heads
they did not know how to do anything
else more than chariot had done

  you send for a doctor to save his life
yes was the young mans eager plea to
britten but the boss like his men shook
his head

  you will let me go i will go yes

  dont leave me canuck they mean to
get me quavered moriarty he set
trembling hands around chariots leg all

                                                       to
the cricket



at once he had become broken and full of
fear in the revulsion of his emotions he
made the strange choice of his enemy as

his aid and pro-
tector  there was
nobody else to
whom he could
appeal t a k e
me out of here
canuck take
me to a doctor
thats a good
idea affirmed
one of the men
the cookee
bringing more wood for the barrel stove
flung open the bunk house door a whirl
of snow followed him in the promise of
the slatey-gray cloudbanks had been kept

  the devil isnt playing in with his pet
on this thing sneered a man he has
sent a snow-storm-and youd better not
to tackle it canuck

  msieu the good god has sent the
snow declared chariot its to make
the runners of the sled slip all fine

  yes if you can find your way said
britten but you cant find it frenchy
no man can do it

  perhaps a man cannot msieu char-
iot leaned and patted joies head the dog
had come sidling close to his master but
here i have my good friend who knows
how better than any man

  the hostile individual who had mum-
bled and who had protested against the
going shuffled near chariot was bend-
ing over moriarty buttoning the mack-
inaw

  watch him dont let him get near
me son whispered the victim damn
him he knifed me thats dawse wad-
den remember him-he stuck me
chariot appealed to the crew kneeling
beside his charge and protecting him the
volunteer asked for a sled for a lantern
for blankets

  a few moments later moriarty had been
wrapped in the blankets and was laid on
the moose sled by chariots direction
the lantern was slung from the dogs collar

  then into the night and thrusting
through the storm went the little expedi-
tion

viii

harlot did not mark the hours
and was only guessing at time

  but he knew he was very weary
and he was glad to stop when moriarty
begged to be eased on the sled and im

all of a chill son i guess im dying

  i think its the cold of the night
msieu and because you lie so still on the
sled we shall help that feeling

  he broke dry limbs from the slash scat-
tered beside the tote-road and built a fire
at which he warmed his charge turning the
heavy body tenderly so that it might be
soothed in all its parts by the heat then
he filled the big mans pipe and held a
flaming twig to the tobacco

  i guess i aint going to die if we get
to that doctor in time admitted the
wounded man now finding solace in his
pipe ill stand the ache i wont
whine any more

  chariot crouched at the fire beside the
dog the young man was silent trying
to straighten out his thoughts he had his
man at last to be sure but he had not won
his victory by any real effort of his own
the prisoner had delivered himself beg-
ging like a child to be helped after all
so ran chariots thoughts it would be
something like betraying a trust if he de-
livered this man to the law and chariot
realized that he possessed none of the ac-
tual knowledge which the stern law would
require puzzlement and a sense of honor
were curiously mingled in his thoughts

  moriarty suddenly started to speak it
was startling in the silence and cliarlot
jumped the other had so surely hit upon
the sensitive spot well son youve got
what you came to brittens to get youve
got me now what are you going to do
with me after the doctor mends me up into
something you can use

  i dont know msieu

  well what do you know anyway
you handed me a dam queer lodk when
we were sitting at table tonight whats
the big idea of chasing me to brittens
im trying to get my poor brother out
of the jail wbere hes dying

  and you reckon on putting me into
that jail in his place do you

  chariot was glad because he had been
doing some thinking on the problem he
was able to declare himself honestly no
msieu i have no right to do that i
really know nothing about you-about any
good reason for putting you in the jail
but i have a better reason of my own
you have put yourself in my hands man
to man i have been thinking much about
that msieu i have lived all my life in
the woods they make a man honest-
except at brittens camp perhaps he
added with bitterness

  gawd ejaculated moriarty finding


short stories

no other words for the expression of his
emotions

  once more chariot harnessed himself to
the thongs of the sled bent his shoulders
to the burden and they went on

  the patient dog trudged ahead swing-
ing the beacon from his collar

  now the sky began to match the color
of the snowflakes-the night graying into
the white of dawn chariot patted joies
head and puffed out the lantern-light

  how about this brother of yours son
demanded moriarty thickly and how
about yourself too for that matter 

  so chariot told

  and simply and innocently he revealed
the heart of a child-man-his hopes his
dreams his disappointment his repentance

the sunshine blessed them when
chariot trudged hauling his charge
into the settlement at the fringe of
the forest

  the surgeon opening his door was a
kindly man who allowed chariot to puli
the sledge into the house

  after the hurt had been repaired the
samaritan tugged the sledge out of doors
and gazed down compassionately on the
big man youll need much rest after
so bad hurt msieu ill haul you to the
little inn

  no not yet growled moriarty
through clenched teeth he was still in
dreadful pain the surgeons work had in-
volved agony on the sufferers face
resolution was grooved into the furrows
set there by his ordeal didnt i see
passing when we came a sign on a house
down yonder  the sign was avocat 
wasnt it

  yes msieu

  means lawyer-notary-and all that

stuff hey all
right take me
there

 and avocat
bernier was as
kind as the sur-
geon had been
he allowed the
sledge to be
drawn into his
sitting-room

  the lawyers
wife was there
seeing her moriarty asked chariot to
draw off tbe mackinaw which the fighter
had not pulled off even in the stress of

 	the combat in brittens camp pull the
 stitches out of the lining maam if youll
 be so kind pick out whats hidden in
 there he put up his hand halting all
 else until the woman began to pull out
 money bill after bill the mackinaw was
 lined with notes

   moriarty grunted his approbation when
the money was heaped on the table now
get ready your ink and pen and paper mr
lawyer i have a story to tell and to
swear to about seeing a man shoot mun-
son the paymaster im no murderer
but i aint any cheap squealer either im
guilty too i waited and beat that killer
up and took the money away from him
thats the cash what shes been taking out
of my jacket i meant to keep that money
even if i had to do worse to the killer he
chased me into brittens camp he was
laying for me he thought he saw his
chance when he knifed me that man is
named dawse wadden mr lawyer and
youd better start a dick with a little army
to get him-get him quick if they have to
tear down brittens camp to get him but
first take down what i have to say so i
can swear to it

   the notary tense and white hurried to
 get his writing materials

   moriarty rolled his head on the sledge
 rail and smiled on chariot who sat on the
 floor aghast and trembling

   you see son you thawed it out of me
 remember how i bragged once away back
 that i was a square-shooter  i didnt half
 mean it i was always handing out cheap
 bluff while i was thinking about what
 one helluva fellow i was in the world
 you tackled me with a new one on me
 son-a brand new twist you couldnt
 have pounded it out of me-what you
 came after but you have thawed it out
 and now ill go to jail and wait for the
 trial and take my medicine-whatever is
 coming to me at any rate i wont have
 to be thinking about a poor devil dying in
 a jail or dancing on air and leaving his
 wife and kids yes sir it was a great
 twist you put on me son twice you have
 done it once with kicks this time with
 kindness almost the only real touch of
 real friendship ive had from anybody in
 a fighting life suppose we shake

   then with joie close-cuddled to him his
 arms around the dogs neck chariot sat
 on the floor of the little sitting-room and
 with tear-wet staring eyes watched the pa-
 tient notary write down the wonderful
 words which would bring elie home again


peavey work

by clay perry
author of sides to a river boss of the river etc

     he was only a boy after all even though he was in charge of
     boom one during the logging drive and when his dog was in
     trouble with a black bear it was hard for the boy in him to
     know what to do-even though the drive had its enemies

theys only one thing you got
to look out for tod raine
thats the links of them chain
couplings you watch em
you know no chain is any
strongern its weakest link

  slim curtin timber cruiser who had
brought tod raine to boom one on the
rainy river four days ago stopped at
tods lonely shanty on the north bank on
his return trip from the timber-cut camps
far above

  humph slim chuckled after a mo-
ment his weathered face crinkling about
the eyes in mirth boss whitney he
dont believe in these ready-made proverbs
though know what he said to me when
i asked him why he was settin a boy to
watch boom one 

  tod shook his head and colored a trifle
he expected some jibe at his youthfulness
tod was but sixteen though in stature and
physical development he was a man he
held a man-size peavey in his hands idly
he kicked at a boom-chain and sparks flew
from steel on iron he wore heavy calked
boots the sharp steel spikes projecting a
quarter of an inch to half an inch out of
the thick soles he had qualified as a
seasoned river-driver a year ago

  boss whitney he says a chain is
often stronger than the link that looks the
weakest humph sort of a reverse


english twist to it eh i dont sees its
much different from the old one well
you seen anybody movin around up here 
nobody nothing but porcupines and
skunks but a black bear cut his nose 
an old molasses can out behind the shanty
the first night after you left slim i didnt
even hear him though and got no chance
at him

  wheres yer dawg

  well thats what worries me tod
confessed rips been missing ever since
yesterday morning slim i reckon hes
after that bear

  something in tods voice and face
caused slims wise eyes to narrow well
you let rip do all the bear hunting he
said if he meets up with one youll
know it all right

  this was one thing tod feared-that
rip had met up with the bear as soon
as slim had gone on his way down river
to where the great northern crew was at
work building the new dam tod fell to
calling and whistling for rip he knew
it was hopeless the loud voice of the
river npuftled every other sound drowned
out echoes and the deep-drooping boughs
of hemlock and balsam formed a screen
along each shore shutting the forest away
from the river

  rip here rip here here here
  tod was in mid-stream calling balanc-




short stories

ing himself on the teetering boom there
was no sharp glad bark no rush of padded
feet along the stretch of spruce logs hewn
flat on the top fashioned into a long
wooden barrier from one bank to the other

  now where is that doggone dog
gone he demanded of the wilderness-
and the wilderness remained discreetly
silent it held its secrets close tod knew
for he had solved some of them and his
wood-lore only made him the more re-
spectful the greenhorn is indifferent to
the wilderness but to the initiate it is a
many-paged book which grows more won-
derful and awesome as the leaves are
turned

  doggone dog repeated tod querul-
ously then he smiled as the picture of the
dog came to him that comical wistful old-
mannish face of the airedale with its blunt
muzzle wire hair standing out in whorls
and swirls about the eyes and the head
like the shock-head of a roustabout a
picture of rough and ready cocksure im-
pudence and wisdom he-e-ere rip

  tod took a quick turn on the boom and
walked it from one end to the other it
was of double strength each twenty foot
section made of two spruce logs cleated
together side by side with wooden pegs
which grew tighter as the water soaked
them heavy chains ran through ring-
bolts of thick iron driven into the end of
each of the log sections the chains of
half inch malleable iron were made end-
less with patent lock links which could
be opened by driving out a steel rivet it
was easy to replace weakened couplings
by this arrangement and to break up the
boom when necessary the couplings
likewise gave the long boom more elas-
ticity so that the shock of the battering
current and bumping logs would be ab-
sorbed

  tods job was to guard day and night
this stretch of boom across the rainy-
with his life if necessary not that any-
one believed such desperate defense would
be necessary tod least of all there was
nothing to fear to be sure there was old
pine garvey the river-squatter who had
fought tooth and nail against the great
northern building the dam at bent creek
from which garvey ran his pine logs and
who regarded pulp sticks the commodity
in which the great northern dealt as
picayune timber compared to his pine
garvey had been beaten muzzled by the
law forbidden to place any obstacle in the
way of progress as represented by the
concrete dam slim curtin had spoken of

crook knee joe the wretched habitant
who was pine garveys tool and who
poled the river in a rotten bateau and made
what trouble he could for construction
bosses and timber bosses

  crook knee joe slim had said was a
rank coward and tod had his  rifle
in the shanty which he was under strict
instructions to use only in emergency
and then only as a threat

  dusk was falling tod walked slowly
along the boom to the shanty which was
his home he shot a final glance up the
turgid flood of the rainy it was clear
the logs had not yet started down from
the cuttings above but soon they would
be for the headwater was rising fast be-
fore another day had passed the drive
would be bumping the boom piling up a
brownish grayish field of timber

  tod pursed his lips for a final shrill
whistle for rip-and the whistle died into
a low whew as his eyes lighted on an
object lying on the ground before the
shanty door he stopped and picked it
up it was a worn leather mitten-slim
curtins the cruiser must have dropped
it as he took his departure

  tod grinned good thing rip wasnt
here he said slim wouldnt find his
mitten again doggone that dog

  but he grinned again as he recalled rips
playful trick of snatching up every loose
object in the shape of clothing he could
find and running away with it-so that he
could be coaxed back and petted when he
returned it

  he-e-ere rip his call was almost
unconsciously given the answer was the
rasp and squeak of boom chains the liquid
roar of the river a blue-jays mockery a
crows caw of alarm

  tod did not sleep well that night the
absence of rip weighed more and more
heavily upon him for one thing the dog
had done night sentry duty for tod
curled up in a bush just outside the shanty
door-refusing to sleep inside-rip was a
better guard than a man could be for
another thing-tod had found his imagin-
ation terribly active it projected him far
into the forest and pictured for him his
dog engaged in a furious combat with a big
black bear

  he was up early in the morning pacing
the boom his peavey over his shoulder its
heavy curved hook swinging he looked
not unlike a soldier of some ancient army
of the days when bill and pike were com-
mon weapons and it was not hard for tod
to imagine himself some such soldier-a

                                                       
peavey work



briton guarding a chain defense on the
thames a roman soldier holding the
bridge across the tiber a gaul fiercely
watchful and jealous of a pontoon across
the seine

  his imagination however swung always
around to the scene of his waking dreams
-the trail of the bear and the airedale
his calked boots crunched crusted snow
his peavey became a rifle his eyes blazed
he lowered the peavey to his arm-pit
took aim pulled the trigger-that is the
steel hook and--

  boom i

  he started as if the peavey had turned
into a rifle and had gone off unexpectedly
in his hands then he grinned at himself
and cried out hello mister log

  the boom was the bump of the first
log of the drive against the boom

  the logs drove down at first in a drib-
ble then in increasing clumps and tangles
by noon a bobbing floor of timber lay
against the boom stretching one hundred
yards upstream tod had a busy time

he zig-zagged
across the
loose - lying
tricky floor
with the ease
of an expert
his calked
shoes gripping
bark and bare
logs with equal
sureness his
educated feet
seeking just the right spot leaving a sink-
ing log at just the right instant treading
timber leaping aside running the length
of a big one birling another beneath him
he straightened out piling tangles made
the logs lie flat and easy it was part of
his job

  the boom bowed into an arc the
coupling chains tightened and grated
sharply link on link tod walked the
boom and inspected each coupling closely
there was considerable wear on the chains
subjected to the corroding influences of
river water ram snow and frost one
half of each coupling lay under water am
the time tod noticed that the patent
links all of them were submerged as if
with purpose he puzzled over that it
would make it very hard to unlink a weak
chain and replace it with a new one but
in a flash it occurred to him also that it
would make it hard for anyone to uncouple
the boom crook knee joe for instance
he smiled at the thought boss whitney

would never leave this boom to be guarded
by a lone boy if he thought there was dan-
ger of that sort would he

  a chain is often stronger than the link
that looks the weakest

  so this was boss whitneys philosophy
well tod wondered how to apply that

  abstract wonderings were erased by
concrete considerations now the strain
on the boom was greatest in mid-stream
the sharpest bend of the bow here must
one expect danger if anywhere the pos-
sibility of a break in the boom however
was remote ten times as many logs would
fill the broad stretch of the rainy extend
for a mile up-stream and the boom would
hold fast it was built to hold

  he-e-re rip here here here

  his call was almost a wail of despair

if he only knew-

  in mid-afternoon the drive slackened
the flow of logs ceased entirely before
four oclock

 uh huh theyve got a jam up
above tod said aloud gosh id like
to go up and see it and help

  he was yearning for companionship for
action if rip were only here to join in

the game of running logs-

  he had convinced himself absolutely
that rip had followed the snooping bear
tod went to the shanty took down his 
fingered it sought out a blackened stump
along the shore which bore some resem-
blance to a bear sought a vital spot-and
hit it first shot with a swift glance
across the river which showed him the
logs lying quiet  more timber coming
down he stepped about the corner of the
shanty and studied the footprints of the
bear driblets of blood in the caked snow
told of bruins reckless search of a jagged
tin for molasses tod cut a wide circle
seeking for rips paw-prints too he did
not find them

  by jove i ill just follow this bears
tracks until i do find where rip hit the
trail he told himself with a thrill and
plunged into the thicket whither the trail
led

  an hour later tod raine floundered out
of the morass of a tamarack swamp to the
baaik of the rainy his face set his breath
coming in great gasps his eyes stony and
fierce in that bush he had come upon
something that sent him crashing wildly
through the morass it was the scene of a
furious combat between a hear and a dog
blood and hair and torn up roots and snow
told the tale tod had turned another
page in the secret book of the wilderness


short stories

and its secret solved froze his blood
bears hair and dogs hair lay in tangled
mats in the bloody snow

  the serious part of it was that for
many yards beyond the scene of that com-
flict there had been blood in the dogs
tracks and the tracks showed that the
dog had limped for long distances on three
legs

  the story was plain the bear had
turned to face the trailing airedale had
fought had been worsted had turned and
fled-the dog bleeding but fearless in pur-
suit that had been two days ago

  on the retina of his inner eye tod got
the picture of the final stand of the bear
it was in a ravine deep in the forest
where a swollen creek blocked bruins prog-
ress he turned and in fierce defiance
faced the limping dog before the savage
attack the bear-a young one though quite
large-climbed a tree

  rips got him and hes waiting for me
to come and help him tod told himself
with the conviction of one who sees

  but his searching feverish eyes were
torn from the trail where it mounted a rise
on the river-bank-where the bear had
turned away from that barrier and plunged
into the thicket again what he saw on
the bosom of the swollen rainy was a mass
of moving logs driving down in almost
solid formation from bank to bank

  tod shuddered from the violence of
emotional reaction a lump rose in his
throat and made his labored breathing
more difficult for a dizzy moment he
stood torn between the desire which
amounted to a frenzy of fear for his be-
loved rip the desire to keep on that
blood-stained trail to the end and the
knowledge that his place at this moment
was down at the boom on the job

  just for an instant he hesitated then
stooped low and sent a piercing whistle
into the forest beneath the drooping
boughs and with the sound of that shrill
call ringing in his ears as the only answer
he sped down the bank and leaped onto the
first log that swerved close to the shore

  the river claimed him tod knew that
were it not for the sweep of that current
carrying him down he could never have
returned to the boom as he did it needed
the mighty pull of the river against his
own volition to do it he rode with the
drive until the glint of open water told
him he was nearing the boom the open
water lay beyond the barrier

  for the last time he turned his face to
the north up the river his muscles tighten-

ing with the impulse to dash ashore and
take up the trail again a line from an old
verse of kiplings ran in his head

  brothers and sisters i bid you beware

  of giving your heart to a dog to tear

  well he ran away from me doggone
him he cried trying to justify himself
but his throat continued to ache some-
thing like a film over his eyes made the
log-field waver and quaver as he turned
his face downstream he bit his lip shook
his head to clear his sight-and started as
if he had been stung

  what was that dark object down there
in mid-boom a dog

  clutching his rifle in both hands across
his chest he started running the logs as
they moved

  doggone dog bet hes been back
waiting for me all the time-thinks ive
gone and left him well its good enough
for him i-say that dont look like
rip

  he halted suddenly in his zig-zag sprint
and rode a big sprwce which lay amid its
fellows with steady balance

  its bigger than rip-sorta black-and
i wonder-if it could be-the bear now
hold steady tod raine

  the sun sinking shone almost directly
in his eyes the way the river curved from
north to west it was difficult for tod
to make out much but a dark blot on the
boom but at last banishing the distor-
tion of desire
which made him
think it was rip
and the illusion

o	f imagination
which made it a
bear his judg-
ment forced him
to the slow be-
lief that it was
neither dog
bear porcupine
nor any four-footed thing-but a man
crouching on his heels

  slim back no slim wouldnt come
back after a night and a day-not for a
lost mitten tod poked at the bulge in his
blouse where he had thrust the mitten
automatically hiding it from rip

  then swift alarm came to him with the
sharp metallic ring of steel on steel his
eyes for an instant shielded from the sun
by a tall spruce caught a clear glimpse of
the object on the boom

  it was a man squatted there swinging
a short-handled sledge

  with a guttural rasp in his throat tod

                                                            
peavey work



sprang forward for a distance of forty
yards on the moving drive which meant
sixty or more on the river he ran reckless
of himself he had only the grim purpose
to charge the squatted figure it was plain
enough what the man was doing he was
cutting a boom-chain with a cold-chisel

  at the edge of the log-field tod halted
his sprint he was within two hundred
yards of the boom plainly he saw the
sledge rise and fall with the sound of its
metallic clink reaching his ears an instant
later he raised his rifle balanced him-
self carefully on a teetering log and aimed
for a spot on the boom near the trespasser

  the shot ripped splinters from the boom
and ricochetted on the open water beyond
whining at it whirled with a start the
man with the sledge jumped up then he
turned and ran flinging the sledge and
cold-chisel into the river each in a different
spot

  tod noted instinctively where they fell
knowing that their recovery later might
be important he noted also the curious
gait of the fleeing man and knew who it
was though he had never seen him it was
crook knee joe the habitant pine gar-
veys tool

  tod let him go to fire at him was
useless unless he wished to shoot to kill
-and he did not that was against or-
ders and against his own desire the im-
portant thing was to get to the boom as
quickly as he could and see what crook
knee joe had done

  tod sped so fast that he stumbled and
fell his rifle crashing across a log and
when he picked it up he found the gun
wrecked it was but a step to the boom
tod slammed the useless gun down
crawled over the logs on hands and knees
to the boom and scrambled desperately to
the coupling place where the man with the
sledge had been busy

  he gasped as he reached it one of the
chains that held the double ends was gone
entirely it had been cut and slipped out
of the rings the other alone held the
boom he ran his fingers along the tight-
drawn section gasped again as their sensi-
tive ends came in contact with a sharp-cut
notch in the under side of a link

 the second chain had been cut half-way
through only a quarter inch of iron held
the boom the grinding bumping horde of
logs the swollen swift tearing rainy-
and protected the growing dam five miles
down the river

  a chain is often stronger than the link
that looks the weakest

    

  tod sent up a prayer that boss whit-
neys philosophy was true and then he
sent up another prayer for himself his
quickened thought brought home to him a
lesson it was this that he was one link
in the chain upon which boss whitney
depended for the harnessing of the rainy
for the safety of the dam and of the hun-
dreds of workmen swarming over the
structure the comfort and well-being of
the thousand employees of the paper mills
far down river he was one link and
boss whitney had chosen him because he
believed in that proverb of his-and in
tod raine others had shaken their
heads doubtfully looking him over when
the boss chose a boy boss whitney had
smiled and later slim had brought tod
a reason for that smile

  rip rip why did you go away

  tod half-sobbed the words as he got to
his feet and stood for an awful moment
bewildered seeking to clear his brain to
think out the first step he must take to
strengthen that weakened boom

  it was not broken yet he was not
broken yet but he felt as if a sledge
had driven down upon his very soul it
sickened him upon him depended
whether that cut link when it broke-and
it must-would mean the bursting of the
boom the rush of millions of feet of rac-
ing timber down the raging stream to bat-
ter and crash against the false structure
which diverted the river from the setting
concrete of the new dam

  tod turned and ran for the shack his
feet dragged his legs were wet to the
thighs but it was not this which hauled
at his heels it was the fear that when he
left the weakened coupling it would break
before he could return he dug his calks
into the flat boom and raced on at the
shack he caught up his peavey snatched
from a nail on the wall a length of chain
with a patent link fished from beneath his
bunk the sledge and the piece of railroad
iron which was to be used as an anvil
felt in his mackinaw for the slender steel
punch he carried always and then again
whirled out to the boom a few steps and
he stopped dumped everything onto the
boom and went back he snatched a sec-
ond length of chain from its hanging be-
rating himself for his haste

  the sun had set the swift northern
dusk faded like a fragment of dream
tod bent low over the boom-ends if only
he had brought the lantern too late now
to go back

  the huge iron circles of the ring-bolts


short stories

lay as flat as the links running through
them would allow and he had to use his
peavey point to raise them and thrust
through the new chain the boom moved
restlessly it seemed to tod that every
yank would be the last if the chiseled
link snapped all would be over still he
had become very cool and calm and sure
it was a job of running a length of chain
through those rings drawing the ends to-
gether snapping the patent link shut and
riveting it tight in emergency he might
even omit the rivet

  but to draw the ends past each other and
give slack enough for the connection was
one thing to try another to do the chain
when he got both ends through their rings
fell short the ends would not meet
tod gasped in dismay he saw the reason
the old chain was now stretched so taut
that it stood out of the water entirely and
the half-cut link was opening

  the wonder was that it held at all tod
thrust the long spike of his peavey through
one link just behind the weak one caught
jhe barb of the curved cant-hook through
an other link beyond the yawning bit of
iron seized the handle at the top which
rose to the level of his eyes and applied
his weight to the lever

  he wjt not a second too soon for the
yawning link dropped off even as he
grasped the peavey handle broken at its
sharpest curve where it fitted into its
brother

  tod gulped and his skin seemed to con-
tract all over his body as he saw that hap-
pen but an instant later he exulted as he
found that his weight applied to the leve-
rage which the peavey gave him was more
than sufficient to hold the broken chain-
and even to draw its ends closer together
now if he could manage to draw it far
enough so that he could join the ends of
the new chain-

  he bit his lip and cried out you dog-
gone fool youve got to use both hands
to snap that link on

  he held tight and pondered then he
brought the handle of his peavey down
toward the boom crooked one knee over it
and tentatively tried holding it that way
he found that it was possible and began
to see his way clear to making the con-
nection he dragged his anvil forward
with some idea of using it later and bent
his body toward the boom-end

  the movement gave him a frightful
thrill of alarm for as he shifted his weight
forward the peavey-handle came up too
and almost took him off his balance to

keep his advantage he must put his weight
well to the end of the handle and to do
this and reach the dangling ends of the
chain-well it simply couldnt be done
that was all

  he must hold the boom himself with
this realization a huge weight seemed to
settle down upon tods shoulders the
logs ground and bumped the boom seemed
to rise like an avalanche of wood the river

leaped and tore
at the lxom
the lxom wav-
ered in eccen-
tric curves
from shore to
shore blood
seemed to start
from his fin-
ger-tips then
they grew cold
the darkness fell and with it a chill of
frost he shivered as his warm blood
cooled after the strenuous log-running he
had done and he settled to his vigil

  along toward midnight tod roused him-
self from a sort of creeping stupor of cold
and fumbled in his blouse for slims mit-
ten it would keep one of his hands from
freezing anyway

 here rip he thought he heard
something rip out here

  long afterwards it seemed hours tod
was brought from another stupor by the
soft patter of toenails on wood the steps
were irregular hesitant he reached down
for his useless rifle

  sounds like a porky he muttered
sleepily then he cried out letting the
rifle fall rip

  it was the dog in the darkness tod
could not see him but he knew that the
airedale was sorely hurt no sound of
whining told him for rip did not whine
nor yelp he was a thoroughbred he
knew first from the dogs hesitation his
creeping approach and then when he
reached down one numb hand to the dogs
muzzle iris fingers touched a sticky sub-
stance caked all over the dogs head it
was blood carefully he coaxed rip close
and hooking his knee firmly about the
peavey-handle with one hand beneath it
as he had done off and on during the vigil
he felt over the dog for broken bones
rip winced when he touched one forefoot
but he sat on his haunches and allowed his
master to examine the blood-clotted leg
without jerking away

  tod took out his bandanna dipped it in
the water and began sopping the blood

from rips wounds the water was icy
and it was that helped to stanch the flow
of blood from the raking scratches of
bears claws it made tods numb hands
still more numb he took off the mitten
the better to work over rip and the mo-
ment he laid it on the boom rip sniffed at
it and gave a sharp bark

  as if the dog had spoken human lan-
guage tod answered him husky with cold
and excitement

  yes rip thats slims mitten slims
you understand  slim is down river-
that way he gestured in the darkness
rip take it to slim

  the dog got to his feet tod fumbled
for a match and lighted it with some diffi-
culty pointing down river he repeated
his first half-hysterical command more
firmly

  slim curtin he said down that
way take it to slim take it

  the dogs eyes gleamed in the match-
light his ears came up-one of them rag-
ged and torn

  tod moaned but he knew that his pity
must be hidden he must only command
he must send this battle-scarred pal of his
five weary miles down the river trail to
bring help

  he thrust the mitten toward rips muz-
zle rip sniffed it again then quietly
opened his jaws and took it and with a
look that was at once understanding and
reproach he turned and with his tail wag-
ging trotted back toward shore

  the darkness swallowed him up and it
hid also something very much like tears
in tod raines eyes they were not tears
of weakness though his hands were so
numb he could scarcely close the fingers
and his neck ached from the strain of hold-
ing to the peavey-handle and his wet feet
and legs were stiff and chilled to the bone

  it was breaking dawn when two men
strolled up the river trail behind them
limping a dejected sore-footed airedale
who now and then stopped to lick at a
great raking rip in the skin of one fore-leg
and to shake off drops of blood from a
torn ear they made for the shack on the
shore set back in a little clump of balsams
the boom was hidden from them for a
short distance on the trail

  cant see that anythins wrong spoke
slim curtin looking out over the clear
flow of the river which was visible to
them the booms held all right or the
rainyd be alive with logs but i figger
i dropped that mitten here and the dog
must have been back here after i left to

   

pick it up and something sure happened to

that dog and-

  whats that out there slim

  well i swan

  the man who asked the question a
powerful young man with an air of capa-
bility about him a square chin but humor-
ous lips kindly keen gray eyes broke into
a run and leaped onto the boom a brist-
ling figure sprang past him it was rip
suddenly alert forgetful of his own trou-
bles as his eye caught sight of his master

  it took the combined strength of boss
whitney and slim curtin to unlock tod
raines clenched hands from about his
peavey-handle

  gosh hes a strong kid exclaimed
slim lots of power in those hands
strong is right ejaculated boss whit-
ney bending closer over the clenched
hands as slim with a quick grasp of the
situation took tods place at the peavey-
lever those hands are frozen stiff

tod was revived by the warm tongue
of a dog who answered to the name of

rip he was ly-
ing in his bunk
his hands curi-
ously detached
from himself it
seemed he
looked down at
them they were
as red as fire
but he felt no
sensation from
them the quer-
ulous thought came to him that he ought
to scold those hands they ought not to
be here they should be out in mid-boom
wrapped tightly about the smooth cold
handle of a peavey

  he coughed the convulsion hurt him
he moved his arms and the hands with
them like lumps of lead attached to his
wrists

  rip h-e-ererip

  the dog reared on his hind feet and
laid his forefeet across tods chest with
a quick human-like up-tilt of his head
he seemed to be reassuring his master

  doggone dog you did you take it
to slim

  at this moment slim appeared and be-
hind him boss whitney tod came to full
consciousness with a rush he sat wildly
up in his bunk

  the boom he cried the boom
crook knee joe cut the chain i went
after rip to kill that bear and he cut the
chain


short stories

  boss wliitney came over and took one
of tods helpless hands in his own at
the touch sharp needles seemed to strike
through the member he winced

  boss whitney smiled so you can feel
it eh well i guess theyll be all right
then thought they might be frozen
worse how long did you hang onto that
peavey handle son

  what time is it countered tod
well its past noon now but it was
only five oclock this morning when rip
brought us up here

  about twelve hours then i guess
tod answered the question the boss had
asked then i-the boom-i let go

after all that and the boom-

  the boom is all right slim and i put
in two new connections and slim cant
figure out yet how you managed to hold
the old one together with a link gone en-
tirely

  tod sat up and told them he did not
attempt to excuse himself for going on
the bears trail for rip

  well tod raine spoke boss whit-
ney when tod had finished his story i
guess you realize you ought not to have
left the boom at all im not going to

reprimand you however because tod
 man without a human weakness is
worth much-if there is such a man your
devotion to your dog was part and parcel
with your sense of obligation to hold that
boom if it killed you and you held it
thats enough for me i tell slim here
that a chain is often stronger than its
weakest link looks-and i believe that i
want to take you down river with me and
give you a real mans job-even more of
a mans job than guarding boom one
im going to put you on duty as head
watchman at the new dam you and
rip

  yes sir gulped tod yes sir i
guess im cured of that weakness of mine
-i mean nothing could get me to leave my
post again for a minute

  i know it smiled boss whitney

  and ive got to cure rip of his weak-
ness too tod added if hes going on
the new job with me hes got to learn
to leave bears tracks alone and stay with
me

  i think rip has learned that already
chuckled boss whitney judging from
his looks

  rip rolled a solemn eye in his direction

the ghost of the
golconda

a story in two parts
by william n vaile
 part i 

    haunted by a mystery of the past stirring with the politics of the
    present the mining town of gold creek greeted young george frisbee
    when he arrived there seeking election as attorney-general and
    past and present were to be strangely merged before the ghost gold
    of the golconda mine became for him real gold warm friendly and
    full of promise and before the pioneer spirit of the town be-
    came fully translated into terms of law order and justice

chapter i

a delayed return

eorge frisbee shuddered
as his native village came in
sight beside the rocky banks of
gold creek

  the mere scenery of the
days journey scenery which he well re-
membered and which he had long wished
yet feared to behold again had made him
profoundly depressed in other places he
loved the great rugged mountains green
and red below where the pine forests were
gashed by granite and sandstone cliffs
bald and white above where patches of last
winters snow still remained in the high
clefts to mingle with the first covering of
approaching winter

  but in the last few miles these moun-
tains had had eyes black empty sightless
eyes scores of them the long-abandoned
prospect holes of forgotten pioneers eyes
looking silently and sadly upon the traveler
	s

 until the train passed out of their range
 when a new group would immediately take
 up the vigil beyond the next curve

   george frisbee reputed a very matter-
 of-fact young man a lawyer with fine sen-
 sibilities perhaps but certainly not usually
 a creature of dreams or fancies had lapsed
 into a settled melancholy his mood was
 a vague and general sense of tragedy and
 sorrow

   a slight jolt and an almost impercepti-
 ble shifting of his own weight as the train
 started down the mountain side toward the
 town huddling in the bottom of the lofty
 bowl and then came the thing which he
 had been subconsciously fighting off the
 thrill of distinct and red and horrid mem-
 ory-his father lying with his head
 against the wall of that very building yon-
 der a smoking pistol falling from his hand
 blood running from his mouth and stain-
 ing his shirt curses on his lips the
 curses ceased as the boy threw himself
 sobbing on the mans breast then came


short stories

the last words thrown brokenly at a tall
man who stood in the doorway of the
building opposite holding another pistol

  you aint got me gass dubonnet you
cant get me ill stay right with you till
i get my rights rights rights dye
hear rights for my wife and kid

  that was more than nineteen years ago
and his mother had taken him away a few
days later he had never returned to
jamestown when he had had business
there he had sent his partner griswold
but a thousand times in the intervening
years his minds eye had reconstructed that
moment once in the last few weeks he
had met in the streets of the capital a tall
old man with a pointed beard who had
looked curiously at him in a startled man-
ner it could hardly have been the same
tall man and yet-there had been some-
thing grimly reminiscent about him

  now with the very street spread before
him george frisbee not only visualized the
tragic event of long ago he heard and felt
it felt and tasted the salt red mixture of
his fathers blood and his own tears felt
his fathers hand clutching fiercely at him
felt the quick throbs of the mans heart
and the one last hard desperate heave of
his breast

  he shuddered then pulled himself erect
in his seat he had work to do in this
town work which was important at least
to him work which called for a pleasing
appearance and a cheerful and confident
manner he was there to inspire confi-
dence in himself

  for george frisbee aged twenty-seven
was a candidate for the office of attorney-
general election was only three weeks off
and this old colorado mining camp seedy

and moribund was still the heart of the
opposition and the residence of his oppo-
nent with a tremendous effort of will
he shook himself out of his morbid mood
and braced himself to assume the character
of his part

  his own name greeted him from a pos-
ter on the station wall grand political
rally court house october th 
p m hon george frisbee candidate for
attorney-general and best local speakers
and here on the platform were residents
of jamestown whom he had seen occa-
sionally at the capital

  hello mr frisbee in on time i
see

  all set for the meeting going to have
a good crowd

  yes said a third voice everybody be-
ing out of work they can afford to waste
an hour

  the last speaker grinning with a slightly
malicious expression proved to be kene-
han the district attorney frisbees oppo-
nent in the present race

  thats ail right charlie ill give em
something to talk about and thats more
than youve been able to do

  guffaws of mountain laughter greeted
this sally and frisbee was introduced
around

  heres judge dunaway hell be your
chairman hes lived here forever guess
he founded jamestown

  judge dunaway a lanky round-should-
ered middle-aged giant with an unkempt
grayish beard extended his hand

  well well georgie frisbee welcome
home reckon you dont remember me
but i remember you a serious-faced bare-
footed kid and i remember your mother
and-and your dad

  the last was spoken as if he had men-
tally questioned whether to say it and then
had decided to let the words come as orig-
inally framed

  another mental surge of the ancient
scene almost staggered frisbee as he
grasped the older mans hand his eye
involuntarily turned to a place a block up
the street dunaway was holding him
with a sort of deliberate and intensive
friendliness sensing a momentary em-
barrassment he added sorry youve been
away so long always wanted to know
you after youd grown up

  next to the station kenehan was talk-
ing with another little group one said
with sneering lip hes too much like his
dad to be any good the young upstart
thinks he can coddle this town now at

                                                   
the ghost of the golconda



election time after hes been too good for
it for twenty years

  dunaway catching the voice but diplo-
matically ignoring the words turned pleas-
antly toward the speaker

  slade he said i want you to know
mr frisbee hell probably be the next
attorney-general but anyway well have
one from this little old burg of james-
town

  frisbee extended his hand well he
remarked of course i agree with judge
dunaway glad to meet you mr slade
say frisbee said kenehan dont
forget that slade is the coroner up here
hes been burying your party so many
years now that he just naturally cant get
out of the habit

  well come to our meeting boys re-
turned dunaway youll find us very
much alive and george you wont find
all the people or even all the county offi-
cers against us heres sheriff bates and
his boy mr bates shake hands with mr
frisbee mr billy bates mr frisbee
billys only eighteen but if kenehan dont
watch him close hes likely to slip a ballot
for you into the box

  nix on that judge protested the grin-
ning youth im an officer of the law i
am but ill bet i can get a few votes
for any candidate that you are for

  the judge escorted frisbee up the street
toward the hotel stopping at frequent in-
tervals to introduce his charge among
some of the old-timers there seemed to be
an undercurrent of hostility or resentment
which dunaway breezily disregarded as-
suming that the person introduced would be
glad to meet the next attorney-general
several times the question why have-
nt you ever come to see us before was
put in one form or another and it was a
rather awkward one guess youve been
too busy making money in the city was
an occasional comment in connection with
the question

  no i cant say ive made much money
laughed frisbee in response to such a re-
mark from old dad postlewaite at the
hardware store i always thought the
mountains were the place to find gold
well its all ghost-gold now nothin
but memories like everything else in this
place gee youre a memory yourself
i think its memories that have kept
george away said the judge quietly then
added hastily come along george
therell be folks at the hotel i want you
to meet most everybody in town comes
there to dinner drop in at our meeting


dad the boyll show you how he can
trot

  postlewaite looked after them reflect-
ively just the double of his father
if hed had a whisky breath and a flannel
shirt id a sworn it was jack frisbee
walkin the streets to get gass dubonnet
like he said he would

  he glanced up past the end of the street
to where at the foot of the mountain a
mile and a half beyond the town stood a
great bare weatherbeaten structure the
fall air was chill and raw presaging a com-
ing storm postlewaite shivered again and
turned into his store where he kicked
open the stove door and added two stout
chunks of wood to the fire dreary
haunty place up there he soliloquized
thats where jack frisbees ghost is if
hes anywhere this side of hell

  dunaway was saying to the young man
slades been getting the town sore about
you because you havent been back and
hes been digging up old stories about your
dad i knew your father well boy and
liked him youre certainly the breathing
picture of him dont get peeved at these
old codgers their point of view has got
twisted in the last twenty years theyre
always thinking of the old busy feverish
times and it makes em bitter to see the
place so dead an then since you havent
been here they havent had any chance to
know you and theyve all been hearing
the other side of the story for a long time
he paused and looked at the mill

  i must say he never tells the story
himself he lives up there all alone
he

  yes gaspard dubonnet i feel sorry
for him too do-do you mind my talk-
ing about him

  no no go ahead said george with
the fascinated horror of a child i want
to hear

  well you remember-no i guess you
dont-what a gay
spark he used to
be always had
plenty of money
always slinging it
around always
spending it like
water but never
spending it for
water every
mine promoter
every drummer every politician used
to know him well he knew all the
big ones he and senator lamson were
great cronies lamson used to say that

gass was the est drinker an the best pis-
tol-shot an the best engineer he ever
knew and he was right all round the
senator used to come up here to j amestown
to go on sprees an then hed stay with
dubonnet till hed slept off his jag

  hot old days they were lxy he con-
tinued as they turned in at the hotel he
glanced from the hall into the lobby no-
body here yet well we can chat a few
minutes i like to talk about those good
old bad old times when everybody had
money an liquor the old saddle rock
saloon never closed its doors from one
years end to another and when miners up
the gulch would get their months pay
theyd make a bee line for the saddle rock
and theyd never leave till their last cent

tom slade the coroner-would stake em
to enough to get back to the mines after
theyd passed all their money to him over
the bar or played it on his roulette wheel

  the miners at the end of each month
and some rich daily customers like gass
dubonnet and senator lamson and your
-and twenty or thirty other chaps like
em-made jim slade a rich man at
night when gass dubonnet and lamson
and some of their gang werent playing the
wheel or playing poker in some other gam-
bling joint theyd be singing and carousing
over at slades or down the line at mag
lovejoys

  lord i wonder now when we boys ever
slept we all lived so fast youd think
wed have just naturally burned out-and
now we live so awful slow that i dont sup-
pose well ever get through living

  most of the old gangs gone now
j im slade finally took to drinking himself
and died of delirium tremens even before
the town died old mag lovejoys still
alive and still here runs a miners board-
ing house now though she aint got many
boarders people have almost forgotten
she didnt used to be respectable not to
say she wouldnt still bootleg a little for
you

  and shell still show you a hole right
in the eye of a picture of buffalo bill
gass dubonnet shot that hole with one of
those old french duelling pistols-excuse
me boy i forget-

  thats all right go ahead please

  well its nothing anyway except a re-
markable stunt gass dubonnet shot that
hole just to show he could he drilled it
so neat in the middle of the eye that youd
hardly know it was there but thats only

half of it he was standing with the other
pistol in his left hand and-i know you
wont believe this but i saw it myself-he
plunked just exactly the same kind of a
hole in buffalo bills other eye

  the judge whistled reminiscently at the
exploit and then changed the course of his
remarks

  well im left and dad postlewaite
and half a dozen of us old no-account fel-
lows that were only second-rate sports in
the old days maybe thats the reason
were still allive we havent had pep
enough or money enough to get away
but that aint the reason gass dubonnet
has stayed hes always thought there
was gold still in the old golconda he
isnt the owner at that hes just a sort
of volunteer manager with a half-interest
for life hes managed to raise money-
god knows how but mostly by selling the
machinery i believe-to redeem the old
judgments and to pay the taxes hes
never taken out an ounce of gold in a
dozen years as far as i know sometimes
youll see the old man puttering round up
there and even running out a car of loose
rock by hand he buys a little powder
occasionally and everybody knows hes
tapping and drilling around in the old
stopes

  here lately hes kind of thawed out
a little we think hes got somebody in
the city interested with him enough to
give him an occasional stake he goes
down every couple of weeks or so and he
seems to have a little money but until
lately wed hardly see the old fellow from
one months end to another hed get
some canned stuff and some bacon and a
little powder and caps and just hide him-
self in the mine and in the old mill ive
been up there occasionally-im about the
only man in town that goes there-and hes
friendly enough to me but at that he aint
exactly what youd call hospitable when
he aint puttering in the mine hes reading
one end of the old mill rooms his kitchen
and the others his bed-room and library
and books-you just ought to see em
theres been a new box of em at the sta-
tion for him every two or three months as
long as i can remember and more of em
lately than before last time i was up
there he was reading one on spiritualism

 dunaway paused for a moment and
stroked his ragged beard he looked at
frisbee thoughtfully

  he talked about spiritualism last time
i was up there he resumed reflectively
taking his eyes from his companions face

                                                    to
the ghost of the golconda



and looking vacantly into space i guess
im the only man he ever talks to at all
confidentially an that aint very much
but he does come to see two women two
very different women one of ems old
mag lovejoy and the other is-is miriam
packer

  packer packer

  yes the school-maam-one of em
why i guess probably you might remem-
ber her she was a little kid when-lets
see she must be just about your age

  a little red-headed girl with a long
mouth and great big staring blue eyes
well-er yes leastwise shes red-
headed all right enough and she does have
rather a long mouth but i dont think her
eyes are any bigger than ordinary

  they were big however in the recollec-
tion of george frisbee for it was made up
of several principal impressions there
was the childs horrified look when he had
put a little garter snake in her desk at
school there was a wide stare of right-
eous indignation which she had habitually
directed at him for several weeks after
that and there was a still more horrified
stare on that last terrible day

  that last look burned in his memory
now but the burning was eased by the
words which had accompanied it awkward
childish tender words she had run to
him and his father as they lay together in
the street run apparently without fear

she had put her
hands on the boys
shoulder

  georgie she
had faltered dear
georgie im so
sorry and her
compassionate eyes
had been like great
blue marbles under
their wide-open
lids

  and those same eyes looked at him now
from the hallway of the little hotel eyes
wide with astonishment the young wom-
an liad paused apparently to nod to judge
dunaway the nod stopped half way as
she saw the judges companion

  miss parker said dunaway do you
remember george frisbee

  is it really george frisbee gasped
the girl well i declare you did give me
a shock i thought i had seen a ghost
the big blue eyes turned downward in
confusion and her face reddened as she
realized what she had said
to

chapter ii

a storm brewing

dunaway broke the embarrass-
ment by making his customary
boast about his candidate

  george has grown a lot in every way
since you two knew each other as kids
now hes come up here to talk you into
voting for him it ought not to be a hard
job but come to his meeting this afternoon
anyway

  i should be glad to come and i shall
probably be able to i expect to let school
out early so that the children who live up
the gulch can get home mr suggs the
bus-man says theres a bad storm coming
and that its already snowing hard in the
canyon

  dunaway whistled softly and looked out
of the window a few large flakes were
falling on the sidewalk

  george im afraid this means good-by
to your meeting at summit i guess you
could make it up there all right even if
miss packer is nervous about her kids but
if we get one of our real good heavy early
snowstorms you couldnt get back better
make your plans to enjoy the hospitality of
your native town tonight

  well frisbee replied i hope i can
get to summit because i promised the peo-
ple there that id come up

  well well see you can call em up
by phone after your meeting here theres
the dining-room open lets go in

  miriam packer it appeared was accus-
tomed on schooldays to take her dinner
at the hotel she lived in an old house at
the lower end of the narrow town which
spread never more than three blocks wide
and most of the way only one block wide
through the long narrow basin which the
crowding mountains grudgingly gjranted
the creek at this place

  on frisbees inquiry she told him that
her parents were both dead she rented
the lower story of her house to a married
couple and lived in the upper story with
the other teacher of the little school this
other girl she said had been confined to
the house for several days

  dunaway sat at one side of frisbee and
miriam packer at the other and although
the young man was introduced to the other
noon boarders across the red tablecloth he
found all his attention concentrating upon
the girl

  when she was leaving to go back to the
school he went to the doorway to help her
into her coat-rather a shabby coat he


short stories

  thought-and her long mouth curved into
  a delightful smile as she buttoned the collar
  tightly around her throat was she pretty 
  it was hard to say no probably not

her features were
too large to be
pretty too irregu-
lar to be hand-
some and yet
somehow it was
a beautiful face
certainly it was
a sweet face a
most winsome
face a strong
face and-a good face

    frisbee saw dunaway smiling broadly
  from the side of the table and in momen-
  tary embarrassment he stepped out of
  range beyond the door

    i mustnt keep you miss-miriam he
  said since youre going now in order that
  i may see more of you today but- he
  glanced out of the window where the snow
  was now driving before the wind in small
  steady flakes i dont believe ill be able
  to go to summit tonight and-

    oh but george you must go it
 means votes doesnt it george im so
 anxious for you to be elected she looked
 down in sudden confusion good-by
 she said hurriedly i must run

    dunaway chuckled as frisbee returned
  to his coffee and his dried-apple pie the
  others at the table were grinning broadly

    must say youre a fast worker boy
  he remarked but nobody can blame
  you miriam packers just about the nic-
   est little lady i ever knew but youll have
  some competition from the home boys
  theres her cousin henry for instance

    henrys certainly been pretty busy over
  there lately remarked one of their table
  companions apparently it was not at all
  out of order to discuss a ladys personal
  affairs at the hotel dining table

    and mort caythorne said another

    in the midst of his growing resentment
  it dawned upon frisbee that this forgotten
  little town was a sort of family in which
  the intimate concerns of each were the in-
  timate concerns of all

     i dont think shes given caythorne very
  much encouragement said one of the
  group

    well hes one of the home folks any-
  way shes known him since he was a
  boy

    the speaker glanced at frisbee with a
  look in which there was a half-hidden inti-
  mation that he was an unjustified inter-

loper a tight little family this it was
evidently necessary that he should estab-
lish his own title to membership in it

  i may say that i knew miss packer my-
self when i was a boy he remarked quiet-
ly and sought to change the subject
snow coming down quite steadily now
yes and blowing awful mean said the
man at the end of the table looking toward
the window thatll make it kind of un-
pleasant for another of miriams beaus
the old man o the mill

  well gass doesnt call there every
single night

  no but he generally calls after each of
his trips to the city brings her a present
i suppose looking at frisbee to enjoy his
discomfiture an i dont think he called
after he got back yesterday so hell prob-
ably come tonight

  frisbee could stand no more of this
stuff he rose quickly and strode through
the hotel waiting room where he savagely
bit off the end of a cigar and stood in an-
gry disgust contemplating the dreary scene
without

  guffaws of laughter sounded from the
dining room but he scarcely noticed as
two sentences were ringing in his ears
one from long ago and one from the im-
mediate present

  georgie dear georgie im so sorry
george im so anxious for you to be
elected

chapter iii

transmigration 

by the time set for the afternoon
meeting it was evident that fris-
bee could not proceed to the next
town and dunaway telephoned to the
chairman there to cancel the speaking en-
gagement however the jamestown meet-
ing was promising the room of the dis-
trict court was fairly well filled in spite
of the weather when judge dunaway
tapped for order at three oclock

  fellow citizens he began we shall
listen this afternoon to a native son of
jamestown mr george frisbee as a lit-
tle boy was favorably known to us old-
timers of the mountains as a man he is
favorably known to the whole state and
has become the candidate of a great po-
litical party for the office of attorney-
general one of the most important in the
gift of the people

  while he was speaking frisbees eyes
searched the audience to find miriam
packer he was thinking of what he

                                                        
the ghost of the golconda



could say to her rather than of what he
could say to the others he did not lo-
cate her at first probably because the rear
of the courtroom was rather dark but as
his gaze roved the chamber he felt a rather
uncomfortable sensation as if it were be-
ing drawn to a particular spot

 the compulsion seemed to grow
stronger

  at last like the final spring of a piece of
steel to a magnet his glance jumped to the
place which had been drawing it the spot
was the piercing black-eyed gaze of a man
in the back row of his audience

  the impression was only of those eyes
deep and sad and inscrutable and yet
they seemed not unfriendly except for
the fire hidden in their depths they some-
what resembled the prospect holes which
from the mountain sides had watched each
mile of his advance into this fastness
weirdly they held his own with a power
he could not shake off they seemed to
penetrate his soul there was some mes-
sage-some inquiry inquiry well an
inquiry or a demand they seemed to call
for some concession

  in some strange way their expression
changed a little as he gazed into them
those eyes like the black muzzles of a pair
of pistols were demanding that he surren-
der something some secret secret his
own eyes flashed back the return lie had
no secrets his life was an open book

  with this establishment of communica-
tion he felt his own strength returning
like that of a man who sinking in a quick-
sand should suddenly feel a rocky ledge
lieneath his feet the others gaze left
him for a moment and he xealized that
dunaway had turned toward him and with
an introducing gesture of his right hand
was summoning him to arise and greet his
former townsmen what dunaway had
said after his opening paragraph had been
completely lost to frisbee but a very con-
siderable salvo of applause marked the con-
clusion of the introductory speech and the
rising of the visiting speaker the clapping
no doubt being generously intended for
both men

  as frisbee rose lie felt his feet slip-
ping from the ledge into the quicksands
those pistol points must be aimed at him
again he must fight this out somehow
his voice sounded husky to himself as he
began friends and fellow-citizens-he
cleared his throat- and i am proud to
say fellow-townsfolk- those eyes
those eyes they were drawing him with
an unearthly power his feet were on the
very brink of the sustaining ledge if he
could only find some other support ah a
saving idea a simple idea

  it is so long since we have had a chance
to see each other he continued and the
storm has made it so dark in this room
that i wish some one who knows where the
switch is would be good enough to turn on
the light besides i want to show you
that politics is really not a dark subject at
ajl

  with the appreciative titter which greet-
ed this mild sally the room was flooded
with light and george frisbee found him-
self normal capable and smiling before a
smiling audience his nightmare was past
the ghosts and goblins of the twilight
seemed to have departed

  there thats better he remarked
glancing with approval at the new chande-
lier whose stout prongs of shining brass
decorated the center of the room it
reminds me that the principal business of
the legal department of the state the prin-
cipal business of your attorney-general is
to let the light into dark places the busi-
ness of that office is to discover and sup-
press graft and extortion and to see that
people are protected in their rights

  he looked voluntarily now to find the
eyes which had watched him from the back
row and saw a tall elderly gentleman with
iron gray hair brushed back in smooth
waves from a splendid broad forehead
the man was sitting very erect he wore
a neatly trimmed pointed beard and long
upturned mustaches which wlere almost
white above the beard rose a strong
aquiline nose those compelling eyes
were deep-set under shaggy brows they
seemed now to be burning like live coals


o

short stories

it was the face of a mystic a dreamer pos-
sibly a fanatic

  frisbee paused again almost shivered
as he confronted those eyes once more
but with cruelly intensified vividness the
old scene flashed before his mind as he
realized that he was looking into the face
of gaspard dubonnet his fathers slayer

  the audience awaiting his next words
shifted uneasily in their seats some fol-
lowed his gaze to the rear of the room
there was a whispering here and there

  frisbee realizing that the pause was be-
coming awkward endeavored to recover
himself by repeating his last word

  rights he said-dubonnets wide eyes
had narrowed in their deep caverns and he
was stroking his beard with long sensitive
fingers like an artists-rights are what
most of us think of in our relations to
other people and to the government

  it was strange indeed that he hadnt
seen miriam packer in the hall until that
very moment especially strange because
she was right beside gaspard dubonnet
in the back row the sight gave him an
odd pang which was closely akin to jeal-
ousy but which helped to steady him from
his own spiritual vertigo dubonnet
stopped stroking his beard and appeared
as if about to rise from his chair the girl
passed her hand inside his arm and said
something to him then-she looked at
frisbee and smiled

  the speaker continued and as his speech
gathered force he felt that the crowd was
more and more with him

  miriams face was aglow with delight
and satisfaction she smiled a benedic-
tion at the speaker and he felt his spirit
expanding under the warmth of her en-
couragement half turning to spread his
thought to other parts of the audience he
caught the eyes of slade and kenehan the
latter thoughtful the former contemptu-
ous he would
win at least
their secret
tribute

  our sturdy
pioneers o f
these m o u n-
tains well un-
derstood that
rights depend
upon duties
they under-
stood that jus-
tice means self-restraint that if men
should be permitted to take the law into
their own hands there would soon be no

law that if each individual should be al-
lowed to enforce his own rights there
would soon come a time when no one would
have any rights to enforce

  their peace their industry their prop-
erty their mines were too precious to be
left to the haphazard and arbitrary adjust-
ment of the six-shooter and the sawed-off
shotgun they must have the machinery
for an orderly adjustment of their dis-
putes an adjustment without passion or
violence

  there were indeed times when our own
pioneers forgot their creed of law-
confound it why should his eyes be drawn
again to those burning coals in the rear of
the house the rest of the audience be-
gan to sense the strange duel people
turned and looked from frisbee to du-
bonnet from dubonnet to frisbee

  frisbee concluded his sentence rather
lamely-but those times happily are
past

  turning his glance by a strong effort of
will to the faces of others in the crowd
frisbee was disturbed by an expression of
uneasiness almost of alarm which he not-
ed here and there among the older men
and on the face of one elderly woman
dad postlewaites mouth was open and his
countenance registered something akin to
both fascination and fear as he stared at
the speaker nor was that expression
changed it was rather enhanced when
frisbee deliberately smiled at him as if
terrified by the smile postlewaite shrank
into his collar and then suddenly turned
around looking at dubonnet in the back
of the hall tbither frisbee looked again
and then there came a diversion while he
stood silent upon the platform dubonnet
rose suddenly and went to the rear door
there he turned for a moment and looked
fixedly at frisbee with every nerve
tense george steadied himself to return
the stare unflinchingly

  the audience was greatly but silently
excited men rose in their seats and
gripped the backs of their chairs looking
first at one and then at the other of the
two apparently hypnotized men strange-
ly again the consciousness was borne upon
frisbee that there was no hostility in the
compelling gaze of the other man-merely
soul-searching question insistent desper-
ate inquiry or demand

  suddenly dubonnet lifted his head
proudly bowed to frisbee and abruptly
passed out

  the audience caught its breath with re-
lief frisbee felt faint he swayed

                                                     
the ghost of the golconda



slightly resting his hand on the edge of
the speakers table to steady himself

  suddenly his eye caught miriam pack-
ers she looked almost wistful fris-
bee in his turn felt a sort of childish yearn-
ing to lean on this woman for support
and now he seemed to get the support
from her eyes he spurred himself to
continue his speech and then decided that
it would be better to conclude it

  my friends he said sometimes i am
flooded with a rush of old memories of
this town where i lived as a child there
was a slight murmur throughout the audi-
ence i really came up here to get ac-
quainted with you not to make speeches
to you i believe i have nothing more to
say from this platform but i hope you
will remain and let me mingle with you
and chat with you

  the simple friendliness of it was effect-
ive people who had sensed some strain
without knowing what it was suddenly
clapped their hands in generous applause

  and some of them did remain to greet
him these were mostly the younger peo-
ple but while they were shaking his
hand frisbee his nerves still tense and
his senses still sharpened by this after-
noons struggle overheard some scraps of
whispered conversation near him

  did you see what gass dubonnet
saw came the hoarse sibilants of dad
postlewaite no wonder he left he
saw jack frisbees ghost-an so did i-
an i aint sure that i dont see it now
lets go

  and soon the few people who remained
were drifting toward the rear of the hall

  frisbee felt dunaways hand on his
shoulder its all right boy you did
your best and it was good too but
there was a spell in the air today gass
dubonnet brought it with him i think
he was here but he was years away from
us he looked just like he did the last
time i talked to him at the mill i remem-
ber he asked me then if i believed in the
transmigration of souls

  well ive got to go to my office for a
few minutes see you this evening
george

chapter iv
i beg to be excused

miriam packer had come for-
ward to the place where frisbee
was standing near the platform
s le had been talking to dunaway and he
turned back to her for a moment before

leaving all right he said in just a
few minutes

  she smiled at the judge and turned to
frisbee she invited him to supper
with herself and her school-teacher com-
panion frisbee assured her that he was
very glad indeed that it had been found ne-
cessary to call off the meeting at summit

  well im sorry said miriam be-
cause i believe each of these public meet-
ings is important in your campaign but
im glad too because i want to visit with
you ill see you about six-thirty i must
be off now  have one little matter of
business to attend to before supper

  she gave him a roguish smile at that as

if the matter of
business c o n-
cerned him
george guessed
that it involved
a visit to the
butcher shop

  he spent the
next two hours
in very pleasant
anticipa-
tion queer he thought how he had al-
ways had in his mind a picture of a girl
who looked just like miriam packer

  miriams house was typical of james-
town construction its lower floor front-
ing on the narrow street which bordered
the creek consisted of two rooms- one be-
side the other its upper floor reached by
a stairway up the steep hillside consisted
of four rooms the two rear ones burrow-
ing back into the hill the two front ones
perched over the lower story at this par-
ticular part of the gulch there were no
houses higher up and the side windows of
miriams rear rooms the sloping ground
reaching almost to their sills commanded
a view of the hillside for a considerable
distance both ways

  miss chapin was a sweet-faced girl
charming and cultivated though rather col-
orless george thought by comparison with
miriam but she had a bright and pleas-
ing style of conversation she had trav-
eled more than miriam who had never
been about at all and she had a somewhat
wider superficial knowledge of the world
though frisbee was more impressed by
miriams keenness and soundness of judg-
ment

  the evening meal passed very pleasantly
indeed miss chapin excused herself soon
afterward saying that she had been suffer-
ing for several days with a severe cold

  miriam sketched her own history

oi


short stories

briefly for george frisbee her father
had died ten years previously he was at
that time the sole owner of the golconda
mine which however had pinched out and
suspended operations five years before that
gaspard dubonnet her fathers engineer
and manager was granted by his will a
half interest in the property and its pro-
ceeds for life she was glad of that be-
cause it had given the old man a place to
live

  and he insists she said that the
property will yet make us both rich

  frisbee was searching his memory for a
remark which his father had made and
which his mother had occasionally repeated
finally it returned to him my father al-
ways said that his fortune was under the
big tree just below the golconda shaft-
house did my father have any interest
in the golconda

  well of course he did at one time
he was the locator of the original claim
that was the beginning of his quarrel with
mr dubonnet

  yes i know

  but mr dubonnet has been so good to
me and he is so quiet and retired now
and so self-sacrificing i really believe
that at times he hasnt had enough to eat
he sold all the machinery at the mine and
the mill and i had hard work to get him
to take half the proceeds he said that his
life interest in the property didnt include
the permanent equipment he said that
was a part of the property itself

  well he was right from a legal stand-
point

  but im quite sure that he used his
half or most of it to pay off some old
debts and to take care of the taxes ive
finally got him to promise to show me an
account of them but he says that when
the mine begins to pay again it will be time
enough to reimburse him for what he has
spent to preserve it hes very confident
that time will come soon i-i have rea-
sons to believe he is right

  she seemed about to explain further
when their conversation was interrupted by
the arrival of another guest miriams cou-
sin henry packer a shifty-eyed young
man flashily dressed who apparently had
been drinking

  young mr packer seemed surprised and
not altogether pleased to find frisbee there
but he made an effort to be affable he
conversed agreeably enough but frisbee
was at a loss to understand what there
might be in common between this supercili-

ous cheap sport and his serious sensible
cousin he gradually reached the conclu-
sion more by intuition than from anything

that was said
that there
was absolutely
nothing in
common be-
tween them ex-
cept the tie of
blood

  miriam ap-
parently took
only a perfunc-
tory interest in
his conversa-
tion and the
visitor seemed
to be getting a
trifle impatient
he appeared to be waiting for frisbee to
go the latter caught a glance of inquiry
directed toward miriam as if packer were
seeking to know when they might be rid of
the stranger

  george had no intention of allowing the
fellow to sit him out but an interruption
presently occurred which changed the situ-
ation for all three

  another visitor arrived it was gas-
pard dubonnet he was carrying a small
heavy satchel

  for just a moment before the attempt
was made to present him to this visitor
frisbee saw miriam glance with a sort of
apprehension at the satchel and then at
henry packer and he saw henry pack-
er look for an instant at the satchel and
then turn his face away from the others
with a covert half-smile what did it
mean what was the confidence involv-
ing a lack of confidence which existed be-
tween these people

  then he looked at dubonnet the old
man was standing very erect dignified un-
smiling so he must have looked thought
george frisbee when he slew his father
twenty years ago so he did look in
george frisbees memory as his childish
eyes had turned from his fathers pros-
trate form to the doorway of the saloon
across the street

  a wave of repulsion seized him filled
him with sudden nausea

  he was dimly conscious that miriam was
speaking mr frisbee let me present
my old friend mr dubonnet

  before him was dubonnets extended
hand frisbee remembered afterward that
that hand with its long thin delicate fin-
gers was trembling he recoiled from the

                                                      
the ghost of the golconda



hand as if he had seen his fathers blood
upon it

  i-i beg to be excused he stammered
his eyes rested for a moment on the face
of his hostess she was very pale he
bowed stiffly to her

  in a dream he heard her say as you
wish mr frisbee

  he half groped his way to the door for
strange visions mingled themselves before
his eyes in a daze he found his hat and
overcoat he let himself out in silence
leaving silence behind him he staggered
up the street toward the hotel over-
whelmed half crushed under a surge of
conflicting emotions

  the heavy wet flakes of the driving
snow and the effort of walking in the
storm had a tendency to cool and steady
him

  he paused in the doorway of the ho-
tel to brush the snow from his coat there
turning for a moment toward the street he
saw hurrying past him one of miriam
packers visitors of the evening her cou-
sin henry that young man must have
left almost immediately after he did

  packer was swaying a little perhaps
he had taken another drink if so it
must have been from a pocket flask for he
would hardly have had time to stop any-
where he hastened unsteadily past the
hotel muttering and swearing to himself

chapter v

a shot in the night

freed from the immediate emotional
pressure under which he had left
miriam packers house and en-
deavoring to consider the situation in the
light of reason and candor frisbee was
soon blaming himself bitterly for hurting
her the matter had been beyond her con-
trol and in no wise her fault after all
the old murderer was her fathers manager
and her own partner agent and trustee
apparently she had every reason to feel
grateful to him

  she had not caused the embarrassing
meeting when it did occur what else
could she have done than she did do 

  he would find an early opportunity to
make amends he would even seek out
dubonnet and apologize to him but he
could not do it tonight he wanted to
see miriam before he saw dubonnet and
dubonnet was still at her house tomor-
row was saturday she would not be at
school tomorrow he could see her in the
morning before train time and if he had


to stay over a day to make formal apology
to the man who had robbed him of his
parent twenty years ago why he would do
that too

  in the meantime what was he here for
he was not here for a courtship certain-
ly he was not here to dig into old wounds
either of himself or others he was here
for politics he was here to make friends
he might as well forget for the present
the early misadventures of the evening and
improve the time remaining it would do
him good anyway to chat with strangers
about ordinary matters

  the pool-room  the corner above
seemed to be open buttoning his over-
coat around his throat he went out into
the storm and entered that place he
bought a cigar for himself and one also
in accordance with political custom for the
proprietor

  i was at your meeting this afternoon
said the latter you made a good talk
wish youd talked longer but i spose you
wanted to visit with folks you knew when
you were a kid

  he smiled roguishly at frisbee saw
you talking with our school maam well
i dont blame you mighty nice girl she
has my two kids and they think there just
aint anybody in the world like miss pack-
er smart girl too

  frisbee attempted to steer the talk to
politics but from state politics in which
the other seemed little interested the con-
versation slid into local politics and thence
back again to other local affairs and to lo-
cal people including the two whom fris-
bee particularly disliked to talk about but
whom he could not help thinking about

  funny said the pool-room man how
old man dubonnet got up and went out
but then nobody ever knows whats work-
ing inside that old fellows head lately
hes been making occasional calls on miss
packer about once every two or three
weeks goes to the city about that often
and calls on the girl generally the same eve-
ning after he gets back or the next da
anyhow probably its partly on business
because he always carries a little satchel
that he might have papers in odd that
he should take a notion to do that lately
lecause for years hes hardly budged out
of the mill except to buy a few provisions
some folks think the old boy has been ne-
gotiating a sale of the mine and has been
getting some money for a first payment
ecause he seems to have a little money
now and so does the girl

   and so does that chap packer her cou-


short stories

sin though he hasnt any interest in the
mine that anybody knows about he
goes to the city too hes making up to
the girl and he acts as if he was jealous of
old man dubonnet seems to think the
old fellows tryng to cut him out

  has he got so far that its a case of cut-
ting out 

  we-ell i cant say how far henrys
got but ill say he sure is attentive to the
lady young caythornes been kind of
shining up to her lately too caythornes
never seemed to care for that kind of a girl

before he must have an idea that shes
coming into a little money somehow

  and i wouldnt be surprised if old gass
didnt think hed found something in the
mine there hasnt been any engineers up
here to look it over so i dont think its
possible hes been negotiating a sale but
occasionally lately hes hired one of the
quillin boys up the creek to muck some
rock out of the old lower tunnel he
wont allow anyone else in the mine and
believe me no ones going to try to get in
without the old mans permission he
comes out with them two old long-barreled
pistols one in each hand he can shoot
just the same with either hand and like as
not hell do a little target practice just for
fun

  there was a tourist foolin around up
there last summer and old gass plugged
two holes through his hat pretty as you
please one with each pistol right or left
hand its all the same to him i aint ever
heard of his missing yet but i dont take
any chances myself some day hell go
an inch under a fellers hair instead of an
inch over it

  in the enthusiasm of his narrative the
pool-room proprietor had not noticed the
effect that the story of dubonnets marks-
manship was making on his visitor as
frisbee listened his muscles tightened and
his fists clenched automatically my
father never had a chance he was saying
to himself it was cold-blooded mur-
der

  the man behind the counter continued

youd never think to look at him that he
knew anything about shooting they say
he killed several men in duels before he
came to this country they say he killed
a man right here in this street twenty years
ago

  hey there he goes now poor old
feller he doesnt look much like a fire-
eater does he

  indeed he did not a stern ascetic old
man as the bright lights from the pool-
room window fell in his strong but sharp
and rather pinched features his fierce black
eyes seemed to pierce the storm as if they
were demanding an answer from the future
or from infinity it was a baffling face
noble yet humble savage yet refined

  frisbee mumbled something to the man
behind the cigar-case and passed out to
the deserted street he glanced at the thin
figure half a block away and was almost
tempted to follow but how fast the old
man traveled in a moment he was lost
to sight in the snow

  frisbee returned to the hotel and sat
down by the stove it would be cold in
his room in his morbid mood he dreaded
the dark and the cold

  there was something unnatural about
the old man he had just seen something
uncanny in his own relation to that man
right now he craved warmth and the com-
pany of ordinary commonplace humans
he would smoke a cigar by the stove and
get back to normal by talking politics with
the clerk and with the doctor who had
just come in and was hanging his snowy
overcoat on the back of a chair

  the stove was warm the cigar was com-
forting the clerk and the doctor if not
brilliant were at least cheerful and sensi-
ble thank goodness there was nothing
unusual or mysterious about either of these
men and whether from accident or
from some unexpected considerateness
they both refrained from talking about
gaspard dubonnet they each accepted a
cigar from frisbee as he lighted his sec-
ond

  ten minutes later the three of them
suddenly stiffened in their chairs there
was the sound of a shot muffled somewhat
by the storm but still distinct to fris-
bee it sounded as if it came from a distance
of two or three blocks

  the doctor ran to the door and looked
down the street snows coming too
thick now cant see a thing he ex-
claimed

  the clerk at his heels turned back to
answer the telephone

                                                      
the ghost of the golconda



  hello yes this is the hotel what
miriam packer who yes yes hes
here he faced quickly toward the
others

  doctor martin he called miss pack-
er has just been shot get there quick
then he spoke into the telephone with a
further inquiry but the person at the oth-
er end had hung up

chapter vi

an embarrassing mission

the announcement of the catastro-
phe perhaps a tragedy had struck
george frisbee not only with horror
and amazement but with a sudden and
overwhelming sense of frustration of per-
sonal failure

  in a rush of mixed feelings he got into
his overcoat as quickly as the doctor and
hurried out with him without asking or
thinking of asking for permission to go
he would have been much surprised if
anybody had suggested that he should not
go instinctively he felt that he should be
near her

  miriam packer shot who could pos-
sibly have wished to do an injury to that
lovable girl what enemy could she pos-
sibly have made

  ah his own failure had been that he
himself had done her an injury that very
evening and that he had not yet atoned
would he ever have a chance to atone now 
would she pass out of his world on the
very day when he had found her again
bearing with her to the unknown country
as a last thought of him the remembrance
that he had repaid her friendliness with a
cruel hurt why why had he not gone
back to her immediately with an apology
and a plea for forgiveness 

  and if he had been there through the
evening as he had expected him to be as
she had expected and wanted him to be
this monstrous and unnatural thing could
not have happened he would have pro-
tected her his churlishness had lost him
the great opportunity of his life had per-
haps cost the life of this splendid woman

  young and vigorous as he was george
frisbee was hard put to keep up with the
doctor in his rapid progress down the nar-
row street beside the creek and he was half
a dozen steps behind the physician as they
ran up the long stairway at the side of
miriam packers house miss chapin
opened the door for them before they had
a chance to ring the bell

  with the assistance of the people in the
    

downstairs part of the house she had car-
ried miriam to her bedroom after call-
ing the doctor at the hotel she had called
the sheriff but he had not yet arrived
several other people neighbors had come
in but she had asked them to remain in the
dining room until dr martin had made his
examination

  the sheriff arrived a moment later and
miss chapin gave the very brief narrative

of what had oc-
curred which
was simply that
miriam while
washing the din-
ner dishes had
been struck
down by a bul-
let fired through
the window
from the side
hill

  several men had gone out there to in-
vestigate but in the falling and drifting
snow any tracks which might have been
made by the would-be assassin were almost
instantly obliterated it had taken a few
minutes to clamber down the steep hill-
side through the snow and they could see
no one on the street except several people
running toward the packer house among
them doctor martin and mr frisbee

  here some inquiring glances were lev-
eled at frisbee yes he said i was
sitting at the hotel with the doctor when
we heard the shot

  the doctor came out from miriams
room

  well he said in response to their anx-
ious looks its one of those cases where
you cant tell what will happen the
wound itself doesnt seem so bad though
any gunshot wound in the body is a mighty
serious thing the bullet-not very large
caliber i judge-passed completely through
her right shoulder just below the collar
bone it didnt sever any important vein
or artery and it seems to be a clean wound
the danger in these cases is first the ner-
vous shock to the patient and second even
worse the danger of pneumonia a per-
son is extremely likely to contract pneu-
monia after a gunshot wound in the upper
part of the body well have to use every
precaution to prevent that if we succeed
shell soon be well oh yes shes bearing
up wonderfully but she seems to be wor-
ried about something she doesnt seem to
be light headed at all but shes extremely
anxious that somebody should go up to the
golconda mill tonight-right away-and
short stories



tell dubonnet what has happened im
sure i dont know why she thinks its so
important but i do know that her ease of
mind is important very important indeed
at a time like this

  ill go of course said sheriff bates
promptly but ill have to make some
investigation around town before i can
start

  the other men were looking at each
other rather sheepishly they had seemed
almost to shrink into their collars at the
proposed trip in the storm to that uncanny
place guarded by the eccentric old recluse

  but to george frisbee the suggestion
came as a heaven-sent opportunity to re-
pair his earlier mistake

  ill go right away he exclaimed eager-
ly please tell miss packer that i shall
be very very glad to go

  the doctor looked at him gratefully the
others admiringly but curiously as if they
suspected that he was losing his mind

  frisbee set out at once for the mill
the way seemed oddly familiar to him
even in the storm

 she shall know that i can make
amends he assured himself

  but he felt a strong pang of jealousy
that she should particularly want dubon-
net of all men to know immediately of
anything that had befallen her

           chapter vii
           work to do

the mill itself as seen from the vil-
lage earlier in the day had brought
no sense of recognition to george
frisbees mind he could not remember
that he had ever seen it before but he
did distinctly remember the way to it as
he passed the uiitenanted houses in the de-
serted upper outskirts of the town even
though he saw them but dimly through the
storm he knew that he had been this way
many times before he even remembered
some of the people who lived long ago in
these habitations now standing lifeless and
deserted in this one had thrived the tur-
bulent malone boys with whom he had
played in the remote past and in that
farthest house-yes it was there yet
though the windows were all gone-had
been old mother fridhof who had kept
the fierce billy goat that used to charge at
little boys

  he had been wont to hurry past the
place twenty years ago when he walked up
that road with his fathers dinner bucket
but oh how pleasant it had been espe-

cially in summer to come back down the
mountain with his daddy how defiant he
had been of the fridhof goat when his
father was at his side

  a hundred little circumstances hidden
in some out-of-the-way corner of his me-
mory little things forgotten since child-
hood suddenly came out clear and fresh

and he remem-

	bered little sto-
ries that his dad-
dy had told him
about the creek
stories about the
funny little
gnomes that dug
the gold out of
the middle of the
mountains and
about the fairies that sprinkled it in little
bright specks in the sand of the stream
where men could find it if they had faith
and patience and his daddy had said that
he was trying to find the place where the
little gnomes dug so that daddy and moth-
er and georgie could have the things they
needed and so georgie could go away to
school when he got bigger

  and his father had shown him too how
the stream was always running away and
hiding from you how on this very road
you couldnt see much of it at a time be-
cause it kept curving away from you all
the way to the mine and there was a high
bank that hid the bottom when you were
on the road unless you were on the very
edge and a little boy must be mighty
careful especially when he was alone not
to walk off the road

  but the warning given in childhood
should serve him now frisbee reflected
he must exercise caution because he had
tome to the place where the road began to
curve and there was real danger that he
might not follow that curve in the blind-
ing snow

  he had an odd but persistent feeling that
he was being led or at least that somebody
was preceding him by a very short dis-
tance suddenly in a sheltered spot where
the road turned away from the creek for a
short distance between a high boulder and
an abandoned building he was almost posi-
tive that he was following a mans footsteps
of course dubonnet himself had come this
way within an hour but his tracks would
doubtless have been completely obliterated
before this these appeared to be more
recent still even as he looked at them
they were filled up beyond recognition

  soon frisbee was able to distinguish a

                                                        i
the ghost of the golconda



light in the window of the mill as he
approached he found that the window on
the south side nearest to him was very
high at least twelve feet from the ground

  there was no entrance to the building
on this side though there was a mine tun-
nel door below and a little to the east of
the window the tunnel entrance was evi-
dently under the mill frisbee noticed
that its old plank door was ajar and ap-
parently blocked by the snow about the
base

  the entrance to the mill floor was evi-
dently on the west side near the creek
yes the ground ascended rapidly here
the space between the mill and the creek
was quite narrow giving barely room for
the road in fact the road at this place
was partly on made ground extending over
a bed of broken mine rock to the retaining
wall or rip-rap which kept the creek
from encroaching on the road and the
building the bottom steps of the stairs
to the mill door had been broken probably
by the wheels of passing vehicles there
were two windows on this side each about
twenty feet from the central door

  frisbee passed the southern window
which was high above his head and ascend-
ed the steps he knocked repeatedly but
got no response he called he tried the
door it was locked he shook it vigor-
ously

  the northerly window on this side began
about seven feet from the ground fris-
bee went to it and by the exercise of
chinning himself pulled himself up un-
til he could get a view of the interior he
found a slight toe-hold on the logs of the
base of the building which enabled him
to ease the strain on his fingers

  his man was there

  there was a fireplace on the north side
of the room a wood fire of several logs
was burning there brightly at a table
before this fireplace sat gaspard dubonnet
the table was covered with books fris-
bee shuddered as he saw beside the books
two long old fashioned single-barreled pis-
tols in an open leather case but dubon-
net was apparently not concerned with
either the books or the pistols he was
playing with a little mound of yellow and
glistening mineral tossing and fondling
the pieces his lips moving strangely

  the mans hands suddenly ceased their
movements as if paralyzed his lips
parted but became still his strange
black eyes turned slowly until they looked
full into frisbees own then his body
suddenly became tense

   

  frisbee expected to see a pistol leveled
at him but he himself seemed to be frozen
in his place unable to move his aching
fingers incapable of loosening their claw-
like hold on the windowsill

  dubonnet was saying something but
frisbee could not distinguish the words
through the closed window he motioned
with his head for dubonnet to come near-
er dubonnet suddenly rose laid the
pieces of quartz on the table and advanced
deliberately to the window his stare at
frisbees eyes was steady yet unnatural
from the motion of his lips he seemed to
be repeating the same words as he ap-
proached

  frisbees every muscle was tense as the
old mans face came within two feet of his
own on the other side of the glass then
he heard the words

  jack frisbee jack frisbee again
tonight again tonight

  he put his face still closer and added
while frisbees scalp prickled i will fight
you again if that is still my destiny but i
would rather be at peace with you i have
tried to atone to you-for years i have
tried and again this very day how often
have i asked you to come in come in
come in

  with every nerve tingling frisbee
nodded his head sideways toward the
locked door then he dropped to the
ground and ran to it the old man opened
it and as in a trance motioned him in

  as the door closed behind him frisbee
extended his hand the old man began
suddenly to tremble

will you pardon me please said
frisbee huskily i owe you an apology
jack frisbee jack frisbee what

do you mean 
would you
shake hands
with me twenty
years after i
killed you

 it was the
young mans
turn to tremble
it was evident
that he had a
madman to deal
with

  you are mistaken he said collecting
himself with difficulty i am not jack
frisbee i am jack frisbees son

  yes yes that is the way you come
now i saw you jack frisbee this after-
noon at the court house

  no you saw me george frisbee at


short stories

the court house you saw me george
frisbee this evening at miriam packers
i refused to shake hands with you then
will you let me shake hands now please
do not refuse me

  the old man stood swaying frisbee
caught him by the shoulders the action
seemed to steady his mind as well as his
body then came a queer sound which
made frisbees flesh creep but which
brought the other back to sanity it was a
sliding sound followed by a distinct thump
it came from a wooden structure project-
ing slantingly downward into the upper
part of the building on the far side

  dubonnet listened for an instant inquir-
ingly then he smiled slightly as if reas-
sured about something

  just a rock falling down the old ore
chute he remarked they get loosened
occasionally by moisture in the mine
thats why i blocked up the end of the
chute

  he passed his hand before his eyes for
a moment and when he turned them again
at frisbee they had entirely lost their wild
look

  yes he said with simple dignity i
am very glad to shake hands with you

  he did so gravely

  wont you be seated sir he contin-
ued you have come quite a distance on
a bad road in a bad night you have
found me a little upset i fear i must
have been dreaming

  thank you mr dubonnet i must not
stay i came for two purposes one of
them is already performed that was to
apologize to you for my boorishness earlier
this evening i hope you will believe that
my apology is sincere even if it is brief

  you owe me no apology the debt is
the other way and is much heavier than
mere words i would be much pleased if
you would stay a while and talk about-
yourself

  with a sort of old fashioned formal
courtcsy dubonnet waved his visitor
toward a seat by the fire at the end of the
room

  no really i must burry back there
has been a crime perhaps a murder in the
town this evening i was commissioned to
tell you but i want to return quickly and
learn how she is

  she repeated dubonnet with a sud-
den intake of his breath

  yes miss miriam packer some das-
tard some would-be assassin shot her this
evening through the window of her house
it happened very shortly after you left

  dubonnets eyes had opened wide is
there danger that she may die tonight  he
inquired

  it occurred to frisbee later to wonder
why the question had related so specifically
to tonight

  the doctor thinks not he says that
though her condition is very dangerous she
will recover quickly unless she contracts
pneumonia as a result of the wound that
cannot be determined for a day or two

  dubonnet exhaled his breath as if with
great relief but almost immediately the
wild look came into his eyes again go
go at once he exclaimed but if your
father will come i do not fear him now
the pistols-ah the pistols he glanced
at the pair of them crouching side by side
in their leather case on the table

  frisbee feared that his own life was in
danger yet he also feared to leave the man

  go go repeated dubonnet fiercely
actually shoving him toward the door i
mean you no harm young man i wish
you well with all my heart but you must
go and go at once  have little time for
what i must do-for miriam and-and an-
other

  frisbee departed from this extraordinary
interview with his brain in a whirl after
the punctilious courtesy with which he had
been received why was he dismissed with
such unceremonious and desperate haste
what was it that dubonnet must do in
such a hurry for miriam-and who in the
world was the other  why could he not
have been asked to help

   as he passed down the road he heard
through the storm a sound which puzzled
him a little a sound of hammering he
paused and listened the sound continued
for perhaps ten minutes well what-
ever it was it was none of his business
part of the strange old mans secret no
doubt

  during the hour in which he plodded his
slow journey through the heavy snow the
storm ceased entirely and the stars came
out bright and clear and cold glancing
back at the mill he could see the lights
twinkling dimly from dubonnets window
he was troubled as he thought of the old
man alone there with his crazy delusions
vaguely and ineffectually he blamed him-
self for leaving even though he had vir-
tually been thrown out

  at the hotel he found the clerk awake
but yawning frisbee was evidently the
last guest of the little hostelry to be ac-
counted for

  well mr frisbee understand you

                                                       to
the ghost of the golconda



went way up to the mill in the storm bad
night for a stroll i should say ive just
put an oil stove in your room so you can
dry out your clothes howd you find the
old gentleman did he let you in

  let me in repeated frisbee wonder-
ingly sure but im worried about him
hows miss packer

  getting along as well as he expected
according to the doctor he came in and
went to bed an hour ago

  id like to see him said frisbee

  oh dont bother him now he said
miss packer was asleep and resting easy
hes got mrs lovejoy to go over there
and stay in the house so as to spell miss
chapin one of emll call up the hotel
if anything goes wrong im going to
sleep myself but ill hear the bell if it
rings

  no dont disturb the doctor mr fris-
bee hes had a hard day gee its quar-
ter after eleven right now thats awful
late for us folks up here in the hills
frisbee still protested im disturbed
about mr dubonnet he said i dont
think its safe to leave him up there alone
tonight he-he seemed to be a little out
of his head

  the clerk smiled seeing ghosts was
he well thats nothing new with him
hes been doing that ever since-for a long
time now dont worry that old boyll

live forever
hes queer but
he aint crazy-
not by a darn
sight-and h e
can jolly well
take care of
himself

  frisbee worn
out both with
physical fatigue
and with the emotional strain of the day
got upstairs to his room his bones ached
as he removed his clothes and hung them in
front of the smoky little oil stove

  he stretched his tired frame under the
blankets and was soon asleep but it was a
troubled sleep a sleep full of weird dreams
and grisly images

  in those dreams he heard a sound of
hammering like that which had followed
him from the mill in those dreams he
heard dubonnet calling jack frisbee
jack frisbee

  then dimly he realized that it was his
own name that was being called george
frisbee george frisbee

  and not dimly at all he realized that the
  

hammering was a loud and insistent ham-
mering at his own door

  wide awake he switched on the light
and blinked at his watch the time lacked
several minutes of three oclock

  george frisbee george frisbee
open the door

  he opened it and a man pushed his way
in roughly a man whose scraggly mus-
tache was full of little melting icicles and
whose overcoat was caked with snow

  the man held a revolver in his right
hand

  george frisbee he said it is my duty
to arrest you for the murder of gaspard
dubonnet

chapter viii

two pistols

they served an early breakfast in
the jamestown jail it was brought
by mr william bates the sheriffs
eighteen year old son and it was quite sur-
prisingly good consisting of ham and eggs
toast and excellent coffee

  young mr bates seemed to harbor no
aversion toward the prisoner

  dad says for me to do anything i can
for you mr frisbee he remarked pleas-
antly and mother says she hopes youll
like the breakfast

  savory as it was however frisbee had
little stomach for it though he finished the
coffee young bates informed him that
he would be taken to a coroners inquest to
be convened at nine oclock to investigate
the death of gaspard dubonnet

  nine oclock he exclaimed may i
use the telephone again 

  he had already used it immediately fol-
lowing his arrest to summon his partner
griswold by long distance now he
called the coroner slade who had been up
most of the night and was in a very disa-
greeable temper

  yes slade informed him the inquest
would be at nine oclock and the sheriff
had been ordered to bring him to it but of
course he would understand that it was for
the district attorney to decide whether he
should be permitted to be present while
other witnesses testified

  frisbee protested vigorously his part-
ner griswold could not reach jamestown
until noon griswold ought to have at
least a day to make some investigation

  the plea was entirely lost on slade who
reminded him that a coroners inquest was
not a trial that a person suspected of or
charged with crime was not entitled to be


short stories

represented by counsel at an inquest and
that it was his slades duty as a public
official to make his investigation immedi-
ately and while the evidence was fresh

  oh yes the inquest would be public
mr griswold would not be barred from
attendance if he should come but the cor-
oner would not tolerate any interference
with his own investigation or with the evi-
dence

  frisbee was unable to get kenehan the
district attorney by telephone mrs kene-
han informed him rather cuitly that her
husband was out investigating the mur-
der

  at nine oclock however when frisbee
was taken into the cold and dusty offices
of the coroner where there was already a
considerable crowd he renewed his protest
to kenehan that gentleman a little more
diplomatic than the coroner was no less
insistent that the inquest must proceed im-
mediately though he said that frisbee
would be at liberty to remain under guard
throughout the hearing

  will you tell me something else in-
quired frisbee how is miss packer this
morning and what progress has been made
toward discovering who shot her 

  i dont think i am obliged to disclose
information acquired by my office in the
course of its investigations responded the
district attorney icily as to her physi-
cal condition well-shes alive thats all
i know

  doctor martin was called as the first
witness he testified that a little after
midnight he had been awakened by a call
from miss chapin who was worried about
the condition of her charge miriam pack-
er that the hotel clerk expressed regret
at having to rouse him saying that when
mr frisbee had returned from the mill
about an hour earlier he had wanted to
speak to the doctor about dubonnet but
that the clerk had refused to disturb him
on that account

  the doctor had gone to miss packers
he testified further but had been there only
a few minutes when hawkins the night
marshal telephoned to him from the hotel
stating that dubonnet had been killed and
asking him-to go out there immediately to
make an examination

  hawkins he said had previously
stopped at the livery stable and ordered a
team to drive to the mill he had called
the sheriff and the coroner and they all
went together on arrival there the sher-
iff had asked hawkins to hitch the horses
on the south side below the mill and had

directed the party to proceed to the steps
in such manner as to disturb the snow as

little as possible and not to go north of
the steps at all

  dubonnet had previously been laid by
the marshal on his library table there
was a bullet hole clear through his body
and he had been dead for probably two
hours

  the coroner seemed surprised at the lat-
ter statement which evidently did not cor-
respond with his own opinion

  two hours doctor shouldnt you say
he had been dead longer than that you
remember it was nearly two oclock when
we got there

  well its hard to tell we judge it
by several things the extent to which rigor
mortis has set in the extent to which blood
has clotted and in several other ways no
-i should not think he had been dead more
than two hours if that long

  the coroner was persistent you
wouldnt care to say would you doctor
that he could not possibly have been dead
for three or four hours 

  the doctor did not seem to regard the
point as of very great importance but he
was a little nettled

  oh no i wouldnt say it was impossi-
ble i would say it was extremely im-
probable such a conclusion would not
correspond at all with my own professional
experience

  mr billy bates who in the capacity of
bodyguard for frisbee was sitting beside
him looked at the coroner with a percepti-
ble curl of his lip

  the doctor proceeded with other details
of the appearance of the body the bullet
had entered the right arm-pit and had
passed out at the left arm-pit imbedding
itself in the left arm just below the shoul-
der

  was there any other mark of the bul-
let yes it had cut the flesh on the little-
finger side of the right hand and had
ploughed a furrow up the right arm as far
as the elbow clipping the bone of the el-
bow the furrow commencing again on the
upper part of the arm and extending until
it reached the place where it entered the

body in the right arm-pit

  would it have been possible for a man
to shoot himself in that manner no it
would have been absolutely impossible for
a man to hold a weapon with his left hand
so as to sear both the upper and lower
part of the right arm on the under side
clear to the shoulder and shoot himself
horizontally through the body he could
not have done it by firing the pistol with
his foot in that case no matter what the
mans position the course of the bullet
would have been upward not horizontal

  could he have aimed the weapon at
himself with his right hand the doctor
wriggling his finger experimentally didnt
think it possible to fire a weapon with the
right hand so as to cut the fleshy part of
that hand just below the base of the little
finger

  did you see any weapon inquired
kenehan

  yes one of the old-fashioned single-
shot dueling pistols which dubonnet had
for so many years yes that is the pis-
tol

   had it been fired recently

   well it smelt strongly of powder

  frisbee objected that the person who
first found the pistol should be the one to
testify as to its condition the district
attorney replied curtly that he would con-
duct the case in his own way to get at the
truth

  was the bullet which you found in du-
bonnets left arm of the caliber of this pis-
tol

  i judge so but im not sure i dont
know much about pistols anyway it was
a little bit battered out of shape by passing
-through his ribs

  judge dunaway was called as a witness
and identified the pistol as one of a pair
owned by dubonnet he had seen them
often he said they had been old fash-
ioned when dubonnet had brought them
from france but he always claimed that
they had been made by the best gunsmith
in paris and that they were more accurate
than any modern pistol he said they had
a long record behind them in the old coun-
try judge dunaway made this state-
ment with a quite nonjudicial disregard for
the hearsay character of such testimony

   the other pistol he stated further was
just like this one the barrels were about
ten inches long each butt had a steel
plate on the bottom

  it appeared that the plate on this one
otherwise dull was now marked with a nar-
row light streak apparently new running

    

parallel with the barrel of the weapon
dunaway looked at this streak curiously
he rubbed it with a moistened forefinger
and then put the end of his finger to his
tongue he said nothing awaiting the
next question

   do you see anything peculiar about that
pistol

   i never noticed that mark on it before
ive seen the pistol many times

  was there such a mark on the other
pistol

  not when i last saw it the pistols
were identical except that this one always
had a little file-mark on the under side of
the barrel heres the mark that was
the only way you could distinguish them
when and where did you last see the
other pistol 

   at dubonnets library in the old mill
the last time i was up there a month or
six weeks ago

  where was it then

  they were both together in the leather
case on his table

  have you ever seen the pistols other-
wise than to-
gether 

  the witness
hesitated a mo-
ment and looked
at frisbee be-
fore replying
yes once
when and
where was
that

  that was nearly twenty years ago in
the street out here i saw one pistol in
dubonnets hand and the other one drop-
ping from jack frisbees hand

  again the cruel bitter surge of memo-
ry for george frisbee	

  what were the circumstances pur-
sued the district attorney

  frisbee objected to the question the
coroner told him that his objections would
not be entertained and that if he should
again disturb the proceedings he would be
returned to jail and left there until his tes-
timony should be required

  dunaway declining to answer was
threatened with punishment under the
statute requiring witnesses to give testi-
mony at a coroners inquest but kenehan
said let me ask this question first was
george frisbee present on that occasion
yes but he was a little child only six
or seven years old

  slade said to frisbee do you remem-
ber that incident j


short stories

  since i am not permitted to make other
objections said frisbee i would like to
remind you that i am not on the witness
stand

  well you will be soon snapped the
coroner

  if i consent to be returned frisbee
quietly i believe the constitution is still
applicable in gold creek county is it not 

  the district attorney who had heard of
the constitution even if slade had not
approached dunaway from another angle

  did you ever hear dubonnet express
any unkindly feeling toward mr george
frisbee he inquired

  no on the contrary i have heard
him express a friendly feeling toward him
though as far as i know he had only seen
george frisbee once since he was a child
-until yesterday but he was always
afraid of jack frisbee

  of-of jack frisbee you mean
twenty years ago when jack frisbee was
alive 

  no   mean during all of the last twen-
ty years after jack frisbee was dead no
he wasnt afraid of him that doesnt
quite express it but he believed jack
frisbee was coming back to fight with him
again

  the people in the court-room were lean-
ing forward with intense interest a light
began to dawn on george frisbee

  mr kenahan said he if the witness
is willing to answer i will withdraw my
objections to his stating the circumstances
of the death of my father

  all right said kenehan rather un-
graciously turning to dunaway he con-
tinued are you willing to state them
now

  dunaway hesitated a moment then he
said i dont know all that preceded it
but there was a quarrel in jim slades-
in the old saddle rock-saloon oh yes
 was there i was generally there and
so were dubonnet and jack frisbee we
knew that frisbee had located the golconda
mine and it seemed hed given a power of
attorney to dubonnet and he accused du-
bonnet of selling it to fred packer for a
song

  well one word led to another and
frisbee-hed been drinking a little too
much  guess-called dubonnet a cheat
and a crook dubonnet didnt have a gun
on him and neither did frisbee and du-
bonnet didnt slug him like an american
would have done but he says very cold
and polite like a french grandee will
you fight mr frisbee and jack says

the sooner the better and the longer the
better

  dubonnet lived upstairs right there in
slades hotel over the saloon and he goes
up very dignified and gets his pistols in
their leather case yes thats one of them
he hands em to slade and he says here
are romulus and remus the wolf-whelps
with the bark and the deadly bite take
either one you want mr frisbee he says
to jack and then when jack had taken
one of the pistols he says to slade you
toss a coin and the man that calls it right
stays here in the doorway the other
goes across the street and when he gets
there and turns around youll holler
fire and well shoot theres just one
shot apiece he bows to frisbee very
polite and he says is that satisfactory
mr frisbee suits me fine says jack

  and jack calls the coin wrong so he
goes across the street the pistol that he
had was the other one remus but they
were exactly alike except for this little
file-mark

  i always thought that jim slade hol-
lered fire just a second before frisbee
got turned around so as to get a good
chance to aim but i might be wrong of
course we were all over in the other side
of the saloon by the window farthest from
the door and we ducked down pretty low
too anyway they both fired once and
lack frisbee was killed he never touched
dubonnet i believe his bullet is in the
wall over the saloon door yet

  what did he say after he was shot
inquired the district attorney gripping the
arms of his chair he had heard the story
a thousand times but now it took on for
him a professional interest

  again the witness hesitated

  go ahead as far as im concerned
said george frisbee nerving himself to
hear his own recollection confirmed the
district attorney shot him a look of mingled
rebuke and incredulous pity do you re-
member what he said he asked the wit-
ness

  i remember it mighty well he said
you aint got me gass dubonnet you
cant get me ill stay right with you till
i get my rights rights rights for my
wife and kid

  was his kid the def-mr george fris-
bee here

  george frisbee was the only kid he
had and he ran up-he was on his way
from school-just as his dad dropped to
the sidewalk

  everybody breathed deeply at this nar-

                                                       
the ghost of the golconda



ration by an eye-witness of the old story
which seemed to have some connection with
the recent tragedy mr kenehan at-
tempted to establish that connection

  you say that dubonnet saw the defend-
ant-mr george frisbee i mean-only
once since that time

  well he saw him yesterday of course
at the court-house and perhaps several
other times i only know of one previous
time and i only know that by what dubon-
net told me

  what did he say

  dunaway looked inquiringly at frisbee
go ahead as far as i am concerned
said george

  well he told me he had seen jack
frisbee on the street in denver

  jack frisbee

  yes thats what he said but then he
was always seeing jack frisbee i told
him he must have seen george frisbee his
son and he said yes hed heard of george
frisbee and that he seemed to be a fine
young man from all reports and duing
well and that he wished him luck and
then he said that hed thought about it for
a good many years and that he didnt be-
lieve jack frisbee did have his rights in
the mine deal and hed like to make it up
to him if he could

  what do you mean when you say that
he was always seeing jack frisbee

  well that was a persistent fancy with
him you know he had got interested in
spiritualism and transmigration of souls
and all that sort of
thing he said that
jack frisbee used to
come and look into
his window at

night-

 george frisbee
shuddered so violently that many people
looked at him and the witness paused

  -used to come and look in his window
at night and used to tell him to keep the
pistols ready for they were going to fight
it out again

  the night marshal in the front row of
the audience suddenly cried out an that
other pistol wasnt nowhere in the room
when i found gass dubonnet

chapter ix

can ghosts kill

slade was distinctly annoyed so
was the district attorney the in-
vestigation was getting a little out of
hand it seemed this was supposed to

be a plain inquest into facts not into the
realm of the supernatural it must be
brought back to earth

  to george frisbee wondering about the
absence of one pistol whereas he had very
distinctly seen them both an hour or two
before dubonnets death pete hawkins
the marshal soon contributed another con-
tradiction on a minor detail

  the witness was greatly agitated as he
began his story he said he had been rid-
ing around jamestown all evening looking
for a trace of some person who might have
shot miriam packer he knew that du-
bonnet had been at her house earlier in the
evening he finally rode out to the mill
starting from town a few minutes after
eleven but it was slow going on account
of the snow and his horse continually get-
ting his feet balled up

  no it wasnt snowing then it had
stopped probably half an hour before he
started

  he finally got up to the south side of the
mill he said and was going to tie his
horse to the bolt of the old tunnel door
but when he got near it he observed that
the door was nailed up

  frisbee distinctly remembered that it
had been open when he observed it

  ask him if hes sure of that he said
in an undertone to the district attorney

  kenehan looked at him sharply what
do you know about it he inquired

  the witness had overheard the colloquy
apparently for he hastened to answer he
seemed very anxious to get along with his
story

  i certainly am sure because i noticed
it awful particular an ill tell you why
gosh he ejaculated running his hands
through his hair i guess i know i was
sittin my horse there for a minute it was
kind of in a shelter an i was lookin at
that plank door to see if there was a place
where i could tie old dandy because i
didnt want him to get impatient and wan-
der back home without me while i was call-
in on mounseer dubonnet

   noticed that it was nailed up good and
tight the snow was kind of tramped
down in front of it that door was made
of inch planks the regular kind that you
buy for a foot wide an that run about
eleven inches but they wasnt all the same
length there was one of em i reckon
eight or ten inches shorter than the oth-
ers an that left a little porthole through
the bottom of the door at the end of that
plank

  well-so help me mr kenehan while


short stories

i was lookin at that door i suddenly seen
a pair of eyes lookin at me from that hole
old dandy seen em too an he gave a
sudden snort an jumped away from there
like hed seen a ghost an i believe he had
if an animal an a man both see a ghost
its there aint it 

  the audience seemed in no mood to
laugh but the district attorney smiled in a
superior manner did you investigate
the ghost that looked at you through the
hole in the door 

  yes i did mr kenehan i do claim
that i aint no coward an i did that very
thing-a little later an im sure it was
a ghost because i didnt find it there an
because-because i did see it-it must a
been it-at the other place

  other place

  yes in the air in front of gass du-
bonnets north window you see it was
like this dandy had shied away from
that door awful quick i didnt want to
have the thing in the rear of us so i man-
aged to get him around to the west side of
the mill around the corner beyond the
steps i got my gun out and watched that
corner that wed just come around but i
couldnt get dandy to face back he was
that nervous so i had to kind of turn in
the saddle well nothin come off after
wed waited there a minute an i began to
think maybe wed made some fool mistake
an id better go on an finish my errand
an then i looked around again in front
of dandy this time to see where i could
leave him we was beyond the steps an
almost to the north window it was
propped open a little with a stick or some-
thin i suppose-just a little perhaps three
or four inches

  propped open thought george it
was closed tight when i raised myself by
the sill to look through it he hung
breathless on the witness next words

   an thinks i i wont have to hitch

dandy at all i
can just talk
through the win-
dow to old
gass because
you see his light
was still burn-
ing an i knew
he must be up
he sits up-he
used to sit up-
half the night
readin them queer books thats what
judge dunaway says

  never mind what judge dunaway

says cautioned the coroner what did
you see

  well im tellin you aint i good
god i seen enough id moved dandy
up a step or two his head was in front
of the window when i heard gass holler
inside an then-my god mr slade it
makes my blood run cold-then the shot
came an just that minute-right with the
shot-somethin jumped or flew away from
that window above the road right in front
of me

  something well what in the world
was it  inquired the district attorney
leaning forward

  good lord mr kenehan i wish i
could tell you dandy reared up back-
ward whinnyin pitiful-a kind of whin-
nerin shriek an dumped me off in the
snow an ran home mr kenehan i hear
animals can tell a ghost quickern a human
can i know i cant tell what the thing
was it was somethin bright it seemed
as if you could see through it it was-
why i think it was round an-an about
as big as a dinner plate well i dunno
either it might a been bigger or smaller
than that

  now mr kenehan i aint no coward
an you know it ive been in all kinds
of gun fights an sometimes against some
pretty bad hombres but i hadnt never
fought with no ghosts- i just got back
against the wall an stood there with my
gun in my hand for i dont know how
many minutes

  an nothin at all happened an i didnt
hear nothin at all an then i kinda begun
to come to myself an thinks i there
aint no ghost lookin for me an any-
way im an officer of the law lookin for
a criminal an finally i got up my nerve
to holler gass gass dubonnet i
didnt get no answer my own voice kinda
give me a little courage as you might say
an then i went up the steps to the door
an knocked on it an then pounded an
kicked on it an shook it but i couldnt
raise a sound inside the door was locked
all right enough i stuck my jackknife in
the key-hole an found the key was in it

  an then i looked for somethin to
stand on to look through the window
an i had to go round by the tunnel door
again god it sure did give me the
creeps but i remembered i had my electric
flashlight-id been so flustered id forgot
all about it before-an i turned it on that
little hole at the bottom of the door an
there was nothin there at all an i
realized that the thing must have flew away

                                                         
the ghost of the golconda

from the north window just the same i
looked inside the hole to see if i could see
any tracks though i dont believe ghosts
make tracks do they mr kenehan
anyway there wasnt any no i didnt
put my hand in no sir i didnt want
some skeleton to grab it the space inside
near as i could tell seemed to have been
swept-there was nothin that would show
any tracks

   but ghosts dont make tracks im sure
because later i looked with my light all
over the ground from the north window to
the creek you could see real plain with
the electric torch i didnt disturb the
snow i didnt go any further than dan-
dys front hoofs had gone just before he
jumped there was some holes in the
snow partly filled up like as if somebody
had gone to the north window and back to
the steps not long before the snow had
stopped but there was no fresh tracks
on top of the snow anywhere around or
near that north window-no sir not as
much as a snow-bird of course as i said
the snow around the south side of the
building an near the tunnel door had been
pretty well tracked up

  well i got hold of an old ore-car
there an managed to tip it up on end sos
i could climb up  it an look through
the south window gass light was burn-
in bright and there was a bright fire in
the fireplace an through the window i
seen gass lyin with his body forward on
the table stretched out toward the win-
dow that that thing had flew away from
his right arm was stretched out ahead of
him an the pistol was near his hand
there was a pool of blood under his chest
drippin down from the table to the floor

   well i managed to get an iron handle
off that ore car an smashed in the door-
it was a hard job-an got in gass pis-
tol barrel was still warm but he was dead-
ern a door nail there was a pile of gold
nuggets  the table sonic of em was
pretty big an they all seemed fairly clean

   his dead eyes was open wide but they
didnt look crazy at al- like they used to
sometimes when he was alive an he had
the peacefulest expression i ever saw on
him looked just as if hed died happy

  how far was he from the window
asked the coroner

   well i should say all of twenty feet
its a great big room but the table aint
been moved you can measure it

  now mr kenehan he continued
heres something queer that window
that the thing had flew away from was

    

closed an locked the other windows wa
closed and locked an nailed down there
was only one door an that had been
locked an id broke it open to get in
there was a trap door leadin down under
the mill into the old tunnel but that was

locked above
with a strong
padlock an liasp
an besides that
the tunnel door
was nailed up as

ive told you
there had been
an ore-chute go-
ing into the build-
ing when it was
used for a mill thats over on the other
side away from the window through the
top of the wall it was nailed up tight
there positively wasnt any way for a hu-
man being to get into that room or out of
it except by the door where i came in or
the window where the thing had jumped
away nothin or nobody else came out
while i was there or after the shot but
when i got in there was no one in the
room except me an gass dubonnets body
there was only one pistol in the room
an gass couldnt have shot himself with
that pistol as the doctor says

  well then said kenehan impatiently
whats the answer you seem to know
so much about the supernatural who did
shoot him

  mr kenehan said the witness hum-
bly thats what were here to find out i
reckon-but i know now

  you know shouted the district at-
torney how can you know

  i know from what gass dubonnet said
when he hollered just lie fore the shot
kenehan leaned back in his chair and
stared at the witness

  well what did he say

  he hollered out loud the pistols are
ready jack frisbee fire 

chapter x

a wounded horse

pete hawkins though a plain
and matter-of-fact person was not
insensible of the effect which his
astounding narration produced upon the
audience and upon the six men of the cor-
oners jury those gentlemen all shiv-
ered a little even two of them who had
been sitting with rather scornful expres-
sions during the earlier part of the recital
the witness living through his ghostly


short stories

experience again wiped with a red cotton
handkerchief a brow which was sweating
freely in this cold damp room

  in the tension of the moment the open-
ing of the street door created a slight but
welcome diversion with the entering of
a gust of outside air the thoughts of the
occupants of the room turned a little
toward normalcy the man who came in
with that fresh air was griswold frisbees
partner just arrived from the station

  good morning gentlemen he said in-
dicating kenehan slade and the jury with
a comprehensive bow ill sit here beside
mr frisbee if i may

  slade started to tell him that he could
not but was deterred by a look in fris-
bees eye and the district attorney whis-
pered dont make this too strong tom
itll cause a reaction

  sorry i had to interrupt remarked
griswold pleasantly though he sensed the
hostility please proceed

  lets go back a little now mr haw-
kins said kenehan really gratified at an
interruption which seemed to draw the sit-
uation a little away from its supernatural
atmosphere lets go back to the time
when you heard the shot did it sound
from outside the room or from inside
it

  thats the funny thing replied the
witness i cant just tell it seemed to
come from inside and it seemed to come
from right in front of me too the more
i think back to it the more it seems as if
it came right from the window in front of
dandys nose but it was a funny sound-
in kind of a shot a kind of a ghost
shot-

  lets not put any ghosts in this thing
now it had a real sound didnt it 
ye-es but-im try in to tell you-it
had a funny kind of a sound

  well well now what do you mean by
that  pursued the district attorney great-
ly annoyed

  i mean i never heard any shot just like
it and ive heard lots of shots too the
only way i can describe it is to say it was
a kind of a long-sounding shot i dont
mean it wasnt sharp it was sharp
enough but the crack of it seemed to kind
of rise a notch just a tiny fraction of a
second after it first started instead of
going bang real short and quick like an
ordinary pistol shot it kinda went ba-ang
an that thing jumped away from the win-
dow just as the shot sounded

  i tell you what i think mr kenehan

  well you neednt tell us any more
ghost stories said the district attorney
what we want is the plain facts

  i wish youd let him finish his answer
mr kenehan volunteered one of the jur-
ors it may throw some light on the situ-
ation

  kenehan waved his hand resignedly
oh all right all right give us the bene-
fit of your theory mr hawkins

  well mr kenehan resumed the wit-
ness theres a lot of things that us ordi-
nary folks dont know about we dont
know much about spirits but theres a
little thing-i mean two little things-that
i found there that makes me believe that
gass dubonnet tried to get the-the-to
get jack frisbee to agree to somethin an
they couldnt agree an they got mad an
then they had their duel again an this time
jack frisbee shot him

  the district attorney waved his hands
above his head in desperation ghosts
ghosts youve got ghosts on your brain
hawkins get rid of your ghosts and get
down to sense we know that george
frisbee a living man a young and active
man was at the mill very shortly before
dubonnet was killed we know that that
living man had a reason to hate dubon-
net-

  stop it i demand shouted griswold
what kind of fair play do you call this
what semblance of legality has such a
statement mr coroner i protest against
this-

  oh well said george frisbee qui-
etly i was there about an hour and a half
before midnight i have nothing to con-
ceal

  the coroner and the district attorney
looked at him in amazement

  but continued frisbee why not let
the witness proceed  he is telling an hon-
est story and whether his conclusions are
correct or not he evidently has some more
facts to tell why not ask him what was
the thing or the two things which he
found there to give him the idea which he
has 

  they was two pens interrupted the
witness without waiting for the question
to be put by the district attorney

  two pens repeated the latter in per-
plexity

  i saw two pens in cut-off penholders
on the table this morning stated the cor-
oner disregarding the order of proce-
dure

  thats them said the witness i

                                                      to
the ghost of the golconda



picked em up from the floor two new
pens in penholders that had been cut off
with a jackknife so they was about four
inches long both pens had the points
split open just as if two men had started
to write with em an then got mad an
jabbed em down hard on the table or
somethin

  judge dunaway who had been follow-
ing the testimony with a very thoughtful
and studious expression tiptoed over to
the district attorney and whispered some-
thing to him then he looked at george
frisbee and smiled

  kenehan addressed the witness did
you find those pens on the table

  why-why no replied hawkins as
if the idea had just come to him i found
em on the floor-on the floor just under
the north window

  the witness seemed vaguely disturbed
as if he had overlooked the significance of
this fact and as if it might cast a doubt on
his theory then he brightened

  the thing-the ghost-must have taken
them to the window he added reflectively
an dropped em before it went out or
perhaps gass started to hand him a pen at
the window

  the district attorney himself smiled at
this hypothesis

  one of the jurors who thought it was
time to display a little practical common
sense remarked i think mr coroner
that we ought to see the premises while the
snow is still fresh and before conditions
change

  i intend to take you there right away
replied slade you may go too if you
wish mr griswold he added indulg-
ently

  why certainly im going said gris-
wold quietly

  in the meantime mr hawkins said
the coroner ignoring the lawyers attitude
have you anything more to say 

  yes somethin else but its somethin
i dont understand i dont see why a
ghost should have any grudge against a
horse especially poor old dandy hes a
gentle harmless critter but that thing
cut him-twice

  cut him exclaimed the coroner and
the district attorney simultaneously

  yes gentlemen thats just what it did
you know mr kenehan after id come
back here to town on foot an called you
an the doctor an mr slade an the sher-
iff an arrested mr frisbee like you said
for me to do i went home and let dandy
into the barn he was whinnerin an cry-
in outside i was so excited i didnt
notice anything wrong with him except
that the poor beast was awful cold an mis-
erable i put a blanket over him an tied
him in his stall well this mornin i
noticed that he had a little cut across his
nose an another one quite a deep little
cut or jab in his neck just in front of the
right shoulder the cut on his nose was
raw but had started to scab over a little
the place  his shoulder was swollen up
pretty bad

  i started to wash it out with some weak
carbolic acid solution but dandy quivered
an jerked so that i dont believe it did
much good

  judge dunaway thoughtfully took off
his glasses wiped them and put them in
their case as if the principal work of the
day was concluded

  others in the court-room stared blankly
at hawkins wondering what this strange
and apparently irrelevant detail could pos-
sibly have to do with the strange and un-
natural story just told by this straightfor-
ward and honest man

chapter xi
find cousin henry

ill you be sworn george fris-
bee inquired the coroner

  just a moment mr coroner
interposed griswold i understand that
mr frisbee has no objection to being
sworn but i am going to advise him
against it for the present he is arrested
on a charge of murder this inquest is
speeded up over his protest without even
the elementary fairness of allowing his
counsel to be present at its commencement
the whole proceeding seems to me a pal-
pable attempt to convict him before he is
tried i am convinced that his own can-
dor and frankness would be used-

  that will do mr griswold snapped
the coroner he doesnt have to testify
and it isnt your province to make a speech
to the coroners jury as you very well
know his reasons for not taking the wit-
ness stand are immaterial the jury can
draw their own conclusions

  im willing to trust the jury but im
not willing to trust george frisbees per-
sonal and political enemies i-

  the coroner rapped with his gavel
drowning the flow of words

  silence he shouted this session is
adjourned the jury will accompany the
coroner and the district attorney to the
golconda mill the sheriff will keep
george frisbee in custody at the jail
mr slade said the sheriff wait a

minute till i give
you a note to my
men ive posted
guards on the
road about a
hundred yards
each side of the
mill

  what d i d
you do that
for said
slade with sud-
den and unaccountable vexation it
wasnt necessary

  i did it on judge dunaways advice
replied the officer

  a very wise precaution sheriff said
griswold it is not only necessary to
see that the mill is not disturbed but-
he looked slade squarely in the eye and
continued deliberately-where a man is
accused of a murder committed at the
mill and the ground is covered with snow
that fell before the murder it is important
to keep that sheet clear-to show that the

accused mans tracks were not in the snow
after it stopped falling

  slade and kenehan exchanged the look
of conspirators who have been caught
and each of whom desires to shift the
blame to the other several of the jurors
glanced at each other knowingly

  dunaway looked at griswold with high
approval just exactly what i thought
mr griswold said he and i wish youd
take me on as associate counsel for the de-
fense

  by the way kenehan added gris-
wold let me ask by what authority you
are keeping frisbee locked up have you
filed any complaint against him  has any
grand jury indicted him if not im go-
ing to demand his release today on habeas
corpus

  kenehan was in an embarrassing posi-
tion he could of course prevent fris-
bees release by filing a formal complaint
for murder and as a commitment on this
charge was not bailable frisbee would be
kept locked up until his trial-until after
election until after election-that was
the trouble if he didnt file such a com-
plaint he might be subject to some criti-
cism but if he did he would probably be
accused of taking an unfair advantage of
a political rival by detaining him so that
he could not present his case to the people

  frisbee was well respected throughout
the state people generally would not be
inclined in advance to believe that he was
guilty even with considerably stronger evi-
dence than had yet been discovered and
in any event frisbee could not get away
without his knowledge he could not pos-
sibly walk over the precipitous snow-cov-
ered mountains the only way out was
down the railroad track the only pre-
caution necessary was to keep an eye on
the track and to watch the departure of
the daily train

  it suddenly dawned on kenehan that un-
der the circumstances it was the height of
political folly to detain frisbee slade
had put him up to this slade was a fool
well he would undo this folly as rapidly
as possible generosity confiding and
noble generosity was the correct-indeed
the only permissible-play

  now now mr griswold he said
rather pompously we plain country law-
yers are perhaps a little too punctillious
sometimes in the performance of our
duty personally i dont believe mr
frisbee is guilty of this crime but an
atrocious crime has been committed mr
frisbee was on the scene-by his own ad-

                                                         
the ghost of the golconda	

mission-at least a very short time before
the crime he had a possible motive
though -er personally knowing his high
character-i would be the last man to at-
tribute it to him under the circumstances
it seemed to mr slade and myself that it
was our duty as sworn officials to detain
him until some investigation could be made
however here he swelled to noticeably
larger proportions i think i am justified
since-er-no formal charge has yet been
filed-to release him on his promise not to
leave this town without my permission
thus establishing both his dictatorship
and his magnanimity in the minds of his
fellow townsmen kenehan bowed to fris-
bee and waved his hand with the liberal
gesture of benevolent royalty dunaways
lip curled a little scornfully griswold
smiled faintly but the jurors and the
others present-who included most of the
inhabitants of the little town-applauded
vigorously with generous disregard of the
proprieties of the court-room

  aint that just like old charlie kene-
han  hed never think ill of anybody
hes too high-minded to suspect anybody
of a crime trouble with charlie is hes
too generous to be a district prosecutor
well have to elect him to a higher office
these and similar expressions were
heard on every side kenehan glowed as
he realized that he had increased his popu-
larity and extricated himself from a diffi-
cult situation by one clever stroke

  frisbee was tactful enough to play to
the same lead that is very generous of
you mr kenehan he said warmly and
i want to assure you that i shall stay right
here in jamestown until this mystery is
solved

  a murmur of approval was his reward
dunaway gripped his hand come on
with us to the mill he exclaimed

  no said george to the surprise of
everybody and the suspicion of some i
have an errand to do here in town ill
wait for you at the hotel

  slade the only person in the building
who was not pleased at any part of what
had happened glowered at him and whis-
pered to the pimply faced youth who acted
as his clerk and general assistant and
when slade the jury kenehan griswold
and dunaway departed for the mill in
suggs bus george discovered that he was
followed from the room

  of course he had not expected to be at
liberty without being under surveillance

  not pausing even to return to the ho-
tel he went at once to miriam packers

    

the young man caythorne stood below
him on the sidewalk as he knocked gently
miriams teacher companion opened the
door she seemed greatly surprised to see
him but was quite friendly and asked him
in

  how is miriam-miss packer he
inquired eagerly

  getting along very nicely the doctor
says it was a clean wound and is well
sterilized if he can keep her from hav-
ing pneumonia shell be sitting up in a cou-
ple of days and will probably be out in a
couple of weeks she kept asking if mr
dubonnet knew of her wound-got a bit
flighty over it in fact along about mid-
night she was delirious for a little while
seemed to think something horrible was
happening kept saying-well  dont be-
lieve i ought to tell you

  please do

  well-i will i dont understand it
but it may be important she kept saying
dear georgie im so sorry 

  i think i understand said frisbee
solemnly

   i was quite alarmed about it continued
miss chapin and i called the hotel and

j	got doctor mar-

yj	he came over and

medicine to put
her to sleep and told me whatever i did
not to excite her but to keep her quiet

  but then the doctor and  got pretty
excited ourselves-here miss chapin low-
ered her voice-because just as he was
putting on his coat mr hawkins tele-
phoned from somewhere for him to come
out to the mill and then he took me out
into the kitchen and told me that mr du-
bonnet had been shot too

  and it was odd about miriam i hadnt
given her any of the doctors medicine but
when  went back into her room after the
doctor had gone she was entirely in her
right mind but she was crying she said
and so hes dead poor man i might
have known it i thought wed been aw-
fully quiet in the kitchen but she must
have overheard us still the doctor didnt
tell me that mr dubonnet was dead he
only said he had been shot well anyway
o

short stories

miriam went to sleep after that and shes
still asleep

  a faint call from the adjoining room
proved that miss chapin was mistaken
she left the visitor but returned immedi-
ately

  miriam just asked if you were here
she says tell him to find cousin henry
shes quite excited youd better go mr
frisbee see if you can get doctor mar-
tin over here right away im afraid

  the doctor however entered the house
as frisbee left it he greeted the young
man briskly but not unpleasantly 

  frisbee walked back to the hotel fol-
lowed by his shadow caythorne

  find cousin henry well that ought
to be easy enough he couldnt very well
get out of town but wait a moment
where could he be when had he been
seen last at miriam packers house and
coming from it shortly before she was
shot so far as frisbee knew

  but it was a little odd that with most
of the people of jamestown at the coroners
inquest this young man who had no regu-
lar occupation which would keep him away
had been conspicuous by his absence

  nor was he present when the coroners
little court reconvened

chapter xii

theories facts and figures

george frisbee although he
did not go with the others to the
mill was too preoccupied to think
of luncheon but apparently the coroner
the jurors and others concerned in the in-
vestigation had found time not only to
visit the scene of the crime but also to
eat a hearty noonday meal

  when the coroner tapped for order at
about two-thirty for the benefit of the
record mr hendricks the county sur-
veyor who it seemed had attended the
examination at the mill made a diagram of
it and a profile sketch of the interior of
the mine he based the latter upon his
own acquaintance with the property and
upon a blue-print of the golconda mine
prepared by dubonnet several years pre-
viously

  i remember something of the early his-
tory of the golconda said he john
frisbee sank the shaft and located a small
but rich vein within thirty feet of the sur-
face he dropped the shaft a few feet
below it and ran a short cross-cut to the
vein which seemed to have a dip to the
west and a strike almost north and south

  one of the jurors a tenderfoot named
hazelton who had recently come from the
east to regain his health in the mountains
and who had then tied his own decaying
fortunes to those of the little town by in-
vesting his savings in a jamestown store
caused a smile at this point by requesting
information

  mr hendricks said he i wish youd
explain the terms dip and strike 

  certainly replied the witness adding
as a friendly rebuke to the others the
language of mines seems simple enough to
those who have grown up among them but
it is not familiar to other people mr
hazelton could get most of us balled up i
guess if he should talk in iowa farming
terms

  its like this just suppose that your
vein sometimes called a lode is a sheet
of paper of course the edges are ir-
regular and its full of holes and in some
parts it is thin while in other parts it is
thick but although it is called a vein it
is a mistake to think of it as a tube like the
veins in your body a vein of mineral is
conceived of as a sheet between walls of
rock in the earth-a sheet lying on a slant
the sheet is generally bent and twisted
take this sheet of paper now

  he held it sloping before him to illus-
trate

  the top edge of this sheet is its apex
the apex of the vein that is to say the
apex is not the high point but the high
edge the direction of that edge is the
course or strike of the vein and the
slope of the sheet is what we call its dip
you get at the vein by cutting down to it
or across to it if you cut across to it by
a tunnel you follow it up on its dip and
sideways along its course by excavations
in the rock we call those excavations
stopes is that clear now mr hazel-
ton 

  thats fine thanks these chaps have
made my head swim with their talk about
stopes and shafts and winzes and its
all been greek to me

  its easy enough when you know it
the shaft of course is the vertical hole in
the mine a sort of well a winze is a ver-
tical excavation made in a tunnel as for
instance to get at ore below the tunnel
you have to do that sometimes but the
best mining practice is to carry the stopes
upward

  all right now mr hendricks said
the coroner a little impatiently if youre
through with this lecture on general min-
ing practice suppose you go ahead and tell


the ghost of the golconda



us about this particular mine

  i was about to do so replied the sur-
veyor calmly frisbee ran a tunnel west
from the shaft a hundred feet below the
surface and hit the vein again a hundred
feet from the shaft you can see from the
old blue-print showing these workings that
the vein had a dip of about forty-five de-
grees it showed up a little thicker there
but the greater values seemed to be below
as frisbe demonstrated by a winze which
he sank in his tunnel at the hundred foot
level

  so he dropped down with his shaft an-
other hundred feet and this time tunneling
west again he struck the vein still not
very thick a hundred and fifty feet from
the shaft

  that is to say the dip had become
steeper the vein was not far from ver-
tical at that point

  it was about that time i believe that
frisbees interest went to packer du-
bonnet took over the management i re-
member dubonnet thought that frisbees
vein didnt promise very much at that
depth but he was confident that it would
show heavy values lower down that is
rather characteristic of the lodes in this
section and of course there was always
the chance of cutting another vein so
dubonnet dropped the shaft to seven hun-
dred feet and then he tunneled west again
if the vein had continued to dip at the
same angle or if it had maintained its ten-
dency to drop toward the vertical dubon-
net would have cut it pretty near the shaft
or at least within four or five hundred feet
but he had to run a lot further than that
i know that mr packer thought the vein
had pinched out entirely as you might
say mr hazelton packer thought they
must be below the bottom edge of the
sheet

  he held his simple model up again for
illustration

  packer was in favor of starting a tun-
nel higher up but they finally struck the
vein twelve hundred feet from the shaft
you see somewhere between the two hun-
dred foot level and the seven hundred foot
level the vein had flattened out till it was
only about thirty degrees from horizontal
well it was good rich stuff when they did
find it dubonnet stoped upward from
the seven hundred foot level for perhaps
two hundred feet taking out good values
then he started to follow it down below
the seven hundred foot level but you
see from there down he was pretty near
the side of the mountain and so to avoid


the necessity of winzes and underhand
stoping and also the necessity of running
all his rock to the shaft and hoisting it to
the top he simply ran a short tunnel from
the outside about a hundred feet lower in
the direction of the shaft

  that made it mighty easy to work the
mine especially so because the short tun-
nel was run right from the county road
he didnt have to run that tunnel more
than thirty feet before he struck the vein
its further dip would carry it below the
road and below the creek if it didnt pinch
out however it was pretty thin at the
lower tunnel level dubonnet simply
stoped up from there taking out the ore
till he hit the place where he had been
working in the seven hundred foot level

  well there seemed to be an unlimited
supply of ore above they assumed that
it went clear up to where frisbee had left
off and it was rich free-milling stuff so
dubonnet thought hed save expense by
putting up a little ten-stamp mill and he
had an ingenious scheme for running his
ore into it he didnt have to hoist it out
of the mine and then tram it down to the
mill he simply
made a chute from
the mill itself up in-
side the mine to the
seven hundred foot
level following in a
general way the hole
that hed made when
he had stoped out
the ground between
it and the lower tunnel of course he had
to enlarge that hole in some places the
chute must have been about two hundred
and fifty feet long hed simply drop his
ore into it at the seven hundred foot level
he had some contrivance of heavy gates
swung from the top inside to keep the
rock from coming too fast and wrecking
his mill i remember he had to experi-
ment a little with those gates but he finally
got them so the ore would feed in nice and
easy to the upper floor of the mill which
he used for a crushing room the chute
is still there youve seen where the low-
er end of it runs into the mill but the
machinery is all gone from the mill and
even the upper floor has been taken out
it was made of very heavy timber and i
believe dubonnet used it all up in the mine
since the mill stopped running timber
is rather expensive up here nowadays you
know because there are no more sawmills
left in the mountains

  when the mill was running dubonnet


short stories

sifted his ore right in the mine it was
very simple all he had to do was to put
a grizzly in the bottom of his chute and
let the siftings come through a funnel-
shaped arrangement below that carried the
finer stuff right down into cars on the short
tracks in his lower tunnel

  excuse me said hazelton again
what do you mean by a grizzly 

  oh thats just a set of bars that you
run the ore over in order to sift it of
course dubonnet had to hoist the sifted
stuff into his mill but it wasnt much of a
hoist

  the country rock he would let run
down into the lower tunnel and then he
hauled it out and ran it alongside the road
to convenient places where he dumped it
into the creek he used the creek for
nearly half a mile up and down but he
rip-rapped the outside of his dump so as
to make a pretty good retaining wall all the
way along the east bank it really im-
proved the channel and protected the road
that cost him something in labor but he
wasnt pinched for money in those days
and he and packer were always public-
spirited men

  he had ore-bins down below his
crusher floor and he would feed his stamps
from them but theyve all been pulled out
now the poor old boy didnt have any-
thing but bookcases in there these last few
years and aside from those the place has
been about as empty as a barn i guess
youd say it looked emptier still stretch-
ing way up in the dark with the upper
floor out

  well i dont know how far dubonnet
followed the vein up above the seven hun-
dred foot level i do know that it finally
tapered down so thin that the expenses
ate up the property the mine got deeply
in debt and dubonnet had hard work to
save it for the last few years weve won-
dered how he managed to live and poor
miss packer has had to teach school

  however it looks now as if hed found
at least a little pocket of high-grade stuff
lately nobody knows where or how
much of it there is

  mr hendricks then sketched the in-
terior of the mill showing its relation to
the surrounding ground

  in front of the mill the road which ne-
cessarily followed the creek from james
town had barely room to pass between it
and the building as the space north of the
steps was not more than fifteen feet wide
the mill consisted of one large room
forty by sixty feet in the north end of

it in the middle dubonnet had construct-
ed a fireplace it was connected simply
to an ordinary iron stove-pipe outside but
inside the building it had a fairly wide
flue however the flue was not large
enough to hold a man he had measured
the flue it was eight inches wide by
twelve inches long there was also an
opening in the concrete floor at the back
for ashes and doubtless intended also to
improve the draft but this opening was
smaller only eight inches by eight

  dubonnet ate slept and lived in this
large room there was a line of very
heavy studding through the middle of it
but these posts connecting with the enor-
mous logs which had served in former
years to support the crushing room floor
were evidently intended to sustain those
logs and that floor and had never served

to divide the mill into two rooms at the
north end of the room these pillars were
missing they had doubtless been pulled
out mr hendrickson explained for use
in the mine the same reason probably
accounted for the absence of one or two
of the great rafters which were the size
and length of telegraph poles and in
spite of the width of the room probably
none of these rafters needed the support of
the central stulls now that the weight and
vibration of the machinery were gone if
dubonnet had lived there much longer he
would probably have used up all the in-
sides of the old place

  his cook-stove and a small kitchen table
were in the south end of the room his
cot-bed was on the east side near the north
end and under the old ore-chute the

                                                      
the ghost of the golconda



end of this chute projected seven feet into
the room at a height at least sixteen feet
from the present floor the chute itself
was approximately six feet square and it
entered the room on a slope of about forty-
five degreesthrough the eastwall its lower
end was about four feet above the rafter
log which had originally supported the
crushing room floor the end of the chute
was provided with a door which swung
from the top the door was secured by a
padlock through a hasp at the bottom mr
hendricks explained that this door which
would have been of no use or effect to
stop the fall of ore when the mill had
been in operation had probably been put
in by dubonnet to prevent the entrance of
sneak-thieves into the mill from the mine

  not only was the padlock fastened but
the door had recently been nailed securely
in place recently the witness repeated
because the nail-heads were bright and the
wood about them showed fresh hammer
dents

  frisbee wondered if this could account
for the sound of hammering which he had
heard after his departure from the mill

  against the walls extending from the
fireplace dubonnet had made bookshelves
and these were full of books mr hen-
dricks said that he and the coroner had
taken out all the books and examined the
space behind them and the walls there
was not room there for the concealment of
a man and the walls appeared to be solid

  at this point in the county surveyors
testimony one of the jurors asked that
hawkins be recalled to say whether he had
looked behind the books

  no not behind the books replied the
night-marshal but i looked everywhere
else in and under the cot under the library
table and under and behind the kitchen ta-
ble and the stove though there wasnt
room for a man there

  yes and i climbed up on rthe rafter
that was under the ore-chute and-

  how did you get up there  asked the
juror quickly

  how did i get up there  why i used
gass dubonnets ladder there was a lad-
der about twelve feet long i guess lying
against the east wall i looked on top of
all the rafters and on top of the ore-chute
there would possibly be room for a man
up there but he couldnt be up there with-
out my seeing him and he couldnt have
got into the chute from the top because
it was boarded over anyway a man
couldnt get up there without something
to stand on the ladder as i say was on


the floor against the wall and the table
with gass dubonnet lying on the east end
of it wasnt directly under the rafter or
near enough to jump to the rafter from the
top of it would you think so mr hen-
dricks 

  it would certainly take a very athletic
man to get onto the rafter from the ta-
ble responded the surveyor i dont
believe it could be done i measured some
of those distances with the same thought
in mind the table is two feet and six
inches high it is three feet wide and a
little more than five feet long it was al-
most squarely in front of the fireplace
parallel with the north wall but the
north side of it was six feet from a point
below the center of the rafter the top
of the rafter was ten feet from the floor
that is seven and a half feet higher than
the top of the table a man would have
had to make a standing jump that would
enable him to grasp a log a foot and a half
or two feet higher than his head at a dis-
tance of six feet fyom where he stood
no gentlemen as the table stood it seems
to me it would have been impossible for a
man to get from it onto the rafter that
was under the ore-chute

  mr hawkins persisted the juror
how long was it after you heard the shot
before you got into the room

  we-ell i should think it was all of
ten minutes

  gentlemen said the surveyor you
saw the situation yourselves even if the
table had been under the rafter log it
would have been very difficult for a man
to get onto the rafter from the table the
rafter would have been a couple of feet
higher than his head and he would have
to have tremendous strength in his hands
to grip that rounded surface after he had
jumped to it and then to swing himself up
onto it 

  and anyway mr slade contributed
the night-marshal the table couldnt have

been moved id
have heard it
youd have
heard it while
you were break-
in the front door
with an iron
bar persisted
the inquisitive ju-
tor disregarding
the coroners
frown i aint sure about that

  you forget i looked in at the south
window before i broke in and when i


short stories

looked in the table was where it is now
an gass dubonnet was lyin on the end of
it

  uh-huh continued his cross-examin-
er an how long was it before you looked
in how long was it that you was shiv-
erin outside the wall waitin for a ghost 
we-ell i-really i dunno five min-
utes mebbe but id a heard a mouse
if one had moved across the floor then and
believe me gentlemen there wasnt no
sound at all inside that room while i was
listenin

  just a minute more mr coroner per-
sisted the juror let me ask you this
mr hawkins could you have heard a
mouse or a man while you was wrestlin
with that ore-car to get it up to the south
window sos you could look in 

  im pretty sure i could i didnt make
much noise really i was kind of scared
to make much noise i believe id a
heard any noise even then but now let
me ask you a question youre so awful
smart suppose while i was movin that
ore-car-it didnt take me very long-a
man had moved the table under the rafter
and stood on it and jumped to the rafter
and then climbed to the top of the chute
-hed certainly have to be some gymnast
to do any part of that stunt-an perhaps
got into the chute-god knows how-then
this is what im askin you how could that
man have put gass dubonnets body back
on the table and moved the table back six
feet to the rear of the rafter

  the amateur sleuth on the jury subsided
in the general snicker which immediately
enlivened the grim proceedings

 the coroner rapped for order i
think theres been quite enough of this in-
formal discussion he announced go
ahead mr hendricks and give us any
other information which you have pre-
pared

chapter xiii

finger-nail marks

mr hendricks gave the jury
some further figures the sill of
the north window on the west
side was seven feet from the ground and
the slope to the south end of the mill made
the height of the other windows greater
the one on the south end being a little more
than nine feet above the ground at that
point the tunnel door was below but a
little to the right or east of that window
and it like the chute in the mill-room had
recently been nailed tight

  on a question by the inquiring juror
who was endeavoring to re-establish his
reputation as an acute observer the county
surveyor confirmed hawkins statement
about the small porthole at the bottom of
the tunnel door it was the width of one
board that is to say about eleven inches
and it was not quite seven inches high the
end of the board being cut somewhat on a
bias a man could not possibly get
through this opening the trap door in
the mill floor evidently used in times past
to hoist ore from tunnel cars in the base-
ment of the mill and more recently as a
means of descent from the mill into the
basement and thence into the tunnel was
firmly locked from above the key to
this lock like the key to the chute was on
the ring which dubonnet customarily car-
ried and which mr slade had taken from
his pocket this door when locked could
not be moved more than half an inch mr
slade had opened this trap door and with
hendricks and several of the jurors had
descended into the space below the mill
floor

  frisbee happened to glance at duna-
way during this part of hendricks story
and saw that gentleman watching slade
very keenly dunaway whispered some-
thing to griswold and the latter addressed
the district attorney may i ask a ques-
tion mr kenehan

  certainly replied the district attor-
ney with an access of his new-found con-
sideration

  what i wanted to ask mr hendricks
was whether mr slade went ahead of you
into the tunnel

  why yes naturally he put the lad-
der down into the basement and climbed
down ahead of us and walked back and
forth for a few seconds then he turned
his flashlight so that we could see to get
down

  frisbee thought he saw the shadow of a
smile behind dunaways unkempt beard
the old chap certainly has some theory of
this case he thought wonder what it is
well below the mill the tunnel wasnt
actually cut out of the rock was it

  oh no of course not the mill had
simply been built on pilings a few feet
above the ground and under the mill the
tunnel wasnt really a tunnel at all but a
cellar except where it curved into the
mountain almost under the east wall of
the mill however the cellar was very
small because practically all the space had
been filled up clear to the floor of the
mill with loose rock hauled out of the

                                                        
the ghost of the golconda

mine it was a narrow passageway for
perhaps thirty feet from the south door

and t h e n it
widened into a
triangu-
lar space under
the northeast
corner of the
mill there
was room for
the tracks
leading to the
tunnel proper
and there was
room left to
get under the fireplace on the north end
so as to remove ashes there was some
empty space in the north end but most of
the basement was filled up tight with rock
from the mine it was easier of course
for the old man to dump his cars there than
it was to trundle them by hand down
alongside the creek

 was-may i go on mr kenehan
asked griswold thank you werent
there plenty of places where a man could
hide among those boulders

  no i think not they were piled up
pretty even so as to prevent falling and
they had the effect of a walling in of the
passage and of that triangular space we
didnt see any place where it looked as if
a man could be concealed in that cellar
of course the tunnel ran back a little way
into the mountain we followed it in
but we didnt try to climb the stope above
it

  did mr slade go ahead of you into
the mine by the tunnel 

  sure he had the only flashlight
dunaway was leaning forward greatly
interested

  did you see any depression in the
ground the floor of the tunnel he in-
quired

  wait a minute said slade rapping
with his gavel we cant allow this if
the district attorney -wants to permit one
of you gentlemen to ask a few questions
thats all right but im not going to have
all of you butting in haphazard trying to
develop theories of your own please
proceed in the regular way mr kenehan
or well dismiss this witness

  well never mind that question any-
way said dunaway unabashed ill
suggest one to the district attorney if i
may

  he did so and the district attorney
asked mr hendricks do you know
whether that tunnel was ever used for


any other purpose than as a passageway
for ore and rock from the mine and as an
entrance to the stope above it 

  why-er-i dont know from personal
observation but as an engineer i know that
it must have served another purpose
exactly what purpose please
why as a drain of course theres
more or less water in all these mines up
here as you know mr kenehan

  well thats just what i was getting at
now did you see in this tunnel any sign
that it was used as a drain was there
water flowing in it or was there a water
channel 

  the witness had not thought of it be-
fore he was frankly puzzled he seemed
to think that his failure to observe some-
thing of the sort was a reflection upon his
professional keenness he finally stated
that he had noticed a little water trickling
down the stope but had not noticed where
it ran out of the tunnel in order per-
haps to cover his own confusion he re-
marked of course you know there have
been a good many deep tunnels cut in this
district since the golconda was opened up
theyve drained the country to a consid-
erable extent and for that reason theres
not nearly as much water in many of the
older mines as there used to be

  dunaway was scratching his head re-
flectively as if he was trying to remember
something mr slade again took a hand

  i dont see mr kenehan what is the
purpose of going into all this it cannot
have anything at all to do with the case
it makes no difference what the tunnel or
the cellar was like gaspard dubonnet
could not possibly have been shot by a man
hiding there even if there were any evi-
dence that anybody had been there it is
as clear as can be that he was shot by some-
body in the room or by somebody through
the window it is also perfectly clear that
after he had been shot nobody could have
got into that tunnel

  oh very well said kenehan rather
testily its the coroners business to de-
termine the manner of this mans death-
if he can im willing to drop this line
of inquiry for the present mr hen-
dricks tell us about those windows if you
please

  well as has been already stated here
they were all permanently fastened that
is nailed except the north window on the
west side they had been nailed from
the inside and they had evidently been
fastened that way for a long time the
north window on the west side had no


short stories

weights-i dont believe any of them had
for that matter to keep the window
open you would have to prop it open but
when it dropped down it would fasten
automatically because there was a little
spring catch on each side when i ex-
amined the window those catches were
both fastened

  same as when i saw it right after gass
dubonnet was shot ejaculated hawkins
from his seat but not the same as when
i saw it the minute before that

  that will do hawkins snapped the
coroner

  mr hendricks further testimony re-
lated to the topography of the country out-
side the creek

bed	proper was
about thirty feet
wide at that
point and its
bottom was very
rocky it was
not frozen over
though there
was ice in the
pools the wa-
ter was a little
above average height right now and op-
posite the mill was perhaps eight or ten
feet below the road

  the near bank was the practically ver-
tical rip-rap wall the far bank rose
rather smoothly for about a hundred yards
in which distance the total ascent was
about seventy-five feet which would bring
it above the top of the mill

  there was absolutely no track of a man
or an animal in the snow on that opposite
slope the witness-at the suggestion of
judge dunaway it appeared-had exam-
ined it most carefully and between the
creek and the mill there was no sign of a
track on the top of the snow at any point
as far north as the south edge of the
north window the most northerly marks
were the front hoof-marks of a horse just
south of that point there was some dis-
turbance in the snow there which the wit-
ness thought was sufficiently explained by
mr hawkins testimony

  also there were some depressions in
the snow under the north window made
before the snow had stopped falling and
hence not readily distinguishable

  those were my tracks volunteered
george frisbee

  your turn will come directly said the
coroner sarcastically

  as for the stream itself it would hardly
show tracks but there was no disturb-

ance of the snow on either bank or on the
rocks in the stream such as would be made
by a man or an animal walking in it the
rip-rap was a smooth snowy wall not only
at this point but as far north and south as
he could see from the mill

  anything else of interest that you can
tell us mr hendricks either about the
mill or the ground near it inquired the
coroner apparently relieved though not
satisfied

  no-o i believe not i did notice one
little thing in the mill that i couldnt un-
derstand it probably has no significance
there were two little fresh cuts or gouges
on the top of the window sill inside they
were not much more than short deep
scratches about an inch long i should
think and an eighth of an inch deep they
were about four inches apart and they were
just inside the window i only noticed
them because they seemed to be new

  again that queer suggestion of a smile
behind judge dunaways beard

  hawkins suddenly ejaculated trembling
with excitement my god they musta
been the marks of the ghosts fingernails
when he was bracin himself for a shot

  even slade laughed dunaway alone
looked thoughtfully at the marshal some-
thing like that he murmured as if to
himself

chapter xiv

a theory of motives

george frisbee later in the
afternoon told simply and in con-
cise language the story of his visit
to dubonnet he remembered that when
he had got back to the hotel it was five
minutes before eleven it had taken him
perhaps three quarters of an hour to walk
down from the mill in the snow it had
stopped snowing a few minutes before he
reached the hotel

  he made no effort to conceal any fact
which might have a bearing on the tragedy

  he was asked if he had felt any enmity
toward dubonnet well he must admit
that he had entertained such a sentiment
it had been difficult to overcome it but
he had offended miss packer by displaying
it earlier in the evening and after that he
had endeavored to suppress his own feel-
ings

  did dubonnet display an animosity
toward him no mr dubonnet had re-
ceived him very courteously had not mani-
fested any enmity or dislike and had shak-
en hands with him he said nothing about

                                                     
the ghost of the golconda



dubonnetts initial refusal to do so deem-
ing this matter of hallucination not ma-
terial to the inquiry

  the jury went out to consider their
verdict dunaway griswold and fris-
bee went to the latters room in the hotel
there dunaway closed the transom and
looked carefully down the hall then locked
the door and hung his overcoat over the
knob

  lets be brief here said frisbee i
want to go over and inquire about miriam
packer

  of course you do said dunaway
smiling seriously but there are some
things to be considered first lets re-
view this case a little and kind of think
out loud-but not so very loud you have
some enemies in this town i dont mean
kenehan i think he would really like to
be decent but hes never learned how and
he was put up to fix this on you george

   now as a starting point of our inquiry
lets consider who would be interested to
kill gass dubonnet you have a possible
motive revenge for the killing of your
father would anybody else have a mo-
tive whats the usual motive for the

crime of mur-
der outside

o	f revenge -
which isnt very
common well
its usually ei-
ther jealousy or
cupidity what
about jealousy
it seems a little
far-fetched tp
imagine that
anyone could be jealous of the attentions
of an elderly man to a young woman but
stranger things have happened gass du-
bonnet was only about sixty and he was a
pretty fine figure of a man mentally and
physically though lately hes seemed to
me to be rather losing his strength if it
was possible for anybody to have that
motive there are two men who might have
it one of ems yourself

  but- began frisbee rather angrily

  now dont fly off the handle george
i believe youre as innocent as i am im
just suggesting how other people might
look at this its the other peoples point
of view that weve got to consider now

  whos the other person asked fris-
bee

  why her cousin henry packer of
course hes been a frequent visitor at
her house

    

  now then there were two crimes com-
mitted last night within several hours of
each other the man who was shot-
he paused and changed the form of ex-
pression to the mystification of his audit-
ors-the man who is dead was a frequent
visitor to the woman who was shot he
visited her in fact on that very evening
only a few minutes before she was shot
and only several hours before he was-
before his own death

  frisbee and griswold looked at each
other frankly puzzled by dunaways odd
choice of words

  now continued the old lawyer ev-
ery police officer every criminal lawyer
every judge knows that its a very com-
mon thing indeed for a jealous suitor to
kill both his favored rival and the woman
who has disappointed him if jealousy
was the motive it couldnt have inspired
frisbee to commit both crimes because at
least it is clear that he did not commit the
first he was at the hotel in conversation
with doctor martin when the shot was
fired in the first crime

  could the other suitor-if you can call
either of them a suitor-have committed
both crimes  well he might possibly have
committed the first he might have com-
mitted the second if anybody any assas-
sin committed it of course we are up
against the difficulty of finding out how
any assassin could have done it

  now personally-of course i may be
wrong i dont believe that henry packer
was enough in love with his cousin to be
goaded to murder on account of her re-
jection of him and we dont know
whether she ever rejected him or had oc-
casion to henry is rather a vindictive
sort of a chap but i dont believe that
dubonnets attentions were of the sort to
inspire jealousy

  but if it wasnt jealousy was there any
other motive and is there any other person
who would be affected by it the usual
motive is cupidity

  a very interesting thing was developed
at the inquest which surprised me and
which i know surprised lots of other peo-
ple though it wasnt emphasized to any
great extent kenehan apparently didnt
think it was important i know from
slades expression that he did think it was
important but for some reason he didnt
choose to dwell on it or inquire into it at
length that interesting thing was that
gass dubonnet had before him a pile of
gold nuggets raw gold practically pure
probably worth several thousand dollars


short stories

you saw them when you looked in at the
window hawkins saw them they were
there when the doctor came it would
seem that dubonnet wasnt killed by some-
body trying to rob him of that gold or at
least any such robber was unable to com-
plete the intended robbery

  the coroner took possession of those
nuggets id rather see them in the hands
of a more honest man i dont trust mr
slade

  but the significance of their presence
is that dubonnet must have actually found
an ore body in the mine where we sup-
posed there had been nothing to speak of
-certainly no high-grade-discovered in
the last fifteen years if that is correct it
probably means that dubonnet had taken
out more of the same kind that explains
to me his frequent trips to denver with a
heavy grip he could carry several thou-
sand dollars worth of such stuff in an
ordinary satchel a good deal of it he
could take right to the mint as for the
rest any assayer could separate a few
thousand dollars worth for him that
kind of gold is almost pure it wouldnt
have to be milled or smelted it was al-
most as negotiable as cash

  and if theres any of that stuff in the
mine there ought to be a lot of the next
grade high-grade milling ore in other
words the mine is valuable probably im-
mensely valuable now in that case who
would benefit by dubonnets death

  of course if the person who would
benefit didnt know he would benefit then
it would provide no motive to him but
oddly enough-and i believe that im the
only living person who knows it so far ex-
cept miriam packer-the only person in
the world who would benefit at this time
by both dubonnets death and miriam
packers death is-

  her cousin exclaimed frisbee

  no indeed-yourself

chapter xv

a legal discussion

  at this remarkable statement the
two young men looked at dunaway
z a and then at each other as if they
doubted the reality of their own existence
frisbee spoke first endeavoring to wake
himself from this queer dream

  you say i am the only one who could
derive a benefit from the death of both of
these people and yet you believe i am in-
nocent 

  well said dunaway judicially ill

put it this way you are the only person
who could derive a permanent benefit from
miriam packers death-at this time and
you are the only person who could de-
rive a permanent benefit from dubonnets
death as it has already occurred its pos-
sible that some one else most any evil-
disposed person might derive a temporary
advantage by having him out of the way
but you couldnt have known that you
could get either that permanent benefit or
that temporary advantage

  well george said griswold this
case has more mysteries in it than anything
ive run against in my experience as a law-
yer

  yes and more dangers im afraid
replied george judge or heavens sake
explain

  thats what i got you here for its
a matter of the title of the golconda mine
give me your professional attention for a
few minutes what became of that title
depended partly on which died first miri-
am packer or gaspard dubonnet if du-
bonnet died first all the property would
belong to miriam packer for her to dis-
pose of as she saw fit if she died first
half of the property her half would go to
her natural heirs and then when dubon-
net should die the other half his half
would also go to her heirs

  her heirs who were they and how
would they get dubonnets half 

  she has only one now her cousin
henry packer you see its this way
old man packer wanted to provide both
for his daughter and
for his engineer and
manager dubonnet
his will left the
golconda mine to
them by undivided
half interests during
the period of their
joint lives with-
out impeachment of
waste to use the expression of the old
law-books that you boys are familiar with
they could mine and sell all the ore there
was in the golconda if they could find it
and get it out-until today i wouldnt have
thought that was a very valuable right-
but while both of them were alive they
couldnt sell the mine itself and neither of
them could dispose of his or her half in-
terest

  that isnt quite a correct statement of
it either because miriam was allowed to
dispose of her half interest after she should
become twenty-six years old whether du-

                                                       
the ghost of the golconda



bonnet was still alive or not in other
words her life interest in the half would
become a clear title in fee when either of
two things should happen first when du-
bonnet should die no matter how old she
should be then second when she should
become twenty-six years old even if du-
bonnet should still be alive

  why twenty-six inquired griswold
well old man packer didnt have a
very high opinion of the business judgment
of women he often said that if a man
could dispose of his property at twenty-
one a woman ought to be at least five years
older than that before she should be al-
lowed to do it

  this is rather curious said frisbee
miriam must be close to twenty-six right
now

  very close indeed said dunaway
smiling today happens to be her
twenty-sixth birthday

  the young men both whistled softly
remarkable coincidence said gris-
wold

  not exactly coincidence coincidence
implies chance i dont think it was chance
that caused her to be shot the evening be-
fore her birthday it fits too closely with
somebodys financial interests if she had
been killed last night instead of being only
wounded her title to the mine would have
descended to her natural heirs-heir not
only that but dubonnets title would go to
the same person when he should die you
see his life interest was only a half in-
terest in any event even if he should sur-
vive miriam

  packer wanted him to have the income
from half the property during his life but
it was all to go to miriam or her heirs
finally of course he naturally expected
that she would marry and that her heirs
would be her husband and children
well said frisbee it sounds fright-
fully cold-blooded-of course any murder
is cold-blooded-but this seems pretty
nearly to convict henry packer of both
crimes he would gain by having miriam
packer die before she was twenty-six be-
cause her property would go to him-

  and dubonnets half too as soon as
he should die interposed his partner

  exactly whereas if she should live
until today she could deed her part away

  and dubonnets part too after his
death interrupted griswold again

  precisely or she could dispose of it
by will so as to cut out her natural heirs


  dunaway was smiling quizzically at
them

    youre a discerning lawyer george
he remarked

  i dont know whether that is sarcasm or
not replied frisbee because for the life
of me i cant see how all this affects me at
all she certainly hasnt sold the property
to me probably she hasnt the physical
ability to make a deed today even if she
has the legal right to do so

  and if shed made the deed yesterday
do you say it wouldnt convey anything be-
cause she then didnt have any title which
she could convey said griswold

  we- responded frisbee i suppose
it could operate as a covenant to convey
such title as she might acquire later

  yes-if there was a consideration for
it said griswold argumentatively you
havent been buying mines from a lady in-
stead of playing politics here have you
george 

  boys said dunaway youre getting
into ratber fine legal distinctions this
case is simpler than that im quite sure
she didnt make any deed i certainly
should have advised her against it but
she didnt need to do that in order to ac-
complish her purpose now well continue
this bar examination a minute or so while
you bright young city lawyers tell me how
else she could dispose of her property
by will of course said frisbee
effective when

  why at her death certainly

  go to the head of the class so it
wouldnt matter when she made her will
what kind of a title she had then or in-
deed whether she had any title at all the
will would pass whatever title she might
have at the moment of her death

  this is elementary stuff professor
said george but i dont see how it affects
me

  of course you dont because theres
one important fact that you dont yet know
unless they told somebody there were only
two persons beside myself who did know
that important fact one of those two
persons is dead and the other one is
wounded and may die those two are
gaspard dubonnet and miriam packer

  now strictly speaking i have no right
to tell you this but from something miri-
am packer said to me im going to assume
authority to do so because it is a link in a
chain of evidence affecting the charge
which has been made against you and
which may be made against you again


short stories

but you and griswold must promise not to
breathe a word of it until miriam packer
releases us-or dies in that event it will
become a matter of public record

  the two young men leaning forward in
their chairs eagerly promised

  right after jour meeting yesterday
continued dunaway miriam packer and
gaspard dubonnet went to my office du-
bonnet in fact went there before the close
of the meeting he left early as you
must remember miriam asked me to go
ayith her and meet him there

  dubonnet-he was something of a legal

draftsman him-
self like most
mine managers
here in the
mountains- had
a will made out
in his own hand-
writing-

  his will 
interrupt-
ed frisbee

  no her will
it was short and he had it all prepared for
her signature i looked it over and i
must say the contents of it surprised me
very much but it was all right from a legal
standpoint-and i reckon it was all right
from a moral standpoint too a mighty
high moral standpoint

  moral standpoint said frisbee puz-
zled

  well they both explained some things
to me particularly dubonnet but i wont
go into that now dont think id better
assume that much authority miriam exe-
cuted the will herself then and there in
due form with dubonnet and myself for
witnesses i joshed her just a little about
a document which probably wouldnt be
effective for about sixty years and she
said shed attend to other steps long before
that time but she was just doing this for
the sake of-of a possible emergency
that wills in my safe now and-mind
you mums the word-the will devises all
her interest in the golconda mine to
george frisbee his heirs and assigns for-
ever

chapter xvi

found in the ashes

while george frisbee was en-
deavoring to adjust himself to this
astonishing information there
came a knock at the door dunaway

opened it and greeted the hotel clerk

  i thought you gentlemen would like to
hear the coroners verdict he said i
just got it by telephone i wrote it down
theres lots of queer things in this world
aint there judge

  dunaway took the slip of paper and
read we the jury find that gaspard
dubonnet came to his death at about mid-
night on or immediately following the th
day of october from a gunshot wound not
self-inflicted but inflicted by some per-
son or agency unknown we are in doubt
as to whether any earthly human agency
inflicted said wound but recommend fur-
ther investigation by the district attorney
of the possible connection of george fris-
bee with said crime

  well remarked griswold theres one
thing about a coroners jury they have-
nt any responsibility and they can say any-
thing they please but you see george
that regardless of evidence youre still un-
der suspicion

  but said frisbee that jury was
simply a prey to superstition lets be
sensible about this a pistol shot may be
an unnatural thing-of course it is in a
sense-but at least it isnt a supernatural
thing a human hand must have fired
that shot it couldnt have been anything
else dont you say so judge

  i would certainly say that a human-
the judge paused a moment again appear-
ing to be casting about for the right word
-a human agency fired that shot i
agree that bullets are not fired supernatur-
ally but im not going to spring any
theory about this till we clear up a few
things here are a few questions

  where is the other pistol he always
kept the two of them together and george
saw them both together on his table a cou-
ple of hours before he was killed george
didnt have the other pistol in his posses-
sion or in his effects when he was arrested
could he have taken that pistol and thrown
it into the snow on the way home pos-
sibly but why should george have taken
the pistol except to use it  and he could-
nt have fired the fatal shot because he was
here in bed in this room at the time it was
fired the clerk saw him come in and go
upstairs to bed nearly an hour before the
time when hawkins heard the shot that
alone would seem to be a clear alibi for
george unless he managed to sneak out
again and go back to the mill to commit the
murder and that would be very far-
fetched at least it hasnt been suggested
yet
the ghost of the golconda

i

  which pistol fired the fatal shot  the
pistol in the room had just been fired when
hawkins broke in and if it was not fired
by dubonnets hand but by some other
hand it might be the one which killed him
it was near his body and in front of his
hand when it was found but it might pos-
sibly have been thrown there by an assas-
sin-if theres any way of accounting for
an assassins presence in the room or his
escape from the room

  but were there two shots or only one 
hawkins says he heard only one but from
his statement im inclined to think he heard
two fired almost but not exactly to-
gether

  if there were two shots from what
place was the other one fired  i mean the
one not fired by the pistol which was
found it couldnt have been fired from
the road between the mill and the creek or
from the ground beyond the creek because
the ground at both places conclusively
shows that nobody was there it couldnt
have been fired from the bed of the creek
because a person standing there wouldnt
be in range the bottom of the creek is
too low even if the man had been on
horseback

  and how could anybody get out of the
room the door was locked from the in-
side no one could have gone out through
it without being seen by hawkins and even
if anybody had gone out of it there was no
one inside who could have locked the door
after him dubonnet gasping out his last
breath on the table could not have done so
the windows except one were nailed shut
and that one was fastened on the inside
of course if anyone had raised that win-
dow and got out it would have fastened
automatically in place behind him but he
would have been seen by hawkins and
furthermore the ground shows that nobody
did get out that way there were no foot-
prints in the snow except the half-filled de-
pressions made by george frisbee two
hours before

  could somebody have shot dubonnet
from the ore-chute asked griswold

  that seems quite impossible though i
will say that that ore-chute is one thing i
want to examine further however the
end and sides and bottom of it were board-
ed up tight anyway a shot from inside
the chute or from the top of it would have
shown a downward course in dubonnets
body and from the other side

  could the shot have been fired from
the hole in the floor in the fireplace

    

  well that would have given the bullet
an upward course but i dont see how a
man could get both his head and his arm
through a hole eight by eight inches hed
have to have them both through in order to

aim and fire a
pistol but
there was a
fire in that
fireplace when
frisbee saw it
a couple of
hours before
the shot and
also when
hawkins saw it five or six minutes after
the shot

  no i dont see how the shot could
possibly have been fired from there but i
do think that fireplace will bear further
consideration i considered it a little to-
day when we were up there and i also
considered the space below it its an ash-
heap i poked around there for a minute
vhile slade and the other fellows went a
little way up the tunnel and i found-
this

  he drew from his pocket a semi-circle
of steel the ends were bright as if they
had been recently filed it was a pistol
trigger-guard

  now boys said the judge i dont
know yet what this means but i have an
idea theres several other questions in
this case theres a question of where the
other pistol bullet went if more than one
were fired theres a question of who
nailed up the cellar door and why theres
a question of where is miriam packers
sole heir-at-law her precious cousin its
most remarkable that he hasnt been
around here all day im glad to say the
sheriff guarded the mill last night he
stayed there after he went up with the doc-
tor and the coroner bates is a mighty
diligent officer no doubt he will main-
tain his watch for several nights if neces-
sary i believe somethings going to show
up there

  ive got to go now i want to see how
miriam packers getting along and then i
promised to look at pete hawkins horse
i used to drive the stage up here when i
was a kid and i always thought i was a
fairly good amateur veterinary surgeon
right now some of the boys will tell you
that im more of a horse-doctor than a
lawyer and i guess theyre right but
even at that i do try to be a horse-sense
lawyer

a female old-timer

i want to go with you to miriams
said frisbee she wasnt able to see
me this noon

  all right come along but mind you
not a word on her affairs

  oh no theyre not for discussion yet i
know replied george but ill be think-
ing about them a lot

  miriam however so they were informed
by her friend and nurse miss chapin was
not yet able to see anybody the doctor
thought she might have a visitor or two to-
morrow if she had a good nights rest
however if they would wait a moment she
would tell miriam that they were there
she might have some message for them

  she did have a message she thanked
them for coming and hoped to see them in
a day or two had they learned anything
of the whereabouts of cousin henry 

  dunaway stroked his chin thoughtfully
you tell her he said that well look for
him till we find him

  he continued to george as they left the
house henry wasnt home last night so
his landlady says and i dont see how he
could have got out of town there hasnt
been a freight train out since he was at her
house last night and only one passenger
train that was the afternoon train to-
day the one that brought griswold up
when it went back on its return trip of
course the snow-plow came up and went
back early this morning but they didnt
take him on that the sheriff had both it
and the train watched to see who went out
of town and he asked the engineer of the
snow-plow and the conductor of the train
to wire him the names of all passengers he
might get farther down the canyon those
fellows know everybody on this jerk-
water line the wire came back a while
ago and henry packer wasnt on the list

  the wagon road isnt passable either
on foot or by wheels and theres been no
wagon or motor traffic since the storm ex-
cept locally around town of course he
might possibly have walked down the track
after the snow-plow had been over it but
it would have been pretty hard going at
that and he would have been practically
sure to be seen i believe he must still be
in town somewhere theres one person
that possibly might know thats old mag
love joy well just blow around to her
place and ill postpone my medical visit
to pete hawkins horse

mrs lovejoys place somewhat belied

her name in its outward appearance but
the old girl greeted them very pleasantly
and took them into a cheerful though clut-
tered and disorderly back parlor there
was a merry little fire in the grate there
was a bird-cage in the window and beside
mrs lovejoys rocking chair there was a
basket of heavy wool mens socks evi-
dently she had been darning them for some
of her boarders

  mag said the judge you look so do-
mestic that i can hardly believe i know
you meet my friend mr george fris-

bee	mr frisbee mrs lovejoy

  i knew your father years ago-by
sight said mrs lovejoy

  by the way george interrupted the
judge theres that picture of buffalo bill

i	was telling you about

  there it was indeed and so neatly had
the bullet holes been drilled in the pupils
of the old plainsmans eyes that at first
they appeared to be only slightly enlarged
so as to give mr cody a rather surprised
expression

  would you and your friend like a little
drink inquired
their hostess going
to the cupboard
good stuff i can
tell you and per-
fectly lawful some

i	had left since be-
fore prohibition

 i was hoping
youd say something
like that replied dunaway but dont
try to slip any of that before prohibition
stuff over on me i know something
about this town-but im not a magistrate
now im-just a sort of investigator
in that capacity ill try a little sample just
to see what its quality is

  thanks very much none for me said
george as the lady produced the bottle
never learned to use it

  well said mrs lovejoy even at
that i guess your family could make a
pretty good average oh excuse me i
didnt mean to say anything unkind since
ive said it though ill say thats the only
fault your dad had as far as i know
mag said the judge the subject of
liquor is really what we came here to in-
quire about were looking for henry
packer- mrs lovejoy raised her eye-
brows inquiringly- ive got to talk to
him about business matters arising on ac-
count of gass dubonnets death know-
ing that henry is fond of his tea and
knowing that you generally have a little-

                                                        
the ghost of the golconda



left over from before the war-and that
you occasionally accommodate a friend it
occurred to me that henry might possibly
have called on you in the last twenty-four
hours and that you might know where we
could find him

  hasnt he been to see his cousin since
she was shot

  no and shes very anxious to see him
thats part of the reason were looking
for him

  well the young pup so hes never
been near her eh thats funny ill tell
you all i know about him judge ive got

a little bit sore at that boy lately-

  does he owe you any money

  no not now he did for quite a
while but hes paid it all but i dont like
his style hes drinking too much for
one thing

  great scott that from you mag
well its the fact but i cant tell you
much he came in here last night i
should think it was a little before nine
he bought a bottle of whisky same as
this

  did henry spend any time here with
you

  no to tell the truth i didnt want
him around hed been drinking some al-
ready

  did henry have a gun with him when
he came here

  oh my god judge you dont think
he- why no-leastwise i didnt see
any of course he might have had a pis-
tol in his pocket i know he has a rifle
because he left it with me once as security
for some booze but he took it away
when he paid me a couple of weeks ago
and i havent seen it since

  do you remember what kind of a rifle
it was

  why-i dont know much about rifles
it was one of those guns that they hunt
deer with he told me it was a good one

  small cali-
ber

  well yes i
think so but
i dont know
much about it
the boys used
to handle six-
g u n s around
the house in
the old days
and ive seen
one or two shooting scrapes but i dont
know much about rifles or any kind of long
guns myself

    

  did henry say where he was going
he said-i lectured him a little about
drinking too much of course i was talking
against my own business-that he was go-
ing away for a day or two and wanted a
little to take along with him

  didnt he say where he was going
no not that i remember i just sup-
posed he was going to the city

  well much obliged to you mag
george and ill be on our way we may
drop in on you again

  glad to see you any time come again
mr frisbee even if you dont want any-
thing in my line i like straight men and
i believe youre straight like your father
was

  frisbee and dunaway proceeded up the
street in the gathering dusk

  not much information there said
dunaway but every little bit helps i
had a sneaking idea that henry might be
at her house but i believe she was on the
square with us

  so do i said frisbee

  one thing i do know continued the
judge wherever henry went he didnt
leave that rifle behind him i went to his
room this morning told his landlady i
had an appointment with him and that hed
asked me to come there and wait his
rifle wasnt anywhere in the room i picked
up several cartridges

  he exhibited two long-nosed -s

chapter xviii

falling stones

  at the hotel frisbee discussed with
his partner the events of the last
j jktwenty-fours hours

  george said griswold it seems to
me that tberes one thing thats very im-
portant and that is to see that the golconda
mine is guarded night and day until this
mystery is thoroughly cleared up lets
go over and talk to the sheriff hell
probably see the propriety of it himself
aside from any other feature of the case
the mine is miss packers property and it
seems to be a valuable property now or at
least to have some value in it

  the sheriff had gone home to an early
supper and they followed him to his
house adjoining georges quarters of the
previous night

  i agree with you boys about guarding
the mill he assured them ive had two
men there all day and im posting two
there for tonight

  not only the mill sheriff said gris-


short stories

wold i think the whole mine should be
guarded miss packer is the sole owner
now i understand if gaspard dubonnet
found some high-grade in the mine theres
probably more of it they tell me those
nuggets are practically pure gold some-
bodys likely to try to carry off fifty or
a hundred pounds of that stuff at around
twenty dollars an ounce it wouldnt take
long for a good many thousand dollars
worth to disappear how much of a job
would it be to guard the whole property

  h-mm said the sheriff not much
i reckon so far as i know theres only
one entrance to the mine besides the tun-
nel thats the shaft the shaft-house is
up on the hill but it hasnt been used
for years what httle work gass did was
done through the tunnel i doubt if the
old shaft is in good enough repair for any-
body to get down it but well just take a
look at the shaft-house if that girl has
some real pay-dirt in that mine you bet
ill see that it stays there till shes well
enough to look after it lemme hitch up
and ill drive you up there with me go-
in up there anyway to take two fellers to
relieve the boys that are there now hey
billy  he called up-stairs to his son

  yes dad

  you go up the street and get axel ol-
son and then you two boys be ready to go
with me to the mill as soon as i get the
team hitched has your mother got your
lunch ready

  she had it seemed a comfortable moth-
erly hamper of sandwiches boiled eggs
and pie with a thermos bottle of hot
coffee

  frisbee and griswold accompanied the
sheriff to the barn and watched him while
he put his faithful work-horses to the an-
cient buckboard he conversed amicably
during the operation

  motors are all right most anywhere but

not in the mountains especially in winter
our roads aint good enough for motors
up here away from the bulk of the tourist
travel and theres too much snow i dont
believe an automobile could make it from
here to the mill tonight

  well said frisbee playfully provok-
ing an argument at any rate the automo-
bile wouldnt get scared at eyes in the dark
like pete hawkins horse

  thats so too but thats because a
horse has some intelligence for my part

i believe every word pete hawkins said
and i dont believe in ghosts neither he
may not ave seen what he thought he saw
but he did see somethin thats one rea-
son why im sendin the boys up there to-
night an why ive kept a guard on the
place ever since that night

  of course mr frisbee i dont be-
lieve youre any guiltier than i am slade
and kenehan might criticise me if they
knew i was takin you up there with me
but in the eyes of the law youre an inno-
cent man yet and i believe you will be
just as innocent when this thing is all
thrashed out

  i appreciate your confidence mr
bates i assure you it isnt misplaced
im more anxious than anybody in this
town to solve this mystery

  well i think were goin to find that
murderer right around here said the sher-
iff confidently i wouldnt be a bit sur-
prised if he was somewhere in the old mine
this very minute though ill admit i dont
know how he could have got into the mill
house or out of it

   the place has been watched im tellin
you except for the time when pete
hawkins was walkin back to town an the
time it took the doctor an the rest of us
to get back there theres been somebody
at the mill ever since the murder i stayed
there till morning after the doctor went
back to town slade came up early to
look the place over and then i came back
and sent a couple of men up slade told
me hed stay there till they came

  did you notice anything peculiar while
you were there inquired griswold

   n-no i cant say that i did i thought
once or twice that i heard some little noise
back in the old ore-chute but i aint
sure

  in the ore-chute you say said fris-
bee curiously well now thats odd i
heard a thump in the ore-chute myself
when i was there with dubonnet he said
it was a rock falling down

   like as not said the sheriff casually
i guess thats what i heard if i heard
anything theres always rocks falling in
an old mine

  thats one reason why its dangerous to
be in one of em the timbers gradually
the ghost of the golconda



rot away of course and theres always
moisture loosenin the rock in the walls
and roof why ill bet the old golconda
levels and stopes are half caved in i
know old gass aint done hardly any real
timbering in the last dozen years

   so if theres somebody hidin in there

i wouldnt like to be in his place an i
dont just see how hes goin to get out
without runnin against my men-though
i hadnt thought- about the shaft it
didnt occur to me that anybody could get
out by it

  slade seems kinda crabby about ex-
plorin the mine for some reason and
kenehan was the same way until this eve-
ning seemed to take it for granted it
wasnt necessary because you musta been
the murderer mr frisbee i mentioned
it to him tonight and he said it was non-
sense to think the murderer was in the
mine and that anyway wed better wait
until miss packer got well enough to talk
about it so she could give us authority to
investigate

   well watch it just the same here
come the boys hop aboard gentlemen
well take a little pleasure drive up the
creek

  billy bates was obviously impressed
with the importance of his assignment
guarding the mill for the night as his
fathers deputy his partner axel ol-
son was a year or two older and apparent-
ly somewhat more phlegmatic bates had
a small hunting rifle and olson was pro-
vided with an army springfield

  dad i wonder how pete hawkins
ghost would like the taste of a bullet said
billy i believe if i see any ghosts ill
just start in to plug em

   you wont do nothin of the kind said
his father if you see any ghosts you
just arrest em thats all

   bill subsided while the other lad snick-
ered

   and look here continued the sheriff
i want one of you boys to be awake and
outside the mill all the time i want that
one to be near the corner where he can see
both sides of the mill an the tunnel door
an the mill door you can take turns
sleepin one feller can sleep inside for
three hours at a stretch but i want the
other one of you to be where he can see
the road and both sides of the mill and
not leave that place except to wake up the
other feller when its his turn to relieve
him you understand me boys

   they assured him that they did

   well it aint so cold tonight im glad

to say continued the sheriff but
billy when youre outside keep your coat
buttoned around you if you catch cold
your motherll never forgive me for puttin
you on guard here

   between the solicitude of a parent and
the severity of a superior officer mr bates
pretty well filled up the time with instruc-
tions and admonitions until their arrival at
the mill there he greeted two young
men waiting on the steps they seeme l
very glad to see him

   anything new boys he inquired

   quiet as a graveyard mr bates said
one of them

   h-mm replied the sheriff well it
is a sort of a graveyard youll have to
wait here boys for about half an hour
unless you want to walk back to town im
going to take these gentlemen up to where
they can see the shaft-house wed better
walk mr frisbee it aint very far but
the road aint broken and i know the team
cant make it up the hill

   he pointed out the shaft-house a lonely
structure a quarter of a mile up the side
of the mountain and apparently six or sev-
en hundred feet higher than the mill

  there she is well walk up the old
road its the only way we can get up
there and it winds about half a mile
around the mountain

   they followed him past the mill to where
an ancient road whose ruts were deep
enough to have left their outline in the
snow carpet led away from the main high-
way and took a steep course by two switch-
backs up to the old building

  the sheriff for all his sixty years
plugged steadily through the heavy snow at
a pace which his companions found diffi-
cult to follow he even had breath enough
to talk

  well one things a cinch he re-
marked this convenient snow proves
that at least no one has been up here since
it stopped falling he grinned back at
the laboring young men can you step
out a little boys or is it too hard for
you 

   they stepped out to the best of their
ability but were vastly relieved to arrive
at last panting and with their knees shak-
ing at the comparatively level piece of
ground which surrounded the front and
two sides of the old building the reat
ran into the hill

   the shaft-house was built of substan-
tial timbers and though weather-beaten
was in pretty good repair the door
however was locked


short stories

  slade has the key of course muttered
the sheriff he took gass keys along
with all his other personal stuff but this
lock doesnt look as if it had been opened
since the nineteen-ten census i doubt if
the key would unlock it now say boys
aint that a pretty view of jamestown and
the canyon from here just look at that
sunset will you did you ever see any-
thing finer in your life

  the view and the sunset were all that he
claimed for them frisbee stood with him
for a moment marveling how the sordid
village had become ennobled when seen in
the pure whiteness of the snow its twink-
ling lights beginning to sparkle like gems
on the long shadow-fingers cast by the
peaks across the canyon

  but frisbees admiration was broken by
a remark from his more practical partner

  yes its a peach of a view all right
but i wish we could get a view inside this
old building thunderation its cer-
tainly too bad that we havent got the
key 

  he applied his eye to the narrow space
between two of the upright boards

  too dark inside to see anything of
course

  suddenly he held up his hand for si-
lence all listened intently in the depths
of the mountain below them they heard a
dull crash quickly repeated twice at a
greater distance

  gosh said bates with a shudder
that must be a section of the shaft wall
failin in boys its lucky for us we aint
in that shaft right now well lets go
theres nothin we can see-from here

  the return was easy they walked
back in the trail which they had broken in
the snow on their upward journey

  the sheriff was silent on the downward
trip at the mill he picked up the two
young men who had waited for the ride
back and gave a parting admonition to his
son and olson

  boys he said mind you no shoot-
in unless in self-defense that wont be

likely but dont let anybody go up or down
the road unless you know all about em
an be ready to report to me everything
you see and every noise you hear an-
oh yes be sure to arrest all ghosts

  but after this joking parting shot he re-
lapsed into a thoughtful silence which con-
tinued during the drive back to town at
the upper end of the village he bade good-
by to his deputies telling them he would
pick them up about eight oclock in the
morning

  theres one thing ill ask of you two
fellers he added as his assistants alighted
from the buckboard an that is dont
tell anybody about our goin up to the
shaft-house tonight we didnt find any-
thing up there but i dont want it talked
about around town

  the two young men gave him their as-
surance bates clucked to his horses

  as the wagon moved down the street he
turned to the two lawyers

  boys he said i dont think its ne-
cessary to post a guard at the shaft-house
tonight weve seen that nobody but us
has been up to it or has come from it since
the snow nobody could get up there
from the town without being seen an
stopped by my boys at the mill there
aint many people up the creek an there
surely aint any of em that would come
snoopin into an old shaft at night-or any
other time if they could help it theyre
miners an theyve got some sense

  but im puzzled about them sounds
theres always rocks failin in an old mine
as i said but theres too many of em
failin there in a short time frisbee heard
one in the mill-end of the chute last night
i thought i heard two way back in the
chute later last night though if thats
what it was its odd that they didnt come
on down the chute we all three of us heard
quite a fall in the shaft tonight it aint
normal im satisfied theres somethin
goin on in those old diggins an im go-
in to find out what it is-tomorrow im
kind of anxious to hear what the boysll
have to report in the morning

chapter xix

love and doubt

sheriff bates came to the hotel
a few minutes before eight the next
morning judge dunaway was
with him inspired by the early-rising
habit of the mountain inn even on a sun-
day morning and perhaps rather restless
because of their excitement frisbee and
griswold had been up for an hour and
were just finishing breakfast

  bates and dunaway joined them at their
table in the dining-room and conversed in
low tones though there was no one with-
in convenient earshot

  mr frisbee said bates i asked
judge dunaway to come with me because
i want him to see miriam packer-if any-
body can see her-and get permission to
examine the mine i think it ought to be
done today but i dont just
like to do it without her per-
mission besides slade has
the keys to the shaft-house
and to the trap-door in the
mill and im positive he
wont give em up unless mi-
riam demands em kenehan
might force him to do it but
kenehan doesnt just know
where hes at in this whole
matter and id rather not
have to depend on him of course i
guess i have the legal right to break in in
search of a criminal

  i think so said griswold even with-
out a search-warrant the mine isnt
anybodys house

  well bates said dunaway i sup-
pose it would be possible to smoke em out
all youd have to do would be to start a
good smudge in the lowest level

  ive thought of that replied the sher-
iff but im afraid it wont do whoever
it is thats in the mine might be suffocated
by the smoke i dont want to kill any-
body in making an arrest if i can help it
and were not dead sure added duna-
way that the man in the mine or the men
in the mine-he appeared to be measur-
ing his words carefully- have committed
a capital crime besides id like to talk
to the fellow the fellows i think they
might have something important to tell us
oh said bates the thing to do plain-
ly is to search the mine but i dont want to
do it without miriams consent except as
a last resort judge dunaway thinks that
you mr frisbee have some special influ-
ence with miss packer and he wants you


to come with us can you come right
now  i want to pick up them two depu-
ties as soon as i can and as it is ill be a
little late relieving the boys i posted at the
mill last night

  but well have to get hold of doctor
martin first said dunaway and get his
permission to talk to the girl

  i certainly think so said frisbee no
matter what happens at the mine it isnt
so important as what happens to her lets
call the doctor

  he went to the desk and was asking the
clerk to call doctor martin when the phy-
sician himself came down the stairs on his
way to breakfast

  what is this gentlemen a reception
committee inquired the doctor as the
four men surrounded him and led him to a
corner of the hotel office

  a reception committee and a visiting
committee replied frisbee in the first
place we want to know how your patient
is

  my patient say do you fellows think
im such a poor doctor that i only have
one patient theres generally more than
one person sick at a time even in a healthy
place like jamestown

  oh he means your most important pa-
tient said dunaway

  oh yes of course returned the doc-
tor so far as he is concerned there is
only one well im glad to say she was
a whole lot better last evening if she
rested well last night im going to let her
sit up a little today

  thats fine said bates i want to
ask her something thats important
though its simple enough

  business matter inquired the doctor
looking serious

  yes in a way i want her authority to
make a search of the golconda mine

  the doctor whistled softly dont
know about asking her a thing like that
dont want to get her excited now her
wound has closed nicely and i dont want
to run any risk of starting a fever whats
the matter with your making a search with-
out anybodys authority youre the sher-
iff arent you seems to me i voted for
you for sheriff scratched my ticket to do
it too

  oh yes i can do it that way i reckon
and i may have to do it that way but i
dont want to id like to have her own
say-so if i can get it

  well come along to her house and
well see how she is guess my breakfast
can wait half an hour i was feeling so


short stories

easy about her i was going to wait till
id had my ham and eggs but im not so
sure about this kind of a proposition

  the whole five of them repaired to the
sheriffs buckboard and drove the block and
a half to miriams house

  miss chapin greeted them with pleas-
ant surprise at the top of the high side
stairs well i declare are all of you
gentlemen calling on miriam

  well im not going to let them all see
her responded the doctor how is she
this morning  oh excuse me i dont be-
lieve youve met mr griswold mr fris-
bees partner miss chapin mr gris-
wold

  miss chapin acknowledged griswolds
bow and turned to the physician

  why i think shes just fine she had
a splendid restful night shes just waked
up hungry and wants her breakfast i
wasnt going to give her any until you told
me what she could have

  hungry eh said the doctor rubbing
his hands well you can give her some
grape-fruit and some oatmeal and some
lamb chops and some fried eggs and a big
plate of waffles and syrup and some tea
and toast-especially the tea and toast

she can have
that now-b u t
make the tea
rather weak
you can give
her the other
things along
about next sun-
day but let me
see her wait
here gentlemen you can call on miss
chapin for a few minutes shes good
company

  the grinning men seated themselves in
the parlor while the doctor disappeared

  he came back directly shes in fine
trim this morning he announced but
i want to keep her that way i guess she
can talk a little business but make it brief
dunaway you and mr frisbee go in
she wants to see you both

  dunaway turned smilingly toward the
younger man you go in first george
ill wait a minute

  george went in the direction indicated
and knocked at the door of miriams
room come in said the voice he had
been longing to hear

  she was propped up in bed and greeted
him with a radiant smile

  i knew it would be you george sit

down beside me and tell me what has hap-
pened

  first said george i want to beg
your pardon for my cruel rudeness to you
and your guest i hope-i do hope you
can forgive me

  george i knew you couldnt help it
some things overpower us at times and
you were simply overpowered that eve-
ning poor mr dubonnet said so him-
self he didnt criticise you

  no he was very generous to me he
shook hands with me when i went out to
see him that night at the mill

  oh im so glad george for twenty
years he had been fighting a terrible sor-
row and remorse he was as sensitive as
a child but he was so-so good and kind
to me

  her chin quivered a little he couldnt
have been any kinder if he had been my
own father oh poor man poor man
why why did he do it

  oh miriam dont think about that old
affair up here in the mountains the
bloody old frontier days lasted for a long
time and anyway mens minds and pas-
sions change in twenty years

  you-you dont understand me
george but what happened yesterday 
they wouldnt tell me but i knew there
was something going on something that
involved you

  yes said george smiling grimly it
involved me a whole lot they had me in
your charming city bastille all night

charged with-

  oh george they blamed you for mr
dubonnets death her eyes opened
wide again and she clasped her hands
oh what a stupid cruel wrong

  there there i shouldnt have said
anything about it the doctor told us we
positively mustnt get you excited any-
way its all right now as far as im per-
sonally concerned they turned me loose
yesterday afternoon at the inquest

  george what did-what did the coron-
ers jury decide was the cause of mr du-
bonnets death

  she looked at him rather strangely fris-
bee thought

  thats the trouble they didnt decide
anything except gunshot by some person
or agency unknown they put in the
agency because some of them seemed to
think the old gentleman was killed by a
ghost-the ghost of my father i suppose
but they still have their eagle eyes on me
im not formally charged with the crime
but im suspected of it

  why george this is terrible it must
be cleared up

  she half rose to a sitting position but
immediately dropped back her lips twitch-
ing with pain

  oh miriam dear girl i shouldnt have
talked so much im going now theres
just one thing more i want to say-at
present there have been noises heard in
the mine the sheriff wants your permis-
sion to examine it

  the girl suddenly shrank back in the
pillows

  no no george i thought so at first
myself but i was wrong it cant be
not now not now dont ask me why
but dont let them go in there

  george was naturally amazed he start-
ed to say something but paused because
he could find nothing to say then he be-
thought himself of another commission
she had given him through her young
woman companion

  you wanted me to find your cousin
henry he said well i have to report
failure so far weve looked all over
town and made many inquiries but we
cant locate him

  i-i guess hes gone to denver-or

        

            mm

somewhere it doesnt matter now are
-are you going george

  he had risen and was lifting her hand
he put it limp and unresisting to his lips

  the hand tightened around his fingers
and drew him back toward her he
looked at her face and she drew him with
her eyes he dropped on his knees beside
her and kissed her lips he felt her arms
around his neck crushing his face to hers

  miriam precious girl he murmured
i know now i must have loved you all
my life

  george dearest-i was afraid i might
die before you had kissed me

  she pushed him gently from her so that
she might look into his face but now-
now that i shall live and we shall both
live- oh everything is different george
dont let them search the mine and
whatever you do please dont search it
yourself

  the strangeness of it bewildered him
wont-wont you tell me why he
stammered pathetically

  george oh my darling boy dont quar-
  to

rel with me george-i-love you with
all my soul ill-ill tell you later

   george was rising again

  send judge dunaway to me please

  george turned away she spoke his
name faintly and as he looked back he
saw her arms outstretched to him

  once more dear heart once more
then go

   his arms his lips found her again

chapter xx

sentry-go

she doesnt want the mine searched
now mr bates said george as he
re-entered the sitting room im
sure i dont know why but her word is law
with me-from now on forever

  congratulations dear fellow said
dunaway but let me see her per-
haps i can persuade her

  he could not however and when he
emerged in his turn he was equally at a
loss to explain why he declared that the
lady had given him no reason but that he
hoped the sheriff would respect her wishes
for the present

  frisbee watching him narrowly some-
how gained the impression that he had a
theory concerning the reason but what-
ever that theory was the judge did not dis-
close it

   gentlemen said bates i dont like
 this i think we ought to search the mine
right away i believe its important but
youre the one principally concerned mr
frisbee and ill take the chance of post-
poning it a little longer of course itll
save some trouble -and possibly some
danger-to myself and my men

  danger inquired frisbee hoping to
get a more definite idea of what was in the
sheriffs mind

   yes-theres a lot of rocks falling in
that mine responded the sheriff dryly
its always dangerous to go into an old
mine

   it certainly is agreed dunaway es-
pecially this one

   but said the sheriff believe me ill
watch it ill have to hurry now and re-
lieve those boys want to go along any-
body

   they all did it appeared except the doc-
tor

   bates stopped in the upper end of the
village and picked up the two men whom he
had taken home the evening before and
soon arrived at the mine the road had
become pretty well beaten down and in
ioo

short stories

the frosty morning before the sun had
warmed it up it was rather hard though
rough and the sheriffs horses made pretty
fair time

  they found the night guards sitting on
the mill steps both looking rather fagged

  well boys said bates cheerfully
guess youve been on your job all right
enough you both look as if you were
awake most of the night

  ill say we were said olson

  oh now axel this is just beginning
to get interesting say dad lemme stay
up here with these fellers today were
just startin on an elegant ghost-hunt
whats that you boys been seein
ghosts too

  ill say we have repeated olson
an im tellin you i dont wanta see no
more

oh protested billy we didnt see
nothin but the eyes and axel only seen
em once but they scared him to death
tell me all about it directed his
father and tell it in order

  it was this way narrated the boy
axel he took the first shift out here and
i went inside to sleep id put the cot
down here at the south end sos to be near
axel if he should holler an because i
didnt like to sleep under the ore chute
id thought i heard a noise in there like a
little rock slidin down and a kind of a
bump against the end axel didnt call me
till eleven oclock-well it was about quar-
ter of eleven- he turned a reproachful
look at his companion he did wake me
up a little bit early the big lobster i sup-
pose he got tired of doin sentry duty out
here in the cold

  well when i went out i put a couple
of mas ham sandwiches in my pocket an
after id been out here a few minutes i
took one of em out of my pocket and had
just started to unwrap the paper shed put
around it when all of a sudden i looked at
that little hole in the bottom of the tunnel
door an there was a pair of eyes lookin
at me i can tell you i was scared plum
stiff because i remembered what pete
hawkins had said about them eyes-
what you laughin at judge dunaway
the others looked at the judge in sur-
prise his mouth was open in a broad
grin

  it wasnt no joke to me continued the
boy and the others agreed with him

  go on kid said the judge youre
doing fine and i believe every word you
say what happened next

  well i kind of pulled myself togeth-

er and i pointed my rifle at the eyes an
then i remembered that dad had said no
shootin except in self-defense an thinks
i i aint been attacked yet the thing is
just lookin at me so i hollers out real
bold halt says i who comes here
but there wasnt no answer the thing
just kept lookin at me and i looked
around for somethin to throw at it but the
snow was kinda hard and i couldnt find
a stone handy an then i grabbed the sand-
wich-id dropped it when i aimed my gun
-and i shied the sandwich straight at the
eyes an the eyes disappeared quick as
a wink an the sandwich went right square
into the hole an then i started to come
a step or two toward the tunnel door im
bound to say i didnt come very fast i
wouldnt be surprised if it took me two
minutes to walk them two steps

  an then-now i cant be quite sure
about this-but it seemed to me there was
a faint glimmer of light back somewhere
under the mill anyway i heard a little
noise somewhere inside a little noise like
psst 

  judge dunaway suddenly clapped his

hand on his
thigh and broke
into a guffaw of
merriment
psst psst 
h e repeated
say kid this
is the best
ever

  the b o ys
pride was hurt
the others were
annoyed by the unseemly levity

  well said billy i-i aint abso-
lutely positive i heard it it wasnt a very
loud sound but i think i did

  i think so too billy replied duna-
way im almost positive you heard it
its just exactly the kind of a sound youd
be likely to hear

  the boy looked at him doubtfully and
rather resentfully was this sarcasm
was the judge insinuating that he would
be likely to hear imaginary sounds 

  go on please billy said the judge
im strong for you what happened
next 

  well axel had heard me holler an he
come tumblin out with his rifle in his
hands we waited a while an didnt see
nothin more an then i took a flashlight
an went close up to the hole an looked
around inside of it an couldnt see noth-
in at all i put the flashlight inside an

                                                         
the ghost of the golconda



-i was kinda scared to do it at first be-
cause i remembered that pete hawkins
thought a skeleton hand might grab a fel-
lers wrist if he put it in there but i laid
down first with my face to the opening and
looked around as far as i could see i
reached my arm inside an felt around but
i couldnt feel nothin except the rocky
ground i couldnt even find the sand-
wich it must ave rolled quite a ways to
one side i found the paper it had been
wrapped in right near the opening but i
couldnt find any part of the sandwich
nothing unnatural about that inter-
posed dunaway the ghost was hungry
and ate it up thats all i dont think that
ghost has had his regular meals since gass
dubonnet died what happened next
well nothin happened then said the
boy rather peevishly an finally axel said
he didnt believe id seen the eyes an any-
way he was goin to sleep

  i stayed out there to finish my three
hours sentry-go an bimeby i seen the eyes
again-just lookin at me out of the hole
so-i wanted axel to see em an not
think i was tellin him a fairy story-i
went up the steps an called him not very
loud he musta heard me in his sleep
because he stopped snorin but he was
sound asleep just the same i went in an
shook him awake he was kinda cross
an didnt want to come out but i dragged
him out it was about half past one i
reckon the eyes wasnt there when we
got back but pretty soon they came to the
hole again and axel-he hadnt be-
lieved me before but he sure did then-
he was that scared he nearly crumpled up
on the ground you see em didnt you
billy inquired turning to his comrade
ill say i did replied axel sheepishly
axel kinda got his nerve back after a
bit an he wanted to shoot but i wouldnt
stand for it except in self-defense as dad
had said an of course the eyes wasnt do-
in nothin to us except lookin at us that
was kinda scarey i will say but i didnt
feel quite so nervous when axel was there
with me so i says to the eyes what do
you want an then i says what you
lookin for but i didnt get no answer
looking for the other sandwich of
course interposed judge dunaway did
you feed the ghost again

  billy vouchsafed a very cold reply to
this impertinent interruption

  there wasnt any sandwich left id
et it myself now as i was about to tell
you i started up to the eyes but id just


taken a couple of steps when they disap-
peared

  did you have a sandwich in your pock-
et when you started asked dunaway

  of course i didnt say judge
whatye keep joshin me for well we
stayed there a while but the eyes didnt
come back an nothin happened then un-
til mr slade came up

  mr slade exclaimed the sheriff
yes he came up on foot about half
past two told us hed been thinkin
about pete hawkins ghost story that he
didnt believe in ghosts himself but he
just thought hed come up to see if there
really was anythin hoppin round here at
night so we told him about the eyes and
he seemed real interested and we all
watched for them together but they didnt
come again an finally he says boys i be-
lieve youre dreamin or ejse youre spoof-
in me an he says its too cold to stay
outside i went in with him because it
was axels turn for sentry-go axel
wanted to come in with us but i said no
dad wouldnt like that so he stayed out-
side mr slade sat for a few minutes
talkin with me an i asked him to help
himself to the lunch an he did an then
i said i was tired an would he mind if i
went to bed an he said certainly not
billy ill just set here by the fire a few
minutes he said an get warmed up an
then ill go out an keep axel company
how long did mr slade stay here
asked the sheriff rather severely

  well-er-dad youll have to ask
axel that

  the sheriff turned inquiringly to the
other

  i-i dont just know mr bates
  dont know repeated bates

  you-you see its like this sheriff
mr slade stayed out there with me for a
while an finally he says youre tired aint
jou kid  an i allowed i was cause id
taken the first turn an been up most of
the second turn besides an he says ill
relieve you for an hour or so if you want
to get a little nap an so i just give him
my gun an went in an sat in the arm-
chair by the fire to take a little bit of a
snooze an the first thing i knew it was
quarter after five an billy was movin

around an-

  i must have waked myself said the
sheriffs son when i went to sleep i
kept thinkin it would be my turn again
from five to eight

  the sheriff who had been glaring at
olson with mounting indignation shot a


short stories

momentary glance of pride at his own off-
spring then he turned savagely on the
other young man

  youre a hell of a sentry you are ol-
son he exploded i left
a man here to relieve you
at the proper time-and a
good man too even if he
is only an eighteen year
old kid and my own son
i didnt say anything to
you about being relieved
by anybody except me or
my deputies and you desert your post
and even give up your gun to a stranger
but sheriff mr slade aint no strang-
er hes a county officer i thought it
was all right to let him relieve me if
he-

  well youve thought yourself out of a
job with me thats all you beat it right
down the road for town i dont want you
around here and i dont want you in my
rig when i drive back come around to
my office after breakfast and get your pay
-though you aint worth a cent

  oh say dad- began billy

  oh say nothin snapped his father
duty is duty and orders is orders no
man can hang around me that wont do his
duty and no man can work for me that
wont take my orders wheres olsons
gun have him take it an git

  i-i reckon mr slade musta took it
with him when he went said the wretched
ex-deputy ill get it at his office good
-good-by billy

  he started disconsolately down the road
i suppose said griswold that mr
slade simply decided that guard duty was
unnecessary

  humph snorted the sheriff ill do
the decidin myself in my own department
well come in gentlemen maybe youd
like to look around in the mill again

chapter xvi

  a hungry ghost-and other things

the judge had withdrawn from the
group and was on the other side of
the road gazing reflectively at the

creek

  aint it remarkable he said irrele-
vantly how quick our mountain streams
rise and fall saturday forenoon after
the snow gold creek was quite high of
course it hasnt been very cold and the
snow went almost as fast as rain after old
sol had begun to get in his work and
now you d think most of it had run down

the canyon the creek has dropped more
than a foot

  say billy he continued turning
toward the group by the door wouldnt
you like to see your mysterious eyes by
daylight i think i can show them to you
again got another sandwich left in your
bucket 

  why sure i guess so said the boy
perplexed ill bring it

  it was a fair-sized basket not an ordi-
nary dinner-bucket which his mother had
packed for him but he was much surprised
when he opened it on the top step of the
mill

  well by gosh he ejaculated i guess
mr slade did help himself or else axel
ate my lunch as well as his there aint
nothin left except this little odd scrap of
meat

  thatll do fine said the judge you
just watch now while i make a ghost
trap

  he laid the scrap of meat about a foot
from the hole and sat down beside it with
his back against the tunnel door his hand
over the opening

  if your ghost doesnt come pretty soon
ill call to it he remarked grinning but
lets wait a minute or so

  that was all that was necessary billy
blushed with mortification as the ghost
appeared at the entrance an instant later
it uttered a psst-psst as the judges
hand clutched the back of its neck the
cat was rather wild but judge dunaway
maintained his grip while he soothed it

  the newly arrived deputies were doub-
ling up with laughter the sheriffs stout
form was shaking and the tears were run-
ning down his cheeks

  say judge say dad began the
wretched billy dont give me away
please fellows turning to the other depu-
ties dont talk about this business around
town

  oh billy this is too good-too good to
keep said one of the young men starling
to open his lunch box

  a cat or anybody else would get hun-
gry staying up here in this old mine for a
couple of days remarked the judge
come over here a minute billy i want
to talk to you

  he led the crestfallen youth to one side

  heres something for you to think
about lad he said in an undertone as
you remarked a moment ago its quite
singular that you didnt find any part of the
sandwich you threw at the ghost last night
cats dont care much for bread though i

                                                       
the ghost of the golconda



 suppose this cat might possibly have been
 hungry enough to eat it all even at that
 there ought to be a few crumbs when we
 look behind that door-if the cat ate the
 sandwich but if the cat was eating the
 sandwich its first meal in two days it
 ought to have been happy why should
 it have snarled the psst that you thought
 you heard

   why because it was mad or scared at
 something i suppose

  exactly now what would make it
 particularly mad lets assume that cats
 are just as natural as human beings
 well-er-it would have been pretty
 sore if it had lost its meal

   of course it would just like anybody
 else but that suggests that there was
 something or somebody else in the mine
 that was hungry too hungry enough to
 rob a cat i have a pretty strong idea who
 it was

   so have i exclaimed the boy and
 believe me ill find him i aint goin to
 have those guys callin me a ninny because
 i was afraid of a cat

  the judge looked toward the mill
 wheres your dad and the boys he in-
 quired and then answered his own ques-
 tion guess theyve gone inside so
 much the better you and ill just play
 partners in this game for a little while
  billy youre the kind of a sentinel i
 like and i owe you something for letting
 that cat out of the bag sit down here on
 the bank with me for a minute and lets
 talk about the old times you dont know
 much about the early days in this camp
 but theres some things worth knowing

   in the first place do you know that all
 the original mining up here was placer
 mining-when they washed the gold out of
 the sands of the creek 

   why sure replied the boy every-
 one knows that i reckon they washed
 gold out of the creek before they found the
 lodes under the ground

   and theres still gold in the creek isnt
 there 

   theres some of course youll see
 old tod hargroves and jed snook workin
 along here most any time in summer with
 a little mercury and a dishpan

   they make tobacco money out of it
 and i guess thats about all but the point
 im working at is that gold isnt the only
 thing there is in this creek the whole his-
 tory of the camp is in it ive camped
 beside it many a night and talked to

concluded in the next

    to

 it while its talked to me v it can tell you
  many a tory and show you lots of
  things if you have ears to hear and
  eyes to see it knows where the gold
  is hidden and sometimes it tells men
  that it knows other things i be-
  lieve it knows who killed gass dubonnet
  and i believe its trying to tell us now
  thats why its sunk so low in the last
  couple of days thats so it can talk low
  its trying to whisper to us-just to you
  and me billy and im afraid that if we
  dont get the secret some old fool like
  hargroves or jed snook might stumble
  across it and maybe the creek never could
  tell that particular secret after that or
  maybe slade might catch it-and then its
  a cinch you and i could never learn it

    now listen close i mean look close
  turn your head this way a little look
  right square in the middle of the stream
  right at the base of that rock see any-
  thing 

    well by criminy i believe i do see
 somethin somethin kinda shiny looks
 to me sort of like the edge of a sardine can
 buried in the sand

    the judge glanced toward the mill

    those fellows are all inside said he 
  now billy if this is what i think it is
  you go and tell your dad what youve
  found and i reckon itll more than make
  up for the cat you just wade in and in-
  vestigate that sardine can go below
  there a little ways where the rip-rap is
  broken i reckon a spry young fellow like
  you can get down ail right from there
  id do it myself only my rheumatismll kill
  me if i get my feet soaked-to say noth-
  ing of my kgs and besides this is your
  discovery remember boy you and i are
  partners

    in a few seconds the boy quite excited
  was stumbling through the chilly water
  which reached nearly to his knees but ran
  into a little shoal at the base of the rock
  when he pulled up the object he nearly
  dropped it in his amazement

    it was a long single-barreled pistol with
  the trigger guard filed off and the trigger
  broken off

    as billy bates brought this prize to the
  bank and handed it up to the judge at the
  top of the wall he latter drew from his
  pocket the semi-circle of steel which he had
  picked up underneath the mill it was ob-
  viously the trigger guard of this identical
  weapon gaspard dubonnets missing pis-

the mid-watch tragedy

                 by vincent starrett

          author of the missing men  the fugitive statue etc

    jimmie lavender was on his vacation when he stepped aboard
    one of the big atlantic liners but even the vacations of famous
    detectives may turn up murder robbery and sudden death

the military-looking gentleman
produced a thin expensive
watch from his waist-coat
pocket and put it away again
the bar said he sagely
will be open in half an hour

  i acquiesced with a smile he flicked
the end of his cigarette overboard and
idly watched its descent until a wave took
it then as if the action had removed
a weight from his mind he turned briskly
and continued do you play bridge mr
gilruth

  no i said thankfully i dont
where the devil i wondered had he got
my name we had been hardly an hour
at sea he was excessively friendly-
much as i understood were the profes-
sional gamblers against whom the company
had thoughtfully warned its passengers

  my wife will be disappointed said he
you and your friend are about the only
eligibles she and her sister have discovered
to date i can play-but i wont

  i resented his easy assumptions my
acquaintance with jimmie lavender had
not been without its practical value and i
had learned to distrust plausible strangers

  that i believe is my friends situation
also i replied stiffly however he must
answer for himself

  of course said he with a courteous
nod my respects to him please his
reputation is well known to me my name
is rittenhouse he added handing me his

card and now i must run along and see
what has become of my women

  he turned away and i watched him for
a moment as he threaded the crowded deck
before i too turned and went in search
of lavender it was lavenders vacation
i mused and i was in a sense his nurse-
at any rate his companion-and i did not
intend that he should be bothered if i
could prevent not that lavender was ill
but certainly he was tired and even if
the plausible mr rittenhouse were not a
professional gambler bridge was no game
for a man who needed rest

  i circled the promenade deck in my
search and at length climbed to the boat
deck just in time to see lavender appear
at the top of the aft companionway closely
followed by a deck steward dragging a cou-
ple of chairs the detective indicated a
spot amidships somewhat sheltered and
balanced an either side by a giant air
funnel

  dump em down here he ordered
hullo gilly this looks like as good a
place as any a quiet spot on the aft boat
deck is always to be preferred to the chat-
ter and publicity of the promenade im
sick of crowds

 see anybody you know i asked
casually

  nary soul said he and dont want
to ive seen the purser however and
the dining-room steward were to sit at
the pursers table-all men its rough on

                                                      to
the mid-watch tragedy

you gilly but i havent enough small talk
to be good company for the women
there are two of them looking for
you i said grimly and told him of my
meeting with rittenhouse at whose card
until that moment i had not troubled to
look it revealed that the military-looking
mans name was joseph and that he was
a major retired in the united states ma-
rine corps

  lavender snatched the card as if to
verify my assertions then chuckled de-
lightedly

  by george he cried its rit
you know him then i asked some-
what taken aback

 know him why weve hunted men
together he served two terms as police
commissioner of los angeles where i met
him a better man never held office and
you thought he was a crook he chuckled
again with great happiness where is
he

  looking for his wife and her sister
i believe

 i must hunt him up i hope you
werent rude gilly anybody else of in-
terest on board

  ive looked over the passenger list i
replied airily theres a british lord-
denbigh i think a sir john rutherford
betty cosgrave the screen actress an
italian baroness whose name i forget and
the rev henry murchison of cedar
rapids iowa

  good laughed lavender you have
them pat the baroness i fancy is the
dark woman who looked me over carefully
as i came on board she was standing at
the rail and i thought she looked as if she
knew me or believed she did she looked
italian anyway and she was romantic
enough looking to be a baroness i thought
for a moment that she was going to speak
to me but if she was she thought better
of it

  confound it jimmie i said i hope
youre not going to be bothered hy baron-
esses or majors or majors wives on this
trip or majors wives sisters either
your nerves are all shot to pieces
and you are an idiot was the amused
reply however ill promise not to play
bridge

  it would be just our luck to blunder
onto trouble of some sort i went on
morosely jimmie if anybody robs the
ships safe you are not to interfere let
the major run down the thief since hes
such a good man

  he laughed again all right said he
   



ill go and see him about it now and
off he went to hunt up his erstwhile crony
the retired major and man-hunter whom
i suspect he discovered in the smoking-
room which was also the drinking-room
for the bar had been open for several
minutes

  and that is the way it all started the
memorable voyage of the trans atlantic
liner dianthus which added laurels to the
reputation of my friend lavender and
began his vacation in a manner-from
lavenders point of view-highly satisfy-
ing and successful

  actually it was the evening of the sec-
ond day at sea that the first whisper of the
trouble i had predicted reached our ears
my sardonic prophecy however was not
accurate in its detail the ships safe-if
it carried one-remained unmolested

  the day had been warm enough but the
evening called for wraps the promenade
deck was a scene of some activity what
with the hustling stewards and the eter-
nally tramping britons who toiled around
the oval like athletes training on a track
an englishman is never happy unless he
is walking or sitting before his fireplace
and the ship had no fireplaces the boat
deck however was comparatively deserted
and lavender and i wrapped in our rugs
looked out into the windy darkness and
smoked contentedly our nearest com-
panions were a spooning couple some
yards away half hidden by funnels and
wrapped in blankets and their own emo-
tions major rittenhouse a likeable fel-
low as i had rapidly discovered had
surrendered at discretion and was playing
the amiable martyr in the card room

  an occasional steward drifted past and
once the second officer of the ship stopped
for a word and a cigarette but for the
most part we were left to ourselves

  indeed said i i believe we have the
choice of locations lavender and at

that instant the italian baroness hove into
view

her name we had discovered was
borsolini-the baroness borsolini she

short stories

came forward uncertainly wavered in
passing passed on and in a few moments
came back she was quite alone and ob-
viously she wished to speak to us on the
third trip she had made up her mind and
came swiftly to our side

  you are mr lavender she mur-
mured i must speak with you may i
sit down

  of course said my friend and rose to
his feet to assist her something is wor-
rying you i fear

  you are right said the baroness i
am very much afraid

  her english was perfect her manner
was pretty and appealing

  something has frightened you asked
lavender encouragingly

  she bent forward and studied his face
closely in the darkness

  you are a good man she said at
length i can tell i think you are a
poet

  lavender squirmed and feebly gesticu-
lated before he could deny the amazing
charge she had hurried on

  yes i am afraid last night-after i
had retired-someone was in my cabin
a thief

  the words came eagerly from the de-
tectives lips in his interest he forgot
her preposterous notion about his profes-
sion

  i think so but nothing was taken
away he did not find what he sought
lavenders interest deepened what
did he seek he asked

  my jewels said the baroness what
else

  they are valuable then -v 

  they are very valuable my friend
they are valuable because it would cost a
fortune to replace them but they are price-
less because they are my family jewels
i speak of replacing them but believe me
they could not be replaced

  my friends cap came off to the breeze
tell me how you know there was some-
one in your cabin he said	

  i awoke suddenly-i dont know why
i awoke i suppose i felt someone there
there were little sounds in the room-soft
brushing sounds-and breathing light
so light i could scarcely catch it it was
only for an instant then the man was gone
i must have made some little sound my-
self that alarmed him as he went i al-
most saw him-you understand  he
seemed to glide through the door which
he had to open to escape he made no
sound and what i saw was just black

against gray as the door opened i only
half saw him-the other half i felt you
understand 

  yes said lavender i understand
perfectly but how can you be sure it was
a man probably it was-but are you
sure 

  i think so-that is all it is my feeling
that tells me it was a man i can not ex-
plain-but if it had been a woman i think
i should have known

  lavender nodded no doubt you are
tight he said whom have you told of
this baroness

  i have told no one but yourselves you
will advise me whom i should tell 

  you had better tell mr crown the
purser he will if he thinks best tell the
captain i suppose or whoever handles in-
vestigations of this sort at any rate mr
crown is the man to whom the first report
should be made i am sure he will do
whatever is necessary probably he will
have his own way of getting at the man
who did this i would see the purser at
once baroness if i were you

  she rose promptly thank you i am
sure your advice is good i shall go to mr
crown at once you are very good
meanwhile said lavender we shall
of course say nothing good night
baroness and i hope you will not be dis-
turbed again

  we rose with her and watched her as
she tripped away to the companionway
with a wave of her hand she descended
the steps and vanished lavender shoved
me down into my chair

  stay here gilly he said ill be back
shortly

  a moment later he too had disappeared
in the direction of the lower deck

  well it had come  my unthinking pro-
phecy had borne fruit and lavender al-
ready was involved where would it end 

i	lay back in my deck chair and earnestly
consigned the baroness and her family
jewels to perdition it occurred to me that
it had been nothing less than criminal for
her to come on board our ship with the
infernal things she could just as well
have waited for the maltania and laven-
der might then have been allowed to have
his vacation in peace

  in ten minutes the subject of my pater-
nal flutterings was back

  she went all right said he laconically
i should hope she would i retorted
did you think she wouldnt

  i -wanted to be sure gilly answered
lavender kindly im wondering why

                                                     
the mid-watch tragedy



she didnt go to the purser first why she
singled me out for her attention why she
didnt put her blessed jewels in the pur-
sers charge when she came on board-its
the thing to do im also wondering how
she knows me for im convinced that
she does know me in spite of her assertion
that i was singled out because i look like
a good man i am more than ever con-
vinced that she recognized me when i came
on board she wanted to speak to me then
although she had no attempted jewel rob-
bery to report yesterday really its all
very interesting

  yes i admitted it is do you think
there wil be another attempt jimmie

  i wouldnt be surprised said he
thoughtfully in fact i would almost bet
on it

ii

in the dining saloon the next morn-
ing the company had perceptibly
thinned out for a stiff breeze and a
choppy sea had sprung up in the night
at the pursers table however we sat six
strong as we had begun the voyage
crown the purser pink complexioned and
almost ridiculously fat beamed good na-
ture upon his charges from his seat at the
head of the table he was in jovial spirits

  if there were a prize offered for the
table that showed no desertions said he
with a chuckle i think we should win
beverley of toronto who sat at my
left growled humorously there are sev-
eral days ahead of us he significantly ob-
served i for one do not intend to
crow

  lavender who had been the last one to
sit down was looking around the room
the majors wife thinking him to be look-
ing in her direction raised her brows and
smiled and he caught the gesture and
smiled and nodded back he spoke to the
purser beside whom he sat

  two of the notables have not mate-
rialized he remarked casually the
baroness and the clergyman are missing
the purser looked startled

  yes he answered i noticed that
murchison is ill i hear but i dont under-
stand the baronesss absence she looked
to me like a sailor

  he seemed worried for a moment and
looked back at lavender as if longing to
confide in him but the presence of the
others at the table prevented lavender
himself having given the officer the hint
he intended devoted himself to his break-


fast from time to time however during
the progress of the meal he glanced to-
ward the baronesss seat at a neighboring
table as if hoping to see that it had been
occupied during the moments of his inat-
tention but the breakfast hour passed
away and the object of his solicitude did
not appear the purser too continued to
be worried although he kept up a lively
flow of conversation

  outside the saloon door the detective
and the ships officer paused while the pas-
sengers dispersed

  she may be ill of course said the pur-
ser at length it was almost humorously
obvious that he would have been relieved
to hear that the baroness was very ill in-
deed

  of course agreed lavender but we
had better find out she told you i sup-
pose that she came to me first 

  yes said the purser one of my assis-
tants tried to look after her but she in-
sisted on seeing me im glad she was so
cautious about it usually a woman gets
excited tells everybody her difficulties and

then in loud
tones demands
to see the cap-
 tain as a
result the
trouble-what-
ever it is-is
all over the
ship in no time
and everybody
is nervous i
suppose im a fool mr lavender but
somehow im nervous now myself i hope
theres no further trouble

  what did you do last night

  spoke to the night watchman hes
supposed to have had an eye on her cabin
all night of course he couldnt watch
it every minute and do the rest of his
work too but he was ordered to notice it
particularly every time he passed and to
hang around a bit each time i fancy he
did it hes a good man

  and the baroness herself 

  refused in spite of all my persuasion
to place her jewels in charge of my office
of course in the circumstances if any-
thing does happen to them its her own
lookout just the same that sort of thing
if it gets out gives a ship a black eye so to
speak

  well said lavender wed better
have a look at her cabin nobody seems
to be interested in our movements come
on gilly he started up the stairs to
io

short stories

the cabin deck who is her stewardess
purser 

  mrs king a nice old soul i spoke to
her too but all i said was that the baroness
was nervous and to do what she could for
her well see mrs king at once

  he sighed and rolled heavily away and
we followed closely at his heels down the
corridors of the lurching vessel to the
stewardesses sitting room mrs king
however had nothing to tell us

  she didnt call said the woman and
i didnt go near her

  she wasnt down to breakfast this
morning explained the purser and we
thought perhaps she was ill you havent
been to her cabin yet this morning

  no sir replied mrs king having
had the ladys own orders not to wake her
ifshe didnt choose to get up

  i see well you must go to her now
and see if she needs you she may be ill
or she may just have missed the breakfast
gong and be sleeping give her my com-
pliments and say that i was inquiring for
her

  the woman seemed reluctant and hung
back for a moment then she moved slowly
off to the door of the cabin numbered
 where she paused uncertainly

  all right said the purser impatiently
knock and then go in

  mrs king timidly knocked and again
stopped as if in apprehension

  whats the matter asked lavender
in his friendliest tones seeing that the
woman was frightened

  the ship lurched heavily lay over for
a long moment and came up again we
all braced our legs and clung to the nearest
woodwork

  she doesnt-answer said the matron
faintly

  open the door ordered the purser

  thus adjured mrs king turned the
handle and with a terrific effort put her
head inside the door in an instant the head
was withdrawn the womans face was
pale and scared the purser looked angry
lavender however knew what had hap-
pened with a quick frown he pushed
past the motionless woman and entered
the little cabin the purser and i at his
heels we filled the place

  there was no particular disorder the
port stood half open as it had stood
through the night to allow ventilation
on the upholstered wall bench stood the
baroness bags her trunk half projected
from beneath the bunk the curtains blew
gently with a soft swishing sound

  even in the bunk itself there was small
disorder yet beneath the white cover-
ings with tossed hair and distorted fea-
tures the baroness borsolini lay dead

  for an instant we all stood in silence
then from the corridor without sounded
the frightened whimper of mrs king the
stewardess lavender beckoned her in-
side and she docilely obeyed

  stay here until we have finished he
quietly ordered

  good god said crown the purser in
awed dismay then he continued to stare
without speech at the bed

  lavender bent over the silent figure of
the woman who only the night before had
whispered her trouble to him

  strangled he murmured softly
killed without a sound

  good god said the purser again

  once more the stewardess scared
whimper sounded

  dont please said my friend gently
to me he said gilly can you say how
long she has been dead

  anticipating the question i had been
examining the body although without
touching it now i stepped forward for
a closer examination

  six or seven hours at least i said at
length the ships doctor-brown-will
tell you better than i

  wed better have him in said laven-
der although you are probably right
excuse me mr crown he added i
dont mean to usurp your position in this
matter

  the purser shuddered go ahead he
said ill be glad to do whatever you
suggest

  then get the doctor here quietly and
ask rittenhouse if he cares to come down
what else there is to do you will know
better than i-that is i suppose you will
have to report to the captain or something
of the sort youd better take mrs king
out of this too crown id like to talk
to her a little later though

  he looked keenly at the frightened
shaking woman but his touch on her arm
as he uttered his last words was gentle
i knew that he was wondering about her
hesitation before opening the door i too
had been wondering was it merely a
womans uncanny prescience or some-
thing more significant

  when the purser and the matron had
gone away he turned to me

  a queer unhappy case gilly he
quietly remarked do you sense it  the
beginning if i am not mistaken of some-
the mid-watch tragedy



thing very curious indeed

  without further words he turned from
the bed and began a swift search of the
cabin his nimble fingers flew as he
worked and under his touch the posses-
sions of the murdered baroness came to
view and disappeared again with skillful
method apparently he found nothing to
guide him

  when he had finished he said the
question is of course did he or she or
they-whichever may have been the case
-find what they were looking for

  the jewels are gone i asked you
dont find them

  they are not here he replied unless
they are very cleverly hidden the second

question we are
bound to consider
gilly is were
there any jewels 
that startled
me he answered
my surprised
glance

  we have no proof that she ever had
any jewels she was vague enough about
them when she spoke to us-vague about
their value-and she refused to deposit
them with the purser which was her
proper course we have only her word
for it that she possessed the jewels and
that she carried them with her none the
less he added firmly she may have had
them and they may have been stolen
certainly she was not murdered as a mat-
ter of whim

  i think you suspect something that you
are not mentioning jimmie i remarked
with another glance at the dead woman

  he followed the glance yes he re-
plied you are right i believe this all
began somewhere on shore almost the
most important thing to be done is to es-
tablish the identity of this woman

  you doubt that she is-

  the baroness borsolini  well yes
and no she may have been just what she
claimed to be and yet nobody in particular
baroness in italy means nothing of im-
portance the last italian baron i knew
was floor-walker in a chicago department
store and of course she may not have
been a baroness at all my doubt of the
poor woman i will admit goes back to the
fact that she seemed to know me how-
ever if we are fortunate we shall know
all about her before long

  again i looked a question

  last night said he i sent a wireless
in code to inspector gallery in new


york i was curious about the baroness
and her tale and suspecting further trou-
ble i tried to anticipate some of our diffi-
culties

  you anticipated-this

  no he flared quickly not this by
heaven if i had gilly id have stood
guard myself all night long i anticipated
another attempt on the jewels he added
in lower tones another attempt on what-
ever it is this woman had that her mur-
derer wanted we must have a talk with
that night watchman too before long i
wonder who occupied the cabin across the
way 

  we can soon discover that said i and
at that moment the purser came back with
the doctor

  brown a fussy little man with a beard
the color of his name had heard the story
from the purser and was prepared for
what he saw he conducted a swift and
skillful examination that proved his ability
and verified my statement as to the time
the woman had been dead

  let us assume seven hours then said
lavender that would fix the murder at
about two in the morning-possibly a little
earlier possibly a little later where the
devil would the watchman have been at
that hour no doubt he had just passed
on for certainly the murderer would have
been watching for him by the way
crown who occupies b

  the baroness cabin was at the corner
of an intersecting passage and its entrance
was off the smaller corridor b oc-
cupied the corresponding position across
the pasage and was the opposite cabin to
which lavender had referred

  ill find out for you answered the
purser but the doctor replied to the ques-
tion

  a clergyman he said murchison
of some place in iowa hes ill he had
me in last night

  last night echoed my friend

  yes said the doctor and it cant
have been very long before-before this
happened about one oclock i think
its not nice to think that this may even
have been going on while i was just across
the way

  how is he

  oh hes sick enough but its the usual
thing it was new to him though and i
suppose he thought he was going to die
the poor chap is pretty low

  he may have heard something if he
was awake suggested lavender can
he be questioned
short stories

  oh yes but i doubt if he heard any-
thing but his own groans somebodys
with him now i heard talking as i came
by

  i told major rittenhouse volun-
teered the purser he said hed be right
down he ought to have been here by this
time

  wed better go to my stateroom said
lavender theres nothing further to be
learned here i think i shall want to talk
with the night watchman purser when
i can get to him i suppose hes asleep
now doctor brown would you care to
speak to your patient across the way  ask
him if he heard anything in the night you
know and press the point any trifle may
be important

  the door opened and the tall figure of
major rittenhouse entered softly he
closed the door quietly behind him

  i heard the last question he remarked
then glanced at the bed for just an in-
stant his eyes rested on the dead woman
then without emotion he continued ive
already questioned mr murchison laven-
der it occurred to me as a good idea to
look up the nearest neighbor in a case
like this time is of considerable impor-
jtance murchison was awake most of the
night and had the doctor in once about
four oclock he got up and staggered
around his room a bit then opened his
door he saw someone leaving this cabin
and supposed the baroness to be ill too
for he thought no more about it

  four oclock cried lavender and
if he thought the baroness was ill he must

have seen-

  mrs king gasped the purser with
jnew horror in his voice

  i dont know her name and neither did
murchison said rittenhouse but the
woman he saw was one of the steward-
esses

ill

rain fell heavily throughout the
afternoon filling the smoke-rooms
 and lounges of the floating hotel
with animated conversation but in laven-
ders stateroom as the great liner shoul-
dered through the squall a grimmer
conversation went forward unknown to
the hundreds of our fellow passengers it
was feared that soon enough the ill tid-
ings of death would spread through the
ship and throw a blight over the happy
voyagers meanwhile the task of appre-
hending the murderer of the unfortunate
baroness had to move swiftly it is prob-

able that no shipboard mystery ever
occurred more fortuitously that is to say
with two more admirable detectives than
lavender and rittenhouse actually on
board to handle the investigation but it
is equally probable that no more mysteri-
ous affair ever engaged the talents of either
investigator we were a little world of
our own isolated from the rest of civili-
zation by hundreds of miles of salt water
our inhabitants were comparatively few in
number and there was no opportunity
whatever of escape somewhere in our

midst actually
moved and ate
and slept a man
or a woman
guilty of a
hideous crime
of violence yet
not a single
clew appa-
rently existed
to the identity
of that indi-
vidual unless murchisons testimony had
supplied it

   mrs king the stewardess was reluctant
to an extraordinary degree when for the
second time she was questioned about her
murdered charge at first she denied
pointblank any knowledge of the events
of the night then as lavender continued
to probe she burst into a storm of hyste-
rical weeping confronted with the pur-
port of the clergymans information she
made a statement that only added mystery
to the case

  i did go in there at four oclock she
said tearfully addressing the purser and
so help me god mr crown she was al-
ready dead

  the pursers anstonished glance went
round the cabin and settled on my friend
but lavender only nodded

  that is what you should have told us
at once he said you were afraid of
compromising yourself but you only com-
promised yourself more deeply by keeping
silent you see rit he continued turn-
ing to the major the time element re-
mains unconfused the murder occurred
at about two oclock as the body indicated
now mrs king let us have no more
evasions and no more denials if you stick
to the truth no harm will come to you that
you dont deserve tell us exactly why
you went to the baroness cabin at four
oclock in the morning

  she-she called me whispered the
woman in a voice so low that we caught


the mid-watch tragedy

hi

the words only with difficulty

  that of course is nonsense said
lavender severely but major ritten-
house had caught a glimpse of the truth

  you mean that the call board showed
a call from her room he interrupted
but you didnt hear the bell ring did
you 

  the woman shook her head

  she was probably asleep jimmie con-
tinued the major she didnt hear the
bell but when she awoke some hours after
it had rung the board showed the baron-
ess number up she answered-and
found the body

  is that what happened demanded
lavender of the woman

  again mrs king responded with a ges-
ture of the head this time affirmative the
purser was angry

  you are the night stewardess he cried
you have no right to be asleep
nevertheless said lavender she
was asleep it doesnt help matters now
to scold her what happened is this the
murderer entered the cabin about two
oclock and the baroness woke-possibly
she had not been asleep she heard the
intruder and sat up before she could
scream his hands were at her throat
there was a struggle sharp but brief and
somehow the victim managed to reach and
touch the call button the ringing of the
bell in the passage alarmed the murderer
and he fled mrs king was asleep and
did not get the call two hours later she
awoke saw that a call had come from the
baroness cabin and responded mur-
chison across the way opened his door
and saw her leaving the room a pity he
didnt open his door at two oclock
rittenhouse nodded and took up the quiz
you saw nothing in the room when
you entered he asked nothing that
would give you an idea as to who did this
thing 

  no answered the woman faintly
  was there a light in the room

  she shook her head

  then how did you know the baroness
was dead

  i-i turned on the light

  why did you turn on the light

  she had called me answered the
woman somewhat defiantly i spoke
when i went in and she didnt answer
i thought maybe she had got up and gone
out-i thought maybe she was ill so i
turned on the light and then i saw-i saw
her

  rittenhouse nodded again

   

  and then you turned out the light and
went away lavender finished why
didnt you tell somebody what had hap-
pened 

  i was afraid said mrs king simply
i was afraid they would think i had
done it

  hm-m said lavender he looked at
the major who shrugged his shoulders

  i guess thats all purser said laven-
der at length lets have the night
watchman in

  but john dover the night watchman
an ex-sergeant of the british army could
tell nothing his story was straightfor-
ward enough

  yes sir said he frankly hi passed
that room many times sir there was no
trouble that hi could see sir hat any time
hif there ad been hid ave looked into
it there was no light in the room sir
hat any time

  this after an hours questioning was
still his story

  its probably quite true too observed
lavender when the man had been cau-
tioned to keep his mouth shut and had
been dismissed the murderer wouldnt
be fool enough to attract the watchman
well rit where are we

  just about where we began jimmie i
should say answered the major

  you believe the stewardess story
asked the purser dubiously

  theres no earthly reason to disbelieve
it as yet frankly responded lavender
she could have done it i suppose but
so could a dozen others extraordinary
as her statement is it has many of the ear-
marks of truth i believe she did exactly
what eight out of ten women would have
done in the circumstances we cant leave
her out of our calculations of course but
certainly we must allow her to believe that
we accept her story in toto in point of
fact i do accept it

  it was not long after these developments
that tidings of the death of the baroness
borsolini were all over the ship exactly
how the news was started nobody knew
for everybody with direct knowledge had
been sworn to secrecy it is a difficult
thing however to hush up as serious a
matter as murder particularly on ship-
board and no doubt the leak could have
been traced to the night watchman or mrs
king or the clergyman of the ships doc-
tor or possibly even to the majors wife
or her sister it is not the sort of knowl-
edge one human being can possess without
telling to another


short stories

  the purser crown was deeply annoyed
for he was worried about the good name
of the ship but lavender only grunted
and said it could not be helped as a mat-
ter of strict accuracy it was the very reve-
lation of the murder that brought us one
of our strongest and strangest clews it
brought to lavenders stateroom the hon
arthur russell of beddington herts
england son of that lord denbigh whose
name i had discovered on the ships pas-
senger list

  all over the ship the rumor of tragedy
flew once it had started and the passen-
gers gathered in groups to discuss the

fearsome occurrence in the smoking-
rooms the male passengers bragged and
told each other what they would do to
apprehend the murderer and in the
lounges the women twittered and hissed
like the gaudy birds of passage that they
were many were frankly alarmed at the
thought that the assassin was still at large
walking among them they stated their
fears audibly and the purser was stormed
by brigades of them seeking information
and assurances of safety

  we may all be murdered in our beds
said they in effect so vehemently and in
such numbers that crown probably wished
in his heart that many of them would be

  idiots said lavender to me in pri-
vacy after the harassed purser had told him
what was going on they are if any-
thing safer than before the murder of
the baroness was not a result of blood-lust
nor the beginning of wholesale assassina-
tion the selected victim has been killed
and for the murderer the episode is over
quite the last thing he would do unless
he is crazy is kill someone else what he
wants to do now is keep himself a secret
not to advertise himself by further crime
people are funny gilly they dont think
most murderers are really very safe men
to be near after they have committed their
murder they have it out of their system
their hate or their vengeance has been sat-
isfied  the one who stood in their path has
been removed and in all probability they

will never again commit that crime the
way to stop murder-philosophically
speaking-is not to lock up or kill mur-
derers but to prevent the accomplishment
of crime or even the desire to kill by
scientific educational -methods this how-
ever he added with a smile and a shrug
is not a doctrine that i often preach and
never in public it would land me in the
insane asylum

  i was inclined to agree with his last
assertion but lavender is a queer fellow
and his philosophy as he states it is very
plausible i merely smiled politely and
at his suggestion rang the bell and asked
that our tardy luncheon be sent to the
stateroom as it happened the hon
arthur russell came in with the tray-that
is he was hard on the heels of the waiter
who bore it and he apologized profusely
for interrupting he was a mannerly young
briton handsome and likeable and we
asked him to sit down and have a cup of
tea

  i supposed him to be spokesman for his
father or for some group of the passen-
gers but his mission it developed was
quite a different one he was not seeking
information he had it to impart

  i say mr lavender he began is it
all true this that i hear  that the baron-
ess borsolini is dead

  yes replied my friend quite true
she was found dead in her berth this
morning

  and that she was- he boggled over
the word murdered and substituted an-
other one-that she was killed

  yes said lavender again there is
not a doubt in the world that she was mur-
dered mr russell

  good lord said the boy he drew a
long breath thats what everybody is
saying i couldnt believe it

 why

  because-well i couldnt thats all
it seemed too horrible why only last
night sir she was with me on deck-full
of life-and happy-why i may have been
the last person to see her alive he fin-
ished

  the individual who killed her was the
last person to see her alive said laven-
der coolly

  of course cried the boy i didnt
think of that say thats clever

  lavender smiled a little not displeased
by the boys quick admiration

  i think perhaps you have something to
tell us mr russell continued my friend
dont hesitate if you have any infor-

                                                        
the mid-watch tragedy



mation is very welcome

  the hon arthur russell gulped his tea
suddenly and convulsively then put it
aside

  well i have said he not much-
but ive got her address

  her address

  yes sir she gave it to me last night
you see we had struck up an acquain-
tance and we liked each other we sat
out on deck and talked pretty late i told
her about my school life and she told me
a lot about america and when we were
parting i said id like to write to her
so she gave me her address wrote it on
a piece of paper and gave it to me here
it is

  with something of the air of a conjurer
he produced the paper his youthful face
was alight with the excitement of his news
which he believed to be of the highest im-
portance he could have been no more
than twenty while the baroness had been
all of thirty-five although pretty enough
apparently the boy had been greatly smit-
ten it was rather amusing and rather
pitiful

  as he spoke he handed lavender the
scrap of paper that he had taken from his

pocket

  thats it he concluded florence
italy the hotel caravan thats her
writing sir

  lavender rose to his feet and carried
the paper to the light the boy too rose
and followed him the interest of both
was profound although for the life of me
i could see no reason for excitement in the
discovery of the dead womans address

  interesting commented my friend at
length very interesting indeed and
if im not mistaken very important too
im really very much obliged to you mr
russell

  im glad if its a help said the boy
flushing his eyes sparkled id like to
think that i had- suddenly he broke
off and his eyes bulged why he cried
youre looking at the wrong side

  no said lavender with a little smile
this is the right side i saw the other
side too and its interesting also-particu-
larly as there is no hotel caravan in flo-
rence that i ever heard of but it is the
reverse that interests me most you say
that she took this paper out of her bag

  i didnt say so answered the boy ac-
curately but as a matter of fact she did
tore it off a large piece and wrote on it
thats her handwriting

  he was still stupefied by lavenders
  

curious action and still certain that in a
veritable specimen of the baronesss hand-
writing he had furnished us with a sensa-
tional clue but lavender continued to
study the reverse of the fragment at
length he handed it to me

  what do you make of it gilly he
asked

  i looked and saw nothing but a frag-
ment of what apparently had been a
printed form of some kind for there were
upon it several words in small print and
a perforated upper edge the words were
quite meaningless removed from their
context above the small print however
was the one word line in larger type

  a ships form of some kind i haz-
arded torn from a book of similar
forms 

  exactly agreed lavender the word
line of course is the last word of rod-
gers line the rest at the moment
means nothing if we had the whole form
it might be very illuminating

  there was a tap on the door and a mo-
ment later major rittenhouse entered the
stateroom

  jimmie said the newcomer theres
a message coming in for you upstairs

one of the
wireless boys
just told me
and asked me
to let you
know whatve
you got  some-
thing new 
yes said
lavender
what do you think of it rit

  rittenhouse turned the paper over in
his fingers and at the baroness written
name and address he blinked

  we are indebted to mr russell for it
explained lavender and repeated the
young britons story but what do you
make of the other side rit

  after some cogitation the major made
of it exactly what i had made

  well said lavender with a sigh i
may be wrong but i thought i saw more
than that his eyes narrowed ill tell
you what rit he added suddenly take
it to your wife or her sister and ask
either one what it is ill gamble that one
of them will tell you

  the major appeared surprised

  are you joking lavender his tone
was a bit indignant

  not a bit of it im intensely serious
will you do it


short stories

  yes said rittenhouse ill do any-
thing you say jimmie but im damned
if i know what my wife has to do with
this thing

  meanwhile continued lavender lets
see what new york has to report on the
baroness borsolini ive a feeling that
another revelation is at hand

  may i come asked arthur russell
eagerly

  if you like smiled lavender but ill
be right back better stay here all of you
we dont want to parade about the ship
in groups and start a new set of rumors
he hurried away and we sat back in
our seats and impatiently awaited his re-
turn in a few minutes he was back with
a small square of paper folded in his palm

  another interesting document he ob-
served this is inspector gallerys reply
to my request for information concerning
the baroness it is in code but i have
translated it bear in mind rit that he
didnt know when he wired that the baron-
ess was dead

  he began to read the message
baroness borolini probably kitty des-
mond well known adventuress and inter-
national character if she has a small mole

at left corner of mouth it is-

  she has interrupted arthur russell
in high excitement

  yes said lavender she has he
continued to read -it is almost cer-
tain jewels probably famous schuyler
jewels worth half million stolen here two
months ago have cabled scotland yard
to meet you at quarantine gallery

iv

  at the pursers table that evening
f the murder of the baroness bor-
a jl solini was the sole topic of conver-
sation we still sat six strong besides
lavender and i and the purser there were
beverley of toronto dudgeon of new
york and isaacson of st louis the
latter three were acquainted with all the
rumors and they questioned lavender and
the purser diligently that lavender was
a famous detective and had been placed
in charge of the case was a piece of news
that had circulated with the rest of the re-
ports our fellow passengers at table felt
themselves very fortunate indeed to be so
fortuitously placed with reference to the
fountain-heads of information and i fancy
they were vastly envied by passengers at
the other tables throughout the meal
heads were turned constantly in our direc-
tion

  the rotund crown who by virtue of his
office had been harassed even more than
had lavender was inclined to be reticent
and a bit short lavender merely smiled
coldly and replied with scrupulous ac-
curacy to all questions leveled at him the
facts he admitted without reserve but he
declined to indulge in speculation

  it is obviously a case of a falling out
of crooks he concluded i have re-
ceived a wireless message from new york
which positively identifies the baroness as
a well known and if you like the term a
high class crook the stolen jewels if
they have been stolen-and apparently they
have been-are said to have originally dis-
appeared in new york some two months
ago i have no doubt that the baroness
was on her way to europe with them and
that the division of spoils was to be made
there possibly she was to sell them her
accomplices in the original theft i should
imagine are for the most part on the way
to europe on other vessels one how-
ever it would seem-or any rate some-
body who knows the truth about the jewels
-is on board this vessel there is no
cause for alarm the decent passengers
are quite safe

  she would have had to smuggle them
in wouldnt she asked beverley of to-
ronto the remark was more of a state-
ment than a question

  yes replied lavender but that plan
was probably worked out to the last
comma smuggling offers no great diffi-
culties to a clever person

  at the close of the meal we were sur-
rounded by interested questioners but not
even the wiles of betty cosgrave the
screen star could shake lavenders re-
serve we heartlessly left the purser to
answer all interviewers and hurried on
deck on the way up we passed the cap-
tain a pleasant faced englishman some-
what past middle life he had something
on his mind

 er-mr lavender he observed
mr crown has been keeping me in-
formed of course of this extraordinary
business nasty-very nasty indeed sin-
ister mr crown of course acts for me
and for the company i have no wish to
interfere with what is in better hands than
my own but you will understand that i
am deeply affected by it all may i ask
whether you anticipate a-a successful
conclusion

  entirely successful captain rogers
replied lavender seriously it is the sort
of case the very simplicity of which makes

                                                        
the mid-watch tragedy



it difficult but i believe it is yielding to
treatment i believe quite honestly that
before long i shall be able to present you
with the murderer of the baroness bor-
solini and to turn over the stolen jewels
thank you said the captain with a
nod i have every confidence in you and
in major rittenhouse too crown tells
me you are both quite famous men in your
field i am sorry i could not have you at
my table if i can be of service please
command me

  we finished our journey to the boat
deck without further interruption and
found our long unused deck chairs await-
ing us the night had cleared but a cold
breeze was blowing over the sea and we
wrapped ourselves in rugs to our chins

  you seem pretty confident of success
jimmie i ventured when our pipes were
going strongly and the moment seemed
propitious

  i am confident said he it is beyond
credence that this fellow can escape i am
working privately on an idea of my own
that i confess may not work out but it
looks promising frankly gilly it has to
do with that fragment of paper that the
baroness gave young russell but that is
all i dare say about it at present and i
will ask you to keep that much a secret
what i want of course is the other piece
of the paper-the larger piece

  did mrs rittenhouse identify it i
asked curiously

  she did replied my friend almost
grimly she identified it in a moment
because both she and her sister have papers
exactly like it rit is working with me in
this and i may hear from him at any min-
ute he is less of a figure than i in this
thing and can snoop about with less at-
tention

  we sat in silence for a few moments
listening to the throb of the ships great

engines and
the rush of
water beyond
the white line
of the rail
then i spoke
again

  gallery was
a bit previous
wasnt he jim-
mie in cabling
scotland yard
to help you

  no it was all right replied my friend
with a little smile dont be jealous
gilly i know exactly why gallery did


that he thought that i might at the last
moment feel some embarrassment in using
the wireless that is that i might find my-
self in a position where i could not use
it without betraying my suspicions what-
ever they might be to the person sus-
pected he anticipates that my use of the
ships wireless if my actions are being
watched-and rest assured they are being
watched-may alarm the murderer it
was a piece of clear thinking on gallerys
part a resourceful mans safeguard against
chance or probability

  i nodded and again we sat without
speech until a step sounded along the
boards and the tall figure of the major
hove in view rittenhouse seated himself
without a word beyond a greeting and for
a few moments we all smoked in silence
im prepared to accept it

  murchison is still ill he said but hes
coming around ive seen him again he
has nothing to add to his first statement
he saw no one but the stewardess last
night he is willing to swear to that ive
had another whirl at dover the watchman
too he now remembers seeing the doc-
tor leave murchisons cabin the incident
made no impression on him and he didnt
think of it before it was just a part of
routine to him to see brown in attendance
somewhere or other all in all jimmie
there is no escaping your conclusion and
im prepared to accept it

  yes replied lavender its pretty
certain but the fellow must be made to
betray himself we havent enough to go
on as it is its dangerously near being
guess-work you asked crown about the
baroness papers

  i did he has them in safe keeping
not a thing in them he says that gives us
a clue

  lavender smiled there wouldnt be
he rejoined laconically anyway ive
been through them twice myself

  however i told him of the fragment
of paper russell gave you continued rit-
tenhouse it startled him

  when are you going to tell me i de-
manded at this juncture where do i
come in jimmie can i do nothing
lavender turned to me very seriously
the fact is gilly he said you will be
a much better witness in all that is to fol-
low if you know nothing for a while you
can do one thing though you can keep an
eye on me i mean it the fat is in the
fire if im not mistaken and from now on
i shall be a marked man i shall go calmly
about my business as if all were well and
ii

short stories

it is up to you and rit to see that i dont
get a knife in my back or something
equally unpleasant rit and i know the
murderer the question is does he know
that we know i dont think he suspects
rit but he may suspect me and the more
innocent you appear gilly the better it
will be all around but keep your eyes
open

  all right jimmie i replied obediently
but i was horrified by the turn the case
was taking and for a long time i sat and
thought deeply while the two curious fel-
lows who were with me actually sat and
talked about baseball

  who by any chance could have com-
mitted the crime who had the oppor-
tunity i faced the problem squarely and
admitted that there were plenty of persons
who could have done it in addition to the
great numbers of obscure passengers first
and second class who had not even been
named in the inquiry there were undoubt-
edly half a dozen principals who might
very well be definite suspects the second
class outfit i was inclined to disregard for
a second class passenger surely would have
been noticed by one of the stewards if he
trespassed on holy ground and yet as i
came to think of it was there so much
difference between a first and a second
class passenger actually i was forced
to admit there was none so far as appear-
ance was concerned of the principal
figures however five at least as i now
numbered them stood forth clearly as pos-
sibilities all had been or could have been
near the scene of the murder at the time
it occurred and with something of a
thrill i realized that i must add young
russell to the list i did not for a moment
suspect him but for that matter i hardly
suspected any of the others

  and lavender was in actual active dan-
ger of one of them clearly there was
only one thing for me to do and that was
to watch everybody i resolved to watch
the entire ship from the captain down not
excluding rittenhouse himself since i
was to be lavenders guardian by heaven
i would suspect everybody

  in this frame of mind i went to bed and
dreamed a mad fantastic dream in which
the captain of the liner which curiously
had become a pirate ship stole into laven-
ders stateroom and stabbed him with a
fragment of paper while the baroness
borsolini joined hands with rittenhouse
and danced around them waking with
a start i sat up and listened finally i
knocked three times on the wall of my

cabin and listened again after a pause
there came back to me lavenders reply
in similar code and after this perfor-
mance i turned over and managed to get
to sleep

  the morning of the fourth day broke
clear and fair and cold i went at once to
lavenders room to find him already up
and gone he did not appear until break-
fast and i had no opportunity to ask him
where he had been but it occurred to me
that he was not playing fair if i was to
guard him against assassination he ought
at least to keep me posted as to his move-
ments so i thought

  breakfast passed with the usual chatter
about the uppermost subject in everybodys
mind and at a table not far removed from
ours sat murchison the iowa clergyman
eating his first meal in the saloon he
looked pale and thin but happy to be on
earth and able to eat later i saw him in
conversation with the purser and still later
with the captain was he then the heart
of the mystery and were the coils begin-
ning to tighten 

  lavender too had a brief talk with the
captain after which they vanished in com-
pany while rittenhouse and the purser
talked in low tones at the door of the lat-
ters office obviously something was
afoot and i felt strangely out in the cold
then mrs rittenhouse and her sister
miss renshaw corralled me and for an
hour i was forced to sing the praises of
my friend lavender to their admiring ac-
companiment

  after this however the suppressed ex-
citement seemed to loosen up and for an
entire day the routine of ship life went 
quietly forward with only casual mention

of the crime
some g a y e t y
was even ap-
parent in the
lounges and
smoking - rooms
and i reflected
sardonically o n
the adaptability
and the callous-
ness of human
nature the fifth
day would be the
last on board
for the sixth
morning would
bring us into port it was this knowledge

i suppose that cheered the passengers al-
though the lord knew that the voyage had
been anything but boresome

                                                        
the mid-watch tragedy



  when i asked lavender what progress
had been made he answered merely that
he was waiting

  on the fifth morning i suddenly re-
membered that the day was the anniver-
sary of my birth-not a particularly sig-
nificant occasion heaven knows but at
least a subject for trivial conversation
lavender however greeted the tidings
with singular enthusiasm and promptly
ordered a splendid dinner for the evening
rittenhouse ordered wine during the after-
noon to drink my health and mrs ritten-
house and her sister embarrassed me im-
mensely by presenting me with ridiculous
speeches with tiny bottles of perfume and
post-shaving lotion purchased of the ships
barber the dinner went off with gusto
with everybody ordering champagne and
making idiotic addresses to which i lamely
responded my humble birthday indeed
was made an occasion for strained nerves
to relax and for worried men to forget
their problems to cap the climax when
i went to my cabin in the evening there
was a gorgeously wrapped and tied box
of cigars and cigarettes with the captains
card attached to it and a huge box of can-
dies with the pursers compliments sim-
ilarly presented i felt excessively guilty
about these latter gifts feeling as i did
tliat they were intended to show apprecia-
tion of lavenders services lavender
however only laughed and was pleased
that my birthday should have passed off
so well

  any occasion is good for a celebration
at sea he observed

  late in the afternoon we had dropped
anchor in the outer harbor of cherbourg
while a tender took off our passengers for
paris then with a fresh breeze we had
headed for england and the end of the
voyage i had noted that during the
transfer of passengers for france laven-
der stood at the gangplank stretched be-
tween the steamers and carefully observed
every person who went aboard the tender
for a time i had looked for fireworks
but apparently there was no call for his
interference

  we sat late that night upon the deck
the three of us and for a time the purser
made a quartette it was with reluctance
that crown took his departure

  we dock in the morning he said as
he prepared to go ive a nasty report to
make to the company mr lavender you
havent anything to tell me that will make
it easier

  the report will be full and complete

replied my friend the murderer will be
apprehended at quarantine by scotland
yard officials and the jewels will be turned
over at that time

  crown was startled and amazed

  you dont mean to say that-that
youve got your man

  not yet said lavender but i shall
certainly get him crown he is one of the
officers of this ship

  the pursers jaw dropped his fat
cheeks sagged his eyes searched the eyes
of lavender

  my god he said im almost afraid
to ask you-who he is

  suddenly he got to his feet will you
come to my cabin he asked this is
no place to discuss what you have to tell
me

  lavender nodded his head and stood up
they moved off together in the direction
of the forward deck

  ready gilruth said the major
sharply and i saw that his face was hard
and set his limbs braced after them
quickly

  the sudden intelligence seared my brain
like a hot iron and then i went cold but
rittenhouse was already on his way and
mechanically i followed him

  we were none too soon lavender and
the purser had barely disappeared beyond
the cheek of the wireless cabin when the
huge criminal fell upon his companion
there was a shout and then a scuffling of
feet and the sound of blows the next
instant rittenhouse and i were on the
scene

  in the deep shadow of the piled life-
boats a desperate struggle was in progress
with the rail and the water dangerously
close even as we reached them the
wrestlers pitched toward the edge the
great bulk of the purser was forcing the
slimmer figure of lavender back over the
rail i heard the cold rush of the water
and the heaving breathing of the comba-
tants the wind snatched away my cap
and tingling spray beat upon my face

  then rittenhouse was upon the purser
like a wolf and with cleared wits i was
beside him aiding

  the powerful crown fought like a
maniac but the odds were now against
him and slowly we wore him down hag-
gard and disheveled he struggled to the
last at length rittenhouse tripped him
and brought him down with a thud that
seemed to shake the deck kneeling on
the great heaving chest of the beaten man
the major forced the pursers wrists to-

short stories

gether while lavender snapped on brace-
lets of steel as the struggle ended cap-
tain rogers and his first officer ran up out
of the shadows

  mr crown mr crown panted the
captain what is the meaning of this
but as the purser could only glare and
foam lavender slightly breathless re-
plied for him

  it means sir said he that mr
crown has just been frustrated in an at-
tempt to throw me overboard major rit-
tenhouse and mr gilruth prevented him
as i explained to you our actual evidence
was slight and it became necessary to
force mr crown to incriminate himself
the attempted murder of james e laven-
der will do for the present charge later
it will be changed to something more
serious

  the first officer was incredulous

  do you mean he began that mr
crown had anything to do with-

  i believe the murder of the baroness
borsolini to have been accidental an-
swered lavender none the less it was
mr crown who committed the crime
suddenly the fat face of the prostrate
man wrinkled like that of -a child and the
great frame began to heave then sobs of
anguish broke from the lips and incredible
tears rolled down the massive cheeks

  i didnt mean to kill her sobbed the
purser i swear to god captain it was
an accident i never meant to kill her
so help me god it was an accident

v

with the purser safely locked in
his room under heavy guard
lavender in the captains cabin
repeated the tale as chronologically it
should be told

  the baroness borsolini said he was
really kitty desmond a well known ad-
venturess crown has made a full con-
fession to me and to rittenhouse miss
desmond was made the repository of the
stolen schuyler jewels and sent to eng-
land with them where they were to be sold
i imagine and the money divided she
recognized me when i came on board and
wondered if i were on her trail it wor-
ried her and she made the bold play of
coming to me with a cock-and-bull story
of attempted theft in order to find out
what i knew and if i knew nothing to
gain my sympathies i am convinced that
there was no attempt on her room the
first night

  crown however recognized her she
had been a frequent voyager on the at-
lantic and many men knew her she had
been pointed out to crown a year ago on
another ship he knew
only that she was a
police character and
probably up to no good
when i sent her to
him to test her story
she was obliged to carry
the thing through and
tell him the same story
she had told me she
trusted crowns office
as she had every right to do and actually
deposited the jewels there and received
the usual receipt

  but the temptation was too great for
crown he was desperately hard up-
deeply in debt-back home in england it
looked to him like a sure thing he would
keep the jewels himself steal the receipt
which had been issued to kitty desmond
and defy her to say anything he was
of course in a position to fix the records
in his own office and being a matter of
routine no one else likely to remember the
issuing of that particular receipt there
could be no appeal for the woman her
story would be laughed at if she reported
it for her reputation was against her
probably she would accept the inevitable
and make no outcry

  crowns slip occurred when on the
second night he stole the receipt which
had been given her she woke up and to
keep her from screaming he choked her
his reputation depended upon his silencing
her at least until he could talk to her if
he had not killed her he would have
offered her-when she caught him in the
act of theft-a share of the profits un-
fortunately she died under his hands he
is stronger than he suspects he got the
receipt however and fled no one saw
him he had timed everything very well

  as it happened in giving young russell
a false address the night before the
baroness-so to call her- had torn off a
fragment of the receipt the only piece of
paper that came to hand in the darkness
whether she knew what it was or not
we shall never know perhaps she did
for she tore off only a small piece not
enough to spoil the receipt but there was
enough of the print on the reverse of the
written address for me to guess what the
entire paper must have been if then she
had deposited something with the pursers
office the purser had lied when he told me

                                                       
the mid-watch tragedy



she had not in the circumstances the
logical conclusion was that she had de-
posited the jewels

  crown is a bold man and he played his
part well once he was forced to it but
in the end i let him know through ritten-
house the importance i attached to a cer-
tain fragment of paper as he had the
rest of the paper himself he knew very
well what it was that i had and what i
probably suspected he tried to bluff it
through even tonight for he wasnt posi-
tive that i knew and he had destroyed the
rest of the receipt nevertheless he was
badly frightened and he had already re-
solved to get rid of the jewels and try to
clear his skirts

  as for me my case was purely circum-
stantial and would have been difficult to
prove in law i had to force crown to in-
criminate himself i told him point blank
just before he sprang upon me that he
would be arrested told him where the
jewels were and asked him what he in-
tended to do about it you know the
rest

  and a wonderful beginning of your va-
cation it has been i said bitterly looking
at his lacerated hands

  dont be silly said lavender i
never enjoyed myself more in my life
this has been just what i needed and
im sure the sea air as a background has
been very beneficial to my nerves

  but where are the jewels asked the
captain suddenly

  i asked gilruth to bring them with
him replied lavender with a smile as
a last resort crown tried to get rid of
them as i said and so he palmed them off
on gilly the birthday gave him his
chance the jewels are at the bottom of
the box of candy which was the pursers
gift to my friend

  whereupon i emptied the box onto the
table and the chorus of exclamations that
followed were lavenders reward for his
efforts and the final proof of the truth of
his deductions even though later the sui-
cide of albert crown made legal proof
unnecessary and made unnecessary the
prosecution of that unfortunate man

plazas cover an area two miles long and a mile wide and beyond this in every direction for
miles stretch the homes of the humbler folk of the lost race

    the work of excavating the ruins of chichen itza the center of the old civilization from
the jungles of yucatan is being carried on by an expedition of archaeologists sent by the
carnegie institute of washington it began last may and probably will take ten years
according to the estimate of dr sylvanus g morley who heads the work

    part of the excavation already done discovered to the explorers beautifully carved
columns whose great numbers have given to the court which was the center of the old city
the name of the court of a thousand columns in it has been found a figure of ku kul-

    a map of the ancient capital has been prepared by j o kilmartin of the united states

 author of denisons final ride the white trails end etc

  pitilessly hunted by his enemy man the great wolf sought the refuge
  of his native desert through the night he made good hunting but

  there was loneliness in his heart-until the deep throated pulsing

  call he sent across the darkness brought the answer he awaited

the desert was a place of exotic
grandeur of silvered half-lights
and toned shadows from a
heaven of vast distances came
the subtle mercuric glow of
myriad stars like crusting diamond chips
on the softness of purple velvet the night
was a time of magnificence unparalleled
by the hours of day the joshua trees and
the giant yuccas were dark weird sentries
in the elfin hours when nalin the night
girl as the old legend called the moon
came from her cave and rode her celestial
pathway illuminating the flats with her re-
flected beneficence

  the awkward branchings of the desert
trees and the crude forms of the giant cac-
tus lent unreality and added confusing
shadows the sharp leaves of the sotol
the cats claws the great dagger plants and
all manner of queer growths lost their for-
bidding appearance and merged into false
softness under the nights touch of magic

  it was such a night as shinav the great
wolf god might choose for one of his sal-
lies against the things of evil loosing his
arrows that the white men find in the val-
leys which are stained with the blood of
strife and finding them call them petri-
fied trees

  the desert was under the spell of the old
gods now and hie power of the newer

things could not prevail enchantment
and almost forgotten spells could work
again for a few brief hours not a night
breeze stirred from vague distances
came the unreality of a coyotes voice lost
at last in the far waste places one thing
moved it was a shadow a darker streak
than the purples it wavered in and out
among the spiny growths and it made no
sound in passing there was solidity
about it yet it was as a wraith in the night
dark sinister strange

  far off inaudible to ears less keenly at-
tuned to read the message of the very cur-
rents of air was a sound other than that
of the coyotes voice the great wolf
stopped and there was a silent snarl the
hunting pack sent forth by men was baffled
again

  it had happened before often they
had harried him and he had retaliated
against their masters it was ceaseless war
with extermination the only terms that
could end it ten miles each night the
great lobo had circled in days that were
gone making his kill sometimes when hun-
ger drove him into the herds of men but
after a fashion this was their fault his
kind had existed on the buffalo and the
antelopes before the white man came
now that ten miles circle was a thing of
the past the trailing dogs and the fight-
under the mating moon



ing pack that yipped so eagerly behind
them drove him afar at every opportunity
into the desert wastes they could not track
him here on the hot sands even their
keen noses were at a loss

  not so with him here he found com-
fortable abode and how he hated them
to him all dogs were anathema there
had been nights many of them when he
had deliberately used every wile of that
cunning brain to lure the fleetest of them
away from the others they were big dogs
these long-eared deep-voiced hounds and
game to death but he held them in con-
tempt only once had his plan worked
that night he sat on the rising slope above
a ranch house and howled his fierce de-
fiance at the race of men and their dogs
then the pack came their trailing methods
forgotten in the mad pell-mell of the sight
hunt

  two of them distanced the rest by a full
hundred yards and the great lobo held
back that amazing burst of which he was
capable a dark arroyo opened in front
and he sped nimbly down its steep sides
with the big hounds following at the
bottom an explosive thing happened the
lobos feet seemed scarcely to touch the
fallen sand as he leaped in and slashed
twice then he trotted in that shambling
fashion on up the aroyo circled a patch
of greasewood and was gone into the night
while the trailing pack stopped by their
dying companions resumed the chase too
late

  tonight again he had tried it but one
lesson was sufficient for these dogs which
had been brought only after poison and
traps failed and tonight they had hung
together and chased him long hours after
they took the trail he left them at the edge
of the desert and he was tired new un-
derstanding of their gameness came in that
chase he hated them with an unreason-
ing hatred

  perhaps some of the emotion which had
never found opportunity in his own kind
and therefore soured within him went into
that hatred in the years of his maturity
he had never known another of his breed
by the hand of man which distributes
poisoned haits cleverly concealed his
mother had died he had seen her pick
up the piece of meat then fall writhing in
the awful convulsions that the strychnine
wolf pill brings an iron thing with sharp
jaws had leaped out of the earth near a
freshly killed calf and held the leg of his
litter brother until the men came and killed
him two of the shaggy fighting dogs had


caught and killed the other member of the
litter a small female and since that time
the lobo understood all the hunting wiles
of men so well that they termed it un-
canny

  on all the sweet grass ranges in the
cooler hills amid the hot wastes of the
desert there had never been an answer to
his long deeply reverberating howls and
now he trotted in that strange slinking
gait amid the desert growths and his mind
was filled with hatred for the pack that
was left so far behind he was their mas-
ter individually in every quality and
he was their master even as a pack in some
things in power of fang in the cunning
of battle he was more than a match for any
of them more for any three of them
in speed in shrewdness he surpassed them
all together there was nothing of vanity
none of over-confidence in that supreme
contempt he knew for them he had tested
them in every fashion and gauged them
nicely

  here they would not come after him
the desert was his sanctuary he ruled it
supreme and accorded respect only to the
side-winders and the red rattlers that were
to be found within its reaches

  miles behind him on the very edge of
the sand waste the dogs had given up but
the lobo went on and here the desert was
broken its sharp luxuriant vegetation
gave way to sparser and even sharper
growths amid the rocky outcroppings that
told of rising heights and the ancient
mountains century plants and spanish
daggers grew in crevices the shadows
were stronger sharper cut and more dense
a sense of harsh mysticism pervaded
there were luring valleys that were prom-
ising but that promise too was false

  into the entire region the lobo fitted by
every characteristic about him was that
same indefinable harshness it was as
though in him the vaguely ominous spirit

o	f the wastes
found being he
was the symbol
of the inanimate
living a thing
that represented
death and hard-
ness and hate
yet there was
something
strangely sinu-
ous about him
as he moved suggestive of slinking power

  once he stopped with forefeet on a rock
silhouetted against the soft glow of the


short stories

heavens his head rose muzzle high and
went back his mouth opened and the
long fangs that were turned inward in-
stead of out as are those of a dog
gleamed but no sound came and in his
eyes was a greenish fire clouded flaming
ebbing

  thoughts of the pack he had left so far
behind dulled and faded he had nothing
in common with them thief and mur-
derer of the wild reaches they considered
him and to him they represented all that
is deserving only of death tonight they
had run him long he was tired but the
silences of these desert mountains did not
bring him content again he halted and
that lambent flame in his eyes was opales-
cent in the darkness

  high in the heavens the night girl
flooded her pale softness diffused into in-
terminable distances it was magic irre-
sistible again the lobo stopped and his
head went back there was a low sound
like the yip of a tiny dog then from deep
in his chest came the howl it was heavy
throaty a great basso it rolled forth as
thunder in the distant hills throbbing
beating rising in tone as it fell in volume
in it was unfathomable depth of loneli-
ness over the miles it pulsed long drawn
to merge at last with and die in the still-
ness it was the wail of a wraith that is
lost in outer darkness

  an interval of silence followed then it
pulsed forth again straight up to that moon
of magic and back to the far reaches of
the desert carried by echo

  a night breeze stirred hot a moving
current close to the sand and rock drifting
into the crevasses circling about to curl
up there amid the rocks the great lobo
stopped then sank to a crouch and stif-
fened those flames of greenish hue
played and faded in his eyes as cold fire
in the boreal skies

  there was no perceptible movement yet
he seemed to be up alert tense the
clouded fires were brighter in his eyes
noiseless as one of the ghost folk which
the red men assert wander of nights in
these mountains of the desert he moved
and was lost in the stygian blackness of a
rocky dip where the boulders lay in jum-
bled fashion a patch of moonlight re-
vealed a flitting shadow and he was gone
again into the blackness where the celestial
illumination did not penetrate this was
the cunning of his brain and instincts
masterful at all the arts of concealment
only his eyes were visible in the darkness
and it may have been the intensity of hate

that made them glow so vividly as though
eager fires burned

  that hot ground breeze came steadily
and was stronger as he crossed a sharp
ridge and went down into the forgotten
bed of an ancient watercourse that told of
the days when the world was young his
advance became a swift lope the mane was
stiffened about his neck and added an ap-
pearance of weightiness as though he was
swollen abruptly he went into a crouch-
ing run a fierce closing rush and stopped
head high over a cringing form a rum-
bling was in his chest an ominous sound
but he looked away from that lighter cow-
ering thing

  minutes passed and the two figures were
motionless like graven things the lips
of each were lifted and a stray shaft of
moonlight filtering through a break in the
rocky ridge revealed the bared fangs of
dog and wolf

  theirs was a hatred of heritage an emo-
tion developed through the centuries be-
tween them was a chasm greater than
anything which separates the races of man
its depths sunk into the chaos of utter hate
tonight the hunting pack from the ranches
of men had run him miles every booming
mouthing of the trailers every sharp yip
of the fighters pronouncement of the hate
of their kind for him and he had led
them on hoping to separate one or more
from the rest that he might kill them alone
no individual among them could cope with
the speed of his lunging stride and he had
longed for just this opportunity-but he
did not leap in to attack

  slowly he backed off a few stiff-legged
steps and sat down his head went up and
his keen muzzle was pointed at the silvered
stars across the desert that awful throb-
bing roar sounded beating pulsing rising
in cadence to the desolation of utter lone-
liness there had never been an answer
to that wail though at times he sent it forth
often through the night and traveled afar
over the sand wastes and the rock

  the dog trembled at that sound and the
great wolf approached again and stood
close towering over the lighter form of
the hound he leaped back once lightly as
a wind blown leaf and the dogs teeth
clicked on empty air again and again
he advanced stood close and leaped nim-
bly to avoid those teeth also he saw the
pathetically thin flanks of the dog that
rose and fell so rapidly in strained panting
at the slightest exertion and then he fol-
lowed a few feet behind as the dog moved
weakly off to where a rock overhang shut

                                                        
under the mating moon



out even the dim glow from above

  throughout the hours of night the lobo
hung close at times he too was gone
from sight beneath that overhang only to
appear suddenly bounding back into the
open like a rubber thing but the inter-
vals were longer and at last he did not re-
appear

in the eastern sky rose tints diffused
the gray and spread as bands of
orange the heat colors rising on the
brow of day the last star was gone and
the time of mystic enchantment gave way
to that harsh reality the heat increased
and the sands and rock magnified it and
gave it back until the heat waves became
visible dancing their oppressive haze
higher and higher from the surface the
rocks took on reddish hues and browns
shading to sepias and crimsons it was as
though nebulous flame from that inverted
cauldron in the heavens touched and fired
them the flats with their tawny sand
glittered and the cactus and other growths
cast thinnest of shadows that werelost en-
tirely as the sun passed overhead grad-
ually it westered and the jagged crests of
stone in the mountains gave lengthening
shadows the fierce reds the mad colors
of the rocks faded to the hue of dried
blood became dun and deepening browns

  under the rock overhang something
moved a long gray brown head with
slanted reddish eyes appeared and the lobo
lay with muzzle on forepaws watching a
lengthening shadow of purple that came
from a sharp needle of rock

  dusk was in the canyons ere he moved
sitting up he yawned and his head turned
in a slow half circle peering all about
then he got up stretched and moved out
into the world of vague shadows even as
one of them on the high ridges were
tints of red gold as the last rays of the sun
burnished them to richly metallic color-
ings higher toward the peaks that last
touch of day mounted and was gone at last
stars were out and in the east the brass
disc of the night girl appeared to claim
her world of desert

  through the night the lobo moved a
part of it once he stopped on a low shelf
of rock and looked away toward the east
where lay the lands of men with their
herds and their calves that were so easy to
take he looked toward them over the
miles and his muzzle wrinkled and lifted
slightly in what might have been a snarl
but he went on toward the south a mov-
ing segment of the vague darkness and

   

remained among the mountains the miles
passed under that swift lope once a coy-
ote fled streaking low across the wastes
at his approach and a few moments later
a bagnio of sound told that it had stopped
to voice its resentment at the invasion of
another to its solitudes

  the lobo paid no heed and passed over
a broad table of rock then down into a
widening canyon his pace was slower
now and often he stopped to test the air
he dropped into a crouch and his mane
was up again where the canyon spread
broad and flat there was running water
cold from the springs of hidden caverns
far back in the mountains but the scent
that came to the lobo was not of water
it was the man scent

  those lambent flames played more
strongly across the great lobos eyes and
he was up silently he trotted off swing-
ing wide and testing the air uneasily he
looked back often as he went down the
canyon to where the sage growths started
in the lower reaches there he leaped
forward in a galvanic burst that was like

the swishing of a
sudden gust the
huge jackrabbit
at which he had
leaped bounded
up a fraction too
slow and died be-
fore it could
squeak the lobo
appeased his hun-
ger somewhat
then went on and
a half mile be-
yond the tragedy was repeated for he was
a masterful hunter by every instinct but
this second jack he did not eat a few
moments he rested then picked it up and
carried it down to the water there he
lapped a long time again took up the rab-
bit and turned back as he had come back
through the rock wastes of the rugged
desert mountains only the moon saw his
passing and the eastern sky was pale with
the dawning as he came to the rock over-
hang still carrying the jack in his great
jaws

  again followed one of those days of
heat of glaring light and fierce tints on the
rocks a day when the world was a place
of flame and reds darkening to deepest
browns that turned to purples as the long
shadows crept and with the advent of
dusk the lobo appeared once more his
way led again as it had the night before
and when he came to the place where the


short stories

drifting currents of lazy air brought him
the man scent he stopped as he had the
night before his lips lifting in the silent
snarl of hatred

  he went on down toward the sage flats
where he had killed the jackrabbits all un-
aware that through the night a lighter
form had followed him from the rock
overhang as the dog came to where the
breeze drifted up with its scent from the
prospectors camp it stopped looked in the
direction the lobo had gone whimpered
and hesitated twice it started toward the
canvas flap of the mens camp only to halt
each time and peer through the darkness
after the lobo then it went on down to
the man a tall dark figure

  eagerly the man welcomed the hound
his words were kindly as he knelt and
examined the scrawny form in which the
marks of starvation and thirst were evi-
dent

  i thought you were gone sure he
said an i tramped two whole days lookin
fur you where you been

  the dog whimpered looked at the man
then turned its head to stare away into the
darkness where down in the flats the lobo
hunted long

a jack got up far in front of the
hunting lobo and sped off with such
an advantage that even his speed
could not overtake it an hour went by
and another as he ranged along with head
low seeking air currents that hung closest
to the ground at last came his chance
and he drove in crushing down a small
sage clump wherfc the jack nestled he
was intensely hungry himself but he did
not stop to eat as he had the night before
instead he looked toward the heavens it
may be he measured the hours of night
that remained to travel the distance to the
rock overhang once again he stopped at
the creek to drink and the water increased
his hunger but he picked up the jack and
fell into that trotting lope which consumed
the miles

  the heavenly lights were paling and the
first ribbons of rose and orange in the east
were the heralds of day as he came to the
rock overhang he was gone beneath it
but emerged almost instantly without the
rabbit there was something eagerly alert
about him and he ranged in a wide circle
with head high in the air once he howled
that deep-throated pulsing howl the
fierceness was gone from it and the lone-
liness was intensified he stopped to listen
then howled again his head came down

until his muzzle was close to the rock and
sand it seemed there was something
frantic about his movements as he circled
back and forth

  one brief moment he halted sniffing
then sped off head low a little while-yet
that scent would hold it was very faint
even his keen nostrils might have passed
it by unnoticed under other circumstances
an hour more and it would vanish entirely
under the touch of the suns rays his
speed was amazing but the sun rose faster
and sooh the last vestige of that scent was
gone no living thing could have held the
trail on the edge of a ridge the lobo
stopped and his head went back but he did
not howl for daylight was brilliant over the
desert

  the sun had passed its zenith when he
returned again to the rocky place the
jack was still there untouched and he
nosed it and licked it his hunger was
great and it was tempting but he did not
eat it his head stretched out on his paws
as he lay and his eyes were closed but they
opened often slanted amber hued eyes
that looked out as though they expected
to see something that did not appear his
ears moved slightly on occasion again
he watched the purpling shadows sharp
cut as they slid down from the western
heights saw the reds lose their fire and
turn to brown then merge into solidity of
tone with gradations of density

  slowly as though wearied he arose and
was gone into the night smoldering fires
were renewed and burned consumingly
within him as the moon rose he had been
hungry but the hunger was forgotten on
other nights the creek with its cold water
from the heights had been his first thought
now he went toward it but the desire that
came was not to be quenched there

  at last he came over the same way as
he had come before once the night
breeze told him of a rabbit not far off but
he paid no heed and went on up over the
region of boulders up where the rocks
mounted higher to a low mesa that stood
silhouetted against the mercuric glow of
the heavens a vast block of harder stone
that had been left by the erosion of the
centuries

  there high above the desert he stood
and his keen eyes saw far through the half
lights then out over the wastes his cry
sounded mournful deep the very air
seemed to tremble with it and in this re-
gion of silence it throbbed off into dis-
tances unbelievable often he had given
voice to that howl when this moon illu-

                                                      
under the mating moon



mined the heavens and it had never been
answered twice his neck and throat
swelled and that awful sound pulsed forth

  in his camp the prospector heard it and
saw his dogs head lift then witnessed that
which made him wonder the dog was
up quivering suddenly it leaped away
into the night and he called after it but
the dog did not return again the man
called then mused aloud

  you fool you got lost before an
i dont know why you didnt die for want

q grub an
prater you
aint got sense
enough to
know thats a
lobos howl an
if he gets wind
o you hell kill
you sure

  h e peered
through the
semi - darkness
up the canyon and thought he saw a light-
ish form that moved very rapidly out
of the stillness again came the howl of the
lobo faint distant the man shook his
head resignedly and sat down while far
off the lobo turned down off the mesa he
no longer traveled at that easy lope his
walk was slow and his head hung lower
life had played strangely with him never

an answer and there were times as now
when that moon was a thing that brought
madness to his kind he seemed very
tired as though the years had suddenly
taken heavy toll again he was going back
toward that rock overhang something
lured irresistibly he was almost there
when he stopped and turned in his chest
was a deep rumbling and afar he saw
something of lighter hue that approached
rapidly

  suddenly the lobos head arose his mane
stood out in swollen fashion a marked
change came over him he moved a few
steps toward the approaching thing and
the shuffling walk gave way to that stiff-
legged trot all the old power was evi-
dent and he broke into a wild run beside
the dog circling leaping over and ahead
of the lighter form his feet seemed
scarcely to touch the sands

  in front of the rocky overhang they
stopped together then the dog entered and
came out with the forgotten form of the
jackrabbit stiff-legged the lobo circled
about and once his head went back as the
howl throbbed over the reaches but it
was different the loneliness was gone
out of it given way to something of fierce
defiance of possession perhaps the dog
trembled then came and licked his muzzle
and the lobo stood in guardian fashion as
she returned to the rabbit

sequoias

in one of the groves of sequoias or big trees in tulare county california is found
mute evidence of the wonderful span of life and the enduring quality after death of these
giant trees

    count of the annual growth rings shows that the increase in diameter approximates one
foot per century a tree one foot in diameter may not show one hundred annual rings but
one seven or ten feet through will usually show about seven or ten hundred respectively

    trunks now lie prostrate in the forest still perfectly sound with trees more than seven
feet in diameter growing in positions where they could have started only after the fall of the
prostrate trees

    death barring the hand of man the great destroyer seems to come to this family only
through accident like uprooting in softened soil or by some freak wind storm lightning
does not seem to kill them for many thrifty trees show scars of the jovian bolts and forest
fires fail even to injure the bark

    one tree that fell and has now entirely disappeared in the almost countless centuries
elapsed since its fall made and still shows a lasting monument in the form of a trench-like
depression formed by the accumulation of mold and soil against its trunk while existent
and now made visible by the total disappearance of the tree within this trench or vacant
bed now grows a sequoia more than twenty seven feet in diameter as high from the ground
as a man can reach to measure it this living successor to the older tree could only have
sprouted after the disintegration of its predecessor excavation within the depression gives
evidence that the old tree was not destroyed by fire-m l w

        waiting out there in the lane of the big liners captain ho-
        gan of the laughing lady was content to keep his hands
        off the smuggling activities of his sinister passenger until
        davy tench tempted him then things took a curious turn

late of georges banks later of
nassau and rum row the
laughing lady captain
thomas hogan commanding
was slogging into it with stay-
sail taut as a congo drum her standing
gear all a-whine to the lash of the shouting
wind and white water over her weather
shoulder every forty seconds smash
she would cut into a long hogback roller 
then a tall geyser of spray would nod
glitter collapse in a lather on the deck and
vanish with a gurgle over the taffrail
ghost pale in the faint fire of the splinter-
ing stars

  ten knots easy barked hogan over
his shoulder and spat where the lee
smoked to the rush of black water ten
knots well be pickin her up any minute
mister-uh-mister jones

  you have already look ahead

 and so we have acknowledged
hogan squinting eastward over the others
pointing hand

  on the rim of the tossing world a tiny
diamond and ruby cluster sparked at them
across a dark infinity

  were south of her course arent we
captain  might as well lay up now

  ah sure an thats wan thing i got
tired of a-layin there in the row off the
jersey coast but its right ye arre mister
jones an so be it his thick voice rose
in a sharp succession of bellowed orders
the deck sprang to life the wheelman

slammed her fair into the wind up she
came slatting and whipping hogan bel-
lowed again and whing-clink-whir-
whir-whir-down dropped jib and fore-
sail and there rode the laughing lady
with the reef points on her mainsail snap-
ping a block up forward rattling like a
snare drum and the black water sneaking
by

  good hold her so said hogan and
turned to his passenger ill be steppin
below wan minute mister jones will ye

 right ye are said hogan but he
paused at the companion head to stare back
at the spare figure silhouetted against the
stars

  cripes muttered hogan theres a
pr-roper hard lad salted he is and no
mistake a bad guy in a squabble im
thinkin and im no tremblin lilly meself
he shrugged and went below

  it was true hogan was not the first
man who had seen the winter in jones
pale eyes and this business he was on
tonight called for all that keeping him
briefly above decks now he looked back
over the way they had come

  it had rained the day before and now
a horned moon drifted down the sky a
combination that lit the ocean with long
streaks of an intense phosphoresence
their wake still swarmed behind the

laughing lady like some gigantic jeweled
scimitar slowly returning to the sheath of
night

  he looked forward again the liner
was climbing the curve of the world up
up mounting with a startling rapidity
the wind veered came in fitful gusts
seemed about to die away somewhere up
near the bow a man began to sing from
the four hours he had been aboard jones
knew already that it must be the cook a
barbadoes nigger with bag eyes an eng-
lish accent and a voice like an angels

  never for you he sang fixing his
pitch and then his great baritone boomed
into the night

you may not greet the scented halms
that drift across a breathless sea
from those low coasts where slender
palms

dream in the moonlight silently-

  on and on went his booming voice while
the cordage hummed a cello accompani-
ment on and on across the distance
mounting into the colossal void climbing
the pale stairway of the stars and the

liner came on and on-

  jones shook himself as though rousing
from the vagueness of a dream from the
depths of some hypnotic spell captain
hogan appeared on deck and handed his
passenger a flask silently the negros
song died away

  shes coming fast said jones

  aye that she is acknowledged hogan
steppin right along aint goin to miss
us moren a thousand yards either probly
not that shes bearin this way

  all right got those lanterns ready i

finable impresion of youth aye capn
theres two side lights lashed together
with a white lantern below ordered
hogan get thim tench an run em
up

on my way capn answered tench
in a pleasant throaty voice disappeared
and within five minutes the red green and
yellow lights were a cluster at the fore


truck dipping and swaying in wide arcs
to the roll of the racing seas

  it was plain now that the liner would
pass them close she seemed to be veering
in but hogan was not looking at her
studying jones he swayed closer to him

  ye certainly got wan divvil of a swell
lay mister jones they bring it right to
ye dont they man its fair wunnerful

  a grim slow smile slid down jones
angular face avoiding his pale eyes as it
came the pulse of the liners screws was
loud across the water

  i dont know cap you got a tough
gang here spose you decided to frisk
me an then tie a little scrap iron to my
ankles eh

  hogan recoiled may the good god
forbid he stammered in cold blood
never tis a good figger yere payin
me and me bould boys share it tis
enough without neck stretchin

  just the same answered jones with
his sleep walkers staring smile you were
thinking of it or you wouldnt have
jumped so when i mentioned it

  hogans resentment was muffled by a
hail from the liners bridge the shout
spewed down on them thickened by a
megaphone hoy theer in any
trouble 

  no bellowed hogan between his
cupped paws

  why the lights

  were signallin fish roared hogan
and the barbadoes nigger cackled as he
lurched to the curl of the wash from the
enormous black bulk rushing by tier on
towering tier of golden port holes and a
faint burst of music spattering through the
wind then the whoosh whoosh of the
giant screws the slick sides rounding into
the stern and a flash of white falling fall-
ing from some obscured port

  what was that called someone in the
waist sharply

  shush a bit of paper mist tench
answered the niggers baritone

  it fell too fast

  jones smiled his slow frosty smile

the men sprang to it

  well well put in jones a little ex-
citement eh he raised his voice

tain

  hogan stared at him curiously jones
fluttered a parchment eyelid

  tench is such a bright boy didnt you

  hogan shrugged passengers goin

  jones dropped into the stern as the
boat got away to a succession of furious
climbs and breathless descents between
powerful pulls at the stroke oar young
tench was studying the passenger cov-
ertly as well as the vague light would per-
mit as they skittered over an enormous
roller jones suddenly flashed a powerful
hand searchlight full in tenchs face
blinding the boy for an instant and then
shot the beam beyond the boat to pick
up a red glint on the water they swept
down to it

  as i live and breathe said jones non-
chalantly a nice fat inner tube with a
towel or something tied to it and-yes-
a long-thin box he leaned out pro-
duced a knife with the suddenness of a
magician and cut the tube away with the
box wedged between his knees he spoke
again coolly

  all right boys lets be getting back
i thought maybe somebody was over-
board

  as they swung there idly for a moment
in the trough of the tremendous swells
david tench smiled in-
wardly he had seen
some strange doings in
his first trip to rum
row and this he
thought was the weird-
est of all

  backing water with
his long oar he called
out right fellers
give way and with a
sudden lunge they began
to climb a long slope to-
ward the wheeling stars
and the tossing lanterns
which marked the

laughing lady-

  aboard again jones
stumped to the companion head and so
out of sight with his hand on a backstay
hogan bellowed orders and they were
soon under weigh coming about smartly
under a freshening wind that came zoom-
ing over the port quarter

  young tench kept near the captain
when he thought hogan was about to go
below he glanced swiftly around the deck
and stepped up to him

  capn he muttered can i have a
word with you quiet-like

  hogan peered at him wisha me lad
a dozen of em he answered leading the
way aft

  what now davy me bould bucko

queried hogan finally settling against a
hatch coaming

  capn heres cases i know this
feller jones as he calls himself

  hogan started ye do

  no no i dont mean that way but

wolf im no saphead he got a box out
there from the ionia a nice size to slide
out of a stateroom porthole fastened to
an inner tube savvy  you can blow em up
after you shove em through the port
now capn whats in that box

  hogan was rubbing his grizzled chin
and grinning at the darkness

  sposin you tell me davy he sug-
gested softly

  well now capn i dont need to tell
you nobody needs t crack you on the
head with a club to make you see a dollar
a bright la-ad like you would be

felly what twas all about when y came

playfully

  with iron fingers david seized the
others arm

  whs-s-s-t capn who said a word
about taps on the head where do we
land this fellow or dont we

  without a drop o hard liquor bechune

hogan chuckled meanin a two way
divvy  the crew not to know la-ad  it

  hogan laughed aloud bhoy ye got
the makins he shot a swift glance
around the pitching deck and added lower
the makins of wan gr-rand young hi-
jacker 

david released his arm with a hard
smile and walked away to lounge in the
bows till the squat coast line hove in sight
the pearl of false dawn was paling the

                                                      
head work



morning star and the crests of the piling
combers were white as curd outside the
wide inlet when they lost steerageway at
last

  from the cabin where he had sat watch-
fully through the night jones came slowly
up the companion ladder his lean face
pallid in the light of a hurricane lamp
held high by the bag eyed nigger the
movements of men across the deck made
blobs of deeper darkness here and there
a small boat rattled in the falls knocking
gently as an oily swell slipped underneath
with the thin box tightly grasped jones
crossed to the davits hogan following

  ill see ye safe ashore volunteered
the captain settling himself in the boat
tench shouldered through the clustered
men as jones clambered into the stern

  ill lend a hand capn by your leave
he offered scrambling into the bow seat

 hogan looked over his shoulder and
grinned always on the job eh la-ad
the quicker were in and out the better
all right me bould buckos lower away

  as the boat hit a ground swell with a
teeth rattling jolt the darkness of the
eastern sky split open to reveal a broad
bar of sword gray light through the
vastness of the whimpering air they could
hear the far off tolling of a buoy deep and
mellow

  everything was ghost gray when they
slipped from the side of the laughing
lady her spars stood out sharply for an
instant against the growing light in the east
and then seemed to withdraw into a vague
opalescence it was as though they drifted
over some pale sea of dreams on which
their lifting oars laid a slow row of silver
discs

 looking over his shoulder between
strokes david caught a quick glimpse of
the misty piles and stringers of a leaning
wharf he could hear the furtive lapping
uf water beneath a block rattled on the
distant ship the wind caught at the sound
and plucked it away then jones an-
nounced quietly theres a landing stage
around at the other side row there

 hogan grunted expecting anybody
t meet ye mister jones 

  i work alone said jones shortly

  as they rounded the end of the wharf
david thought of the speed with which
their passenger had made the knife ap-
pear when he cut loose the box from the
inner tube back there in the open sea and
he wondered whether the man carried it
in a forearm sheath the fellow was one
tough cracker for a fact he speculated

on how big a haul he and hogan would
make a fortune probably jones had
never chartered them for twelve hours for
any piker stake he smiled and felt of the
hard weight in his side pocket as hogan
stopped rowing

  offshore the laughing lady stood out
suddenly in slender silhouette against the
enormous vacancy of sea and sky far
off the buoy was tolling dong-ring rang
-dong

  david sprang to his feet as they slid up
to the landing stage here the wharf
cut them off from a view of the ship he
stepped out and threw the painter in a
double half hitch around a stub of rotten
post

  hogan grunted to his feet and looked
slowly about they were shadowed by an
old shed at the landward end of the wharf
from the landing stage a path ran up a
gentle slope some distance inshore was
a group of tiny houses stark in the morn-
ing light a thin smudge of lilac smoke
bloomed from a chimney and fled away
in the clutch of the wind

  hogan leaped lightly onto the stage ran
with astonishing speed up the path to the
top of the rise and stood there for a mo-
ment gazing around all right he
called suddenly beginning to descend once
more

  in the meantime jones had crawled
stiffly out the box wrapped in black oil-
cloth projecting from his side pocket but
he did not turn his back to david sidling
along instead until he reached the path
as hogan approached the man david
sprang forward shouted and flung up an
arm instinctively jones dodged and half
turned in one great leap hogan was on
him david stood aside detached aloof
almost as though he had no interest in the
outcome there was something grotesque
about the struggle so silent there in the

cool morning
air they fell
slipping down
the path al-
most to his
feet the box
twisted from
jones pocket
and lay apart
in a clump of
weed jones though slighter proved top
man davids hand came slowly from his
reefer gripping a big blue automatic for
some obscure reason he was smiling

  soak him wheezed hogan

  methodically david leaned down and


short stories

smote jones once at the base of his skull
not very hard jones shivered twitched
once or twice spasmodically and relaxed
with a sigh

  expert eh grinned hogan getting
shakily to his feet wisha the fellys
twice me strength but that rap fixed him
twas a two man job though davy an no
mistake

  yes its a two man job all right but

mebbe not the way-

  the box davy in hiwins name
the- ah sure an here we are he
made a lunge toward where it lay and be-
gan fumbling with the wrappings

   twill be a couple hunnerd thousand
or theres snakes in ireland he muttered
whisht lad what ye doin  cmere
working quickly and silently david had
produced a coil of thin rope and was lash-
ing jones arms behind his back in sailorly
fashion next he went rapidly through
the mans pockets while hogan tore at
the inner fastenings of the box and trans-
ferred a considerable armory to his own
jacket he was tapping jones bulging
money belt when he heard hogan gasp
wirra tis himself was crazy theres
nothin in the dom box at all at all
youre right cap said david
straightening witb an amused glint in his
black eyes youre probably right he
was usin the box just to fool us

  f-fool us

  likely ill bet theres a hundred
grand in stones in his money belt if theres
a thin dime

  hogan leaped to his feet

  jones stirred slightly and david looked
down to see the mans filmy eyes fixed on
him with a stare of such insane venom that
he almost recoiled

  in a belt ye say on him barked
hogan and dove for jones prostrate body
to fumble furiously at his waist

  as calmly as though he were crushing
some annoying bug david at once leaned
over and rapped hogan sharply behind the
ear with his heavy gun butt the captain
slipped forward soundlessly across jones
chest but the expresion of the man be-
neath changed not by so much as the twitch
of an eyelid

  what queried jones softly while

david explored hogans pockets what
is the idea boy you must be some op-
posed to splitting with your pals eh you
dont think for a second youre gonna get
by with this do you

  with another length of cord david was
tying the captains wrists as tightly as he
could pull thats for a double-crosser
he muttered the pain began to bring
hogan arounid why yes jones or
whatever your name is he went on you
might say im expectin to get away with
it he looked down at them and turning
hogan over with his toe yes i guess
ill get away with it o k

  you dont know the gang youre buck-
ing when you begin to mess me up jones
spat out viciously ill follow you myself
hogans eyes opened for a bewildered
moment then through a purpling face
he began to curse with fluency and vigor

  you follow me said david amusedly
disregarding hogan you follow me
why man youre plain nutty

  hogan stopped swearing suddenly
why wha d ya mean ye dirthy spal-
peen ye double-crossin hijacker he
shouted

  thatll be all of that snapped david
get up the both of you and make it
snappy cmon

  what the hells the idea snarled
jones

  david swept off his cap and ran a lean
hand through his black hair why this
he said pleasantly just this  you got two
big shipments through mister jones that
was plenty so the customs service had
the coast guard plant a man in every fast
boat on rum row to kind of lay for you
and as far as the laughing lady goes im
him you sort of hit me as a hard to han-
dle baby so i thought id just get hogans
help on the job and then pinch him too
the rest of the crew aint worth botherin
with or id wait for some of them to come
after the boat

  well ill be domned gulped hogan
david made no answer but the steady
whisper of the wind tbe little ripples
around the worn piles of the wharf and
the distant tonking of the bellbuoy blended
into the sound strangely like sardonic
laughter

mesa

by kenneth perkins
author of cal triggers bucks his luck the voice of the chasm etc

alqne with the killer pablo claug in that desolate storm battered shack
at pinto mesa little jingle thompson faced death unafraid with a
strange power of his own greater than all of pablos brutal strength

         giant mongrel half pima
         and half white rode up to the

    door of a desert shack his
  face under the broad lop brim
of the sombrero was a mask
of many emotions of which exhaustion
fear and cunning were uppermost the
high cheek bones the slanting eyes of his
indian breed the flabby lips the bristling
and brutal chin these lineaments were
softened by a thick coating of alkali mud-
died with his own sweat to a mask

  he pounded at the door with his gloved
fist

  a leather faced man with the narrowed
pupils common to the desert mucker
opened the door started back collected his
wits and then grinned obsequiously his
visitor was a famous man what he asked
must be granted

  let me in here-hide me-feed me
water my cayuse-and water me pron-
to

  you-all seem to be in a hurry pablo
the old mucker said genially vyhos
after you

  two hombres from that thompson
outfit

  you-all been shootin up them poor
thompson agin
is

  pablo lurched in swigged eagerly from
the flask proffered him fell into a chair
and began gobbling up the noonday meal
of flapjacks and bacon and coffee at which
his host had just been engaged between
mouthfulls he vouchsafed to explain

  went up thar to their outfit to shoot
em old man thompson and his father
-thats all thats left of the outfit exceptin
some young kid who dont count if id
seen my chanct to plug the two men-that
would of finished the outfit

  didnt git your chanct pablo oh
jvell wait till next time

  pablo claug swore fervently through
a mouthful of flapjacks id have got
em if it hadnt been for a galloway bull
that chased me

  shouldnt sneak around them cow out-
fits too much on foot the old man coun-
selled sorrowfully

  i wasnt on foot it happened out on
the range werent nowheres near the
outfit

  you mean a bull chased yer while you
was on hossback  and you got skeered 
i plugged him skeered no i
werent skeered never was skeered in
my life i admit a bull gits on my nerves
same as a gila monster will on yourn was
tossed oncet when i was a six-year-old
who wouldnt be skeered rememberin


short stories

that i plugged him forgot how these
here cattle will drift home to die ef you-all
plug em in the belly he licked his lips
that thars where i like to plug a gal-
loway bull

  he went on eating loudly while his host
maintained a respectful silence as if the
noise of his guests eating demanded at-
tention as much as his verbal pronouncia-
mentos

  you see the damned galloway got back
to the ranch afore i got thar pablo fin-
ished and word was spread around that
i was back agin thats how it happened
old thompson and his father came gun-
nin for me picked up my trail at a
gamin house just this side of mule town
and i couldnt shake em off all the way
down into the desert theyre hot after
me now he snapped out the conclusion
to his narrative give me a good shot
of likker

  the old mucker gave him a jug and a
tin cup

  dont see what you need to be afraid
of now pablo the host said that thar
red roan of yourn kin walk away from any
hoss of the thompson outfit

  pablo claug drank then smacking
his lips he let the liquor take its slow burn-
ing course a light came to his eyes
they slanted wrinkling

  walk away he repeated walk
away did you say how come you alius
want to be givin me an insult you little
ole seedwart dont appear like you know
me im pablo claug why should i
walk away from thompson-and his
toothless old father i aint goin to walk
away from nobody

  the host reflected silently that pablo
had shown evidence of fear and trembling
before taking that swig but he held his
peace

  now that thompson and his father
have took the trouble to come all the way
down here to the desert rim where i want
them ill fight em

  fight two men the other exclaimed
it was hard to believe for claug had
never been known to fight two men to-
gether before

  aint goin to fight em goin to kill
em and right here out in front of your
shack in just about ten minutes

  ten minutes the old mucker went to
the door of his cabin and looked out toward
the horizon of mesas on the scarp of the
granite hill nearest to him he saw the sil-
houettes of two horsemen a short zig-
zag ride down the face of the mesa thence

across a boulder wash of the dry river
and they would soon reach the adobe banks
just above his own diggings

  pablo claug came and looked over his
shoulder

  you-all have been thinnin but them
thompsons cattle for a long time the
old mucker said bein as you yourself
stipulate them two is the last grown-up
men of the tribe theyre goin to be power-
ful keerful how come youre offerin to
fight two desperate hombres of that thar
nature 

  pablo claug evidently had not listened
he was staring at the crest of the adobe
banks a few hundred yards beyond the
sand windrows and sage patches outside
the door

  and remember this the host was
saying you caint expect a pore old man
like me to help you much as id like to

i	caint draw any too quick these days
and besides why should i draw on them
thompsons anyways and git plunked
me a pore weak ole seedwart as you
yourself likes to call me

  you dont have to draw on no thomp-
sons pablo claug answered but you
got to draw on me and not only that
you got to throw on me

  throw on you the other gasped the
heat must have gotten the better of the big
gunman despite the fact that he was a
breed

  i reckon youre a good enough shot to
throw your gun on me-and miss

  that thar looks easy pablo but how
come you want me to raise my gun agin
you i aint nothin gin you i want to
be counted one of your friends wouldnt
dast raise it agin you no one in these
parts dast ceptin only them thompsons

  the sound of hoofs as the two thomp-
son men came galloping down -along the
pebbly trail of the boulder wash struck in
upon the ears of pablo and his old friend

  quick now heres my game the
breed said im goin to mount then

 im goin to ride around this here shack
 -like i was raidin you when they come
 up to the top of that thar adobe bank and
 are pickin their way through the mesquite

                                                       
the prophet of pinto mesa



for to ride down into the stream bed then
you begin to pot at me outn the window
be sure and aim good and high dont
want em to see yer bullets kickin up the
dust aim for that greasewood sos they
wont ricochet good and high mind you
itll make it all the safer for me then
suddenly afore they come within range
ill drop pretendin to be hit ill fall on
the sand lyin face downrd theyll most
like ride up slow dismount and maybe
palaver with you or maybe not wont
make much difference if they do you
tell em i was after a bag of pay dirt you
got anything to make it look good then
when they come up to me to see just how
bad im hit ill blaze away at em

  the old mans lips trembled to an un-
comfortable smile ive helped a lot of
men both reckless and keerful in my days
out here in the desert he said but i
never met up with anyone so all-fired keer-
ful as you hate to cold-deck two honest
gents like them thompsons

  if you dont like it mebbe in this here
sham fight of ourn i might do some
honest-to-god sharp shootin on you in-
stead of pretendin

  this settled the problem the old
mucker did not spend another moment in
weighing the moral aspects of the act
pablo claug was the king of the desert
his word was law and the old mucker
prided himself on being a peaceful law-
abiding man

  all right pablo anything you says
must be right

  and mind aim good and high if i
see them shots ricocheting too close to my

roans feet-

  there was an idea if the old mucker
could only have reacted to that touch of
divine inspiration why not actually
shoot pablo claug in this sham fight

  but no he load nothing against pablo
if he raised a hand against him he would
win nothing and perhaps lose everything

  there was pablo claug now mounted
and galloping his roan in a wide circle
around the little cabin it had the same
effect on the old mucker as they say a cir-
cle drawn in the sand has upon a horned
toad it hypnotized him

 he began emptying a volley of fire
the shots smashed loudly into the thin
quiet air mingling with the growing clat-
ter of horses hoofs the thompsons
were already at the crest of the adobe
banks

  good men them thompsons the old
mucker said but theyre reckless pablo

aint and im with the strongest side
his sixth shot rang out and he had
been very careful to aim all six high in the
air

ii

the two riders drew up their mounts
at the edge of the adobe bank and
looked down toward the muckers
shack the dry river bed stretched below
them a furlong or so across with the
shack in the middle an ore-crusher near
by and a small corral surrounded by giant
boulders and stretches of sand and sage
across this little scene went the white
flashes of fire from two six-guns

what-alls happenin the older of the
two men blink thompson said all as

i	kin see is a rider circlin that air cabin
its pablo claug himself blink
thompsons son replied hes got into
some argument with an hombre inside
good enough nows the time to pot
him old thompson cried kin you git
that range too fur for me my eyes
too bleary you kin do it nows your
chance

too far for anything sure well
leave our cayuses here and git down a bit
closer to him behind them there boulders
they dismounted letting their horses
stand with reins dragging

  hulloa there the younger thompson
cried hes hit

  whos hit whats happened pablo
claug stretched another victim  the
yellow-livered son of a skunk

  no its pablo claug thats hit

  the old man shaded his weak watery
eyes caint see whats that roan
trottin off for without its rider what-
alls happened

  its pablo claug been hit damme if
he aint stretched good and proper rolled
to the sand offn his saddle wrigglin
like a chuckawalla thats been stepped 
ned thompson gave vent to a joyful
shout were free bgod do you git
that dad  pablo claug aint goin to per-
secute us no more free come on
he leaped down through the mesquite
unmindful of the tearing thorns jumping
over the low patches picking out the short-
est route through the dense brush his
aged father stumbled slowly along after
him gun in hand mumbling as he went

  look out thar now son dont be
reckless i know a thing or two about
gun-fightin youre too all-fired reckless
easy now dont try to bust through
mesquite thetaway
short stories



  the son had come out on the open river
bed and for a moment having no protec-
tion he paused his fathers warnings
came in breathless and excited treble

  i tell you son watch out find out
who lives in that air muckers cabin first
some locoed hermit mebbe most like
hell take a pot at you

  whoever he is hes a friend of ourn
the son cried joyfully hes bumped off
the yellowest coyote ever chawed off a
cows nose

  the hermit had come out to the door
of his shack now and standing in full
view of the two newcomers he waved

  its all right young thompson said
he looked over to the form of pablo claug
lying in the sand head toward the shack
one arm pinned awkwardly under his body
the other his right lying out with palm
upward in the blazing sand it looked pre-
cisely as if his six-gun had fallen from his
hand and he had died in the act of clutch-
ing the empty air

  hulloa thar pard young thompson
called out what-all does this mean
you sure will be a hero in my eyes from
this day on

  the mucker came down from his shack

  just a disagreement he come after
me thinkin to stick me up he seen i
ben doin some pannin here its pablo
claug you know him mebbe got a
sting in him worsn a rattler he dropped
his voice a rattlerll stay alive till sun-
set you know that there superstition
hombre 

  but the warning was not loud enough
the old muckef loath as he was to see a
man shot down practically in cold blood
before his very eyes did not dare to op-
pose the great pablo claug

  the tragedy inevitable as it was hor-
rible came the mucker saw it and if
he hadnt been used to such sights dur-
ing his fifty years in the desert he would
have covered his eyes and the older man
off there in the mesquite brush saw it even
though his eyes were dim

  a flash of light a report it looked as
if a white tongue of fire had leaped out
from directly underneath the prostrate
pablos chin the simile of the rattler
was perfect

  thompsons hand went to his chest
his head went back as if some invisible
hand had timed an uppercut on his chin
his knees sagged his gun flipped from his
hand he sank forward face downward in
a patch of rattleweed

  pablo claug knew that this was no sim-

ulation of being hit the man was hit be-
yond any shadow of doubt pablo knew
it the old mucker knew it the white
haired bleary-eyed frontiersman who was
the father knew it

  the latter ducked into the protection of
two boulders and opened fire the carcass
of pablo claug came to life arose ran off
towards his horse over his shoulder he
hurled a string of fire towards the boulders
and mesquite brush from which the father
thompson was firing a bullet passed the
breeds head like the crack of a whip
another ripped through his tall peaked
sombrero a fear gripped the big half-
breed he realized suddenly that he was
in the open and his adversary was under
cover but this was not what routed him
it was the fear of facing the father of the
man he had shot he vaulted to the sad-
dle of his horse and hit the trail

  old thompson came out stricken with
rage and grief he had given his best in
the fight but his best no longer counted
he had a steady hand an indomitable
strength of wiry body a heroic spirit but
his eyes were dimmed by many years of
squinting at desert suns no use he
had come to help his son with his wisdom
and his courage but he had failed

  both the father and the old mucker ran
toward the fallen man the former turned
him about carefully he felt for the
wound held a flask to the half-opened lips

  he aint done for yit the mucker
said

  the father turned upon the speaker with
an oath he was cold-decked be god

and you know it
you ole toothless
coyote my son
was cold-decked
you wasnt fight-
in you was
stallin and ef
m y son dies-
youre goin t o
pay the same as
pablo claugs go-
in to pay

  he aint goin
to die mister
the mucker whim-
pered

  the father snatched the flask from him
and tipped it to the wounded mans lips
the eyes flickered

  take me back he whispered finally
i aint through fightin by a long shot
but not now i want to be back with-
my boy

  the aged father thrust his powerful
arm under the mans head

  only a crease thats all i swear dad

the third generation of the thomp-
son outfit was a slender gray eyed
boy of nineteen who seemed as
much out of place in the cow country as
an ocotillo blossom in the desert he was
a very peculiar character no one under-
stood him some called him a poet jin-
gle was his nickname for he had a
habit of writing poems to adorn the walls
of the cantinas most of the barkeeps and
gamblers in fact were his friends they
had his sonnets about spring in the can-
yons the fragrance of sage the wind in
the mesas and the rest of his favorite
topics written upon the mirrors behind the
bar

  totally oblivious of the fact that his
father and his aged grandfather had gone
gunning for their enemy this boy was
singing one of his odes accompanying
himself on a banjo while the cantina girls
miners and stockmen thumped out a texas
tommy to his rhythm jingle thompson
was really a very popular citizen of mule
town but he was popular in a disagree-
able way as domingo the humpback was
popular for instance among the gamblers
domingo brought luck to you at cards if
you rubbed his back jingle was popular
and pitied and in a manner of speaking
despised

  and the reason for jingle thompsons
being despised was this he had sedulously
refused to learn how to fire a six-gun
this was supposed to be due to some
promise he had made to his mother a
promise which his father made him keep
nevertheless a man who refuses to touch
a six-gun does not command much respect
in mule town and the ranges about soda
mesa a man must not crawl behind a
promise to his mother and thus save his
hide that was the philosophy of mule
towns stockmen and gamblers every
boy promises his mother not to fight but
does that let him out

  and now at the climax of his merry-
making at cal martins cantina some-
thing happened when the dance was
over an old mucker from the desert shuf-

fled across the sawdust covered floor drew
his gun and aimed it at the floor of the
platform where jingle thompson was
seated playing and singing

  now do that air song to the tune of
my gun he rasped out shrilly dont
sing it nor dont play it just dance it
why the hell should i dance to your
gun jingle thompson asked quietly
focusing his gray eyes upon the grizzled
old man

  the man seemed to be struck with the
deadly calmness of the boys look he
hesitated just a moment before opening
fire

  dont touch that boy you the boun-
cer called out you caint pick a fight
with him he never fights

 ah thats it the old mucker
laughed i caint touch him because it is
generally known he dont carry a six-gun
caint shoot a man whos known to be
busted youre like them weaklings in the
zuni tribes which calls theirselves klath-
manas and does the work of women in-
stead of goin  the warpath in plainer
terms kid youre yaller

  neither the bouncer nor the bar keep
nor the deputy sheriff nor any acquain-
tance of jingle thompson seemed disposed
to contradict the irate old gentleman from
the desert

  play us another tune jingle the old
kook is locoed or drunk forgit him
but jingle did not take his eye from his
accuser am i yeller because i wont
pull a trigger its the man who goes
around town ready to protect himself by
killing whos yeller

  this was a particularly unhappy state-
ment as it insulted practically every man
at the gaming tables as well as at the bar
there was a grumble of anger throughout
the smoke befogged room

  look here kid the desert mucker
said if you dont shoot your enemies just
what-all do you do with em

  forgive em make em my pards
give em my hand take a drink with
em forgit the wrong go on enjoyin
life

  the grumble of the assembled bar
guests lightened to scoffing the old
mucker spat he looked at the gray wide
open eyes with every mark of contempt
and then snarled out youd give your
hand to a man whos done you wrong
you yaller skunk what ef he wouldnt
take yer hand what if he stayed yer
enemy 

  id find a way to reach him theres


short stories

something good in the worst man

  by good you mean he could under-
stand yer lousy pomes the mucker
scoffed this brought a good laugh from
the bar

  yes i mean that jingle cried hotly
theys poetry in every mans carcass
dont care if hes a greaser or gunman
theys pomes inside him somewheres and
id git him thataway

  again the mucker spat what if it
was some hombre as plugged your own
father would you try pomes with him
the question nettled young jingle for
a moment the gang of stockmen and min-
ers waited upon his answer the cantina
girls who were always on his side for
some peculiar sentimental reasons under-
standable only to womankind peered
eagerly under the fans of the hanging
lamps at the boys handsome face that
was a question

  jingle frowned his philosophy had
never embraced the existence of revenge
it rejected it as for instance some relig-
ions reject tbe existence of disease he
resorted to his bible-that is to say his
pack of fortune tellers cards

  many prophecies in time past had come
from the boys pack of cards cowmen

had said that
since he was ten
years old he
had prognosti-
cated drought
storm or rinder-
pest with the
uncanny certainty of the indian shaman
and medicine men of the county

  still they waited for his answer the
old mucker breathing sniffling swayed
belligerently where he stood in tbe middle
of the dance floor there was the sound
of poker chips the tinkle of a glass a
cowboys spurs clicked then jingle
thompson gave his answer 

  i turned up a spade here which it
says the blood of my kin has been shed
that thars a damned good guess
boy the old mucker laughed i said if
your father was plugged didnt i 
damned good trick of yourn to guess what
im drivin at well and good young mr
snivelin coyote your dad was plugged
down thar he pointed toward the des-
ert now kin you-all answer my ques-
tion 

  the boy paled coming irresolutely to
his feet my father you say my

father-

  now do you want this here gun the

mucker cried triumphantly now are
you goin to give your enemy your hand
and call him pard

  my father-where- whats hap-
pened plugged you say in a gun-
fight he covered his ashen horrified
mouth with his hand no no not that
not killed tell me-quick-who did it
pablo claug

  the cantina was in an uproar the
proprietor big cal martin came from a
gaming table ey e-shade on forehead
sleeves rolled up loo yung the cook
came from his hot dog stand in the corner
the barkeep leaned across the bar with a
grim interest

  another victim for pablo claug pablo
the cruel and the powerful the wolf of
the bad lands the bully of all muckers
pablo the pet fear of old sheriff bendley

  then there rose a champion not the
sheriff-he was too old and too diplo-
matic not the sheepmen-pablo left
them alone not the prospectors-pablo
gave them immunity from his papago
henchmen no the champion who pre-
sented himself was a frail banjo-playing
youth-a fortune teller and writer of cow-
boy ballads a poet who did not know how
to load a gun or squeeze a trigger

  ill git him jingle thompson said to
the crowd

  his gesture of revenge was so futile that
a cowpuncher in the background laughed
it started a snickering that went like a
rustle of leaves over the whole gang

  git him how the old mucker
guffawed with yer pomes

  the humpback domingo gave a giggling
rasp you think pablo claug has potry
in his carcass

  every man so the kid says has potry
in him laugbed the barkeep

  not pablo claug cried another

  yes he has so help me god jingle
thompson cried frantically turning upon
his persecutors hes got it in him damn
you all and ill git him-thatazvay

  in the silence with which mule town
accepted this peculiar dictum of their
youthful prophet jingle turned to the
desert mucker

tell me old pard where is my father
hes bein toted up from saddle creek
from my diggins i seen the whole fight
your grandfathers totin him home no
he aint daid yet son

  jingle pulled his sombrero down over
his eyes hitched up his trousers and
walked out to his horse

  when he was gone one man turned to

another and said what-all did thet kid
mean when he said hed git pablo claug
thataway

  he meant every mans got potry and
good in him and hell work on claug
thataway

  well the yaller livered son of a jack
rabbit the other snorted goin to
make friends with the man as plugged his
father

  you caint alius tell

iv

when jingle arrived at the little
group of shacks calf sheds and
corrals that composed the thomp-
son cow outfit he found that old blink
thompson had already arrived bringing
with him the wounded man jingles
father a mexican mozo was hobbling
about excitedly attending to the horses
and his wife a mountainous half-breed
weeping and hysterical was bringing
water from the pump for her masters
wounds both the ranch hands were act-
ing like two chickens after a hawk has
made a raid on the coop

  the hawk was pablo claug and his
law among all the renegades and breeds
and mexicans of that range was that if he
declared war on an enemy no man must
come to that enemys assistance very
shortly after jingle came home the two
ranch hands had fled

  jingle went into the main ranch house
and his grandfather upon seeing him
looked at him as if he had completely for-
gotten the fact of the boys existence
there had been a gunfight and when
gunfights were concerned jingle thomp-
son ceased to exist the gaunt old fron-
tiersman looked down upon the boy as if
trying to recall who he was then it
seemed to come to him yes this was the
little cottontail they called jingle this
was his sons son no by heaven he
would not believe it he was every inch
of him a replica of ned thompsons wife
the boy looked like ned the grandfather
admitted but in his nature he was every
bit a woman he dismissed him with a
snap

  git in there you and take a look at
yer dad

  jingle needed no prodding he brushed
by the old fierce-looking cowman hurried
into his fathers bunk-room and fell down
by his side

  its all righto son the father said
cheerfully dont worry itll take some
time but ill be all righto just a crease
it

caint do any more fightin you see what
comes of pickin a gunfight just because
of a ole galloway bull as was shot re-
member what yer maw said afore she died
we aint livin here to be gunmen too
many gunmen as it is the wests
changin little by little were in a corner
that aint changed yit but youre the kind
were goin to have here when the gun-
mens thinned out

  jingle did not answer many thoughts
were whirling through his mind his
mother must have been right she had
made him one man in a community who
could live without a trigger-finger always
itching she must be right but she had
left out that little point about revenge
there was no revenge in her heart

  i wanted to git back quick soil sos i
could warn you of something the father
went on thought mebbe thered be
ranklin inside of you for to go and even
up this here score well you aint goin
im tellin you that straight if you go
after pablo claug youll git killed dont
reckon id git well if i knowd that son
whats more the fear that you might git
killed by claug has made me come to a
decision we-all are goin to leave this
ranch once pablo claug gits it in for

anyone he
dont let u p
look at the
way he fin-
ished up the
circle m out-
fit picked em
off one by one
snipe - shootin
at em even
the sheriff
stays outn his way because hes got all the
renegades in the desert on his side yes
theys a reward out for him but no one
dast go after him he never shoots you
straight face to face alius in the back
they say he alius finishes up his enemy
because hes afraid to let em live same
as when you half kill a rattler when yer
campin on the range yer cant sleep
at night till yer go out and find whats
left of him and bury him thats pablo
claugs way and thats what im
avoidin

  you mean for my sake dad yer givin
up our ranch the boy asked piteously
you mean weve got to run away

  the wounded father winced under this
he wouldnt run away not if twenty pablo
claugs were after him in fact did he not
go into the desert after pablo claug but
short stories



when his son was considered the son who
was the only living and tangible thing re-
maining of his dead wife then he looked
at the whole affair in a different light

  im goin son he said conclusively
because i know damned well pablo will
come after you

  but look here dad-

  no no more im gittin weak give
me a swig there now git out he
called him back by putting up his shaking
hand one thing else son you pack
up a grubstake and saddle black diablo
and right now you take the trail up to
eagle fan mesa our cousin smoo
thompsonll take keer of ye until i come
which i promise to come in a day or two
now git hell he groaned with the
pain in his shoulder damn this if i
only had the strength-god almighty id

looked up seeing the boy still kneeling be-
side him git out of here damn you
are you-all goin to disobey me at a time
like this git and saddle black diablo
hes the fastest he sank to the pillow
youll need a fast horse god give
me-give me my strength again-to fight

old blink thompson found his
grandson some few minutes later
down in the coral saddling black
diablo black diablo the best little bronc
on the outfit the fastest on a rough trail
the longest winded the surest of foot in
riding down deep arroyos or up the rocky
sides of mesas and lomas

  blink thompson stepped up behind the
boy grabbed his arm and whirled him
about toward him

  so youre doin what yer dad told you
to ay the gaunt old frontiersman
snorted disgustedly oh yes i heard it all
was just outside the bunk room heard
him tell you to beat it to where pablo wont
git you he clutched the boy by the
scruff of the neck fairly lifting him from
his feet and looking into his face look
here you dont you know your dads
outn his head with that thar crease
bleedin do you think in his right mind
hed want to give up this here ranch sell
out and run away hell no you know
your dad hes doin it for you hes
actin like a mother to you bein you aint
got one for the time bein hes weak and
sick and womanish

  i aint goin jingle muttered angrily
aint goin oh no it dont look like
it does it now what-all air you saddlin
that bronc for then

  leave me alone leave me play my
own game

  the grizzled man peered intently into
the boys face for all blink thompsons
dim sightedness his bleary eyes had a
peculiar fire in them from his many
years staring at desert sunsets it seemed
as if he had developed a new sight sharper
far than the vision of younger men for
a moment the grandfathers and the
youths eyes were alike-wells of limitless
passion and wisdom

  look here boy do i see a yaller
coyote before me or do i see a man with
my own blood coursin in his veins the
west has changed since my time but heres
one day taken outn my own past if
youre my grandson theres one thing only
for you to do you got to live this here
day like it was fifty ytar ago this here
corner of arizony is the same like the
frontier was in my day youre me all
over agin git that  and ef you-all
dont do what i would of done then from
now on you aint my grandson but only a
yaller coyote

  leave me alone i said im playin
my own hand you quit ridinme

  the grandfather burst out in a volley
of oaths he yanked the boy away from
the strap he was cinching and pulled him
out in the open corral it looked for all
the world as if he were going to give the
boy a flogging or perhaps worse for
the irate old fellow actually drew out his
six-gun

  they call you jingle thompson dont
they you little calf-eyed wart jingle
thats a fine name for a grandson of
mine they call one of my kin jingle be-
cause he writes pomes about the drifts
of tumbleweed and the palo santo and the
cactus wren zowie

  what-all are you goin to do for hells
sake shoot me

  i ought to if you was in a gunfight
youd know what real honest-to-god
pomes there are in real life palo santo
yah he spat disgustedly gunshootin
with a flash of white fire and a man saggin
to the alkali sand thats pomes thats
whatd awake somethin in your car-
cass 

  the boy tried to writhe from the vise
grip but he couldnt old blink still had a
giants strength

  you never got in a fight did you you
never so much as asked me how to fan a
gun did you you never so much as
asked me how to clean it how to throw it

on a mex you never knew that when you
aim you get the top of this here front sight
settin on a mex or a stallion and you get
it in the notch of this here sight with equal
daylight a-showin on both sides you
never knew that you should orter press
on the trigger slowly not pull it press
it back not sideways hell youd close
your eyes if the trigger didnt pull sweet
youd flinch if the pull was creepy and
you were waiting too long for this here
deadly weapon to kick bah what do
you care about it anyway you care more
about your stars haw haw haw
no the boy said sulkily you said
if i ever touched it id blow out my
brains

  and this holster ill bet if you tried
to put it on youd get yourself all tangled
up like the way you harness a mule here

you-let me show you-

  what are you puttin it on me for
this-away fasten it on the belt and
anchor the belt sos itll always be in the
same place the grandfather went on
sos you could yank out the old shootin
iron and throw it on a man within a
second

  jingle thompson looked down at the
holster that- had been buckled on- him he
fingered it awkwardly his brow wrinkling
his gray eyes narrowing he unbuttoned
the flap started to pull outthe shooting-
iron but it stuck he looked up again
into his grandfathers face

  what and the hell is this here contrap-
tion for i dont need it dont want it
couldnt use it ifi had it

  i told you just now how to use it if
that aint enough then go on and git out

vamose git offn
this rancho you
dont belong here
with menfolk g o
up to the zunis and
make a klathmana
outn yorself they
kin use you for
weavin blankets and
cookin of their meal
cakes

  the boy fumbled
nervously uncer-
tainly with the buckle of bis holster
there must have been some trick to it
always is a trick to these things finally
he gave it up as a bad job he would wait
until he was free from that burning gaze
of his grandfather he turned to his
bronc

  the father watched him cinching the
  

saddle again so viciously that the bronc
turned to bite him

  the youth mounted swung off and gal-
loped his horse toward the corral gate

  keep that there deadly weapon with
you boy the grandfather called after
him theys lots of jack rabbits on the
way up to your cousins outfit and jack
rabbits is right dangerous animals i
mean comparatively speakin

  i aint goin up to my cousins ranch
the boy shouted angrily i made up my
mind long afore you started razzin me
where im goin

  the old man shaded his eyes as he saw
his grandson heading down for the desert
trail

  consarn my eyesight he grumbled
caint see that hes takin the trail up
noth like his father told him he
strained his eyes looking down through the
cow-barns the corrals the bunkshed to-
wards the sage plain to the south what-
all is he ridin thet-away for 

  although old blink thompsons eyes
were none too good his ears were phe-
nomenal he could hear the hoof beats
of jingles horse striking on the pebbles
of the stream bed it was from the direc-
tion of the canyon now the sound drifted
away as the horse went clattering down
towards the canyon floor

  that canyon old blink knew had only
one opening-ten miles further down
and that was the desert

  i heard him say hed made up his
mind the grandfather exclaimed with a
sudden burst of exultation make up his
mind to what i know by hell the
young uns goin to trail pablo claug
the aged frontiersman swung his
scrawny burned fist in the air with a
whoop as if he wanted all the mesas the
sage plains the canyons and gulches to
join him in his cheer

  i knew it i knew it these here ole
bleary eyes of mine kin see what other men
cant i knew he was of my blood my
sons son thats what he is hes goin
to kill pablo claug

  he rushed back to the ranch house
im goin to tell his paw so help me
itll make his paw well he paused
no i cant do that the boys goin to
git killed he cant fight pablo claug i
mustnt tell his paw hes goin to git
killed

with a different expression on his wind-
burned heavily seamed face the old man
gazed again towards the canyon all he


short stories

could see was a deep black gash in the
breast of the plain

  goin to git killed for the first time
in his life old blink thompson knew what
fear was he had never felt it for him-
self but now his great courageous heart
began to beat like a frightened birds

  for if the truth must be told he loved
the boy no matter how strong no matter
how despicably weak the boy was his sons
son

v

ingle thompson trailed all
during the earlier part of the night
while the moon was up a supper at
a water hole and a few hours sleep then
a short ride during the cool of the morning
brought him into the lower reaches of the
valley

  here the chasms deepened it was a
region where it seemed the cool night air
of the plains was never admitted many
days of blistering heat were imprisoned
there finally there appeared at the end
of the valley a narrow vertical slit between
two precipices beyond which was a red
glare-the desert and the sun it was like
looking into the mouth of a furnace

  here in a remote arroyo an indian
shaman lived in a shack in his earlier
boyhood jingle thompson had come to this
man somewhat as a disciple going to a
shrine in the wilderness he had taught
jingle many things some of which be-
longed to the trappers lore some of which
belonged to the lore of the bad mind and
the cold hand some jingle accepted
some he refused he taught him how to
make milk out of corn how to paint hides
with the juice of prickly pear how to stim-
ulate his sight with the peyote plant how
to make medicine out of the spider bean
and likewise he taught him to read the
stars to understand the call of coyote of
buzzard of the wind he taught him
songs to the tune of his jesako drum and
he gave him the sacred turtle bones which
if swallowed would give him power to see
into the body of the sick

  the indian hermit came down to the
canyon bed through which the trail wound
he stood there a giant with the heat
shimmering about him his mane of white
hair glistening in the sun crowned with
a dazzling sort of glory the ragged and un-
kempt figure except for that stature and
that silvery hair he was an ordinary pima
renegade with shirt hanging out sleeves
tucked up with armbands of fawn skin

trousers hanging in torn shreds mummied
feet bare dried gnarled

  jingle thompson dismounted and said
jesako you have told me everything in
the world everything in the sky above the
world but now ive trailed down this-
away once more to ask you a question
and you kin answer no doubt about it
beat on your drum git your turtle
bones swallow em bring down the ole
stars outn heaven for to do your biddin
and answer me this where is pablo
claug

  what need of the stars the shaman
said the halfbreed claug is hiding be-
low pinto mesa a kinsman of mine
trailing up to cobbs coulee with baskets
to sell told me

  good jesako youve told me what
nobody else in die desert dast tell me
youve told me where claug is at and
im goin to kill him

  the old shamans eagle eyes looked
piercingly at the boys face then he
nodded as if to say yes i see you
have murder in your heart without
changing the expression of his deeply
wrinkled face he said aloud any man
dast tell you where pablo claug hides
because pablo claug himself will laugh
when you find him and after he laughs
he will take your life

  i dont know about that my cards
dont say that hunted all through my
pack over and over agin for that statement
and it aint there

  then the desert will take your life

i	have seen many signs ever since the time
of ripe acorns that we are to have a great
storm and today the signs multiply
thought i felt that in my bones jin-
gle admitted but what of it jesako
ive been in a desert storm before none
of your tribe ever got skeered of a little
wind and a couple clouds of sand let her
come the hell with it

  this kinsman of mine this basket
weaver who saw pablo
claug tells me that the
heat is very great down
there by the sierra del
aja it is a sign likewise
pablo claug hiding in his
canyon does not leave the
shack which is his hiding
place because of the great heat

 good enough for me jesako so
much the easier ill go up to his door
and knock so help me god and ill say
heres jude thompson son of ned

                                                        
the prophet of pinto mesa



thompson the man you plugged and
then ill-

  the old cloud-swallower watched the
youth no sign of surprise or incredulity
coming over his face but jingle himself
darted back an angry look

  you think i wont kill him ay he
hitched up his trousers in the belligerent
swagger of a boy and in doing so his
hands touched his holster

  yes he still wore that holster he had
been many a time down that canyon with-
out a gun but now for once he clung to it
it was a half superstitious half sceptical
feeling he had towards it very much for
instance as the feeling a negro sustains to-
wards the rabbits foot he carries tucked
away a foolish little talisman no possible
good to anyone but then why go against
the superstitions of many years besides
jingles grandfather had given him that
gun and his grandfather was always
right

  you think i aint good enough to kill
him ay he went on threateningly well
then why does my card pack tell me i
will  and why do them stars which you
taught me to read-and which all last
night i was palaverin with-why do they
say ill kill him

  the old shaman nodded such things
had happened this youth had all the
strength of the mesas and the sierras be-
hind him they were on his side

  look here ill tell you how im goin
to git him im goin to skeer him they
say he gits skeered easy dont they 
never kills a man outright plugs him in
the back or else lyin down this time
he lay down pretendin he was daid and
then plugs my father a lot of imagina-
tion hes got-thats what i hear is the
right name for it imagination same as
i have only i write pomes with mine
and he bumps off his enemies with hisn
well this time its my imagination agin
hisn

  the heat-the storm- the shaman
was shaking his head with its straight
mane of coarse hair is your mind
greater than the mind of the storm-of
the sierras-of the hot hand

  damn right it is jingle said shaking
his fist like a boy making a swollen and
futile oath but the shaman did not smile
again the eagle eyes pierced into the
lyouth and again he nodded his white head

  this hombre pablo claug it is true is
a coward he fears everything which his
grandmother a pima witch feared but
he will not fear you

     

  he wont ay the boy cried why
look here he got so all-fired scairt of a
galloway bull that he plugged him in the
belly hows that for bein plain adobe
yaller

  the indian held up his hand a withered
mummy hand whose gesture no man could
disobey listen to this white child  he
is afraid of bulls because when young he
was tossed but what of that can you
take a galloway into the arroyos a bull
may fright this man but a child like
you- now the hard deep wrinkles the
piercing eyes the hook nose the adaman-
tine countenance seemed to soften jingle
thompson was the one white man in the
world who understood this shamans re-
ligion he could not forbear giving him
warning you may laugh at pablo
claug even though he has the strength of
seven men but can you laugh at the
fires of the canyon  can you laugh at the
sandstorm and the desert whirlwind -
good god the boy fairly screamed
the canyons are on my side and sos
the desert the heat the sand thems my
weapons ill use em if i caint git
pablo claug with this here contraption on
my hip ill turn the fire of hell agin him
-which is the desert

  the white head nodded slowly yes
it is true ever since you were born the
canyons and the wind-and the mesas-
they have been on your side

vi

jingle followed the witch doctor into
his shack many a time before the
old sage had given the boy refresh-
ment for body and soul

  im goin to wait till the times ripe
jingle said when the deserts so hot
you caint see and when the vultures begin
to escape to the sierra when the mesas
turn upside down in lakes of mirage-then
ill trail him

  he ate some meal cakes drank of a
colorless liquid the shaman had distilled
from the agave plant rolled a cigarette
and then he spread out his pack of cards to
study them

  the indian stood at the door watching
the coming of the mirages

  the desert is burning he said never
was there greater heat no wind across the
picachos the country is dead there is
a buzzard fleeing like a sea-gull before a
storm

  the old birds guessed wrong jingle
said reading his cards if he stuck
 v-

short stories

around a while longer hed git a good
meal

  never was there such heat-and never
was there so much water the sierras are
become islands the thunder bird is
come into the desert the bad mind is
casting a spell over it

  then bgod im trailin jingle
said

  the time is come the aged shaman
admitted to his disciple the hot hand
be with you my little puma cub go
down to your combat and when you
fight wear this braided cord about your
neck for it means you have dreamed the
great dream and are a jesako

jingle went down to the river bed
to his horse he now had two talis-
mans with which to fight the six-
gun which his frontier ancestor had given
him and a piece of sacred string-given
to him by his boyhood friend a half-
crazed pima

 he mounted black diablo and at a
steady canter plunged into the wilderness
of rabbit brush and mesquite the first
steps of the sierra del aja appeared on
the horizon in squares in a pattern as reg-
ular as the battlements of a castle they
changed in color as the rider neared them
from a light blue to a purple brightening
to a streaked orange

  he reached their bases and then started
a slow climb up the facade of rain stained
rock zigzagging up across strata of cream
yellow and indian red shadowless adobe
glistening quartz

  reaching the crest he struck off at a
steady trot across the mesas flat top at
the southern crest he came precipitously
upon a vast purple bowl its rim consisting
of crater formations its center corrugated
with numberless radiating wallows in the
canyon closest to his feet jingle could see
a lake tinged a dusky lavender although
he knew this was a mirage it was a veil
hiding something beyond he strained his
eyes trying to fathom the depths of that
lake the heart of the desert

  despite the lateness of the day and the
slight elevation jingle could feel a terrific
heat gathering about him until his head
throbbed and he heaved slightly for breath
his horse without having loped fast
enough to become lathered panted heavily
it was a curious heat not the kind that
usuahy comes up like a furnace blast from
south of the sierra del aja there was
no feeling of wind but there was the
sound of it and in the floor of the can-

yon whiffs of dust scudded across the

sand the phan-
tom lake seemed
to be simmering
to a boil the
crest of the
granite benches
against the low
sun partially
obscured by a
strata o f heat
undulated
in scarcely per-

  the tensity of the atmosphere preced-
ing a storm the semblance of a tornado
on every side without so much as the
touch or sound of wind all these things
baffled the boy

  the sun rolled down quickly snuffed
out in those mirage lakes like a torch
thrust sputteringly into water there was
no twilight

  a line of vivid lightning scratching
across the table mountain transformed the
scene into a wide sweep of sand faults of
jagged granite silhouettes of man-high
cactus a rumble of thunder like the
sound of a jesakos tatoo upon a witch
drum sent black diablo tearing madly
down into the bowl canyon

  with his rider dinging to his mane the
brone plunged through patches of black
sage sliding down steeper slopes partly
on his haunches in a shower of rocks and
sand scratching his flanks and tearing the
boys khaki in the underbrush of thorn
in flashes of lightning jingle saw ahead
of him the dry wash of a river bed a series
of sharply falling cliffs and draws-and a
desolate nesters cabin

  thats where he is-damn him to the
bottom of hell a useless curse pablo
claug was already in the nethermost
depths of hell and so for that matter
was the boy hell was all about appear-
ing in spasmodic flashes a stark demesne
of cactus lava thunder-and that nesters
cabin

  the bad minds sure aworkin jin-
gle said and the thunder birds hover-
in over us if it scares me think how its
searin him

  he laughed achieving a sudden courage
if the thunder bird which i dont be-
live in can scare me itll sure make that
half breed crazy hes part indian and be-
lieves he pressed his horse up toward
the cabin the animal was trembling
hysterical shying at every cactus jingle
looked over his shoulder at the overhang-

the prophet of pinto mesa



ing mesa down at the gulch lightning
was playing across from one granite wall
to the other there seemed no end to the
echoes of a single thunderclap

  if its terrifyin me he said again
think what its doin to him

vii

jingle thompson had a very
clear conception of what he was talk-
ing about claug was afraid but he
was afraid no longer of posses of men
trailing him he only wished they were
trailing him his great horror was the
anticipation of spending a night in that
desert the only human being within many
miles

  the first flash of lightning seemed to
electrify all the dormant horrors of his
pima ancestry they came to life clamor-
ing about him gripping him riding him

  no longer able to bear the loneliness of
that little shack he went out for his horse
better to ride pell mell on any trail to any
destination there was a chance he might
find some wayfarer-pocket hunter bandit
or mexican-if he rode far enough it
made no difference as long as it was a
human being two men can laugh at the
thunder bird and all such savage gods
and devils but one man alone-no

  he untethered his horse the dgsert
had darkened rapidly the stars were
blanketed by what seemed a red curtain
hanging between them and the mesas
pablo claug looked about in the deep
gloom in which the cactus and pronged
saguaro loomed like waiting beings if
they only were men he would rush to
them throw his arms about them crying
out for joy he was alone in a bedevilled
creation he was lost and in a country
even the buzzards abandoned why had
he fled from those thompsons or from
civilization for all he knew thompson
might not even be dead and besides it
was a fair fight he could have escaped
the noose many a time before he had
escaped he cursed himself for his fear
of men which had sent him fleeing into
a region of demons no those saguaro
looming about were not men-they were
demons biding their time

  he leaped to his roan terrified at the
frantic pulling at its mouth the horse
reared standing upright and falling back
onto the sand pablo claug practised
horsebreaker left the seat in time to save
himself a streak of lightning sent the
roan galloping into a patch of mesquite


leaping over it in bounds into the deeper
tangle of the thorn and then struggling
like a fly caught in a web

  claug knew well enough he could not
go after his mount in that mesquite patch
he had no desire to be trapped out there
now let the horse fight it out his reins
would keep him from wandering

  he picked himself up and stared about
dumbly a flash of light revealed a great
cloud of dust sweeping down through a
break in the sierra del aja far off as
if from a region as remote as those crim-
son stars he heard the howling of a great
wind

  another flash one of those pronged
saguaro down toward the creek bed seemed
to have come to life it was a big saguaro
-bigger than any he had noticed more
like a horseman than a man on foot

  the wind rose to a deafening roar it
came rushing down through gulch and
barranca bringing with it a dense mist of
alkali it hit the patches of brush so that
the lightning caught a glitter on the under-
sides of the leaves it came walloping
against the little shack with the force of a
tree trunk hurled against it it overthrew
one of the cactus-trees and that big
saguaro was blown bodily along the trail
for all the world it was a horseman riding
before the wind

   and then the lightning revealed what at
first looked like a cluster of white blossoms
at the top just like a face-as if the
horseman had lost his sombrero in the gale
so that his face was revealed clearly in the
flashes of light

   by god it is a horseman pablo cried
no it aint yes it is or a devil no
its buman thats what so help me blowin
along the trail afore this wind he drew
his gun no aint goin to kill him i
want him im goin to keep him hell
save me from the thunder bird-just
talkin to him will save me from goin
mad

  the mere thought of a human being
coming up that bank buffeted by the wind
seemed to bring pablo claug to himself
he was no longer alone at the mercy of all
his superstitions his indian devil-gods
the thunder bird and the bad mind were
again something to be laughed at ill
shore keep him at my side till the nights
over he said triumphantly

  but then another much more rational
fear occurred to him the law was after
him and perhaps this man was trailing
him very likely some double-crossing
indian in the desert had revealed pablos


short stories

whereabouts some indian who wasnt
afraid but there was no such indian
they were all afraid still you couldnt
tell they got drunk sometimes-or else
crazy mad eating peyote a sensible in-
dian wouldnt tell on him but a locoed

indian-

  well nothing to do but treat the wan-
derer as an enemy shoot his horse break
him take him prisoner that was an easy
matter-for this man pablo claug

  he turned to the door of his shack and
knowing he was still out of range he stood
there with back towards the horseman
and calmly and slowly rolled a cigarette
as if he had not noticed anything coming
up the trail he did not light his cigarette
because of the wind but he stood wait-
ing with a fine calculation of the exact mo-
ment the horseman would come within
range

  and then he wheeled drawing on the
instant firing a shot into the chest of the
mans mount a black bronco the little
cow pony plunged forward reared and
fell rolling as if to shake off some animal
that had clutched its throat

  pablo claug rushed down the trail gun
in hand and stopped within a few feet of
the rider who had been violently thrown

  you draw on me hombre claug
shouted and ill put the rest of these
here shots in your own carcass

  the man on the ground struggled to a
sitting posture and looked up when
pablo claug saw the oval face the black
wavy hair and big gray eyes of a mere
boy he burst out into a laugh

  so its you jingle thompson he
roared triumphantly youve come to
get me ay 

  sure its jingle thompson the boy
said im his son

  i didnt figure that youd do anything
about it little moso they always said

as how you
was a reader of
the stars that
there was no
fight in you
jingle sat
there unflinch-
ing there was
no tremor vis-
ible on his lips the truth was and pablo
knew it that the boy even though looking
into the muzzle of a six-gun was com-
pletely devoid of fear

  if youre a reader of the stars claug
said scoffingly im right glad you come

im goin to keep you a while afore killin
you the stars look funny tonight and
im wanting a thing or two explained to


  a terrifice cannonade of thunder broke
off the halfbreeds speech his eyes
opened wide again so that young thomp-
son could see the whites and a peculiar
sheen about them like the phosphorescent
eyes of a coyote

  youll be company to me tonight
claug said marching over to the boy and
frisking him of his gun you come into
this here shack with me im hankerin
for company in the mornin ill fix you
sos you wont be trailin me any further
south instead the coyotes will be hangin
around for a chaw at your pintos nose-
and yourn

  claug threw the boy into the cabin and
jingle found himself in a hot room which
was cluttered with saddle parts oil cans
frying pans a dutch oven a jack lantern
on a box table

  pablo lit the candle sticking it in the
cone of dropped wax he then turned to
the boy who sat on the floor looking up
with a taunting placidity at his enemy
how pitiably frail in comparison to the
hulking and powerful brute and yet in
those large gray eyes glowing through a
stray black lock claug could not detect
the slightest flicker

  for the first moments pablo claug took
little notice of the companion he had
captured the boy was unarmed claug
having tucked his six-gun in his hip pocket
nothing to fear from this little waif of a
human being compared to the thunder
he was pitiable ridiculous-and also a tre-
mendous comfort

  meanwhile the whirlwind raised its
voice unnaturally close maddening in its
resemblance to a desolate puma or to the
wail of a woman the sound swelled with
a burst the shack rocked almost like a
cabin on a ships deck a furious pelting
of sand pebbles mesquite roots deafened
the two inmates pablo reinforced his
nerve with a prodigal swig and then looked
almost beseechingly at the boy who was
studying his captor with glowing eyes
calm set lips

  look here you damned little skunk
pablo cried arent you afraid

  he waited then goaded by the inexor-
able almost happy smile he shouted do
you hear me im yellin at you why
the hell arent you tremblin at this here
storm  maybe i wont live to kill you in
the mornin youll be dead before that

-and me too damn you ill make you
afraid you little grinnin rabbit

  pablo claug swung his great red fist
toward the floor catching the boy on the
side of the mouth young thompson
hurtled back his shoulders splintering the
boards of tbe door of the shacks bunk-
room the rusty hinges snapped and the
door warped backward twisting partially
open

  youve got power in your giant body
pablo claug the boy said wiping the
blood from his mouth but i have a
power you havent a power denied to
other men

  pablo claug after the hysterical exer-
tion of his blow was left sitting trembling
from head to foot

  ive got my right mind the boy said
scrambling to his feet composed for all
his dizziness thats moren you have
pablo claug your minds shriveled up
with this here whirlwind i can see your
forehead dry as a cow skull bleachin in
the rattle weed

  claug frowned the nerve of the little
rabbit making fun of him then he
smiled and rubbed his huge paw across
his forehead the smile left him yes
the boy was right his forehead was dry
dry as something bleaching in the wind

  i can read the stars-thats my power
the boy cried his voice ringing piercingly
in a lull of the storm

   pablo claug fingered the flap of his hol-
ster nervously across his long face there
flashed indecision a whimper of pleading
then when the thunder clapped a new ex-
pression of fear plis forehead was no
longer dry for jingle could see a moist
film of sweat reflecting the candle light

  he looked to the boy beseechingly and
his eye followed the trickle of blood from
the placid mouth down the oval chin to
the sacred cord

  who gave you that there jesako cord 
the breed asked

  my own right i dreamed the jesakos
dream are you so daft that youve for-
gotten the rites your injun grandma taught
you 

  pablo winced swore then stammered
out tell me-tell me this- if youre a
jesako-whats happenin up thar-and
whats happenin to me you tell me
straight dont think you can save your-
self im goin to stretch you when im
ready dont stall and tell me lies thinkin
ill let you off

   youre goin crazy pablo claug i read
   

that in the low stars i seen the low red
stars reflected in your eyes

  the halfbreed stared quizzically puzzled
at first then maddened

  youre a stinkin liar he cried

  am i  then why is it youre believin
theres a storm outside why-if you
aint locoed you are savin theres a
storm outside aint you now

  hell no

  but you are you said so and there
aint a touch of storm out there no water

no rain no hail-

  who said there was hail the half-
breed grumbled in bewilderment

  you heard stones hittin against the
cans overhead

  sure he kneaded his lips fingers
writhing

  and you thought there was a wind-
a whirlwind blowin up the under sides of
the sage he changed his voice maybe
you think you can smell the sage

  there was no doubt about the sage per-
vading every corner of that room claug
sniffed he reminded young thompson
of a horse snorting in fright

  there was thunder claug whimpered

uncertainly but maybe i was-

  dreamin ay youre crazy thats
what did you ever hear a millin herd

growl did
you ever think
it was like

jingle thomp-
son knew that he had touched a vibrant
chord

  did you ever hear of the man-eatin
bull the boy hastened on his imagina-
tion soaring the bull that gets his vic-
tims and waits till they go crazy with
thirst he raised his voice to an intense
cry-a bard evoking epic scenes ive
seen that bull pablo claug you took a
shot at it when it came chasin you to get

galloway but it warnt it was the bad
mind in the form of a bull and after

short stories

you would come back to it you have
come back and its goin to get you and
gore you pablo claug thats what the
stars say-the low red stars i seen out
thar reflected in your eyes

  claugs face turned color the soft
wagging light of the candle threw his
features into a relief-a blue mask with
sharp black lines of madness desperation
the big fear-crazed man impotent against
the thunder cornered like a rat turned on
the only thing upon which he could vent
his rage and fear-the taunting boy

  jingle thompson met the onslaught with
a wide sweep of his slender arm his fist
did not reach up to the brutes chin but in-
stead a fortune tellers deck struck claugs
face bursting outward into a shower fill-
ing the dim room for an instant with
downward fluttering cards

  claug rubbed his eyes confused baffled
at kings jacks diamonds black spades-
symbols of death of life of misery and
power

  jingle thompson raked the torn dog-
eared pile together with his tapering fin-
gers

  death is written here upon this table
above the tumult and whistling in the
flattened tin cans of the shacks roof the
loy raised his voice his words were
screams following sharply rapidly upon
the claps of thunder

  the cards are leadin the life of pablo
claug torturer of cattle killer of men
every card falls tellin of death pablo
claug locoed dies and the cause of him
dyin is his own cruelty taurus comes
down outn the sky tonight claug will
be gored trampled as the bones of the
mex matadors are broke as the chaff
of the pimas corn is driven away

  a long roll of crashing clouds drowned
him then as they rumbled in diminish-
ing echoes through the mesas the boy
added you can hear it now the bull of
pinto mesa at your very shoulder behind
you-on the other side of that wall

  yes there was unmistakably a rattling
of the boards a rumble of sticks and
stones beyond and all about them a bellow-
ing of wind

  pablo claugs jaw dropped a hoarse
scream came from the stained gaping
mouth he wheeled drew and emptied
his revolver into the bare warped boards
it was the same cowardly impulsive act
by which he had killed jingles pinto the
same by which he had shot jingles father
during that moment jingle circled his ad-
versary and crept up behind him as he was

firing hysterically into that wall the
boys hand with one convulsive gesture
reached to claugs hip pocket the fingers
snapped shut upon the gun his own gun
which the breed had taken from him

  but the streaks of white fire and the
loud banging seemed to waken claug from
his hallucination as a mans own voice
calling awakens him from a nightmare
he turned his thick lips blue now not so
much with fear as with a humiliated
rage

  you think you can come injuu on me
do you you white-livered rat you with
your tricks and your cards i aint wait-
ing till mornin ill finish you here and
now for your lies he pulled the trigger
and heard it snick on an empty shell

  jingle thompson clutching franticall
at his own gun jumped to his feet and
straightened up he was no longer a
frail puny boy waiting smilingly for death
the smile was wijped away his lips were
tight he was immobile statuesque
amazed baffled at the terrible power that
had suddenly come to him

  dont throw it on me claug gibbered
brokenly for gods sake kid im only
a poor ole cjioio-an old cowdog that aint
worth killin ill save you from the storm
kid from the desert from the lightning
ill- he sank to his knees as jingle
lifted the gun pulled the trigger

  a blast of white a shot ripping a
warped upright jingle staggered back
his wrist sprained by the kick his ears
deafened his brain numbed by the terrific
power of the gun in his hand a heavy iron
thing that had become horribly instinct
with life

  pablo claug roared with triumph the
muzzle had kicked upward claug had
ducked just before the trigger was pulled

  a stinging pain leaped from jinglev
wrist to his shoulder and across his back
it felt as if that kick had shattered his
forearm with both hands he clung to the
piece fumbled again for the trigger
backed to the wall hurling his whole
weight against him claug smashed the
frail figure against the boards

  claugs great fingers dug into the boys
throat twisting his neck till a thousand
pains gripped him a white light more
brilliant than the lightning stabbed his
brain again he pulled convulsively in-
numerable times upon that trigger

  a succession of muffled reports came
from between his body and the stench-
ridden animal that was suffocating him
there was a hideous smell of powder and

                                                       
the pkuphet of pinto mesa



burned clothes of his own flannel shirt
and the calfskin vest of pablo claug-and
of flesh

  for an eternity of moments those fin-
gers tightened pressing his jaw backward
sending pains like deep knives throbbing
down his spine two hundred pounds of
sheer weight lay against him he could
feel the mans heart pounding he could
feel a huge pulse in the thumb buried in
his throat a dense cloud pressed down-
ward upon his lungs his palms burned
with the hot steel of the gun

  and then he felt claugs pulse flutter
pause beat frantically and stop the
thumb cutting into his neck just below the
jaw was stiff-but without any consciously
directed strength

  the huge carcass of flesh fell away from
him sliding to the floor

  jingle thompson stood there like a
spirit which is freed from its habitation
of putrid flesh like a delicate winged thing
from which a hideous cocoon has fallen

viii

the afternoon sky above mule city
was of an intense a dazzling blue
the air purified by the storm was so
clear that you could see the pinon trees on
the sierra etched like little black lines of
pen-and-ink

  as if to compensate for this extrava-
gance of light and color the shacks and
corrals and main street of mule town
were clothed in a dull monotone of alkali
the sand storm sweeping up from the
pinto mesa desert had transformed every-
thing as completely as if with a fall of
snow dust was an inch thick on the
warped galleries of cal martins cantina
on the chow wagon of ping loo on the
buckboards on the snubbing posts on the
edges of the horse-troughs on the crooked
stretch of board sidewalk in front of the
wells fargo and the sheriffs office

  into this scene rode one who had been in
the vortex of the storm a flimsy scare-
crow of a youth riding an exhausted hide-
torn limping horse

  its jingle thompson be god a
stockman cried coming out of the swinging
doors of the big cantina

  several men left the bar several left the
monte tables the chink left his hot dog
stand and his cousin ping loo came to
the door of his chow-cart with his cow-
puncher guests a girl came out on the
gallery above a deputy came out of the

   

 sheriffs office the cry went down the
 street

 jingle thompsons back-and claug
 didnt kill him the halfbreed let him

come back somehow might he didnt find
claug at all else how come hes ridin
back this-away

  but there he was and the word went
from cantina to hotel to veterinarys shop
to the barbers to the livery stable to the
assayers office and from bar to bar
jingle thompson hes back

  but someone raised a very plausible ob-
jection as the youth rode down the center
of the main street his nag shuffling up the
soft dust it was not a black broncho it
was a roan whose hide was torn with
thorns making streaks of blood through
the alkali coat and the objection was
this  taint jingle thompson at all
and that thar hoss aint from the thomp-
son outfit

  this seemed a very reasonable doubt
the boys face was disfigured with blue
marks as if a bear had cuffed him his
back revealed by the torn shirt was cross-
hatched with the marks of thorn and rock
his neck was swollen clotted with blood

  some one else called out it is jingle
thompson but it aint his hoss its
pablo claugs roan

  in the gaping silence that followed this
statement a gaunt frontiersman stepped
out into the middle of the street and
walked down towards the rider shading
his eyes with his scrawny dried-up hand
it was jingles grandfather and the whole
town coming to doors and windows saw
their meeting the meeting of the past gen-
eration of lawlessness and gunfighting
with the new generation represented by
the boy they all scoffingly nick-named jin-
gle thompson

  the grandfathers eyes squinted his
mouth at first anxious began to curl into a
grim smile of recognition yes this was
his grandson no matter what horse he
rode no matter what tatters he was
clothed in no matter how thick a mask of
alkali and blood was on his face the
partly blind old man knew his kin


short stories

  did you do it kid  the old man asked
excitedly so that everyone in the street
could hear him did you do what i ast
you to i told em-the whole town-
youd gone after him i told em you was
my flesh and blood did you bump him
off

  the boy was eager to tell but there
was something else that came first
wheres my dad

  hes back thar kid i had to tell him
damned if it didnt give him more spirit
to fight for his life hes all righto kid
cornin around fine fightin like hell
cause he wants to see you

  before the grandfather could resume
his volley of questions the crowd had come
down from office and bar and gaming
room and chow-cart the boy was sur-
rounded and the old grandfather was
shouted down with the clamor of questions
where did you git the ole roan
who tore up your clothes

  who tore tip your face

  been wrasslin with a puma

and pablo claug where is he now 
the grandfather was feeling of the
horses hide his nose his mouth aiding
his sight with the sense of touch is this
pablo claugs hoss shore enough

  it is and i done it jingle thomp-
son anounced with a boyish flourish

 hes bumped off hes done it
bgod

  and with his bare hands the deputy
sheriff cried

  caint shoot a gun must have did it
with his hands they wrastled the boy

won but how in hell-

  the skeptical barkeep of cal martins
cantina yelled out above the din did
you-all git him like you said you would-
and tell pomes to him

  this did not elicit the laugh it might
have done a few days ago instead the
crowd became silent as if waiting for the
answer

  i told him pomes shore enough jingle
said grimly he alighted from his horse
and took a swig from the flask the first
man held out to him pumped potry into
him till he was ravin mad he emptied his
gun firin into the storm and then i fin-
ished him with this here contraption

  he patted the six-gun his grandfather
had lent him

  the deputy sheriff as well as some of
the more skeptical citizens of mule town

scratched their chins finally look
here jingle said the deputy you cut
out this here potry and tell us the truth
did you ackcherly meet up with the hell-
bender 

  go back there to the dry wash south
of pinto mesa jingle rejoined wiping
his mouth theres a nesters cabin
there

  what about it from the deputy
  pablo claugs bodys there

  thats talkin jude the grandfather
cried he turned about to the whole
crowd and anounced proudly my grand-
son-jude-he stretched him

  thats the ole gunman jingle cried
a barkeep

  i knew hed do it i told you-all hed
do it shouted the grandfather jingle
he rode after pablo claug and bumped
him off wow

  the scarecrow took another swig from
the flask and looked up as if startled into
his grandfathers face he had never been
called jingle by that man before except
in the most scathing contempt could it
be he deserved that now

  what-all are you callin me jingle for
id like to know

  what-all what-all taint me its
your dad lies the one he said you just
wait till my kid comes ridin down the
center of town with his rein chains ajing-
lin and his spurs ajinglin theyll listen
to him then ill tell you dad burn my
soul ef hed only knowd you was cornin
ridin pablo claugs hoss wow

  the deputy sheriff the barkeeps and
gamblers and every miner and stockman
and renegade there broke out into shouts
of laughter and acclamation

  the excited old frontiersman added at
the top of his lungs didnt you-all hear
the way his rein chains jingled when he
was a-ridin home and his spurs thats
why youll all call him jingle thompson
from this day on because its music in
everybodys ears be god i heard that
thar jingle of them rein chains down to
the bottom of my toes so help me and
ill never forgit the sound of it

  but as loud as his cries were he was
drowned by the renewed acclamations of
mule town

  jingle was the name of the kid whose
tunes they danced to it was his name be-
fore it was his name now and it would
be that forevermore

                by eric howard

     lloyds greed had always crushed everything before him 
     but up there in the cold heights of the pecos country

     he was faced with something stronger even than greed-

     the call of blood that made jack hughes execute justice

two men on horseback follow-
ing three heavily burdened bur-
ros rode up the dry arroyo a
light snow fell obliterating
whatever trail marks there had
been  a biting wind swept through the gash
of the canyon the first man cursing the
blinded burros accepted the cold as he ac-
cepted most things without complaint
the other of quite a different type unused
to the saddle equally unused to the ways
of the trail beat his hands together bit his
lips blinked his smarting eyes and again
and again sobbed god but its cold
occasionally the man in the lead would
turn his head and give his companion a
contemptuous glance of course it was
cold what did he expect in mid-janu-
ary at this altitude with the wind sweep-
ing fulljorce down the pecos

  when do we reach camp demanded
the second man querulously

  poco ticmpo lazily responded his
guide

  both men were dressed heavily in prep-
aration for storms of any kind-the guide
in a double sheepskin coat a fur cap long
woolen stockings and high boots the sec-
ond man wore what the best of chicagos
clothing shops had recommended for such
an expedition as he was undertaking-an
expensive fur coat imported chamois rid-
ing trousers waterproof boots of soft
pliable leather but warmly as he was


dressed henry lloyd was not warm for
city winters he was prepared he went
from his steam heated apartment to his
steam heated office in a closed car his
body was soft and round but his blood was
thin rich food had lowered his resistance

  why he asked himself had he had the
bad luck that made necessary this trip at
this time of year luck usually favored
henry lloyd but now it seemed to be dead
against him and yet the long journey
was necessary necessary to everything that
made lloyds life what it was he must
investigate for himself the reports and ru-
mors that had reached him if they were
true if the upper jemez land was really
valuable all of his plans would have to be
changed

  he recalled how he had acquired that
property for less than the proverbial song
the pleasure that recollection gave him
caused him to forget for a moment the pain
of the saddle and the trail he laughed
softly the chuckle of triumph that those
who entered his chicago office furnished
in heavy mahogany knew so well

  his chuckle ceased abruptly he felt
the serious eyes of the guide upon him
and a shiver not of cold passed up and
down his spine damn the fellow any-
way what was wrong with him

  he gets my goat said lloyd to him-
self i didnt like his face when i first
saw him if thered been any other guide
short stories

id never have hired him and this damn
country you might as well be in mex-
ico with a swarm of yaquis in ambush
waiting to attack as here the govern-
ment ought to do something-nothing but
mexicans in all these towns weve passed
through and he savvies their lingo like
one of em wish i did

  it was true that since leaving san an-
dreas two days before they had journeyed
through tiny villages where the majority
of the inhabitants were of spanish extrac-
tion lloyd ignored the historical fact
that these people were the descendants of
the conquistadores who had come into the
country three hundred years before that it
was their country he had heard no eng-
lish or next to none since he had left san
andreas yet he was within the united
states the guide obviously an amer-
ican spoke seldom he became fluent only
in spanish he had nothing in common
with his employer and to the latter it
seemed that his eyes took on a malevolent
gleam whenever the guide looked at him

  lloyd was uneasy from now on they
would pass no more towns not even mex-
ican villages they would follow the ar-
royo far up into the mountains ascend the
long trail that led to the mesa and traverse
that to the section of land that had already
proved profitable to henry lloyd it gave
promise of even greater profit and henry
lloyd lived for profit

  swope his agent in san andreas had
recently reported that the land was valua-
ble several persons had tried to buy it
one of them the representative of a large
coal company there was actually coal on
it and probably oil swope advised lloyd
to go easy it might be worth far more
than he had ever thought when he allowed
his imagination free play in writing his
stock prospectus the upper jemez min-
ing corporation which was one of lloyds
pseudonyms had already sold twenty-five
per cent of his stock its only assets
were the section of land which lloyd had
never seen and lloyds imagination gift-
ed as he was lloyd had never imagined
that the land was really valuable he let
his stockholders imagine that

  but if it was coal and oil-bearing then
hed stop his stock selling campaign let
it rest for a year buy back the stock that
had been sold for a tenth of what it had
brought and negotiate with a lug company
lor the sale of the property once before
lloyd had iost a hundred thousand by sell-
ing stock in a worthless enterprise only to
have it prove valuable he didnt intend

to make that mistake again and he was
enough of a geologist to make the examina-
tion for himself

  lord but it was cold nothing but
business crooked business could have got
henry lloyd out of his steam heated apart-
ment and his comfortable office in the mid-
dle of winter but when he thought of the
financial possibilities his small eyes glowed
and he forgot for a moment the guide
and the cold

  but not for long he couldnt forget
the guide the man rode before him tall
and lean and broad of shoulder somehow
sinister henry lloyd had been afraid be-
fore but never under
circumstances like
these there had been
the time when a mad-
dened investor in one
of his enterprises had
leaped to the running-
board of his limou-
sine in the midst of
the city traffic lloyd
had cowered against the soft cushions
while his strong chauffeur flung the man
off and called a policeman later lloyd
had read that the fellow had been sent to
the insane asylum

   in his office and in his apartment he had
nothing to fear no one could get to him
his negro valet had been a pugilist before
he learned to press trousers and his of-
fice was well guarded

   but here he looked at the bleak cliffs
twisted and distorted by volcanic action
he was alone many miles from the pro-
tection of the law alone with a man who
hated him he knew the guide hated him
but did not know why and he feared
him as he had never feared anyone before
worse than the fear was the terrifying un-
certainty he was going into the wilder-
ness with this man and he was helpless

  he felt in his hip pocket the pearl
handled pistol he had brought along but
he was no shot and his gun was a mere
toy compared with the long barreled re-
volver that was holstered below the guides
silver navajo belt

  had it not been for his greed lloyd
would have turned back at the end of the
first day but he must learn for himself
the truth about the upper jemez property
he must go on in spite of his fear his
cupidity made him almost brave

  besides he was probably imagining
things he told himself the guide was
probably just a dumb stolid brute like the
burros why should he hate lloyd he

                                                        
tempered with mercy

had never seen him before knew nothing
of him

  when do we get to that darn camp
he demanded again striving to put a cheer-
ful comradely note into his tone

  the guide pointed to a rise far up the
arroyo there was a small shack barely
visible

  well camp there for the night he
said ive been headin that way its
jim hunters old cabin nobody there now
since jim died

  jim hunter the name startled henry
lloyd and seemed strangely familiar
who the devil was jim hunter why-
why he was the chap who had owned the
upper jemez section lloyd had got the
property from him jim hunter of
course

  so hunter was dead yes he had
heard that and tonight he was going to
sleep in hunters old cabin ugh he
didnt fancy that he wasnt superstitious
but it was sort of ghostly for all that he
frowned as he remembered his dealings
with hunter

  he felt the guides eyes upon him study-
ing him

  well he attempted a casual tone i
hope itll be warm

  itll be warm all right the other re-
sponded slowly

  what did he mean by that lloyd asked
himself the words had some other sig-
nificance than they usually had hed have
to be on guard have to watch himself it
wouldnt do to let this fellow know that he
was afraid

  jim hunter had come to chicago a lean
gangling youth in ill health lloyd re-
membered his first visit to his office they
hadnt admitted him until hunter had men-
tioned that he owned some coal land in
the upper jemez then lloyd had talked
with him the first of several conferences
hunter was eastern bred and had taken
a partial course in geology at an eastern
university unable to go on with it on
account of his health he had left college
and gone to work

  later he had married later still his
health became worse and with his wife
he had gone west they had lived out of
the world for a long time hunter prospect-
ing as much as his health would permit
he had found the claim on the upper
jemez and had acquired the property by
borrowing a little from his family then
he had gone east to sell it or to get capital
with which to promote it

  im afraid i wont last long lloyd re-
  

membered him saying i want to leave
things right for jane my wife

  lloyd was not the first to whom he had
offered the property but lloyd saw possi-
bilities in it that the others had not seen
it might or it might not be valuable it
didnt matter much to lloyd he needed
some remote little known el dorado as a
bait if he could get the jemez land cheap
enough it would do hunter needed mon-
ey at once and floyd needed the land he
set to work to get it he offered no ob-
jection to it on the ground that transporta-
tion would present a big problem  if it was
as rich as hunter said they could build
their own narrow gauge down to the main
line

  lloyds alaskan oil corporation was
almost exhausted all but a small block
of the stock had been sold and what re-
mained wasnt moving in the end after
skillful maneuvering he had exchanged
that worthless block of stock being ex-
tremely glad to get rid of it for the up-
per jemez property there had been a
verbal agreement that he would buy it back
at any time at its current price-but only a
verbal agreement young hunter inex-
perienced and very sick accepted it and
looked for the stock to rise in value soon
it slumped in six months it was worth-
less and lloyd forgot the verbal agreement
hunter too weak to return to chicago
realized on his death bed that he had been
robbed and that jane would be left penni-
less

  and lloyd was to sleep tonight in the
cabin in which hunter had suffered and
died with the guide as his only companion
he shuddered

  swope at first had reported the land
worthless after a cursory examination by
a local prospector acting on that report
lloyd had proceeded to sell stock in it
but now it seemed that hunters dream
was a reality he had to see for himself
had to avoid the mistake of selling stock
in an enterprise that might be wortb keep-
ing but what a fool he had been to hire
this guide he might have engaged a
geologist to examine the property but he
wanted to be sure and especially he
wanted to keep his knowledge secret
secrecy was important in all lloyds deal-
ings

t was an hour later that they reached
the old cabin it had grown dark
go on in said the guide and get
a fire started ill look after the animals

  he herded the burros into a makeshift


short stories

barn-four poles supporting a roof-and
proceeded to remove their packs one of
the burros carried feed for the animals

  henry lloyd stood on the threshold of
jim hunters cabin with the door half
open in the dim light he saw that it was
rudely furnished it had the look of hav-
ing been suddenly abandoned like the ghost
houses in deserted mining towns in one
corner was a drum stove near it a pile of
dry pinon wood

  lloyd forced himself to enter he felt
that the guide was watching him timidly
he walked across the creaking floor to the
stove and with numb fingers made a fire

  jim hunters cabin he inspected the
shack more carefully so it was here that
hunter had lived with his young wife
through the long days of his sickness  it was
here he had died lloyd didnt know what
had happened to hunters wife he never
concerned himself with such things but she
had probably left the cabin just as it was
after hunters death had probably fled
from the place of misery and death

  before the guide brought the packs into
the cabin lloyd had time to recall vividly
the stricken youth he had defrauded but
there was no regret in his heart only fear

  the guide silently set about preparations
for supper cooking a simple meal over the
heater

  frijoles y pan y cafe comida buena
he said and set the pot of beans greasy
and richly flavored with chilli on the table

  whats that demanded lloyd always
suspicious of the guides spanish talk
english will you

  sure said the other but first lets
eat

  again lloyd felt that there was some-
thing ominous in the guides simple words
but he sat down on a rickety chair and lift-
ed a fork of beans to his lips ugh what
food but he was hungy and however
they tasted the frijoles con chile were fill-
ing and warming he ate heartily drank
two cups of black coffee and lighted a ciga-
rette offering
his case of mo-
n o g r a m -
med cigarettes
to the guide

  no gracias
ill roll one
the guide
drew out a
book of brown
papers fun-
ny he s a i d
after a moment to be stayin in a dead

mans house hunters been dead a year
or so now

  did you know him 

  sure i knew him when he first came
out here nice young fellow too bad
about him i wasnt here after he came
back from that fool trip to chicago or
when he died he should never have left
here if he had stayed he might be livin
today couldnt stand any other climate
but the poor kid wanted to fix things for
his wife and there was no one else he

could send if i had been here- but

i was down in old mexico looking for
gold that year the worst of it is he lost
everything got swindled right out of it
by some shark and his wife was left
without a thing

  where is she 

  workin down in san andreas she
hasnt been well since he died it wasnt
the trip that finished him so they tell me
half so much as his disappointment when
he found out he had been stung the
poor kid was lyin right there on that bed
half willin to die thinkin he had kind of
repaid his wife for all her loyalty and de-
votion and then to find out that he had
given his claim away for nothin for
less than nothin for a batch of worthless
stock thats what killed him and the
man that did it is his murderer jim died
cursin him callin out his name

  the guides steely eyes bored into
lloyds the easterner recoiled and his
hand moved feebly in the direction of the
pearl-handled pistol in his pocket

  what  he cried his voice rising its
a lie the whole thing was fair and
square i can prove it in any court

  so thats why the guide hated him
thats why he had feared him what an
idiot he had been to place himself in this

mans power why he might be-

  who are you  he cried

  the guide had given the name of jack
hughes but that might be an alias

  im jim hunters first cousin hughes
replied and in our family a kinsman al-
ways fights for a kinsman

  lloyds fingers clasped in desperation
about the pearl handle of his pistol but
before he could remove it from his pocket
he saw a flash of silver and the blue barrel
of the guides revolver was leveled at him
across the table

  put up your toy said hughes in his
slow steady voice put it on the table
thats right

  lloyd cringed perspiration stood out
on his white brow his small eyes darted

                                                       
tempered with mercy



desperately around the room in search of
a means of escape seeing none they
looked again at the guide a desperate
pleading look

  dont kill me dont shoot he
begged i didnt know-about hunter

i can prove in any court-

  hughes mirthless laugh cut him short
maybe youll have a chance in a court
where technicalities and such truck dont
go he said with an upward gesture
you better pray

  dont-dont shoot wailed lloyd and
his voice broke

  he began to crawl literally hughes
spat in disgust

  stand up he commanded i aint
goin to shoot you-yet that would be
too easy for you jim hunter suffered for
months on account of you and besides
i guess there are other ways of dealin
with a hombre like you ways thatll hurt
you more

  listen this jemez property of jims
aint worth much-not moren a hundred
thousand theres no oil and not any too
much coal its more valuable on account
of the water on it for grazing than for
anything else but with the water and
the coal thats on it though itll be years
before they can take that out its worth
maybe a hundred thousand

  but the western coal people offered
- began lloyd and then checked him-
self

  sure grinned hughes and i guess
you heard a lot more about how valuable
it was eh sure i fixed that gregg
of the western coal company would do
anything for me and i started the other
rumors i wanted to get you out here
knowin i couldnt get you in chicago

  you- began lloyd

  sure said hughes i understand
youve sold about a hundred thousand dol-
lars worth of stock in this jemez project
how many widows and orphans does that
make anyway what youre goin to do
before you leave here is to have that
money transferred from your bank in chi-
cago to mrs jane hunter in san andreas
you might as well write that letter now
lloyd attempted a laugh he was sure
that hughes was bluffing how was he
going to send a letter to chicago from
here they were miles from any post
office farther still from a telegraph station
give up a hundred thousand dollars  not
much

  some of his feeble courage returned
  you cant bluff me with your bad man
  

stuff he said i wont fall for it i
bought that land from jim hunter fair and
square and thats the end of it what
ive made since is mine and ill keep it
your bluff about sending a letter dont go
how you going to send it youll have to

think quicker than that if you-

  grinning jack hughes exerted his trig-
ger finger a bullet whizzed past lloyds
head burying itself in the wall behind him
instantly the man cringed his face was
white and his eyes had the look of a cor-
nered rabbit

  before the smoke had cleared the door
of the cabin was kicked open and a blan-
keted indian entered he lifted his right
hand in silent salutation

  come in sit down and eat hughes
greeted him casually in spanish

  the indian entered sat down and be-
gan to eat letting the colored blanket slip
from his shoulders he paid no atten-
tion to lloyd except to grunt as he passed
him white mans business

  here is my messenger said hughes
santiago is the fastest runner in all the
pueblos he is my friend-eh santiago 
si muy buen amigo he turned
casually to lloyd santiago run like
hell like the damn ol wind sure
santiago will bear your letter it will
go special delivery then he will go on to
san andreas when the money is deposited
to janes account in the bank there he will
return and tell us then-well then per-
haps you can go

  lloyd thought quickly the shot had
unnerved h i m
the presence of
the stolid indian
who was the good
friend of hughes
upset him a hun-
dred thousand 
well supposing
he lost that there
was still enough
in the bank he
would get it back
youre a damned robber he protested
ill write the letter i have to

   thats right said hughes soothingly
ill dictate it

  when it was written enclosed in an en-
velope and sealed hughes handed it to the
indian

  bueno observed santiago

ill see you jailed for this said lloyd
well considered hughes gravely i
guess ill have to ask you to write a kind
of confession just to protect myself sup-


short stories

pose you tell the truth about the upper
jemez mining corporation the alaskan
oil corporation and all the other things
youve promoted i know a good deal
about em i sort of looked into em after
i learned that you had killed jim come
on now write

  you cant blackmail me any more
  write

  i wont

  the gun barked again and hughes
grinned

  i-ill write promised lloyd but

youre forcing me-

  no sir smiled hughes im just
kind of requestin put down first that
since youve got religion you feel you
ought to tell bow many widows and or-
phans youve robbed and dont lie re-
member i know a lot more about you than
you think i want a full and complete
confession

  lloyd wrote submitting each page as
soon as he had finished it for the others
approval sometimes hughes returned the
sheet demanded a clearer statement of
some fine point and lloyd laboriously
copied it once or twice during the long
evening he rebelled ft required only a
slight gesture an elevation of hughes re-
volver to start him writing again

  at last hughes approved the statement
santiago witnessed lloyds signature to it

  bueno said hughes and proceeded to
fold the sheets of paper and to place them
in an envelope this he addressed to the
district attorney at chicago

  my god what are you doing  cried
lloyd until now he had visioned his re-
turn to his steam heated apartment to his
luxurious office true he had lost a hun-

dred thousand dollars true also he had
been forced to write a confession of nu-
merous and sundry fraudulent enterprises
in which he had engaged but more mon-
ey could be made once out of this in-
fernal country away from this man and his
gun safe in chicago he would quickly re-
gain what he had lost and never again
would he risk such a chance but now-
the district attorney good lord  if that
confession were mailed he would be ruined
he had been investigated once before
they hadnt been able to get anything on
him-he worked within the law as much as
possible but with that confession-

  youre not going to mail that he
cried you said it was to protect your-
self  ive given you a hundred thousand
ill give you more but dont send that
dont ill-

  do you think asked the guide slowly
that id be so selfish as to let you go on
robbing people do you think im only
thinkin of jim and jane no they
come first theyre my kin but im think-
in too of all the others-of that boy in
the asylum and of the other one in jail for
stealin so he could buy your stock im
thinkin of them same as jim would have
thought of them if hed lived and got well
si senor the letter will be mailed-after
janes money is properly put in the bank
for her

  there was a grim finality in the tone and
eyes of jack hughes lloyd staring at
him recognized his doom

  ill give you-ill pay you- he be-
gan

  no said hughes the letter goes-
with the money and half the outfit you
stay here or not as you like

     thirst-tortured men a yankee sailor and a hate-crazed pas-
     senger and in between a man and a woman singing-had

 ever a man seen the like the man-o-wars man had not

the monacy all squat and ugly
in her war paint was ly-
ing at anchor off ninety-
sixth street windows along
the drive north and south of
grants tomb were beginning to blink
their early evening messages through the
gathering mists aboard the cruiser mess-
gear had sounded and the smoking lamp
was lit

  jimmy legs his big shoulders in their
tight fitting c p os uniform looking big-
ger than ever in the autumnal gloom sat on
the hatch coaming forward watching the
gunners-mates making secure for the
night one of them a tall youngster an-
gular and slim but with the promise of a
chest that would later rival that of jimmy
legs himself was singing in a clear tenor
voice and bad italian accent a neapolitan
folksong made familiar to american ears
by the phonograph oleary the red
haired chief-boatswains mate suffering
from his customary indigestion and
grouch growled a surly protest against
song and singer

  leave him alone broke in jimmy
legs i like to hear him and the song
too it reminds me of one time off hat-
teras-and us in an open boat

  the gunners-mates their work com-
plete joined the gang on the hatchway and
settled themselves comfortably to listen
to

 jimmy legs made them welcome with a
 grin that showed his big white teeth firm-
 ly clenching the stem of his pipe

    there aint none o you youngsters as is
  old enough to remember the old dirty
  kate he began interrogatively no
  i thought not she was broken up before
  most o you was old enough to be out o
  kindergarten back in the middle west
  towns where you was raised i was on
  her when they commissioned her at the old
  brooklyn guardo she was the meanest
  thing afloat always up to some sort o on-
  suspected trick never was there when
  you called her

    on this trip im tellin you about we
  was ordered to the south atlantic station
  as it was called in them days with old
  sammy patchen as commandin officer and
  little willie snow as first luff

   i remember goin down through the
 narrows me at the con and old sammy
 teeterin back and forth on heels and toes
 just behind me watchin the staten island
 shore slip by and pickin up the marks
 ahead when we got into the lower bay
 we run into a nasty soueaster before
 wed left the swash channel the old ship
 was earnin her nickname for fair with
 spray a-flyin over the high focsle-head o
 her and rattlin agin the canvas wind-
 shields on the bridge like birdshot on a tin
 roof that weather kept with us south o
 
short stories

cape may us huggin the shore

  by the time we was off the virginia
capes the gale had growed to a hurricane
i never seen nothin worse the dirty
kate was shippin it green when she rolled
makin extra work for all hands to keep
the broadside guns from breakin adrift
and smashin things up in general you
couldnt get no sleep on watch nor off and
wed had nothin hot to speak of exceptin
midnight and mornin coffee since leavin
scotland lightship behind us

  he paused looked around the circle of
expectant faces now growing dim in the
twilight rose and rolled to the side where
he spat into the brown tide of the flowing
hudson back on the hatch once more
he went on

  well we weathered hatteras all right
passin close enough to scratch the red
paint offn the sides o the diamond shoals
lightship and changed the course a cou-
ple o points to the eastard that brought
us headin sou-soueast or thereabouts and
right into the gale which stead o dyin
down was gettin stronger as we went
south

  i was quartermaster first class then
and jimmy doyle was an apprentice quar-
termaster it was jimmy that sings out
the morning after passin hatteras that
theres a ship ahead of us and makin heavy
weather of it i was just bein relieved
but i hangs on to see whats goin to hap-
pen

  old sammy was a real seaman he
pokes the nose of the dirty kate around
and heads for the hulk for we could see
that was all she was and the nearer we
got to her the worse she looked

  the storm had raised hell-in-general
with her all right her foremast was just
a stump her single funnel was all twisted
and slued to one side and her decks seems
to be swept clear o boats and deck houses
except for the solid superstructure amid-
ships from the top o what was left o
her mizzenmast a spanish flag is a-flutter-
in just a-beggin for help on the wreck-
age of her bridge is a little group o peo-
ple a-wavin and a-jumpin up and down
like they was crazy it give me a funny
feelin in my throat to see em there so
sure we was goin to save em-and in that
sea

  i tell you fellers i never see a worse
sea than what that was shes all run-
nin twistywise with a nasty under-rollin
swell that chops the waves about sos they
come together in spurts o white spray that
shoots up like waterspouts

  little willie snow come up on the
bridge and was standin along side o the
old man both o them was a-studyin
the wreck through their binoculars with
the wind whippin their oilskins about their
legs sort of affectionate and cuddlin

   she wont last long in this sea says
willie cockin one eye at the captain

   no-o-o says patchen drawlin the
words as though he was considerin some-
thin

  i could see the old man was a-workin
over some problem and guessed he was try-
in to figger out a way for us to get a boat
to them people on the spiggotty craft but
he looks at the seas and sort o shakes his
head like he was sayin it cant be done

   no use tryin to reach em with a boat
sir says the first luff like hes makin a
statement he wants the captain to contra-
dict

  the old man just shakes his head
again and i get a little cavin-in feelin
around the pit o my stomach no use
lookin any longer at what i cant help im
just turnin my head away sos i couldnt
see the founderin craft and them on her
when little willie who had went back to
his starin through his glasses sings out

   theres a woman on her sir shes
just come up from below

  the dirty kate roundinto under the
captains orders sos to pass across the
strangers bows had fell off into the
trough o the seas and was rollin like no
other ship i was ever on before nor since
when little willie squawks out about the
woman the old man jerks out a word
he dont often use starts to raise his
binoculars when the ship gives a roll and
over him and i and little willie goes i
feel the bridge rail givin under our weight
and let a yell out o me as i go overboard

  i dont fall far seeins how the dirty

kate is heeled
over the way
she was and
so dont sink
deep but when
i come to the
surface there i
am right under
the counter of
the spaniard
how i got
there so quick
ive never been
able to tell though i guess we was nearer
to her than we figgered in the mist any-
way i strike out and grab a rope thats
trailin over the side
song power



  next minute im a-clawin and a-spit-
tin up her flanks and a-climbin over her
broke rail to her deck with nobody offerin
to give me a hand

  up there the wind seemed to blow
harder than ever and the ocean was al-
mighty close too close for comfort i see
a big boat in chocks just abaft o where
her funnel had been and keeps wonderin
to myself as i go forward to the bridge
where the peoples still a-standin not pay-
in no tention a-tall to me why they hadnt
launched and took their chances i sup-
posed then that they must have some good
reason-no time or no men or somethin

  the old fellow paused drew his pipe
from the pocket into which he had stuffed
it when he began his yarn carefully filled
it with navy plug changed his mind and
replaced the pipe in his pocket

  i wish i could tell you how that gang
up there on the old broken bridge looked
when i got to em he said slowly it
took just a glimpse of the captain to show
me that he was skeered silly and didnt
know what to do he was wearin a coat
with gold braid on the sleeves and his face
was covered with a weeks growth o beard
hes sayin somethin in spanish and a-
lookin off astern

  i turns to look too and what i sees
aint none too reassurin

  its the old dirty kate so far behind
us i can barely see her through the thick
mist of course i knowed then shed
been up to some of her tricks but couldnt
lightly figger out just what had happened
while i was a-lookin though she fires
one o her six-pounder bow guns and sends
up a rocket which i take to mean that shes
tellin us shes a-standin by anyhow
shes out o the reckonin for some little
time to come so i turns back to the span-
iards

   that was a pretty close shave i says
just to be polite and open the talk but i
made it all right you look in a pretty
bad way

  the spiggotty skipper says somethin
back to me in spanish which me speakin
only the cigar box kind gets clean by me
i guess i looks as blank as i feel for i
hear a soft low voice at my elbow say
the capitan asks will your warship re-
main close by

   stand by  i says of course shell
stand by till hell freezes over thats a
way we have in the navy maam

  while im speakin my little piece i get
a good look at the woman and say sbe
was an eye-full her cloes was all wet

        

and clung  her figger and her face was
white with brine and her eyes was big and
looked bigger but she was calm and and
-oh i dont know how to say it when
she looked at you you just had little crawly
feelins racin up your spine and you felt
like you do when theres general muster
for punishment and the old man begins
readin out the court martial orders you
know-all gone inside

  when i get the full charge o them
eyes  stammer out i beg pardon maam

  i dont know what im beggin her par-
don for but it dont make no difference for
she aint payin no attention to me she
has turned round to the captain and is
speakin to him in spanish and believe
me if tones is anythin i wouldnt be
spoke to that-a-way if i had to jump over-
board to dodge it

  the captain didnt seem to mind
maybe he was so skeered he didnt care
what anybody thought o him anyway
she leaves us walkin stately as queen
flavia in the movies or somethin like that
only there wasnt many movies in them
days

  the spiggotty mate comes up and tries
to get more out o me his english bein
rotten i couldnt make him out and goes
off to the wing o the bridge to clamp my
glims on the misty dirty kate it dont
take me long dim as her shape is through
the murk o that day to make out theres
somethin wrong with the old hooker in-
stead o roundin to and cornin toward us
as shed ought to be doin shes gettin fur-
ther and further away i stand there
wishin not to blieve my eyes till shes dis-
appeared altogether

  knowin old sammy patchen as i do
as well as whats expected of us in the
navy i know theres only one party to
blame for the way the dirty kates behav-
in and thats the ship herself

  as soon as i fully take it in that shes
gone and left us adrift i get sick sicks
no real word for it i could tell easy
enough by the way the spiggotty is waller-
in that shes due to go pretty soon the
seas was washin over her as she rolled and
pitched in the trough and each time i see
one cornin at us i say my prayers and get
ready for a long last swim as for them
things amidships they dont do nothin but
moan and make funny noises in their
throats when the waves hits us finally i
go up to the spiggotty mate and talks busi-
ness to him

   see here i says this hookers goin
in a couple o shakes why not make a fight
	short stories

for it and launch that lifeboat back there
ill get her over the side if youll gi me a
couple o men

  he just stared at me with wild eyes
his lips all slack and trembly and his chin
a-wobblin

   well i says tryin to wake him up
what about it do we launch that boat
and have a try for our lives or do we just
stay here and drown like rats remem-
ber theres a lady on board

  he just keeps on starin and wobblin
so i turns to the captain and tries to get
him to order the boat launched he un-
derstands me all right but he just shakes
his head

   no good he says she zeenk queek
cowo los otros or somethin like that

   soll this ship sink quick you lump
i says sink quick and us on her

  i turns to the third man

  this feller was a-wearin a long coat
almost down to the tops o his shoes which
is long and narrow and pointed-you know
the shoes the spiggoties wears around
his throat is wrapped a gray scarf which
hes pulled up over his head to protect his
ears for the wind has a nip in it the
scarf thing makes a sort o frame for his
long dark face which is set off with a lit-
tle spiked chin beard and some mustaches
all waxed and drawed to a fine point i
didnt like his looks at all but i could see
he had his wits still and i thought maybe
he could get the captain to act bein plainly
a passenger so i grabs him by the arm and
points to the lifeboat astern

   boat i yells at him boat launch
eh

  he shakes off my grip easy bein a
powerful man and snaps at me in good
english

   do not touch me yankee dog he
says your ship has deserted us leaving
us shipwrecked-as yankees would do
you are all cowards a race of pigs

  say if hed slapped me in the face i
couldnt ha been more took aback i look
at him a minute wonderin if hes goin
dotty or was i then i seen he meant it
and i let a howl out o me and went for
him i just hit him once though for the
lady who wasnt anywhere around as i see
when i pitched into him steps in between
us she gives me the once-over with them
eyes o hers and makes me feel cold and
hot in the wrong spots

  she speaks and her voice is cold as
the wind if you think we should launch
that boat and are willing to try i shall get
you the men only five are left the

others were drowned trying to launch the
other boats come

  feelin anythin but proud o myself
but knowin that the only chance any of
us stood was in that lifeboat i follow the
woman down the ladder to the forward
well deck remember the bulwarks was
all washed away and the ship was rollin

like oleary here cornin back from a
twelve-hour liberty and every time shed
roll shed ship it green over her sides the
water rushin across the deck in a sluicin
torrent it was a sweet job crossin that
deck

   at the foot o the ladder i sort o hesi-
tated watchin the sea and kind o gropin
round for my courage but did that dame
hesitate she did not she just walks
out on that swayin slippery death trap of
a deck like she was walkin across a ball-
room floor i foller

  at the coamin o the forehatch over
goes the ship and a sea leaps aboard like
a dog jumpin for his master i yell ex-
pectin to see the woman washed away to
leeward instead down she drops clutch-
es a line made fast to the battens o the
hatch and lets the wave go right over her
i never see sech presence o mind in man
nor woman before id got my breath
back shes up and a-walkin on toward the
focsle-head

   down the focsle ladder she goes with
me a-trailin her it was dark down there
and the deck was all awash the water
swishin back and forth with the motion of
the ship

  o course the place is full of noises
what with the creakin o the crazy struc-
ture and the poundin o the waves outside
but in spite o the racket i can hear the
womans voice clear and cool a voice of
authority if ever there was one presently
a man comes lumberin out o the dark to
the little patch o light under the hatch and
then four more

   you tell them what to do and ill
translate she says to me with that air o
hers sort o high and mighty as if she was
song power



talkin to a pretty punk kitchen maid up-
stage thats what im tryin to say if it
had been anybody else youd ha wanted
to bash em but you sort o expected it
from her

  you fellers know what it is gettin a
boat over the side without proper tackle or
hands blest if i know yet how we did
it but somehow we did

  finally we gets her swung outboard
and then at deck level and then i get the
dame into the stern sheets all wrapped up
in coats and things

  by this time the skipper and the mate
and the man in the long ulster has come
down off the bridge the two officers was
tryin to help but fears got em and they
get in the way inoren they do anything
else so i shoo them into the boat with the
woman the other man haint offered to
do nothin but hes made no protest when
i orders him to load us up with water and
what food he can find and i go  with
my work thinkin hes obeyed

  before were all ready for launchin
the ship has sunk until her decks only a
couple o feet above the water line and
every roll she gives is a peck of trouble
for us at the boat

  when all is ready i give the word and
down we lower the boat on the run me
stayin on deck last to see she cleared prop-
erly i come damn near missin out
though for she sheered away as a big wave
rushed us i slipped brought up against
the ragged edge o the broken bulwark
tearin my shirt and a rip down my right
arm there i am on the sinkin ship and
theres the boat ten yards away and goin
further every second

  believe me i done some quick thinkin
just about then the woman though she
motions the men to back water and i take
rny chance and jump and go for them
hand over hand the captain shows hes
human for he reaches down and grabs me
by the hand and helps me into the boat

  she was already gettin out o the lee
o the ship and beginnin to feel the full
force o the wind so i scramble aft and
pick up the steerin oar with the help o
the others i manage to get her straight-
ened out head to the sea

  i was so busy doin that i didnt hear a
shout from the captain that is i heard it
without knowin i heard it after we was
ridin fairly easy i look around for the ship
weve just left

  shes gone it was just as though she
was human and had waited for us to get
away before sinkin for good and all

      

  so there we was seven men and a
woman in a open boat with night corn-
in on and as near as i could guess at
least a couple o hundred miles o stormy
sea between us and the nearest land to
make it worse theres no water and 
food in the boat the man in the long
ulster hadnt done what i told him to do
he was too aristocratic for that i reckon
anyhow he didnt and we had no sort o
provisions o any kind

  when i find it out i looks at this fel-
low with the waxed mustaches and i says
you called me a dog a while ago back
there on that ship i slapped your dirty
face for that then we are quits on that
but when we gets ashore im a-goin to
take this out o your hide understand

  he gives me a scorchin look which
dont scorch me none for im not worryin
about him no more just then im a won-
derin where were at and whether wed
best try runnin before the wind with the
little rag o sail id put in the boat or try
hangin around on the chance the dirty
kate fixed up whatever had happened to
her and come back to pick us up at last
i decides on tryin for the land feelin
very sure that sammy patchen would
never have deserted that sinkin ship un-
less somethin had happened to his own
vessel to make her unmanageable for fair

  i ask the spiggotty captain where he
figgers were at and after a deal o talk
with the lady actin as interpreter i make
out that he reckons were about two hun-
dred miles south o diamond shoals light-
ship

  that gives me my line and i get the
boat swung about though it was some job
with a small boat and the seas that was
runnin i do it though and away we
goes with me crouchin in the stern sheets
at tbe steerin oar bein afraid to let any
o those squoogy moogy landsmen with me
take on the job

  and i tell you i was skeered the
waves looked as though they was coinin
aboard every other minute curlin out o
the dark with their fierce white caps and
just towerin over us somehow more by
good luck than anythin else i managed to
keep her free for the most part though
once or twice we was caught and almost
swamped by one that broke sooner than i
expected

  all that night we run for it lucky
the boat was a big one with blunt bows
and good freeboard for her size

  with mornin the wind dies down to a
gentle breeze though the seas continues

short stories

high for- a long time after the sun comes
up long about ten oclock after id
been at the steerin oar for close on seven-
teen hours straight i turns her over to the
mate he proves to be a pretty good
steersman now that he aint so skeered
and i go forard for a rest under a thwart
pretty soon i was poundin my ear eight
bells in spite of an empty stomach which
even then was beginnin to hurt

  i dont sleep so long at that though
but wake up in about two hours with the
sun straight up over me and me sweatin
and stewin in the heat for all im worth

  i sits up and looks at the others three
o the men is settin near me in the thwarts
aft in the stern sheets is the others the
girl sittin forard o the men with her chin
on her hands and her long white fingers
over her eyes hidin them from the glare

  from the girl i turn to look at the
weather

  the sea has gone down until except
for a long slow swell and a tiny little rip-
ple where the catspaws stirred the surface
theres no movement to speak of the
horizon is close aboard though and theres
a vague sort o shimmery mist over every-
thing it dont look so good to me seein
as how we was so far from land and i
look back at the men to see how they seem
to be takin it and whether i can count on
much help from them

  the mate was still steerin the cap-
tain was a-lyin back on one of the fore-
and-aft seats his shirt open at the collar
showin his red turkey gobbler throat all
tufted with beard where he needed a shave

  but it was the chap with the spiked
beard and mustache that looked worst off
to me hed took off his coat and was in
his shirt sleeves but still had his head
bound up in that scarf thing

  i suppose my gettin up had sort o at-
tracted his attention to me there where

wed nothin to
do much but
watch the sea
and each other
anyhow h es
studdyin m e
through
squinched
up eyes when i
look  at him
eyes that gives
me a little
shiver theyre so damn mean lookin
oncet sence then i saw a fillum called
fawst the mephisto in that movie looks
just like this feller im tellin you about

theres a broodin melancholy devil a-lurk-
in in his eyes that meant business it
seemed to me but i couldnt for the life
o me tell why he had it in for me special
onless it was because i was an american
o course id handed him a wallop back
there on the ship but hed brought that on
hisself anyhow i squinches up my own
eyes and stares at him till i beat him at the
game and he turns his back on me

  i take a seat on the nearest thwart and
reach for my pipe and tobacco o course
the tobaccos wet and spoilt still i man-
age to get a chew that stopped my stom-
ach gnawin but it dont quench my thirst
none and believe me by that time id ha
give a months pay for one swig from the
old dirty kates scuttle butt

  while i was sittin there chewin slow
so as to make it last longer the woman
takes her fingers offn her eyes and looks
at me with a slow friendly smile that curls
her lips and lightens her dark face its
the first time shes looked at me like i was
human and i smile back in return

   come and seet where we can talk
she says to me there are many ques-
tions i would ask

   ask em says i gettin up and crawl-
in over the in-between thwarts till i am
sittin alongside o her what are they

   your sheep she begins why did
she not come back to get us

   because she is of that pig nation the
yankees breaks in the evil lookin man
with the beard

   be silent senor gonsales commands
the woman beside me i will not have
troubles made here especially with this
american who reesk his life to come to our
aid

  i feel sort o guilty at that seein as
how id not had anything much to do with
the cornin the credit bein due the rollin
o the old dirty kate but i didnt say
nothin if she wanted it that way why
that way it was a-goin to be senor gon-
sales as shed called him growls a little
under his breath and turns bis head away

   and now she goes on what is your
name what is your rank and why did not
your vessel stand by as you thought she
would 

  i tell her my name and the real name o
the dirty kate and explain that the old
hooker certainly busted somethin or she
would have been back for us

   but of course she says your sheep
is herself in trouble i had not thought
of that

  she sits silent for a long time finally
song power



i get up the nerve to ask her what her
name is they call me in france lc
rossignol she tells me which means in
your language the nightingale in my
own countree i am called carlotta and on
the billboards i am called la seville which
is the name of the city in which i was
born many names is it not

   quite a few says i respectful what
am i to call you miss 

   not miss  she says and her face is
like a stone image you may call me
madame gonsales

  after that neither of us says anythin
more her forgettin whatever other ques-
tions she wanted to ask me if any by
and by i go back to my forard thwart and
falls to watchin the sea

  man and boy ive been follerin the
sea pretty much all my life and pretty near
all over the world ive seen it in all its
moods and under all sorts and conditions
of weather but i never hated it yes and
feared it like i did that day it looked so
damn sleek and shiny like a great slip-
pery snake crawlin its way to the land

  it got hotter and hotter by and by
one of the three spanish sailors beside me
slips to the bottom of the boat and lays
there with his mouth open and moanin a
little hes just a youngster i think as
i look down at him and see his chin cov-
ered with a black down and just a couple
o curly hairs stickin out-just a youngster
a-growin of his first beard i cant make
out all hes savin in his mutterins but
every now and then i catch the word
agua and know the poor kid is askin for
what he cant get-water

  lord how the day drags but at last
the sun goes down behind the sleek swells
the wind freshens a little and i feels bet-
ter and goes back to the steerin oar to re-
lieve the mate none o the others havin
offered to take their turn pickin out the
north star as my guide i sets my course
a little to the west o that hauls the sheet a
little flatter and feels kind o cheerful
when the boat begins slappin through it

  the funny thing about that day im a-
thinkin as i steer the boat is that nobody
talks we might ha been a gang o deef
mutes for all the sound we make for hours
on end

  along about nine oclock the moon
comes up and we go slappin along with
the water purrin at our bluff bows like a
brace o ships cats i get tired a-figgerin
ur chances on bein picked up or makin
land on our own and takes to observin the
people in the boat
le

  madame gonsales is settin on the bot-
tom o the boat between the two after
thwarts her back to the stern sheets she
might be a statue o one of them buddhas
for all the motion or sound from her the
mate has gone forward with the men and
the captain is a-restin as usual on one o
the fore-and-aft seats astern gonsales is
on the other hes took the scarf thing off
his head and i notice he parts his hair so it
looks like two little black horns in the moon-
light hes a-leanin with one arm over
the side his fingers a-trailin in the water
i see now what i hadnt noticed before
that hes a big man as spiggotties go with
narrer hips and broad shoulders he makes
me think of a bullfighter i seen once in
barcelona evidently i thinks to myself
there aint no love lost between him and his
missus they dont even look at each
other if they can help it much less talk
the youngster in the bottom o the boats
half asleep

  it seems to me as i set there lookin
em all over in the slitherin moonlight
that theyre all dotty and me with em

  thinkins doin no good so i takes my
second chew o tobacco goin easy on it
first because i want it to last and second
because the salt in it makes me thirstier
than hell the wind keeps a-freshenin
and haulin round more and more to the
west kickin up a nice little ruffle o sea
funny im thinkin how different the sea
is that afternoon id fair hated it for
bein so sleek and slimy and full o treach-
ery tonight with the cool air and the
moonlight and all the little wavelets run-
nin to white eaps as cheerful as kittens
the seas a friendly companion

  at midnight the mate has one o the
men relieve me and i go forard again to
try to get some more sleep pretty soon
in spite of hunger and thirst i doze off
my last thought bein that the winds a-get-
tin lively and does the man steerin know
his business

  he dont and i come out of it sharp
with the sail a-flappin all over me and the
mast over the side i make a grab and try
to salvage it but the darn fool aft lets the
sheet fly and away goes the stick draggin
the sail after it there we was adrift on
the high seas with nothin but oars to get
way on her and not a blasted thing in sight
except the white caps which dont look so
playful now that the boats swung off into
the trough

  i grab an oar and bellows to one o the
other men to grab another pretty soon
we had her headed into the seas and pull-
l

short stories

in just enough to keep from broachin to
before that shed been a-wallerin like a
pig in a stye

  and then them spiggotties begins to
talk first the captain starts on the feller
at the steerin oar and i think is he goin
to beat his brains in then the mate takes
his turn with the captain chimin in and the
man a-shoutin at em both and the kid in
the bottom o the boat stops his moanin
and laughs in a way that sets my teeth on
edge with that the other two sailors
butts in till it sounded like a whole me-
nageries broke loose on the lower deck of
a freighter i stand it till i cant stand it
no longer and then i declare myself

   shet up every damn one o you i
yells louder than any of ems shoutin
the damages done and talkin wont
mend it its up to us to row this boat
ashore im goin to head due west the
mate and me do the steerin and the rest
o you can row except o course madame
gonsales

  i dont think they understand all im
sayin but i scramble aft and take the
steerin oar and madame gonsales sings
out somethin in that queer penetratin
voice o hers two o the men takes oars
while shes talkin and away we go

  and then i begin to look back on how
well off we was when we was a-sailin easy
with the wind doin the work and us a-liv-

in high now weve got only our arms
and backs for it and nobody knowin how
fir we are from land grousin never
done  good though so i sticks to the
oar a-thinkin maybe im better off now
than i will be in a little while for i feel
in my bones that more troubles on the
way itll be cornin some of it i tells
myself when i orders that feller gon-
sales to take his turn at the oars which
ive made up my mind him and the cap-
tains got to do when their time comes

  dodgin trouble aint losin it none
though so i sets my jaw and when i figger
the first two men has rowed for a couple o
hours or more i sing out time to relieve
the wheel watch below turn out you
i mean mr gonsales take them oars

  he is a-leanin back over the side trail-
in his fingers in the water as if he was a
silly woman on a pleasure boat he didnt
pay the slightest attention to me when i

spoke just went on trailin his fingers in
the water one arm over the side the other
makin a rest for his chin on the gunwale

  i beckon to the mate whos roused at
my call and tell him to take the steerin
oar i guess they think im a-goin to
take a trick at rowin but instead i reaches
down and grabs mr spaniard by the
waistband o his trousers gives a yank and
pitches him into the bottom o the boat at
the feet o one o them two oarsmen

  next second hes up and cornin i
brace myself and let him have it a good
solid clip on the jaw

  back he goes under the blow the gun-
wale takes his knees and he drops over the
side thats more than i had planned and
i reach down and ketch him by the shoul-
der as he slips past and haul him back into
the boat hes a-gaspin like a fish and
full o water and with no fight left in him

   thats for disobeyin orders i tells
him and has nothin to do with the lickin
im a-goin to give you when i get you
ashore now you take that oar and row

  he takes the oar without another kick
but i see in a minute he aint never learnt
how to handle one proper i keep him at
it though and calls on the captain expect-
in another fight but i dont get it the
captains learnt his lesson by watchin what
happened to the senor he takes holt at
the word from me and i go back to the
steerin oar and send the mate to finish his
watch below

  that second day when it comes is like
the inside of a tomb nobody says nothin
to nobody mine givin orders is the only
voice i hear and i get damned tired of it

  all that day we pull the mate and me
takin turns at the oars and cuttin our
tricks at the steerin short to make up for
it i was gettin used to bein hungry now
but the thirst was like a raging fire gettin
bigger and hotter every second

  after sundown that day the youngster
with the fuzzy chin goes plumb loco hes
been drinkin sea water for a couple o
hours i find out and his fool mates aint
stopped him no use tryin to describe
that part of it it dont last long but its
hell while it does last and im glad when
its all over and theres only six men and
a woman left in the boat

  as for that woman shes just the same
except that her face has browned under the
sun till she looks like a malay

  its the momin of the third day the
sun comes up on a bare cruel sea all
burnished and shinin like the bright work
on the pinnace of an english man-o-war
song power

the mate bein all in ive been steerin
since about six bells in the midwatch my
tongues so dry it rattles in my mouth my
eyes feel hot enough to burn holes through
my eyelids and there aint no little bone
no muscle in me that aint achin with
weariness i look around at the steel blue
of the horizon with never a break in it and
i says to myself this is the end heres
where they sound taps over you old boy
i dont say this with my tongue for it
seems useless for all practical purposes
my mouth feels like coals o fire when
i try to stand up with the help o the
steerin oar my head spins around like a
dog vane in a change o wind its all i
can do to keep the boats nose headed west

  all night long the woman has been a-
settin on the bottom of the boat if shes
moved once i dont know when it was but
now she gets first to her knees and then
verv slow to her feet and looks around the
horizon presently she turns to me and
points dead ahead

  and then just when ive give up hope
i see it

  its a little black bump on the edge o
the horizon just a sort o hump on the sea
it dont look no biggern my fist from
where we are but i know its a ship o
some kind the sight o it steadies me
i gives a gulp and finds my voice

   yes maam i says croakin like a
frog its a ship

  and then just like a black blanket de-
spair comes down over me again for i see
the oarsmen lyin exhausted on the flat o
their backs and the mate all in lyin with
his face up to the sun his cracked lips
pulled back in a inhuman grin from his
teeth i realize too that weve dropped
off into the holler of a swell and that ive
been just dabblin with the steerin oar for
i dont know how long when i might as
well been savin my strength

   were done for i fells myself well
never make that ship see us caint get
close enough to it

  i guess what im thinkin must ha
showed on my face for the lady says very
low and kind o tender as if shes lots sor-
rier for me than she is for herself are
you near the end of it big man 

   not on yer life maam i says tryin
to grin you cant keep the workin man
down

  that seems to puzzle her a bit but at
last she smiles

   i know she says you mean you
will die fighting is it not so yes and
i i shall die singing

      

  she pulls herself up full and tall and
looks at the senor whos give up trailin
his hand in the water since both hands is
all blistered and raw from his rowin hes
lookin at her as if his eyes would burn
holes in her face but she just smiles gives
him a scornful little bow and says would
you like to hear me sing senor once more
before the end

  she dont wait for him to reply but
turns to me and you big man she
says you would like it eh

  she makes a little bow as if she was
standin on a stage throws her head back
and begins

  at first it was sort o husky that voice
o hers but soon it begins to fill out and
gets richer and richer and clearer and
clearer and goes soarin out over the water
like the sound o eight bells from the flag-
ship of a squadron

  i feel new life cornin into me i for-
get im thirsty hungry achin burnin
and go stumblin around rousin the fel-
lers in the bottom o the boat yellin at
em pullin at em kickin em i guess till

i get them to
the oars then
i points to the
bump on the
horizon which
dont look no
biggern it did
before and
tells em its a
ship

  the singer
while im doin
all this is silent but when im back at the
steerin sweep again she gives me a long
look and takes up her singin for a time
the men at the oars dont seem to know
what s goin on they just pulls along
without puttin any heart or muscle which
maybe they aint got left into it by and
by they seem to hear the senora and stop
rowin to listen

  instantly she stopped singin

   row she says in spanish row for
that ship if you do not row i shall not
sing and then to me make them row
big man

  i didnt have to make em they catch
at the next song she starts and begin keep-
in time with their oars this is a sweepy
sort o thing that seems to carry us along
rollin and swellin dippin and swingin

  and there we go scuddin across the
seas like a lot o crazy people with nothin
to make us go but this woman singin like
a mermaid right out o the sea

  and then her voice goes and cracks on
a high note she drops onto the thwart
her face in her hands and begins to cry

  i dont know what makes me look at
gonsales hes the last one id a thought
of by my own self but somethin pulls
me that way and i look and catch my
breath

  his wicked face is changed it aint
wicked no longer its all lit up from the
inside and washed clean of the nastiness
and meanness of it very slow he gets
up and steps over to her and stands there
with his hand restin on her bowed head
a moment like this and he begins to sing
-and it sounded like the ruffle o drums
when the admiral comes over the side

  say i didnt know whether i was
afloat or ashore and them fellers at the
oars they just pulled their bloomin guts
out

  me i gets an idea and yanks off whats

left o my shirt sticks it on the end o the
steerin oar and begins wavin at that ship
can you beat that me naked to the
waist them fellers tuggin and sweatin
with the last ounce o their dyin strength
and him standin there with his hand on his
wifes head and a singin like a church or-
gan-and off on the edge o the horizon

  a new sound cut in on the speaker a
phonograph record had been started just
bafik of him by the young gunners-
mate

  for an instant the weather-beaten face
of the old sailortnan showed disgust and
amazement at the interruption then
slowly his features quieted down and a
smile of recognition widened his mouth
and brought a twinkle into the gray blue
eyes beneath the shaggy white brows

  thats her he exclaimed aint she

first covered wagon train

the first emigrant train to cross the plains to california left sapling grove kansas in
may  an old french trapper had spread a story of the wonders of the pacific coast
and with james bidwell later general bid well of the united states army succeeded in per-
suading a number of families to make the journey

    the missourians of thaparty were skeptical at first fearing that fever and ague abounded
on being questioned as to this the trapper replied that there was but one man in all california
who had ever had a chill which was a matter of such wonderment to the people of monterey
that they went  miles into the country to see him shake

    when all was ready the wagons rendezvoused at sapling grove and although several
families became disheartened at the last moment sixty-nine persons began the long tedious
journey to the pacific the party was led by a man from jackson county missouri who
although not the best choice for the position would have deserted with his eight men had he
not been put in charge seriously weakening the defensive force

    the route lay from near westport now kansas city northwestward to salt lake city
then southwest across the nevada deserts cyclones indian scares and other troubles
were prominent features of the journey but the pioneers pushed on accompanied by a mis-
sionary party which had joined them after leaving sapling grove half of the families de-
cided that the trackless wilderness was too much for them when they neared fort hall on
the snake river and they followed the missionary party into oregon the remainder
thrown on their own resources without trail or guide but none the less undaunted deter-
mined to reach california or bust

    they reached salt lake city in september the settlement being known even then by that
name here the wagons furniture and everything possible was abandoned and packs
made on the oxen to add to their misfortunes game became scarce necessitating the kill-
ing of the oxen

    fully incompetent for leadership the jackson county man bartleson deserted the party
several times with his men but returned when hungry food was so scarce that crows and
even wildcats were shot to keep the people from starving but when the san joaquin valley
was reached they found wild grapes and herds of antelope in abundance doctor marshs
ranch was reached on november   where the partywas agreeably surprised to learn
that they were at last in california-j r j


blue overalls-

            by clement wood

 that was the sum-one dollar and seventy-five cents-

 and in railroad circles along the colorado-kansas state
 line they still talk of the way it was collected

it did not begin with the pair of blue
overalls that nat beale purchased at
the new canterbury emporium it
did not even begin when old man
stidhams piebald calf strayed on the
central pacific tracks just before the
sunset flyer was due the armed dead-
lock between every self-respecting man in
wallace county kansas and every thug
and hireling of the railroad-the pro-
fanity has been edited out-commenced
when the c p secured from a spineless
legislature the right of way for a curve a
hundred yards long inside the kansas
county over the protest of every decent
citizen the tension reached breaking-
point when the railroad placed its station
at sinai colorado a quarter of a mile
across the line ignoring that pride of kan-
sas the thriving village of new canter-
bury

  the railroad was welcomed with closed
fists and hair-trigger guns the cattlemen
saw in the roaring trains a potential mur-
derer of cows calves and profits the
farmers swore that their stock was not
safe and that the fall of cinders damaged
crops and threatened during every dry
spell a general conflagration the wiliest
jo	

 arguments concerning improved transpor-
 tation met only black disbelief

   pat boggan gaunt blue-eyed foreman
 of the great bar x ranch phrased the gen-
 eral feeling from his splint-bottomed
 throne in lem hodgkins new canter-
 bury emporium bad enough to have
 thim murderin spalpeens killin cattle an
 settin woods an cornrows on fire but-
 and his blue eyes flashed ominously -to
 have thim locate their blankety-blank sta-

 even a store-a cross-fields dump with
 only four run-down shacks outside of the
 depot an that mangy little railroad ware-
 house-in colorado too-an with new
 canterbury gleamin like another dublin
 half a mile away-thim railroad folks is

wards his hip and the small man leaped
sideways rabbit-fashion almost colliding
with two men who had suddenly turned

rabid call-down for bis carelessness the
two men shouldered into the store without
ceremony

five intent faces bent over the em-
poriums counter at eight oclock
on the evening of the next tues-
day all day the nearer farmers and
hands had strolled in and the further
ranchers and cowmen had loped by not
a one entered without a whispered word
from stidham or his helpers some had
seen the light some had not it was up
to the chairman of elections to do his best
the acrid smell of kerosene came from
the three glass lamps lem hodgkins wet
his purple pencil on his lips and added up

upon the crowd pat boggan is elected

  the candidate wore a puzzled look no
votes a-tall for andy

cided head

  old man stidham sitting on the cracker
box where all votes not for boggan had
been deposited chuckled slightly not a

short stories

  an your guns gentlemen the law
must be obeyed

  the buggy held the stout storekeeper
beside mr stidham boggan his assistant
foreman and mat stidhams helper
mounted their horses and trotted off after
the buggy through the chilly kansas night
down the hill to the curved hundred yards
of railroad track  kansas soil then
along the road that climbed beside the
state line to the turnpike and down this
to the second farm on the upland

  they turned in at the gate a wild
clamor of dogs suddenly woke

  a man lamp in hand appeared in the
doorway whos thar

  its me andy peck lem hodgkins
me an a party call off them dogs
come on in they wouldnt hurt a
horned toad andy peck led the way to
the dining-room table and set down the
lamp on the one spot clear of papers he
rubbed his judicial hands importantly to-
gether i wuz just studyin out a case i
got to decide tomorrow he explained
with shy pride

  well save you the trouble said hodg-
kins briefly at the election today duly
called an held mr patrick boggan was
elected justice of the peace  votes to
one for you andy you just hand over
them papers peaceable an we wont say
nothin more about it

  the room grew suddenly tense peck
pushed his chair back from the table with
a harsh grating sound and half rose he
could feel the pressure of his pistol against
the back of the chair and shifted his body
a trifle to free it dont talk foolishness
lem hodgkins that warnt no election
his eyes rolled from one to another of the
group and sank before the steely deter-
mination there his brain worked rapidly
id like to know why not

  a laugh that sounded easy for about
a hundred reasons i wuz the only man

nominated-

  they wrote in
pats name

  he aint been
a legal citizen of
the state long
enough

  hes to pass
on that hes
judge aint he
no he aint
anyhow peck rose and assumed a non-
chalant pose beside the door opening into
the darkness of the house his eye meas-
ured the distance to the lamp pity it was

on the far side of the table anyhow
my own term dont expire for four months
yet good night gentlemen aimlessly
his hand swung against his side

  no you dontbarked out from mat
he pulled his own gun half out of its hol-
ster were five to one andy better
be reasonable

  a bitter gleam flashed across the face of

the cornered farmer ill see you-

  stiddy stiddy pat boggan rose
heavily to his feet his hand roved in a
wide gesture of command he moistened
his lips slowly and launched out upon his
first public address andy when in the
course of human events it becomes neces-
sary fer a man to git he ought to git with
as little trouble as possible

  hear hear

  it is now time for you to git the
tongue did duty again against the dry lips
i want to be justice an almost all of the
qualified voters-all exceptin one of the
votes counted-want me to be justice i
command you in the name of the con-
stitootion of the state of kansas and of
the newnited states of america to git
otherwise you will compel me as justice
to hold you for contempt of court inter-
ferin with an officer in the discharge of
his bounden duty an general cussedness

  you cant make me-

  stiddy stiddy the foremans pale
blue eyes pierced compellingly out of his
gaunt face furthermore andy please
notice that lem hodgkins is on our com-
mittee ive had a little talk with him
about the mortgage on this farm that he
holds if you dont vamoose pronto its
by-by farm get it

  peck squared his shoulders against the

door jamb you cant threaten-

  i aint were peaceable men andy
but theres five of us an each of us is got
two guns do you resign peaceable
for a moment the visitors feared re-
gretfully that there would be peace then
it happened all at once peck had hurled
himself on his knees into the dark hall
there was the gleam as his gun seemed to
leap from the holster

  but mat was quicker he threw him-
self beside the other man and clipped
down with all his might against the gun
arm no you dont he snarled

  shaken and unnerved peck was jerked
back to his feet and into the light the
four men faced him their hands negli-
gently ready on their hips

  do you resign peaceable pat re-
peated meekly

                                                  
blue overalls-



  andy was a reasonable man he was
persuaded relieved of his gun he bun-
dled up the papers and delivered them to
the new justice thereby installing him in
his post

  you can get your gun at my place in
the morning hodgkins called back as
they passed out of the gate better be
good andy without a chuckle the cav-
alcade commenced its brisk trot back to-
ward the new canterbury emporium

shortly after sun-up the new
justice of the peace and his efficient
election chairman set out on the
short jog over to sinai station the road
led down to the curve of the railroad
within walace county turned and crossed
the state line the storekeeper drew rein
and surveyed the sister commonwealth be-
fore him disgustedly bum lookin place
colorado aint it pat

  boggan inspected the land in front and
turned back for a view of the landscape
absolutely similar that they had just left
reglar hole colorado is lem

  yeah kansas fer mine

  they continued a quarter of a mile
along a rocky gulch at whose level head
the station had been placed

      

  got your gun hodgkins whispered
to boggan as they topped the last rise
with tbe station just before them

  have i got my face asked pat dis-
gustedly but remember we wont need
em this is to be peaceable lem im
an officer of the law now an im goin to
preserve law an order come what dares

  yonders copeland now whispered
the storekeeper excitedly thought wed
jump him

  as they drew up at the platform the
agent nodded absentniindedly and hurried

inside the
two men left
their horses
and walked
briskly in

  mornin
the railroad of-
ficial looked at
them over his
glasses in some bewilderment you want
a ticket to somewheres

  we dont pat winked at his asso-
ciate significantly

  the agent stared at them want any-
thing 

  we do the new justice scowled
truculently

  well spit it out copeland slammed a
drawer open glanced within and drove
it shut again he had found this mysteri-
ously effective why-whats this

  he picked up the paper with a puzzled
stare as swelling with importance bog-
gan pushed it through the grating to him

  its a garnisheement he explained
proudly cant you read

  slowly copeland spelled aloud the awk-
ward lettering lemuel hodgkins doing
bussiness as the new canterbury em-
porium plaintiff v nat beale deaft
the cent pac railroad garnish 
he sniffed contemptuously and tossed it
back just put it in your pocket pat and
trot along im busy

  this is a-

  its a joke i reckon copeland
yawned im too busy to joke this morn-
ing i got work to do come back some
other time

  the veins on the judges neck bulged
out his eyes glittered you goin to pay
that money

  soon as somebody leaves me a million
trot along pat

  look here dick copeland you aint
talkin to me-youre talkin to my joo-
dicial office youre talkin to the judge


short stories

  havent got time to talk to nobody
copeland turned his back a moment to
bring forward a bulky report book

  hodgkins gave boggan a nudge and
pointed significantly the agent warned
by some unnumbered sense looked up and
into the chilly end of a big six-shooter

  put that up you big- he stam-
mered slightly

  stiddy stiddy youre talkin to the
law you are are you goin to pay that
dollar sixty-five

  seventy-five pat whispered the solic-
itous plaintiff

  seventy-five i says an costs will
you take it out of nat ceales salary
copelands mouth became a straight line
this was not in the contract but he would
have to see it through dont be an idiot
boggan put up that gun there arent
any more bad men in colorado of course
im not going to pay it

  aint hey

  good lord no beat it-ive got to
work

  this was a complication justice was
plainly being flouted there seemed no way
to pierce the nonchalance of the station
agent boggan kept at him doggedly
why

  oh for nine milion reasons but ones
enough you kansas jack-rabbit cope-
land laughed frankly now boggan had
laid his gun aside and relief spoke in the
agents voice this is colorado you
tanktown constable-and not kansas if
you had the brains of a dead nanny-goat
youd a known that yourself and not come
pesterin around with your dinky little
writs your authority stops with the
state of kansas dont you know that
you sawed-off runt

  boggan held in his freshet wrath with
difficulty lem face puzzled turned to-
ward his friend that sounds reason-
able pat is that the law

  judge boggan forgot his ignorance and
replied meditatively well that depends
 the construction i put on it

  the agent laughed immoderately con-
struction your aunts red-nosed grand-
mother what do you think you are-
the soopreme court of the league of na-
tions every bit of law in the world be-
gins with the proposition that a judge has
joorisdiction so far and no further-and
youre a darned sight further its up to
you to backtrack pats blank face in-
spired him to push home the point why
man the english common law the con-
stitootion of the united states and every

state in the union and every decision of
every court in the world has decided that
youll have to reverse all that before your
dinky little writ would amount to anything
dyou realize that

  boggans pale blue eyes looked musingly
at the representative of the railroad i
might do just that dick

  the latter exploded you make me
snicker do it please and listen to me
you poor little cinder the central pacific
hasnt time to bother with fly-specks like
you no matter what the law is the cen-
tral pacifics big enough law for this place
get that

  boggans eye fixed him coldly so
your policy mr station agent is that the
railroad will let its men live in kansas and
trade in kansas and run up bills there
and dodge payment and the railroad wont
lift a hand to assist in getting lawful an
just debts paid an settled

  not a paw sneered copeland he
was not so much at ease now his tongue
had carried him a station beyond his in-
tention

  and the central pacific wont pay any
attention to me and my writs no matter
how legal they are boggans voice was
as smooth as cornsilk and as unemotional

  not a bit put that in your mouth and
chew it

  this aint the finish with solemn
dignity the judge turned and may god
help you an the central pacific when i
get after you he walked out hodg-
kins face uncomprehending close beside
him

  without a word boggan mounted his
horse and set its head toward the dusty
haze beyond which lay kansas without
a word hodgkins trotted after him he
realized now that somehow the leadership
had passed out of his hands some mighty
thought was shaping in that furrowed brow
beside and a trifle ahead of him that was
certain there was a dangerous hard glint
in the eyes that spelled trouble in capitals
for somebody hodgkins thought to him-
self that if a man with those eyes started
after him it would be an excellent time
to take to his cyclone-cellar

  well judge- he commenced awk-
wardly

  boggan for the first time beamed
dont ask me no questions lem you do
as i say you be at the railroad at the
kansas curve at seven oclock tonight
have a couple of men along lemme see
the local passes at  doesnt she
an the sunset flyer at eight

down to stretch his legs

explained he felt more reassured after

  ten-fifteen-twenty minutes passed

pear fretfully he studied the hill road
behind down which judge pat should long
ago have put in his appearance

  i dont know whats happened to him

  five-seven minutes more

  thars her smoke one of the men
pointed excitedly

  a despairing survey of the hill road

hazy in the dusk why there-

  an-an there he comes
lickety-split down the slope pat gal-
loped as he came nearer they saw the un-
lit lantern dangling from his arm he
flung himself over the saddle face pant-
ing pile them logs on the track pronto

red lantern hurry

  he knelt in the dust of the road trying
to light it the others watched him open-
mouthed hurry the judge com-
manded

  the first match went out on him he
heard the first log fall into place he heard
the whistle of the approaching train at
the grade crossing a third of a mile away
the second match sputtered feebly des-


perately he pushed it down through the
air the flame leading it showed brief
blue vitality then grew golden a trem-
bling hand slid it along the wick there
lighted at last

  pile that second one on there

  agilely pat jumped up one foot on each
log and started waving the red signal up
and down

  the sky to the west was lit in a moment
with a red glare of welcome the rails
trembled in eagerness to hold the vast
monster as round the far curve it swung
into sight

  hi pat screamed hodgkins itll
hit you

  ill crow-hop shouted the judge
stand back

  it did not seem humanly possible that the
train could come to a standstill in so short
a distance boggan just as he imagined
he felt the fiery breath of the iron mon-
ster envelop him flung himself toward the
road his legs working like agitated pistons
every moment he expected to hear the
crash as the train hit the logs and to feel
them hurtling through the air after him
a screeching of brakes a grinding of
wheels and the train came to a standstill
less than fifteen feet from the obstruction

  without delay fireman engineer con-

ductor several guards came running up

  what in the devil does this mean
shouted the engineer

  out of his breast pocket judge patrick
boggan drew with great dignity a sheet
of legal-cap and read in a loud voice
this engine the property of the central
pacific railroad is hereby and heretofore
attached to be held on to in satisfaction
of a debt of  owed by nat beale to
lemuel hodgkins doing business as the
new canterbury emporium

  engineer fireman guards conductor
stormed and raged the air grew dusky
with profanity boggan would not be
moved

  they withdrew for an excited confer-
ence the conductor swaggered brusquely
over to him this is a mail train youre
interfering with the united states mail


short stories

thats a penitentiary offense were go-
ing through those logs ill report this to
the government

  pat blanched a trifle his hand inched
back toward his gun

  the conductor read the motion his
face paled and stiffened abruptly he
turned his back if it had to come-
a penitentiary offense he grunted go
ahead tom give her all youve got
pats fingers clenched the automatic
impotently with the whole government
against him- the engine rumbled quiv-
ered backed a score of yards then
while the judge plaintiff and the two
helpers gazed helplessly at the thing it
gathered sudden momentum and threw the
two v-placed logs aside as gently as if
they had been wisps of stubble two tri-
umphant toots and it disappeared in the
distance

  can you beat that groaned hodgkins
you bet i can boggan muttered
through set teeth tell me lem-is the
sunset flyer a mail train

  i dont think so

  it dont make no difference pile on
all them logs men this time we got em

vi

they did a better job this time fix-
ing the apex of the v toward the
direction from which the transcon-
tinental express would come all seven
logs were placed on the pile an engine
would split itself against such an obstacle

  the storekeeper made an important find
-an unlocked box of way tools left a few
rods down the track at boggans direc-
tion the men brought out crowbars and
sledges maybe we can get the first rail

loose-

  there she comes

  again the judge mounted the logs and
wigwagged the red warning

  the mighty train warned by the signals
that the local had just left the block was
running easily she stopped two score feet
away again the officials came on the run

  pat read his notice again but this time
he included the tracks the first car and
the right of way

  before he could finish a fussy person-
age elbowed his way through the uni-
formed officials whats this whats
this what are we stopping here for

  in a moment he had half a dozen ex-
planations

  oh stop stop this is outrageous
im mr lessing vice-president of the

road i never heard of such a thing

  if your depot agents are sassy as dick
copeland youll hear of it again said
pat grimly

  there he comes now cried hodgkins
excitedly

  sure enough around the bend in the
road the agent was approaching on horse-
back

  he flung himself off his saddle glaring
wildly through his glasses that man is
crazy he gasped

  the law is never crazy corrected the
dignified justice

  the vice-president sized up the situa-
tion said he wouldnt pay any attention
to your writs did he  i think youre
legally within your rights my man ill

pay the bill out of my own pocket-

  not this day pat boggans jaws
closed like a wolf trap the railroad had
its chanct i wuz informed youd pay no
attention to the law i hold this engine

car right of way tracks-

  the worried general official offered to
give bond to cover the garnishment or pay
any amount boggan would name his
blue eyes snapping the homespun judge
remained inflexible sinai station may
not be within my joorisdiction but this
curve is am  right mr four-eyes
here i am and here i stay

  take your engine then the conductor

sneered coldly this is a mail train-

  your first car isnt carryin mail
  its owned by the pullman company

  they dont own the tracks an the
right of way

  ah fishhooks ill get a switch engine
and butt the train into the next station
you put the engine in your pocket if you

want to-

  for one second the judge was stumped
he had a mental picture of the poor engine
and its car being butted ignominiously out
of kansas into lowly colorado carrying
with it his own defeat should he submit
to this his hesitation ended before the
second ticked his blue eyes were like
levelled guns then ill tear up your
tracks an pile em in my back yard ill
put an armed posse on this right of way
that will tie up traffic till my case is fin-
ished if it takes till-till colorado freezes
over

  well what could they do there was
nothing left but to submit as gracelessly
as possible to the law as embodied in the
gaunt man with the piercing blue eyes and
the scrawny moustache

                                                      
blue overalls-

io

    have a heart judge the vice-presi-
 dent pleaded well switch this en-
 gine back to the siding a quarter o a mile
 away and let you have it if youll release
 the tradks and the right of way and what-
 ever else youre after

   boggans face beamed what had been
 hidden in his mind slowly emerged you

 give me that
 switch engine
 at sinai as se-
 curity and ill
 let you go
 right through
 -if youll do
 two things
 his eyes grew
 bright at the
 realization o f
 his power to
  aid the community you know we wanted
 a station hers at new canterbury instead

 of that dump of a sinai-

    im familiar with that hurriedly the
 general officer spoke

    give us that station then dismguitle
 your place at sinai-thats first second
 youll agree to pay attention to any an all
 court papers from my court he drew
 himself up cockily

    the local men gasped in admiration the

vice-president studied him shrewdly

  mr judge youre a reasonable man i
cant guarantee the station for you but
weve been discussing the change and ill
pledge you my word that i  do my utmost
to get it for you and i can assure you
that your writs will receive as much atten-
tion as a mandamus from the united
states supreme court as long as youre

	the bench will that suit

  judge boggan drew a long breath ill
take your switch engine and your word
sir go ahead

  the switch engine was hurriedly backed
down onto the siding the sunset flyer re-
sumed her journey two and a half hours
late at the termination of the suit o
hodgkins etc vs beale three weeks later
the railroad paid judgment promptly the
check was handed to the judge by dick
copelands successor at sinai

  ill be moving over to kansas next
month he said affably while pat finished
the crude receipt soon as we get a root
on the temporary station you must a had
some pull with general offices to get the
change

  not me the jurist evaded modestly
that vice-presidents got something over
his shoulders beside a roof he respects
the law

the famous sharps rifle

one of the most famous rifles of the old west was the sharps this rifle invented about
 was one of the first successful breech loaders produced in fact in  it was the
only reliable-weapon of its kind manufactured in the united states the sharps was equipped
with a vertically sliding breech block and used at first a conical bullet in a paper or linen
cartridge which was fired by a percussion cap or a flat percussion plate held in the priming
lock loading was accomplished by dropping down the breech block and inserting the
paper cartridge in the rear of the barrel when the block was pulled up by means of a lever
forming the trigger guard the end of the cartridge was sheared off exposing the powder to
the flash hole in the block a percussion cap was then placed in the nipple leading to the
flash hole and the gun was ready to fire the paper cartridge was quickly replaced by one of
brass greatly improving the firearm

    the sharps was issued to a few british regiments in  and shortly after the start of
the civil war its issue in carbine form was begun to united states cavalry

    when the henry repeating rifle appeared most of the other rifles were driven off the
market but the sharps single-shot retained its popularity for many years this was due
largely to its powerful cartridge which was splendid for large game and long ranges it was
the sharps that killed off the buffalo so popular was it with hunters of that animal that
a special model was produced known commonly as the buffalo gun this was supplied
with a heavy octagon barrel usually of  or  calibre using the paper cartridge with
the invention of the brass cartridge the gun was changed to the hammerless type the shell
containing as much as  grains of black powder and a bullet weighing  grains the
popularity of the arm is accounted for in a comparison of its cartridge with that of the best
of other rifles the henry which used a shell containing only  grains of powder and 
grains of lead-j r j

after reading the ghost of the
golconda which begins in this is-
sue which by the way will be published
as a cloth-bound book by doubleday page

	company shortly after its completion in
short stories we started wondering just
how much truth there could be in the wide-
spread belief that the congressional record
is a dry-as-dust old tome at least were
willing to wager that william n vailes
contributions to that worthy publication
are pithy interesting and to the point
concerning himself and this his first nov-
el vaile writes

  born in the centennial year at kokomo
indiana my father and grandfather
were lawyers grandfather also ran an
abolition newspaper in indiana before the
war conducted a station of the under-
ground railway and got tarred and feath-
ered once or twice for his in those days
exceedingly radical anti-slavery views as
a child i used to be filled with horrible yet
humorous fascination when i visualized
that stiff and solemnly dignified man en-
during such a cruel but grotesque torture

  your present autobiographer graduated
from yale university in  i served
as a private in the spanish war but the
spaniards have no cause of complaint
against me as i never got out of the u s
afterward studied law at harvard and at
the university of colorado and practised
law until my first election to congress in
 i was a candidate two years before
that but was licked of course the only
reason for that-aside from the popularity
and ability of my opponent-was that i
was absent from my district during the
campaign being an officer of the colorado
national guard on duty at the mexican
border the duty consisted mainly of
chasing mexican children away from the

city dump of douglas arizona

  since that time the folks at home have
been very good to me and have just re-
elected me for a fourth term

  i have lived since early childhood in
denver except for several years on a farm
near there my regular political opponent
used to say that farmers called me a law-
yer that lawyers called me a farmer and
that i could prove an alibi on either count
so far nobody has accused me of being a
writer but if the editor should make that
allegation i would plead nolo contendere

  i suppose you want to know what i
have been doing in congress my con-
stituents often ask me the same thing my
work has been chiefly on legislation relat-
ing to immigration naturalization public
lands and war veterans i was one of the
draftsmen of the immigration restriction
acts of  and  the  per cent
and  per cent laws being one of the
conferees responsible-for good or ill-for
the final language of those two measures
i have to my credit a little bill now enacted
into law extending the provisions of the
federal employes compensation act at
present i am serving on a joint committee
to work out an adjustment of the old
northern pacific land grants

  i have not traveled much except in the
united states but have made two trips to
canada before prohibition and three to
the west indies and central america

  i tried to write a little twenty years ago
but with no success tackled it again
three years ago of course you will un-
derstand that i dont want all my words
buried forever in the congressional rec-
ord havent had much time to write of
course i may have more after next elec-
tion but have accumulated enough rejec-
tion slips to paper the wall of my office
and havent wasted much money in return
postage that wasnt used still i have

managed to get by the guillotine with a few
short stories the ghost of the golcon-
da is my first offense as a novel but i do
not want to commit myself to abstinence in
the future

   in it i have tried to take a sympathetic
glance backward at the old feverish mining
camps which were passing away when i
was a youngster and to give also something
of the flavor of those camps as they exist
today there is  didactic purpose but
i have allowed myself to express here and
there the voice of the sound americanism
which was inherent in the old period but
which speaks just as vigorously in the new

the red gods smile

his name was obrien and he was
about as tattered and unshorn a
tramp as one could find-unlovely to the
extreme until one saw the smile wrinkles
about his blue-green eyes he had stowed
away upon a nitrate freighter and had
been kicked ashore dead broke at anto-
fagasta

benefactor who had yielded the price of a
meal and lodging

  oh-out there-anywhere vaguely

horizons underlay the laughter though

if eric howard who on the occasion of
his first short stories offering writes
in a similar vein of himself runs across
obrien in peru or macao or beyond
ballarat may there be a handclasp and an
understanding

  i was born with the wanderlust and it
has been pronounced incurable during
the last ten or fifteen years ive wandered
back and forth up and down across the
country seeing with commendable thor-

than a morris gest production ive
lived in indian pueblos and have made
friends with these survivors of a great

me turquoise and pottery in return

  from here  shall go into the navajo

through reasons having to do
solely with the inclusion of one par-

when that

corn is gone

a corn isnt just a pain-its a
drain a tax on the whole nervous
system a blight not alone on the
toe but on the spirits and the dis-
position    doctors know that a
com can darken a mans whole view-
point on life headache fatigue ir-
ritability and indigestion are often
reflexes of a throbbing corn   
pain-messages shoot to every
nerve center when a com starts

broadcasting  if you would know
blissful relief apply blue-jay to
that burning corn in ten seconds
the world will seem a better place to
live in  a tiny cushion-cool
as velvet-fits over the com and
stops the pain at once you wear it
two days in solid comfort when
you take it off the corn comes with
it-gently removed by the little
brown disc of magic medication
