flects any celestial body whose altitude
is to be determined this gives so nearly
level a reflecting surface and so nearly
a plane that the latitude can be deter-
mined within a few hundred feet by its
use the surface of the ocean is very
nearly spherical the disturbances due
to tides are infinitesimal when re-
ferred to the diameter of the earth the
disturbances due to the true tidal wave
which is carried around the world by
the combined effect of the attractions
of the sun and of the moon is modified
by the irregular conformation of the

shore lines of the land so that tides are
higher and lower in some places than in
others

  the atmosphere includes several lay-
ers distinctive and varying in thickness
through relatively large amounts while
we speak of the depth of the ocean in
numbers of feet or of fathoms when we
come to the atmosphere we speak of it
in terms of miles the layers of the per-
fectly elastic highly mobile air can be
defined and designated with the provi-
sion that they vary greatly in relative
depth from time to time the atmos-
phere in which we live is an ocean of air
varying in height for we measure it up-
wards from six to ten miles the ocean
of water we measure in depth or down-
wards this layer of the atmosphere has
been named the troposphere

  it is the layer of the atmosphere
termed the troposphere whose meteor-
ology affects the drama of our lives


amazing stories

storms and temperature-changes the
seasons and clouds and sunshine are a
part of our life experiences and the
general history of the troposphere is one
of constant change and there is one
point of similarity between our tropos-
phere taking it as the ocean of air and
the ocean of water-they are rather
closely related in their depths the ocean
proper at its deeper portions is about six
miles in depth-the troposphere varies
from six miles to ten and a half miles in
height and in this range occur the
meteorological changes that affect our
lives its greatest height is at the
equator and the least height is in the
far north and south latitudes

  above the troposphere a dividing
layer is assumed called the tropopause
where the change is made from the trop-
osphere to another layer of air which is
the stratosphere and which has figured
conspicuously in the daily news items of
recent years the stratosphere varies in
temperature being coldest where it is
farthest from the earth which place is
the equatorial region it is coldest above
the warmest part of the earth

  the stratosphere has no clouds no
rain and intense cold the lowest re-
corded temperature is - f it may
be said to have no change in temperature
except as related to the troposphere
it appears perfectly obvious that the
temperature as we rise into the stratos-
phere should constantly fall following
the rule of temperature changes en-
countered in ascending mountains yet
for some unexplained reason this does
not occur in the stratosphere the tem-
perature changes in general accordance
with its distance from the earth but the
almost regular reduction in temperature
with increased height does not hold above
the tropopause we have never gone
very far into the stratosphere but the
records of balloon ascents lead to this
conclusion the changes in temperature

in the upper layers of the stratosphere
arc still a matter of conjecture we do
not know when the problem will be
solved if it ever will be the water sup-
plies the fishes oxygen we live by the
oxygen of the troposphere

  it has long been known that the tem-
perature of the air falls athigher eleva-
tions this it does with some degree of
regularity the higher a balloon ascends
the higher we ascend a mountain the
lower the thermometer reading will be
but this law obtains only for the tropos-
phere when the limiting or separating
layer called the tropopause is passed the
decrease in the readings of the ther-
mometer the regular fall of tempera-
ture encountered in the troposphere
ceases and a layer filled with rarefied air
is reached beginning at a height of five
to ten miles from the surface of the
earth where the temperature of highly
rarefied air is approximately uniform or
at least has no change due to elevation
and is unaffected by distance from the
earths surface the stratosphere ex-
tends from the tropopause to a height of
about thirty miles above the earth

  the fact that height from the earths
surface does not effect any graduated
regular change in the temperature of the
stratosphere must not be taken as mean-
ing that it possesses a uniform tempera-
ture in its distance from the earths sur-
face in all its parts the tropopause
varies and where it is nearest to the earth
the temperature of the stratosphere over-
lying it is the highest the temperature
of - f for the troposphere has been
registered in the antarctic at ground
level over in batavia in the dutch east
indies in the tropics a temperature of
- f at a height of ten miles in the
stratosphere has been recorded

  on the earth the troposphere is so
irregular in its attributes that we never
know what the next hour may bring we
are quite uncertain about the future
troposphere tropopause and stratosphere 

weather but in the stratosphere these
uncertainties hardly exist or do so in
very small degree there are no storms
no rains no clouds it has been ex-
plored by one balloon to a height of
about  miles by standard methods
several balloons with human observers
have gone nearly thus far into its mys-
terious depths the difficulties involved
are very great-the car containing the
observers has to be hermetically sealed
and several lives have been lost in these
ascensions

  but untenanted balloons with self-reg-
istering instruments have been sent
adrift and it is reported that in one case
a height has been registered of 
miles these balloons are called sound-
ing balloons and the average of 
miles is assigned them for the heights
attained the  trtile record we are
at liberty to doubt

  sounding balloons are liberated with
their equipment of extremely light reg-
istering instruments and with a writ-
ten request for their return by any-
one who should find them these regis-
trations were for various phenomena
and varied greatly in their reliability
some were quite accurate but as already
noted elevations determined by baro-
metric readings are not very reliable the
instruments which the little balloons
carry are suspended at the end of a
thread about a hundred feet in length so
as not to be affected in any way by the
balloon

  a comparatively recent system of con-
struction for sounding balloons is to
use two balloons one small one inside the
other larger one it was determined at
what rarefaction of air the larger one
would burst when this occurs the
smaller interior balloon acts as a par-
achute and descends gently to the earth
with its load of tiny instruments this
method is due to regener of stuttgart
and the ascent of  miles is credited
to one of his balloons

  the history of balloon ascensions is one
of flotation but it is interesting to note
that the highest elevation ever reached
by mans instrumentality was attained
by a steel projectile the celebrated
german guns that bombed the city of
paris from a distance of some seventy
miles did it by giving a very high angle
of projection to the gun the shell in
a few seconds penetrated the troposphere
and went on through the almost airless
regions of the stratosphere and above
it so that by far the greater portion of
the course was made through an approx-
imate vacuum

  the curve followed by a projectile
near the earth the ballistic curve by
name is unsymmetrical due to the
presence of the air whose resistance dis-
torts it if there were no air the curve
would be a parabola but the shells of
the guns bombarding paris did so much
of their journey in an approximate
vacuum that they approached the par-
abola in the course they followed it
has been calculated that they attained a
height of thirty-four miles or nearly
one two hundred and fortieth of the di-
ameter of the earth on the eight inch
globe we referred to last month this
would be about the thirtieth of an inch

  an interesting coincidence as it may
be termed in the troposphere is to be
found in the height of mount everest
this is probably the highest mountain on
earth and its summit has an elevation
almost equal to the minimum depth of
the troposphere and man has never
been able to climb to the summit of this
giant of the himalayas

  the many changes that occur in the
stratosphere its perpetual unrest have
done much for mankind much good and
a little evil for long years the winds
have driven machinery and ships for
him but at last have been given their
holiday from mechanical uses sailing
vessels whose driving power was the
wind are rapidly disappearing from ocean

and lake windmills are nearly extinct
except small ones for country houses so
the wind except as a possible source of
destruction in tornadoes and cyclones
ceases to directly interest us although
it is still working for our benefit in de-
veloping the beneficial weather changes
especially rain this phenomenon of the
troposphere is in a sense the greatest
triumph of nature over man for while
heat motors and electric motors have
displaced much of the possibilities of
using the wind man has not yet suc-
ceeded and has naturally not even tried
to distill pure water from the salt water
of the ocean and to distribute the dis-
tillate on mountain tops to produce cat-
aracts and on many vast regions to sup-
ply rivers and to keep lakes from evap-
orating to dryness and to give life to
vegetation the cataracts in the moun-
tains of switzerland drive machinery and
in doing so utilize the energy of the sun

  man has striven for years to pro-
duce a solar engine but every water tur-
bine large or small is driven by the solar
heat and by the disturbances of the air
by the winds of the troposphere with-
out the heat of the sun the water
charged with salt would stay in the
ocean even when the sun draws it up
the operation is incomplete for here the
wind comes into play and blows the
humid air over the land area where it
does its work by forming rain for man-
kind wind water and the heat of the
sun working in a sort of unison are
what make the earth habitable we could
not exist on the earth without these
three factors interlocking in their actions
and how few of us realize that the
wind strong or gentle does the all im-
portant action of distributing the water
distilled from the ocean over the land
the very glaciers of the earth the great
rivers of ice are maintained by the
wind the iceberg is a product of wind
sun and ocean and when it breaks off

from the edge of a glacier and floats off
to melt in the ocean it is only going
back to its parent source

  our arithmetically disposed readers can
calculate how much of the heat of the
the sun is used by the earth it is an
infinitesimal proportion of the total heat
of the great luminary yet if we did not
receive our infinitesimal proportion of
the suns radiations we would perish on
an earth sinking into desolation and
this shows how active is the troposphere
in taking care of the earth

  but go above the tropopause and a
region is reached rainless and bitterly
cold a place of comparative rest which
humanity is striving to explore it is a
truly desert stratum of our atmosphere
there is an absence of clouds and it is
virtually of the one temperature

  the great peaks of the himalayas
everest kinchingunga and dapsang
would pierce the lower levels of the
stratosphere were they in another lat-
itude man in his passionate desire to
reach mountain summits has tried sev-
eral times to climb mount everest but
its summit about  feet elevation
has never been reached it has a record
of several deaths in the efforts to ascend
to its summit but in the latitude of the
himalayas the troposphere is far more
than  feet in depth at this height
few men can climb without an oxygen
supply so rarefied is the air the bal-
loon with an hermetically sealed car can
reach well into the stratosphere

  there is a thory that the stratosphere
is the ideal locale for air travel its
physical constitution its comparative
freedom from atmospheric disturbances
would favor the operation of dirigibles
the disadvantage of an hermetically
sealed car with artificial supply of oxygen
would seem to mitigate strongly against
the idea there would be a good oppor-
tunity to obtain the full benefit of rocket
propulsion in space so nearly vacuous

in this interesting story mr campbell pictures the future of what may
be termed interplanetary life and tells of how the inhabitants of earth
contrast with those of distant spheres there is no doubt that if mankind
ever did succeed in conquering space it is an open question whether what
he found there would increase the good opinion which so many of us often
unjustly hold of our own characters or whether it would diminish what
may be called the self-conceit of mankind

prologue

the crowded men a full hundred
and twelve cramped in a tiny con-
crete room were unbelievably
quiet and tense only one small light
thrown on the tuning controls of the
big set relieved the absolute darkness
that seemed to push in from the win-
dows mclaughlin at the controls was
quietest of all his ears were intensely
aware of the strange rushing roar like
heavy ocean surf that beat out through
the loudspeaker

  a voice struggled through the wash-
ing sound elevation about twenty-five
miles now incredibly jagged rock this
side much rougher than other found a
small crater-bottom-were aiming for
that-looks smooth again only the
washing roar of short-wave static and
the tense silence elevation twenty
miles dropping on rockets almost no
gravity pull however the big boy is
pulling us around a bit though hard
to handle tricky motion fifteen miles
weve got an horizon now there is no
axial rotation or we would never make
it ten miles silence washing static
five miles the voice reported

  weve almost stopped-comparative-
ly-now about a mile and a half to
go stopped and falling back can you
hear the rockets now theyre working
fairly loudly a thousand feet-eight
hundred-five hundred-well know in
a second and if its bad-we had a nice
time try again

  were floating on the rockets stev-
ens is doing a wonderful job of it
theres a big pinnacle of rock near us
this floor wasnt so smooth as it looked

were sinking--weve- the loud

speaker crackled with a tinny broken
rattle and then only the washing static
sounded in it

  a low heavy groan came from the
hundred and twelve men three near the
door darted out headed for their offices
the second attempt had failed

  mclaughlin sat just as quietly and
tensely as ever they smashed a tube
anyway he snapped softly that
doesnt mean theyre broken a tubes a
hell of a lot more tender than a man
the hundred and nine men were
rustling and weaving listening to the
static sounds whatever happened it
happened a long time ago-it takes time
even for radio on that hop someone


shes hot now watch  slowly he began turning a control dial on one

of his machines
the contest of the planets



said his voice was low but it seemed
a shout in the bare concrete room

  the loudspeaker crackled hummed
and silenced again to washing roar but
an instantaneous quiver ran through the
men sorry said the voice probably
worried you tube gave out we made a
perfect landing but the slight jar
cracked a tubes air-seal 

  the rest was lost as a roar went up
from the men in the room a jammed
stream squeezed out of the door like
toothpaste from a tube they squirted
out sprinted for the monorail line
near by over charred blackened earth
they stumbled and sprawled cheering

  five men remained in the room mc-
laughlin was talking into his own trans-
mitter now while the recorder took down
every detail of the message coming in
from space

  philip laurie the little narrow
chested dreamer who had designed the
ion  was dreaming out loud to big
broad-shouldered john cummings the
man who had had intelligence and in-
terest enough to listen to the man and
his strange ideas

  its done john said laurie dream-
ily theyve made it

  theyre not on mars yet only pho-
bos cummings replied

  no difference mars is easy now
the little rocket can do it and land
with her wings no trick they arent
back either thats harder but it
doesnt count to them it does of course
but i mean to earth earth has crossed
space earth-men have reached another
world thats just the first in twenty
years john you will be able to make
the trip in a regular commercial liner-
freighter new colonies earth-men col-
onizing other planets

  john thats always been my dream
i cant go-i wont you gave me con-
trol of this that was my one stipula-
tion the profits are yours-and there

will be profits i promise you-but-
he looked down at himself and then to
the towering powerful body of his
friend no more half-men like me
the conditions on those other planets
are hard and harder than men ever
faced before and im going to set up a
control board therell be plenty of men
willing to go look at the thousands on
thousands of applications we both got
for this trip but im going to combine
several of my dreams in this im go-
ing to make a greater race of earth-
men a more powerful finer more ad-
venturous race of earth-men i hate
this body of mine and its weakness i
want all men to have bodies and minds
like yours i will have reason enough
to forbid it-and im going to forbid
the acceptance of one single man or
woman who is not physically and men-
tally perfect

  earth is greater this day and hence-
forth she will grow as her children
grow said philip laurie

  it was inevitable his decision perhaps
made it a bit more radical and more
rapid but the result was as inevitable as
fate there were no barbarians to pour
in on civilization any more but philip
laurie had cut open earths veins where
flowed the richest life-blood of the
planet it was not a greater planet hed
created not a mightier earth

  and it was not merely his plan the
very forces that made life harder on
those planets would have done it as ef-
fectively earths greatness died that
day that hour it died the very second
robert gadv said sorry probably wor-
ried you we made a perfect landing

  but the corpse was very large and it
took many centuries for the corruption
to spread and the ultimate decay to de-
stroy it

amazing stories

of the inventor of the first ship to make
the crossing to mars was an humble em-
ployee in the office of the interplanetary
transport examination service bruce
laurie or tom jones got the same treat-
ment here old philip laurie back in
 had fashioned well when he fash-
ioned it and john cummings had been
willing to trust laurie the result had
been a board of scientists who had to
pass on every man who made that trip
and for four generations that office had
been all but flooded for only an intermit-
tent service was possible the air ships
of that day even a full century after
lauries invention were not free of all
troubles for instance while they had
been able to reach mars and the jovian
satellites and the satumian satellites no
ship had ever returned from jupiters
surface jupiters mighty gravity stopped
them

  there was much room on those jovian
worlds and even on mars although the
colonies were growing swiftly but
there were few ships and many people
trying to go interplanetary tranporta-
tion had their chance to pick and took
it

  bruce laurie was hopeful-but fear-
ful he was twenty-five just three weeks
past the necessary twenty-fifth birthday
in fact he stood five-feet five rather
light in build but already he had a rep-
utation in engineering

  the girl at the statistics desk looked
up at him as his turn came

  name in a moment she had his
vital statistics card dr thomas drew
will see you room four-fifty-seven
down the hall to the left laurie took
the card with its series of punched holes
on a perfectly blank white card the in-
dexing machines would read it for dr
drew laurie entered four-fifty-seven
handed the card to the brisk pleasant-
looking doctor and sat down the in-

dexing machine had interpreted it for
the physician in seconds

  this is your second visit is it not
laurie

  yes sir i came immediately after
my twenty-fifth birthday

  right the card contains not only
all the information you handed in but
of course much more that we gathered
plus the decision we reached and why
the decision was against you im sorry
to say youre a fine engineer as your
reputation already shows you have ex-
cellent heredity of mental characteris-
tics-but as you know your famous
great-grandfather died of tuberculosis
your grandfather didnt probably be-
cause wed conquered the disease by
then but he died at forty-seven of heart
disease your father died two years
ago at fifty-two of hardening of the
arteries and attendant physical degen-
eration

  im sorry laurie we need your
mentality in the new race were trying to
build up but your physique isnt de-
signed for hard wear even here on
earth irn not sure you would survive
even the space trip the effects are very
severe due to lack of equalization of
blood pressure in the absence of gravita-
tional or other acceleration if you did
survive-your great-grandfather who of
all men had a right to emigrate to mars
refused to go you remember when his
application automatically came up he
turned it down himself and he alone
voted against it

  he was right there is some taint
of weakness in your inheritance that has
time after time robbed the world of
powerful minds in their prime what i
have mentioned in connection with your
direct descent is equally true of your
uncles and grand-uncles

  but-go on laurie your type is
needed here on earth too that weakness
will be driven out through the genera-
the contest of the planets



tions you may not make the trip but
neither did your great-grandfather per-
haps your great-grandson will

  laurie was not greatly surprised as
he made his way out of the office and
took the moving ways toward the airport
for new york once more but he was
vastly disappointed the moon shone
pale in the daylit sky no laurie had
ever reached even so far

  some day he was determined that one
of them would in the meantime there
were still opportunities to make a name
for himself here on earth even though
there were only two doen business or-
ganizations in the united states there
was room for their ramifications
 

  ban miller had reached that acme of
human aims for the average man of
-he had been accepted accepted
of course meant that within two years
he would be given a berth in one of the
crowded planetary transports where-
fore since ban millers particular field
of mental activity had been news report-
ing and interpreting he was now acting
as trainer to the unlicked cub the cub
was not wholly unlicked naturally but
he was inexperienced as far as this field
of reporting was concerned televiso-
news was a highly interesting and effec-
tive means of spreading the stories but
the average man did not care to sit be-
fore his televisor and watch the inter-
national conference on planetary af-
fairs for fifteen all-day sessions and
further he didnt have the time the
conference was scheduled to run fif-
teen days and the nations were spoiling
for a real good battle-royal it would
be a battle-royal too because the in-
dustrial committees were fearing a vio-
lent depression and realized that they
had the choice of fifteen million unem-
ployed in the united states and pro-
portionate numbers elsewhere or a war

which would make the fifteen million
and proportionate numbers unproduc-
tive consumers in the armies of the
world further the war was indicated
by falling profits the customers needed
a good reason before theyd accept a
price boost a war would be ideal

  then incidentally of course there was
real enmity arising from the planetary
affairs commissions for nearly three
centuries the interplanetary transporta-
tion company had had practical control
and ownership of the planets interplan-
etary had gotten off to such a flying
start it had simply bought up all com-
petition at first and since then no one
had been interested in starting a rival
company the only government of the
planets had been the interplanetarys
own executive office now however
there had arisen considerable feeling
on earth that some nation had a definite
claim to the control of those planets

  theyll argue miller explained to
the cub on the basi of the claims
made way back in the late s and
the early s the united states has
an iron-clad claim on mars really be-
cause it was an all-american crew that
took old lauries ship up there but
her navigator and her captain hap-
pened to be of french descent and
france has laws to the effect that no
frenchman can become a national of any
other country therefore the captain
when he claimed the planet for the
united states had no right to do so and
further the second ship to make the
crossing was actually french and also
claimed half the planet but germany
pointed out that neither ship had fully
explored the planet and not until their
ship made the crossing in  was a
complete survey in detail available
therefore they claim about a third of
mars

  now the jovian worlds were ex-
plored by nationals of all the terrestrial

countries and io was explored by an
american-born martian the big fight
of course is over mars and-i sort of
have a hunch old terra is in for the
shock of her life

  why asked the cub

  wait and see well know within
twenty-four hours

  whos that coming in now  asked
the cub

  m poireau french premier
elected by the steel interests hes nat-
urally for war steel in france includes
aircraft and rockets

  whos following him there i dont
recognize him at all

  oh-oh watch the fireworks i
knew that would happen terra is def-
initely in for a shock thats john mon-
gommery terrestrial president of inter-
planetary mystery montgommery
every time he does show his face some-
body gets blown off the map-look at
those delegates there every one of them
is trembling in his boots right now cart-
wright from these united represents
metals and allied utilities and hes
wondering whats up if he works against
montgommery he may lose business for
metals-and if he doesnt why he may
lose his job metals can have his elec-
tion recounted any time they want to
and find fraud in it of course

  and i in my innocence thought
there were still some traces of the ancient
democratic government left on earth
funny lots of people still do clerks
and so forth think their votes really get
counted of course some of the votes
do they may all be counted pretty quick-
ly though i hear metals is going to start
taking their employees fingerprints so
they can check up on who voted and
how when they find it necessary

the secret ballot what a secret
that gang is worried all those dele-
gates are worked-up montgommerys
presence means real trouble you know

they have a true democratic government
on the planets now-something on the
order of the old socialistic schemes pro-
posed here on earth back in the twen-
tieth century and which russia even
tried out but what the planets have
is supposed to be a corporationvoting
idea actually-well youll see im
willing to bet of course their social-
ism is a whole lot different from any-
thing they proposed back in the twen-
tieth century started that way you
might say because everything on mars
was owned by interplanetary to begin
with and every immigrant of course
paid his fare by buying stock but-
youll probably see

  the gentleman from france had been
appointed temporary chairman and so
french was the official language of the
conference till the permanent chairman
was elected he was calling the meet-
ing to order now the delegates took
their places and order ensued mont-
gommery had taken a place in the dis-
tinguished visitors gallery more eyes
were turned to him than to the chair-
man montgommerys presence was like
the tick of a time-bomb when would it
explode 

  sir reginald barry of england was
made permanent chairman according to
schedule in rapid fire order almost at
once m poireau rose and in beauti-
ful diplomatic english beating all
around the bush and robin hoods barn
stated that france declared one half of
mars surface area as hers that half
being delineated carefully it included
mars center new denver new berlin
and salamance france knew of
course that the nations would realize the
justice of her claims at once and with-
draw any claims of their own however
france was fully prepared to stand up
for her rights-and intended to

  cartwright of the united states rose
and read his speech notice hes read-
the contest of the planets



ing a typed speech and answering all of
poireaus points that speech of poir-
eaus was a complete surprise of
course chuckled miller now watch
hans schenkie answer both speeches
from his own typed script man this
conference is going to explode in a
hurry montgommery is the cause of
this theyd have delayed these speeches
over a period of days but they want
him to hear their claims hes taking it
all in himself-and theyd just expected
a few vice-assistant-seconds to be listen-
ing in say-hold on here will you i
want to make a call miller rose and
vanished along the corridor

  in perhaps fifteen minutes he was
back cartwright was answering poir-
eaus third point by this time with only
eleven more to go miller glanced at
the cubs notes and laughed too
serious man too intent heres the
way he condensed the cubs three
pages to two paragraphs and explained
at that rate youll fill several large
volumes at the average conference and
never be able to find what you wanted
again those points hes making are all
in the terrestrial encyclopedia

  but heres a note to make the new
denver is due to land to-morrow at
noon in new york but-theyve spotted
a life-boat leaving her the life-boat
broke out five hours ago and will land
in about an hour im waiting the bomb
explodes then ill bet it lands right
here in geneva too

  cartwright had nearly finished his
speech when the man entered the dis-
tinguished visitors gallery he was
clad in the loose-looking dust-tight mar-
tian garments and his face was dark
and lean with martian sunlight he
moved somewhat heavily on earth here
but there was a certain alertness and
energy about him he went directly to
john montgommery and spoke softly to
him from a brief-case he drew a large

envelope of papers and passed them
over with a smile of confidence and a
handshake

  ah-its come now the bomb ex-
plodes

  cartwright had been watching in re-
markable fashion he concluded his ad-
dress almost at once the conclusion was
that frances claims were wholly baseless
and false according to international law
mars belonged wholly and singly to the
united states of america

  montgommery rose in his seat

  mr chairman

  mr montgommery acknowledged
sir reginald you have no official
status at this meeting but i am sure we
would all be glad to hear your views
as an expert on martian affairs

  mr chairman i should like to pre-
sent these credentials montgommery
stalked forward and passed over to
sir reginald the papers he had so re-
cently received from the messenger

  sir reginald looked at them hur-
riedly then stopped he looked again
then smiled slowly at montgommery
surprising isnt it how the obvious
will escape attention gentlemen he
went on addressing the conference
i beg to present mr montgommery
delegate from the united planetary
council and ambassador plenipoten-
tiary for mars he will explain mars

  thank you mr chairman mont-
gommery replied interrupting the sud-
den hushed murmur of surprise and
anger gentlemen i have little to
say but i believe you will agree vith
sir reginald that it is obvious mars
does not belong solely and singly to the
united states she does not belong half
to france or one-third to germany
neither do the jovian worlds nor the
saturnian worlds mars belongs solely
and singly to the citizens of mars

  the jovian worlds belong singly


amazing stories

and solely to the colonists of those jov-
ian worlds as the satumian worlds be-
long to their inhabitants

  i am i realize setting forth a great
principle but it is yet an old principle
it is the principle that set up the united
states that men should determine their
own courses of action we of the plan-
ets desire to do so

  i fully realize the feelings that will
be stirred up but i intend now in open
conference to say and say bluntly
what we are all thinking

  mars and the planets all represent
great wealth further they represent
room for colonization interplanetary has
long held absolute control and only so
because of the vast wealth and consump-
tive power it represented this very con-
ference represents the culmination of a
recent tendency we who are interested
in planetary affairs have watched with
alarm terrestrials want more ships
built more accommodations for inter-
planetary travel so that all can move
to the planets who want to and this
pressure of public opinion has grad-
ually been bringing forth legislation that
would weaken interplanetary to a point
where an undesired rush of colonists
would be possible

  the planetarians have been care-
fully selected and are quite literally a
chosen race the result has been a bit
of superiority on their part but there
has always been the opportunity for
terrestrials to be chosen and this hope
has prevented any strong feeling against
them

  but the reason we have given for
this selection so rigorous that we have
refused ninety per cent of all applicants
has been limited transportation facilities
terrestrial governments could build
more ships say the people and take us
there

  frankly-mars doesnt want too
heavy an unselected immigration

  that is the reason for this change
really mars is now in theory as well as
in fact a self governing world she has
been you all realize that fact although
technically it has been a corporation
called interplanetary transport now
the name has been changed to the mar-
tian planetary union a state with pow-
ers similar to those of the individual
states of the united states of america
in the greater government of the inter-
planetary union

  we have combined against an unde-
sirable immigration we need more peo-
ple need them badly and will continue
our present system and expand it-
but we will select them the inter-
planetary union government will ap-
point as officers the entire staff of the
present interplanetary transport re-
naming them according to the more usual
diplomatic practice as consuls and am-
bassadors

  the immediate reaction on the part
of the terrestrial nations having claims
to the planets will of course be a de-
sire for war there is a strong ec-
onomic need for war right now i under-
stand montgommery added bitterly
but i would like to point out the ab-
surdity of such a course mars is not
wealthy enough in human and economic
capital to desire such a war-but i think
it should be remembered that all the
existing ships capable of the inter-
planetary crossing belong solely and
exclusively to the newly-created inter-
planetary union

  oh no doubt you could build ships
and attack within two or three years
what would you gain you cannot
armour a space-ship they are very ten-
der machines as we well know there-
fore they could not attack readily nor
effectively further they could not carry
fuel for the round trip and still man-
euver the result would be a fleet of
derelict helpless machines in space
the contest of the planets



hanging off mars powerless to move
and completely at the mercy of our own
small  wift battle-rockets

  i believe you will agree that war
is out of the question-purely so from a
mechanical standpoint however i doubt
that the people would support such a
venture for they all hope and secretly
expect to get to mars themselves every
man with any self-respect believes him-
self worthy of choice those that feel
sure they wont be chosen are cripples
weaklings or completely spiritless of
such you cannot make an army when
england tried to put down the rebellion
of her american colonies she failed not
because her men were not brave or
strong or spirited but because the men
of england agreed with their brothers
and cousins in the colonies and refused
to fight them mercenaries had to be
hired with deplorable results

 well-you may find mercenaries
but every worthy citizen of terra has a
real and genuine chance to join us in
the greatest work man has undertaken
the colonization of new worlds by new
and better races of mankind

 montgommery sat down suddenly
the cub became aware of the fact that
miller had vanished in his place was
an international newsman with his tele-
viso projector

  there was an angry mutter of discon-
tent rising from the conference and
officials were heading for the interna-
tional newsman

  that scene was not directly broad-
cast of course demanded the sergeant-
at-arms 

  miller reappeared before the interna-
tional man could speak no rafferty
it wasnt we wouldnt care to put that
red-hot stuff on the air but its being
groomed for broadcast right now we
canned it temporarily

   fraid it wont go miller said
rafferty shaking his head they all

agreed on that its bad for the people
im afraid it has said a new voice
the messenger from the interplanetary
union had appeared there was noth-
ing we were ashamed to have on the
air and it has all gone out i have a
new ultravisor in the bag here and it
was relayed from my lif e-boat the
conference will have to answer that
frank challenge as frankly if they want
the sympathy of the people

  but dont worry miller replied
ironically those boys will cook up some
kind of hash or their companies will
a voice pierced suddenly through the
mounting angry buzz from the floor of
the conference -all realize that this
is the desperate move of a traitorous
jealous german government to prevent
the just claims of france being realized
and- the voice was drowned in a bel-
low of denunciation from the german
delegate

  i guess they have already grinned
the cub theyve got their war any-
way ill send the pictures to you mil-
ler if you martians should be inter-
ested



  moon-faced fat simon wallowy was
chairman of the conference simon
wallowy was also chairman of the in-
dustrial committee of the united states
of north america the son of a long
line of wallowys who had been chair-
men of the committee naturally because
of the vast properties owned by the
wallowy interests

  simon wallowy was very much an-
noyed by this conference as it had called
him away from a very pleasant time he
had been having at his country home
with a number of plehb girls he had
directed to go there but-this annoy-
ing conference had been necessary the
trouble with the world was that there
were a number of semi-plehbs with a


amazing stories

little property and some influence that
could make so much noise that they in-
fluenced opinions adversely now if
mortans idea would just be accepted by
some of the other men this last annoy-
ance could be done away with in another
two decades

  however since things were as they
were the disarmament conference would
have to be gone through with naturally
it would come just when war had almost
been decided on by the sino-japs and
the americans wallowy didnt see what
he was going to do with the present un-
employment situation if they didnt
have a war fairly soon

  also he was annoyed by the attitude
that john montgommery had displayed
that annoying attitude of indifferent
superiority as though he was not a
descendant of middle-class incompetents
squeezed out of and off earth by the strife
of business the planetarians acted as
though they had wanted to leave earth
a billion incompetents and dreamers
earth had gotten rid of so that a real
stable society could be established and
now these same exiles were acting
superior

  they scarcely carried on any trade
with earth any more but then wallowy
didnt want it really hed have had to
make some concessions on the tariffs if
he had and those cheap all-machine
made goods of the planets would have
caused trouble among the workers

  ah well wallowy wandered across
the park toward the conference build-
ing the beautiful white silica building
set among the green of trees on the shore
of the blue lake backed by snow-capped
mountains was shimmering pink in the
twilight above it a great tongue of
azure and golden atomic flame hung mo-
tionless and steady unmoved by the gen-
tle breeze-the azure and gold of the
peace building

  wallowy had always been annoyed by

it it reminded him so forcefully of the
trouble his grandfather had had when
the atomic flames were first invented by
david laurie of io the tremendous
increase in the available energy had
made it possible to throw thousands of
workers out and still maintain produc-
tion but it had brought a great deal of
trouble till the british-american war
had gotten rid of the excess and brought
canada into the union but it had had
the beneficial effect of opening up the
major planets and venus and mercury
to colonization so that a great many of
the remaining semi-plehbs had left earth
and made things quieter anti-gravity
had come almost simultaneously and
completely opened the system to coloniza-
tion but by that time the interplanetary
union got nasty and wouldnt permit
any further emigration from earth

  wallowy passed through the door of
the peace palace with a determined wad-
dle he might be able to induce the
heinrichs and the derriers to join him
in declaring war on the interplanetary
that would solve the unemployment
problem and might get them a little sat-
isfaction on the score of interplanetarys
superior attitude he frowned though
as he remembered that interplanetary
wouldnt respect his properties properly
they might cause damage

  an hour later he called the meeting
to order he had intended calling on
karl heinrich as the first speaker but
he discovered to his annoyance that
montgommery of interplanetary union
wanted the floor he ignored him and
called heinrich to speak

  i think said montgommery inter-
rupting that it would be wisest to hear
me first mr chairman may i have the
floor

  very well mr montgommery your
manners however are execrable

  montgommery smiled slightly and
nodded to him worse according to
the contest of the planets



your ideas however my message has
not been heard by you-er-men be-
fore he continued more soberly

  interplanetary union has decided that
we have made a bad mistake earth the
mother world has always been re-
garded with some feeling of interest and
sympathy however we have come
more and more to realize that in giving
birth to the children old earth has been
sacrificing her life-blood i am sadly
afraid that the children have been stupid
and selfish the result is inevitable of
course but our own interest in our own
problems and the vast work that we had
to accomplish in making civilization
possible on such bleak worlds as pluto
and athena turned our attention from
earth we have neglected her inter-
ests now he smiled we have de-
cided that earths only hope is that we
completely neglect her

  interplanetary union has decided to
completely withdraw all relations with
earth we will withdraw our consuls
ambassadors all our interests we will
send no further ships to earth we will
send no messenger we will receive
none

  this should be put on record for
future generations when earth first
sends a ship again to interplanetary at
mars center a new ship with some new
invention of importance then inter-
planetary will revisit earth and help her
finish settling her problem

 you do not understand me poor
earth has given her life-blood in giving
life to the planets earth is nearly dead
we will leave her for no effort of ours
can bring new life to her only the slow
cleansing of time can do it

  the planets have for nearly seven
centuries through thirty generations of
men robbed earth of her greatest her-
itage the near-geniuses we have ac-
cepted only the strong the intelligent
and the healthy generation after gen-

eration we have taken from earth every-
thing that makes the human race strong
we have left only the dregs the weak
the stupid the unadventurous and-the
contented

  the result-we can see all too clearly
now earth still has a remnant of hope
-the so-called semi-plehbs we know
that genius arises slowly if a thousand
morons mate a few normal men will re-
sult if a thousand normal men mate
a few near-geniuses will result if a
hundred near-geniuses mate perhaps one
genius will rise to lead all the others on-
ward the planets took every genius
earth produced and nearly every near-
genius they did this not once but
time and time again through thirty gen-
erations the result was that now nearly
all the genes of intelligence and health
and wisdom that the human race carried
have been isolated on the planets the
genes of stupidity and disease and
every form of weakness have concen-
trated on earth your death rate shows
that and that is a benefit fortunately
in a machine age the genes of stupidity
lead only to death-sudden and violent
death so we of the planets have this
hope for earth through perhaps another
thirty generations the genes of weakness
and disease will kill off their bearers
more and more they will concentrate in
certain strains and bring death

  even among your plehbs there is
some opportunity for intelligence there
will be such a divisioning that the more
intelligent will be thrown together and
there will slowly rise a group of normal
healthy intelligent people then from
them a group of near geniuses and
finally a real genius who will fly his ship
to mars center and redeem earth

  it was the selfishness of the planets
that brought it about in its present acute
form-but it was inevitable all the near-
geniuses would have gone we accel-
erated the process true but it would


amazing stories

have been just those intelligent restless
ones who sought greater opportunities
who would have made the trip anyway

  america led the earth when she was
young for just one reason she was
populated by only those people who had
intelligence enough to earn their pas
sage-money who had ambition enough
to seek new opportunity and brains
enough to permit them to cut loose from
the land where they were born america
lost her advantage slowly as a new race
of settled people rose for a time all
the restless driving genes of the cau-
casian race were concentrated in amer-
ica in europe there remained the
stupid land-loving peasant who could
not see beyond the horizon

  the planets inevitably were populated
by a race of men who could see beyond
the horizon even beyond the skies and
up to the stars they inevitably got the
restless ambitious men and women who
sought new room for their abilities

 why-earth was doomed to decay
when laurie sent his first rocket to
mars nearly seven hundred years ago
we of the planets made it worse still by
our selection generation after genera
tion of the finest and best blood earth
had to offer

  now we are leaving earth we will
send no ships we will send no mes-
sages nor receive any from earth we
will send no men most of all we will
take none thirty generations brought
about the downfall of earth thirty more
may see it rebuilt

  we leave within a month i leave
this evening

  we hope to hear from you or better
from the people of earth in another
seven or eight hundred years but no
matter how long it may take earth will
be completely isolated so far as we are
concerned it is impossible for us to do
any positive thing to aid earth only
time and generations of men can do it

  one other thing he added with a
faint smile i may hope to greet the
first man of the new earth james
steven munro has discovered a system
of prolonging life for a period as yet
unknown i am proud to say that i am
one of the few who have been chosen to
receive this treatment

  we of the planets have decided
thanks to the example of earth that
death is a necessary evil it alone
purges the race and makes room for the
new generations only the coming of
new and newer generations can bring
the new and better men evolution did
not stop when men arose from the mud

  we have seen evolution you have
seen the short inhumanly powerful men
of jupiter and the lean dry dark men
of mars

  but i may live to receive the first of
the new men of earth

  now i am leaving the decision is
final

  do you mean to say that inter-
planetary considers earth unworthy of
their high and mighty society  roared
wallowy his face crimson with rage

  montgommery stood up slowly and
smiled at him

  pm afraid it does of yours at any
rate i might add for your interested
consideration that we thought of teach-
ing you how to live for centuries it
would prevent any increase in your in-
telligence if you become intelligent
you may prevent the re-evolution of in-
telligence in the plehbs we decided
against it because you would probably
give it to the plehbs also so that new
workers would not have to be trained
so that less time would be lost during
their infancy that would prevent new
generations so we decided against it

  montgommery smiled and despite the
storm of anger bellowing from enraged
and life-hungry men he walked out pro-
tected by the same short powerful jo-

end of prologue

chapter i

bravely the nine-year-old
boy swung along the passages
through the almost deserted
main corridors past the roar-
ing workshops polshin guards
stationed here and there paid little at-
tention to him plehb workers plodding
about their work heavily or walking
more briskly carrying messages paid
 no attention to him he was the sole
care of his parents and himself no one
would pay any attention if one more
child was caught in a machine or crushed
under a heavy truck

   bruce i-awry actually was consider-
 ably frightened for he had bravely de-
 termined to reach the far-away deserted
 passages

   jon la wry bruces father had told
 him about those deserted passages jon
 was a mechanician a plebh of the a
 class in consequence and fairly free to
 roam his blue garb a protection from
 polshin guards jon had seen and en-
 tered these deserted passages when a
 mysterious short circuit in a power cir-
 cuit had to be located far back in the
 deserted passages the power line had
 long since been dead-ended and never
 removed a fall of stone from the
 passage roof had shorted it bruce was
 determined to see them he had told
 don he would he had taken one of his
 fathers little light-tubes so that he could
 see

   it was nearly four miles across the

city and all the distance had to be trav-
ersed on foot once his father had told
him the streets had moved and you
could ride on them but that had been
stopped to discourage the wandering
of the plehbs

  his father had been apprenticed to
a man who knew the story of the great
city of nyak of long ago then his
father had told him not only the pol-
shins had surface homes but even the
plehbs had lived above ground only
because it was cheaper to create artificial
light from atomic power and maintain
air conditioning than to maintain both
of these and also buildings that the
weather constantly wore down had the
plehbs been moved below the surface
into the rocks

  jon had even been to the surface
sometimes to fix power lines leading
to the polshin homes

 bruce walked more slowly as he
came at last to the edge of the city
there were few people in the streets
here now the polshin guards were far
apart and the light-tubes were scanty
bruce looked down the corridor he was
following and saw where the light
ended there was no polshin stationed
there for it was a little side-street
where no people lived

t turriedly bruce scuttled be-
yond the lighted zone and looked
back no polshin had seen him he
went on stumbling in the dark afraid
to light his hand-torch something
tripped him suddenly and he fell with
a little cry of fear quickly he turned
his light on it it was a strange white
lattice work of rounded bars it was
only when he saw that it was an outline
about his own size and that draped
over it was the rnetal-cord belt such as
he wore that he realized what it must
be-a skeleton

  he almost went back but he looked


amazing stories

and saw there was no light-tube beside
this skeleton and determinedly he
started on he wondered how many-
more might have come this way and
died

  with the super-developed sense of di-
rection he had acquired from many walks
about the lighted part of the city he
felt no fear of getting lost instead he
went on and on his light-tube glowing
now

  he passed long rows of deserted
dwellings then he came to a section
the like of which he had never seen the
corridor had grown wider and wider as
he advanced with incoming passages
adding to it here at last he came to
a great cube far greater than cube
center in the part of the city he knew
in the center of the cube was a build-
ing not made of the universal granite
grey and cold but of white stone of
marble had he known it it was utterly
different from anything he had ever
seen beautiful and clean and white in
the spread light of the tiny but wonder-
fully powerful hand-light he could
dimly see the graceful columns and the
roof that was something he had never
seen before in this weather-less place
he did not know that this was a copy of
greek architecture

  breathlessly excited as he had never
been before he looked around him the
whole cube was lined with various great
glass windows far larger than he had
ever seen before they were dark now
and lonely little heaps of rubbish lay
behind them he could not guess their
purpose

  cautiously he made his way toward
the beautiful white building there was
rubbish on the stone floor of the great
cube over it he picked his way with
the aid of the little light-tube and went
up the broad foot-worn steps of the
library this library was very old even

he knew that he knew more than
most children of that thirty-second cen-
tury civilization would have known he
could read the inscription above the door
even though it meant little to him
interplanetary library
foundation foundation he un-
derstood his father had taught him to
read for jon lawry being a mechan-
ician had to be able to read meters and
other things as had his predecessors
and so the art of reading had been
handed down among the mechanicians
bruce knew foundation only as a heavy
base one put machines on he looked
around for the machine and wondered
what kind of thing it could have been
that had been set on this beautiful struc-
ture

interplanetary meant nothing
to him he did not know what a
planet was library meant as little for
the plehbs had forgotten libraries and
printed literature almost entirely and
the little they knew was the simple tech-
nical material they needed actually
bruces mother marta had taught him
reading more than his father had done
though his father had begun his in-
struction for marta was a worker in
the chemical plants she had nearly half
a dozen books books on thin metal
plates worn and broken now for they
were some four hundred and fifty years
old these were the only books bruce
knew libraries were unheard of among
the plehbs

  bruce stared at the great bronze
doors cautiously he pulled at one it
did not open the grill of the gate was
far too fine-meshed for him to slip
through and there were no windows in
the building inside he could see the
smooth layer of grey dust on the white
stone and long racks a series of great
tables and here and there a low desk
it was very dark save where his light
the contest of the planets



touched it he wanted very much to
get in

  suddenly he turned his attention to
the lock it was steel bright rust ss
steel far too well made to be opened
his efforts perhaps somewhere there
still existed a key for that lock but no
man on all earth could have said where
it might be but bruce was a mechan-
ician his mind was sharp and trained
to mechanical and electrical thoughts
confidently he examined the door then
he turned and made his way back
through the trash and litter of the cube
hunting he finally found what he
wanted a bent piece of metal some six
inches long fearfully he made his
way to the door stripped off his single
garment and wrapped his hand and the
light-tube in it then with the other
hand he removed the tiny glowing gas-
tube from the device and carefully in-
serted the bent metal carefully pro-
tected with some mouldering cloth- in
a moment he had located the thinnest
of the metal bars of the grill

  a sudden groaning hum came from
his light-tube as he made the contact a
popping and crackle of sparks and a
shower of incandescent metal fell on his
cloth-wrapped hand some burned his
bare body-but the grill-bar parted
again he applied his light-tube another
bar gave way three more bars he
fused then he stopped and replaced
the gas-tube it didnt fit well now for
even the resistant light-tube was some-
what burned and it didnt glow very
brightly any longer for the charge was
nearly used he knew though that it
would bum satisfactorily for another
four hours and then he would have the
emergency cell left for half an hour
more

tugging straining with all hi
power he pulled the broken bars
aside he crept inside and looked

about him now he could see the
stacks and with a soft intake of breath
he realized they were books books in
such quantities as he had never imag-
ined rapidly he went to them and read
their titles

  th-e de-v-e-l-o-p-m-e-n-t o-f i-n-
t-e-r-p-l-a-n-e-t-a-r-y c-o-l-o-n-i-z-a-
t-i-o-n he spelled out but he didnt
know what it was so he took down the
book and looked at it then he put it
back realizing he did not know anything
about it at all and looked at other
shelves

  three hours later his light was grow-
ing very dim and he realized he must
hurry back to the lighted ways soon
regretfully he turned away and started
homeward but he determined that this
library the meaning of which he knew
now was to be his secret shared only
with don wade they would come
back here and bring fresh light-tubes
with them and they would learn what
was in all those thousands of books

  why they might learn even what
made the burners give off their silent
hot flame endlessly and the great surg-
ing currents nobody knew that any-
more but jon lawry had said they
have forgotten once men knew but
they have all forgotten now and the
books are lost they must have told
once upon a time once men were
wiser than now

  maybe these books told even that

chapter ii

dot steel was the third per-
son to enter the library after
the seven centuries of deser-
tion bruce brought don back with him
that next day children had their work
to do too soon enough in life by the
time he was twelve bruce was appren-
tived to his father in the mechanics busi-
ness time and again he amazed his


amazing stories

father with work jon could not do by
then he had read some of the books in
that library and what had been a childs
secret from the first day became even
more of a secret and from them he had
learned the secrets of the machines jon
repaired blindly by rule they were to
him just as to don wade an escape in
the books they left the grinding labor
of  and went back through time
to the days when earth was great

  an even deeper secret it was as they
advanced to adolescence then as their
apprenticeship approached an end their
maturing minds began to realize more
and more fully the significance of this
thing they realized the true inherit-
ance of mankind bruce had studied the
technical books both because they lay
along the field of his work and because
in them lay his interests he knew how
the burners worked splitting the atom
and releasing the protons and electrons
in flying streams to give off the tre-
mendous currents that were the life-
blood of their civilization

  wade had studied the historical books
he had gathered more and more a true
picture of what the human race had
been but one problem was left in his
mind what had happened why had
men fallen so and fallen so completely
and abruptly in  dozens of books
were placed on the shelves in  the
last book had been placed there the
library records ended in  what
had brought about this tremendous and
abrupt fall from a vast civilization
that spread to every planet of the sys-
tem to a tiny shrunken thing that could
not maintain itself at its high level for
even one brief decade had men been
afflicted with some titanic system-wide
plague why was there absolutely no
record of this tremendous world-shak-
ing change

  don more than bruce was absorbed
in this problem don was the student

the sociologist bruce was the scientist
to bruce came the sheer thrilling ex-
ultation of intellectual brilliance as he
read of the scientific achievements of the
old days when men had come face to
face with an absolutely impassable
boundary-why they had simply dodged
under it or over it or crept around it
nothing had stopped man then it
seemed in the greatness of earth man
had sought and found the secret of the
energy of exploding atoms one of the
things that had given bruce the keenest
joy was the infinite subtlety with which
men had attacked the problem of x-
rays no substance could be ruled with
lines so close together as to produce a
diffraction grating such as was used in
light study so-man had used the nat-
ural regularly spaced crystal-molecules
in substances as his diffraction grating
x-rays could not be reflected by a mir-
ror or concentrated by a lens to form an
image yet man had used crystals to
focus x-rays to make picturesof things
too minute to be caught by light

   bruce did not wonder at it it seemed
perfectly natural to him but he was
able to understand and follow with ease
the deepest thoughts of those greatest
thinkers of the old days why shouldnt
he he would have thought they were
men he was a man-so why not

ta he planets had done better by
earth in leaving her than they had
guessed wheat strong and healthy
planted in fertile ground produces lav-
isly but all the wheat grows weak
with the good and gradually the yield
falls to that of ordinary wheat in ordi-
nary ground weak poor wheat in
poor lean ground will grow very poorly
the crop will be nearly nothing but
with a few generations it rises to a more
normal level now if that wheat be
transplanted to good land the yield will
be enormous because that harsh poor
the contest of the planets



land has killed out the weaklings the un-
resistant and only strong vigorous
stock could survive

  the planets had concentrated all the
weakness of the race on earth all
the weakness of the race had killed it-
self by its very weakness now in the
thirty-fifth century a tiny population of
scarcely two hundred million remained
of earths three billions but those two
hundred million were far above the av-
erage of the twentieth century before
the great dividing began

  bruce and don had studied each find-
ing a vast interest and release in these
books more and more they realized
they must keep it secret lest the pol-
shins find it and destroy them as pos-
sible revolutionists no other humans
knew of these finds

  and that was why dot steel was fin-
ally brought don met her when doing
some special work for the metals de-
partment they had worked together
talked together-and soon they loved
together don twenty-two now was
tall and wirely powerful his keen pleas-
ant face framed in golden blond hair
he wore the blue of a class a plehb
and for that matter so did dot steel
there was no law that forced them to
marry within their own plebh-class
but the class a plehbs being in similar
lines of work tended to come more to-
gether they lived in the same parts of
the city and there was a natural tend-
ency to intermarry

  dot steel was twenty when they met
five feet two in height slim as soft and
graceful as a cat her hair was black
as the deserted coridors and shiny
as laquer her lips were full and red
and her black eyes seemed to challenge
don to love her

  he did he loved her whole-heartedly
hed have gone to the mating office
with her within a week of the day he
met her but that he was still only a

first-grade apprentice in six months
he was to get his class c masters pa-
pers and with them in hand he could
petition the local polshin for a separate
apartment and on mating he would be
granted with his wife a two-week hol-
iday so they had not gone at once tc
the mating office

  dot steel wanted to she cared only
for the moment and she wanted don
wanted him as only a plehb who had
little in life to long for could want any-
thing she wanted to be with him and
feel him near her not some time but
now

and don with the keener more pow-
 erful mind realized it would be far
better if they started their own home in-
stead of bringing a wife to live with his
own parents further now as a class
one apprentice he and his wife were en-
titled to but one week of vacation

  dot began to doubt him she grew
suspicious of his love and further she
knew when his hours of rest came she
knew he had twelve full hours off every
day yet never did he spend more than
three with her and then only once a
week the other days he limited him-
self to one hour-and vanished try
as she would coax as she would she
could not learn where he spent the other
time

  so one day when don wade called
expecting three hours with his own girl
-she was cold and angry she accused
him of spending nearly all his time with
another girl

  i know-i know you say you dont
-but where do you go have you ever
told rne have you ever denied even
that you were free those hours one
hour-then you are gone you do not
love--and you do not even play fair
with the other girl the one you must
love better for you spend most of your
time with her


amazing stories

  oh dot darling i dont i love you
and only you i-

  then why dont you stay with me
why do you always leave you go
off with bruce-and stay away you
have lovers together

  sweetheart in this town you know
that couldnt be true don smiled
youd have heard the truth from the
neighbors

  i have snapped the girl they
all know you leave me thats why its
so unbearable if you love me and not
some other girl prove it take me
where you have been going

  that was final either dot went where
don spent all his time-or don could
spend all his time there so far as she
was concerned

  in despair don turned to the tele-
phone system bruce now a master
mechanician was necessarily available
by phone

  we must show her bruce it is your
discovery-shall we take her

  of course don if it means your
happiness you need not have asked me
shall i come along

  will you im afraid he laughed
ruefully she would not believe my
word in her present mood

they started in an hour bruce
leading the way in his blue mas-
ters garb with its gold star down half-
lighted back passages then through a
series of apartments long deserted that
stood right on the border line between
the deserted and the populated regions
missing the polshin guards as always
then down the familiar passages to the
great cube it was laurie cube as
bruce knew now as they came to it
the great gas-tubes lighted suddenly a
little scream of surprise came from dot
those miles of black mysterious cor-
ridors deserted for centuries had been

all she could stand only her determina-
tion to see where don was leading her
drove her on as they came on she be-
came convinced that don was taking her
here that he might scare her make her
afraid to go through with it then al-
ways he could say when he left her that
he was going to the place he would have
taken her had she not been afraid

  as the lights blazed up suddenly
mysteriously at their approach her
nerves almost gave way altogether

  its all right honey-just an auto-
matic photo-cell device bruce arranged
to light it at our approach

 oh she gasped then oh-how
beautiful

  in the full light of the light-tubes the
little greek temple of white silica stone
shone like a great jewel in a dark set-
ting about it the dark granite ab-
sorbed the light it alone reflected it and
seemed to glow of its own light

  warm yellowish light shone from the
doorway of the library now inside was
the clean white light of the reading
lights but here the warmth of the yel-
lowish light seemed to welcome them

  rapidly they advanced and dot steel
entered the library the third human to
enter it since this region had been de-
serted six centuries before

  in-ter-plan-et-ary li-brar-y foun-da-
ti-on whats that mean what is this
place 

  a library is a place where books are
kept darling bruce found this place
when he was a small boy and ever since
we have been coming here studying
reading the books of the old days
darling we know more about this city
here than the polshins we know more
about the machines than any other man
living these books have kept forever
the knowledge that men have forgot-
ten we have learned it again

  books the girl cried just books
the contest of the planets



she looked into the library now looked
about at the shelves of books racked in
thousands and thousands the tables
were strewn here and there with sheets
of paper pencils calculating machines

 tljst books smiled bruce his deep
voice smiling with him but you
shouldnt say just books books are
something you have not learned to un-
derstand man practically lost books for
seven centuries why i dont know
and because he lost books he lost
everything he lost freedom and wis-
dom and judgment he lost ease and
happiness

  the books can teach him to win them
back

  i tried to read a book once said
dot her suspicions returning it was
very uninteresting it was so uninter-
esting i went to sleep and was nearly
late to work i dont believe you come
here no one could be so interested in
books as you pretend

  but we are dot that is how we
have gotten our advancement so quickly
dont you remember bruce got his
masters papers because he fixed a
broken burner that no other mechani-
cian could fix he could fix it because
he knew how those machines worked
he alone of all men knows why they do
what they do i have gotten my papers
rapidly because i have taken from these
books knowledge that has been lost for
centuries and put it to use

  but that doesnt make me believe you
are so interested you come here day
after day and read-read books she
said the last words with scorn

  sweetheart you have never read
books you dont know the romance and
the mystery that surrounds them and
the things they say what were the
old days like-and why did they end
who are the polshins  who are the

plehbs do you know that polshin
comes from a corruption of the old word
politician a man who sought to gain
some public office oh-but you dont
know what a public office is

  there are mysteries and wonders in
those books

  i read one insisted dot it was
very uninteresting

  dot said bruce there are one
hundred and fourteen thousand books in
this library there are one hundred and
three thousand different books-no two
alike you read one you know how
you hate jak studds would you say
because jak studds was hateful that all
plehbs are hateful be fair because
one book is uninteresting to one very
small and very pretty little girl that
does not mean that one hundred and
three thousand books are all very unin-
teresting to a man

  well-maybe

  but then why is don o unwilling to
go to the mating office with me she
launched her attack suddenly along dif-
ferent lines

  dot dot--you know im not un-
willing to go there with you don
cried wrapping her suddenly in his
arms and turning her face up to his
theres nothing i want more-except
perhaps your happiness and that i
think i can best assure by waiting a
little longer

  ooo-you cant--you cant she
suddenly sobbed and hugged him harder
burying her face suddenly on his chest
i-i want you don-i want you now

  don lifted her face again if you
want me so much now as much as i
want you maybe why-i guess we can
get to the mating office in half an
hour	 

  but dot didnt stop crying she cried
harder and hugged him harder and be-
gan to dance lets go-lets go-


amazing stories

chapter iii

there were three couples ahead
of them when they reached the
mating office all of them were
trying to look bored and indifferent all
of them were being very stiff and
wooden the couple in the blue were
being recorded first a mixed couple
a man in blue and a girl of the greens
was next then a green pair and finally
a pair of big powerful-bodied greys

  each couple was accompanied by a
master of his class to act as witness and
identifier the blues witness was ev-
idently the girls father and he was
quite as flustered as the pair them-
selves the plehb clerk behind the bench
looked at him with a bit of annoyance
but not too much for he was a second-
class blue while the master was of
course a first-class finally the pair
moved away to the accompaniment of
chuckles and snickers of half-suppressed
laughter from the polshin guards stand-
ing at the door

  one of the polshins left his post long
enough to press his seal-ring on the
wax and returned his soft scarlet cloak
flapping about his legs

  this guard-duty was the one task the
polshin men performed in all their lives
for two years they were forced to do
the strenuous job of standing or sitting
about in the plehb sections and guarding
the polshins interests usually they
went in pairs for company each was
armed with a shock-rod but it meant
nothing for they were seldom needed
their duty in this office was merely to
put a polshin stamp of approval on
the mating record-and collect their
fees two lest the duty be too boring

  the mixed couple accompanied by a
blue master was up now the master
in this case was evidently the young
mans apprentice-master the records
were entered speedily and the three de-

parted the green couple followed as
another couple came behind dot and
don then-omallin came in oriial-
lins entrance at that precise moment
was as mighty a force in the course of
human history as montgommerys
speech on the independence of mars
or that later speech of the later mont-
gommery on the isolation of earth
omallin was the local polshin leader
nyaks polshin chief he was round
and short and fat his face was red
and fat his hair faded and missing on
top altogether so his pink shiny skull
showed his fifty-three years of utter
unrestraint showed in the bleary pig-
eyes in the flabby fat face and the
flabby fat belly he waddled when he
walked and his voice was high-pitched
and unpleasant but he was followed
by a retinue of lesser polshins bowing
morally intellectually and physically to
this scarlet-cloaked monstrosity his
once sharp hawks nose was half buried
in the soft fat of his face and the sharp
chin whose evolution marked the evolu-
tion of man was lost in rolling quiver-
ing fat

 omallin entered and the polshin
guards sprang to the straightest of at-
tention the plehb clerk bowed low
and the other plehbs in the room in-
clined their heads

 omallin nodded grandly the pol-
shin guards relaxed the plehbs straight-
ened again plehb how many matings
this month demanded the polshin
leader

 six thousand four hundred and
thirty-nine polshin sir replied the
clerk

  the rate is rising

  yes polshin sir

t tmmmm - maybe karrody i

 fl will admit your request to open
some of the deserted passages to coun-
the contest of the planets



ri hmmmm- onialin looked around
him

   dot steel had with the other plehbs
sunk back to the less lighted portion of
the scorn but the softer light merely
enhanced and softened her beauty
omallins wandering eyes suddenly fo-
cussed a slow smile came across the
fat face

  by gah-a beauty plebh come
here

   dot steels richly colored face went
white as the clerks papers her body
was suddenly trembling her eyes opened
dilated slowly but she did not move

  the polshin guard nearest the girl
stepped over abruptly plehb move
when youre ordered he snapped a
touch of the shock-rod and the girl
jumped violently with a little whimper
she turned and started for the door on
flying feet the polshin guard caught
her just as bruce lawry his cold grey
eyes blazing caught don wade fool
he whispered you cannot help by fight-
ing it will only be death

  the polshin guard brought dot steel
toward omallin omallins fat hand
reached up caught the fastener of the
girls suit a swift crinkle of sound and
the single garment fell away leaving
her white body under the lights

  omallins eyes seemed to lose their
bleariness for a moment

  ahh- he said softly send her to
infirmary five for the treatment then
to my place-she is very nice

   the girl collapsed slowly gently to
the floor and lay quiet as omallin
walked out of the room the plehbs in
the room were tensely quiet as the grin-
ning polshin guards picked up the girl
passing his hands over her one turned
to his companion with a broader grin
old omallin-

  white-faced frozen don exploded
into life so suddenly that bruce did not
even feel the warning tensing of his

muscles one blow of his fist backed by
the work-hardened muscles of a strong
man sent the polshin guard flying half
across the room

  one touch of the others shock-rod
jerked wade into abrupt unconscious-
ness his lax body fell across dot
steel raging holding his near-broken
jaw the first polshin started across the
room his shock-rod glowing now with
the blue fire that meant death at its
touch

  wait mark the poor fool was
crazy hes a blue and worth some-
thing losing his woman made him
kind of crazy dont kill him

  out of the way that plehb-spawned
maggot struck me no plehb can-
let him live mark let him live he
was crazy dont worry hes paying
for it



it was hours later when don wade
woke bruce was leaning over him
his eyes cold and clear there was a hy-
podermic needle in his hand

  dot groaned wade abruptly he
sat up he stared about him he was in
the library now lying on one of the
tables

   lie back don you almost died any-
way believe it or not the interference
of a polshin saved your life

  wheres dot

  shes gone don replied bruce
steadily you know that

  dons eyes began to smolder with a
colder saner hate now im going to
get her back those maps-the old maps
they will show where infirmary is and
ill bring her back

  no don you wont listen to
me don you arent prepared to bring
her back you couldnt get to her in
the first place in the second you would
not be able to bring her away now she
has been operated on by now she will


amazing stories

be unable to move for days if you did
reach her and escape with her where
could you go i have thought of all
this while i was getting that stuff
to revive you from the old interplanetary
hospital i thought that out

  don you will have to lose dot i
know more of medicine now than do
those doctors of infirmary five they
are trained only by what is remembered
from the old days i know all that is
known of the old days-more than they
do listen i will tell you what will
happen dot is not like most of the plehb
girls taken she is not the first but she
will be almost the last dot will be-
come conscious when the anasthetic
wears off about two days from now
then she will know what has hap-
pened she will be treated and she
will die because she does not want to
live nothing they knew even in the
old days would have been able to make
her whole again so even if you could
reach her it would avail you nothing
because dot would not want to live
and she would die when a human not
only does not fight for life but seeks
death that human will die even though
they be in sound health with a wound
death is inevitable dot is lost don

  for a long minute don sat in silent
blank-faced thought slowly he sank
back yes she is i guess i have read
that too and i know dot he smiled
faintly at bruce what will work for
her will work for me bruce i do not
want to live

   bruces eyes just hardened i thought
of that too i would not have saved
you if i had not known you would
want very much to live don you want
to live because you know more than any
other living human you know the se-
crets of the old days and we can learn
more with them-we will not only
destroy omallin but we will destroy

the zvhole polshin order we will bring
back the old days

qlowly dons eyes lit up again
 and again he sat up use these se-
crets of the old days-to end omallin
and the polshins yes bruce i want
very much to live

  his voice was so coldly precisely
deadly bruce looked at him sharply don
spoke again it will take years wont
it bruce we cannot do it alone for
then it would not stay done the other
plehb girls would be seen by other
omallins and want to not-live no it
will take years and we must be very
careful we must make all the plehbs
in nyak help us first then-i wonder
if the old cities still exist like this one
shkaga and washton san franeo
and london somehow bruce we must
learn and start in all those cities so that
all the polshins everywhere are de-
stroyed

  and first we must learn all the se-
crets of the old days and more too
if possible i think perhaps we can we
will open the old interplanetary labor-
atories somehow we must build an
atomic cruiser for i know that while we
have seen only the pleasure cruisers of
the polshins they must have some-
where the old atomic cruisers we will
need powerful weapons if we are to
regain the surface for the plehbs

  i thought you would agree with me
don yes it will take years and all
those years you must keep out of the
sight of the polshin guards for one of
those two in the office there will look
for you the one you hit the other
saved your life

  for that perhaps i should thank
him if he did not i would not have
had this opportunity dons cold pre-
cise voice seemed with him permanently
now

chapter iv

don wade began the study of
mass psychology and the psy-
chology of the individual that
day while bruce began the study of the
maps with more care the power they
were using to light the library and the
laurie cube outside they had simply
stolen from the old power-lines that had
never been tom out but now bruce
realized he would want vastly more
power power to light and operate the
buildings for they had decided that
some small part of this deserted section
was going to be restored to the beauty
it must have had before the great
catastrophe as they had come to call
that period of sudden fall from earths
greatness the sudden change from the
old days

  bob steel dots brother was their
first recruit and jon lawry their sec-
ond bob steel was a master of direc-
tion and a class a blue and he hated
the polshins with as deadly a hate as
did don wade with wade he began
to read the old books and to learn
what had been before he quickly appre-
ciated the mystery and romance of them
and-their possibilities for revenge and
for reinstatement of the old days old
jon read the books and with ecstatic joy
learned again the secrets forgotten by
men for more than six centuries he
reveled in knowing with difficulty he
restrained himself from showing his
knowledge at every job he was called
on and from calling on bruces far
greater knowledge bruce had trained
himself through years to study to a point
that equalled the learning of any physi-
cist of the old days to him the at-
omic engines were clear and straight-
forward in their action

  the polshins had had years and cen-
turies ago a spy system that had been
thrown over now long since when first

the semi-plehbs the small property own-
ers and near-genius trade intellects had
been suppressed almost immediately after
interplanetarys complete withdrawal
there had been violent crafty rebellion
led by these intelligent ones soon
though they had been killed off had
died out or by intermarriage with the
weaklings both in mind and spirit the
last revolutionary tendencies had been
stamped out the far-reaching spy sys-
tem of those days had died out with it
gradually the televiso-system fell into
decay and failed utterly the telephone
system was simpler needed less intel-
ligence for its operation and was main-
tained because the polshins needed rapid
communication at times of emergencies
the masters were connected by tele-
phone system but that had at first been
watched with the greatest care lest it
be used for plotting finally even this
had stopped

  now in  there was no check on
the plehbs because there seemed to be
no need for it the plehbs had no unifi-
cation whatever no common leaders save
the polshins

  but unnoted by the polshins intel-
ligence had risen again the dampness
of stupidity had dried out of the powder
-and bruce was the fulminate cap that
would set it off omallin had pounded
the cap already the trains of fire were
streaking out through the loose mass of
highly intelligent and explosive men all
they needed was to be shown what
could be-and they would demand it

  in a month bruce and jon and a
dozen other master mechanicians had
restored the great power station in the
mahtan section of the city the long de-
serted part that part furthest from the
inhabited portion there were lights there
now the great atomic burners supplying
plentiful power and-the elevators had
been restored to operation the moving
walks moved again there were goods in


amazing stories

the show-windows goods manufactured
in the hidden plants in that deserted
section by the skilled plehbs who had
been converted to the movement

p he mahtan section lived and
breathed with a surface semblance
of the old life the televiso system was
in full operation here and century-old
reels of televiso-plays stored in the
magnetism of thin steel ribbons were
again in action the theatres were lighted
and showing scenes of the old days

  these educated the people to the old
life far more quickly than the finest of
orators could have educated them ed-
ucational reels showed the whole solar
system how it was made up and how
it worked news reels showed the
mighty jungles of venus the blazing
smoking rocks of mercury the yellow-
red deserts of mars and their gleaming
cities they saw the ultra-powerful
squat men of jupiter and the lean tall
tanned men of mars the mighty glac-
iers of athenas frozen airs and her
broad rivers of liquid helium flowed
again across terrestrial screens

  they rode again in the early rockets
then in the mightiest of the great space-
liners of seven centuries before

 and don wade spoke don had
trained himself with the aid of the old
books and with the patient deadly pre-
cision of a man whos life is directed to
one end the destruction of a hated sys-
tem normally when he spoke now his
voice held only that cold deadliness but
when he spoke to his audiences it was
rich and strong it told the men what
they could be blues and greens were
admitted but as yet no greys for don
wade had one important message to
give and no grey would have been intel-
ligent enough to obey

  do not let any polshin for whatever
reason even gain suspicion that in the

slightest degree your ideas have been
changed

  there was everything to win those
plehbs seeing the city alive the walks
moving freely once more the televiso
news working admitted freely now to
the half-dozen libraries that had been
found did change but they were
chosen plehbs too not over a thou
sand at any time were allowed to enter
the deserted passages there must be
no sudden decrease in the population of
the inhabited section-

  and other side-separated routes were
found for entering the deserted section
there were a score or more plehbs who
had permanently left the old section and
lived now as guards and watchmen at
the entrances to the new televiso sys
tems kept them connected with bruces
headquarters

  bruce had established himself he
was one of those who no longer lived
in the old section but on one of the
lowest levels of the mahtan section
deep down here two levels below the
power plant was the interplanetary re-
search laboratory when interplanetary
had maintained its offices on earth these
laboratories had been the finest research
organizations on the planet they had
been used for research in physics
in chemistry and biology and for human
research for testing applicants for em-
migration when interplanetary had left
that laboratory had been simply closed
down the polshins had not been inter-
ested in research-and they could have
found no adequate scientists to populate
it had they been so inclined

bruce found it and bruce repop-
ulated it from the master kem
class he drew chemists from the mas-
ter meks he drew mechanicians and
electricians from the master bios he
drew his biologists then he set them
all nearly fifty of the most intelligent
the contest of the planets



plehbs the most intelligent terrestrians
working on the books and records he
found here the more advanced books in
physics he read himself the last records
the reports and scientific publications
that had been printed on mars and
jupiter

  for there is one problem that will
when solved give us the things we need
-real power

  remember this the old revolutions
were always stamped out by two meth-
ods  shutting off the air flow and pump-
ing in heat till the plehbs nearly suf-
focated they had to stop all those
controls are still in the hands of the
polshins at the surface they still know
how to use them ill bet then they
turned off all the power so that dark-
ness and utter lack of energy forced
submission and the deliverance of the
leaders to them

  our first necessity is independent
power we cant possibly build new
atomic burners remember the infuse
lining f the burners and of the stop
plates is a substance we cannot make
here we must have the jovian ele-
ments we must seek a new answer to
the old problem of power chemical fuels
simply wont do accumulators marvel-
ous as they are arent enough

  besides we must have a greater
power than the polshins and they have
the atomic cruisers don the atom con-
tains the secret that was the one prob-
lem that was not fully solved in the old
days i think i have a chance where
thev failed because i have learned not

 j	

at the time but centuries later and i
have gotten a perspective that they did
not have i have learned across all the
centuries toward the end of the old
days they were treating the atom more
and more as a particle but several cen-
turies before that they had considered it
more as a series of waves

  the treatment of the atom as a
particle however brought them the
energy of the atom while the treatment
as a wave brought them nothing what-
ever

  the treament as a particle brought
them a particle of the energy think of
it this way a thousand tons of water
is a mile above you you can extract
the potential energy of that water as it
falls by treating it as a mass but if
you treat it as an enormous number
of atoms and take out its atomic en-
ergy you get infinitely more energy

  the break-up of an atom in the
burners yields electrical energy as
charges the burners simply break up
the atom the way a man might take
apart the plates of an accumulator and
discharge each plate separately in the
burner the atom is exploded in a tre-
mendous magnetic field the protons and
electrons which composed the atom are
hurled apart and scattered like the frag-
ments of a bursting shell before that
energy can become available as elec-
tricity the particles must be separated
into two types the positive protons go-
ing one place and the negative electrons
another the magnetic field does this
it directs the protons one way because
they are moving positive charges and
the electrons the other because they are
moving negative charges the two
streams move in opposite directions
around the center of the magnetic field
and strike the infuse collector plates
they build up a charge on these plates
that tends to repel the incoming particles
the charge reaches about a million volts
and then stays there for at that voltage
the repulsion is so great that the in-
coming protons or electrons are almost
stopped before striking if we draw off
power the voltage falls to just such an
extent as will allow such a number of
protons and electrons to strike as will
maintain the charge


amazing stories

  out-the protons and electrons

  - cant be stopped in practice but
actually strike with about twenty thou-
sand volts velocity that means that
the kinetic impact will heat the infuse
plates thats why the infuse plates
are made hollow and the mercury is cir
culated through them the mercury
cools them and helps stop the protons
and electrons

  here on earth of course we use
water-cooling and just waste the heat-
energy its so cheap anyway we dont
have to worry about that but in a space
ship that heat has to be taken care of
heat is very hard to get rid of and
while the process is  efficient
twenty per cent of one hundred million
horespower is twenty million- a space
ship one of the big liners may easily
use two hundred million horsepower in
pulling free of jupiter that means a
constant heat energy of forty million
horse therefore on space ships to
cool them they carry mercury cooling
use the mercury vapour so created to
run turbines and cool and recondense
the mercury vapor in water turbine
boilers

  that system of atomicrelectricity-
mercury turbines-water turbine will
take care of the normal constant produce
tion of heat energy by converting it
to electrical energy they can use and
thus get rid of it for the short period
of two hundred million horsepower used
in leaving a planet they used heat-res-
ervoirs tanks of liquid hydrogen the
substance which holds the most heat
weight for weight then they could get
rid of the heat slowly as it was how-
ever even the atomic cruisers had to
stop at the jovian satellites to cool off
between jumps in space only radiation
will carry away the heat you see and
radiation at any normal temperature
isnt very rapid

  now the atomic eruisers for battle

were normally in a pretty bad way if
the thing went on very long because
theyd overheat atomic power engines
would permit of about two billion horse-
power in a moderate sized battle cruiser
-but if they ever tried to use that
theyd have four hundred million horse-
power of heat to get rid of

  that doesnt satisfy me at all in
the first place you are just using the
potential energy of the water falling
down hill i want to find a way to use
all the energy of the atom destroy even
the remnants so that i dont have even
a hydrogen gas exhaust as the atomic
engines do i think i can see some way
toward doing it thats the goal i am
heading toward now

  what progress asked don

  whoa-not so fast i havent even
set up the apparatus yet lora wayne is
helping with it shes a bright girl
you go back to your work-and i to
mine remember even when we have
this whole city ready we will still have
to wait till we can convert the others
around us

chapter v

ruce smiled up in triumph to
lora- that proves it i think
doesnt it

   it certainly looks to me like the an-
swer bruce she replied her eyes glow-
ing with excitement can you try it out
someway practically what will it do-
can you limit its action

  im sure i can those old mathe-
maticians were right when they made
their calculations but wrong when they
passed on unheeding i think this is
infinitely more important than anything
else we have done the old days had
anti-gravity and we have it again he
nodded toward a large metal ball float-
ing unsupported in the air a small string
holding it down and against its tend-
the contest of the planets



ency to be thrown because of earths
centrifugal force now we have anti-
reaction you might say

  those waves of force though must
act against something objected lora
when i made the apparatus for you i
didnt see what that was going to react
against

  they dont react against something
they react against everything they are
of such incomprehensible fineness that
they slip through what we call matter
and space and react against the stuff
out of which our curved space is cut
they pull on all space they push the
earth and the sun on jupiter mars
and the magellenic clouds equally

  practically--they mean a ship with-
out the tell-tale streams of atomic fire
pushing it along atomic rockets are
visible these momentum waves arent

  it seems strange that the wave theory
of atoms should lead to a means of gen-
erating momentum directly in space

  any correct theory of the atom must
delve far deeper than surface manifes-
tation of force we know as matter it
must take into account the real nature
of space atoms arent things--theyre
symptoms of space we detect magnetic
fields by their action on steel or on an
electric particle we detect space by the
existence of atoms-but atoms are
merely symptoms of space as the move-
ment of the compass needle is a symp-
tom the wave theory asserts remem-
ber that every electron every proton
every tiniest particle is actually a series
of complex waves spread through all
infinite space over all space these
waves cancel out the trough of one
wave-system coming on the crest of
another wave-set of that same electron
except in only that tiny bit of space
where we can detect its effects where
the waves are not visible and we say
the electron or proton is

  that involves space if it described

the property of space known as atoms
correctly then it should describe that
property of space known as momentum
and kinetic energy correctly through
perfectly logical derivation on the
mathematics of the wave-atom you can
derive this formula of momentum and
this kinetic energy

nphey seemed to me the simplest

  jl means of proving or disproving
the theory though worked out nearly
fourteen hundred years ago way back
in the twentieth century they were never
tested if a theory is good it will pre-
dict and its predictions come true here
is a prediction that has come true by
these momentum waves we can drive a
ship silently invisibly and almost in-
detectably we are one step toward the
defeat of the polshins

  are you going to make a ship now
asked lora eagerly

  not yet we have not enough men in
our movement yet remember we
must have workers enough to operate
the deserted machines here to make the
vast number of things we will need
only one hundred of us are living here
permanently and nearly a third of that
number must spend the major portion
of its time in services making food on
the machines and clothing and other
necessities another portion must spend
some time on the generators and other
apparatus scarcely a score of us is en-
gaged in advance work

  besides-i have another thing i
want to work out it may be even more
important

  what bruce

  bruce turned to his laboratory assis-
tant with a smile these members of
the new movement were not clad in blue
or green they wore costumes of pure
white trimmed with whatever color they
fancied-save only scarlet that was
dons idea the scarlet would merely
amazing stories

have broken the law it would not have
been a choice

  lora was dressed in the white cos-
tume trimmed with gold as was bruce
her jet-black hair and dark eyes made a
striking contrast to it a contrast she
hoped that some day bruce would notice

  but bruce turned to his laboratory as-
sistant with a smile the solution to
another problem the men of the old
days never solved television without
a sending device

  but didnt they say in the  days
that that was impossible

  they did but they also said before
it had been done that making a ma-
chine that would fly was impossible and
thgt making a ship to cross space was
impossible and finally that overcoming
gravity was impossible but they didnt
after it had been done

  the trouble is that you have to pick
up some form of energy coming from
the scene in question before you can
view it light wont do because bodies
in between will stop it no wave will
do that is short enough to be effective
in delineating the object- radio wave
will penetrate but they are so long that
they will also penetrate the body to be
viewed-

  then havent you yourself said it
was impossible

atch i have been working on
tliis while you were making up
that apparatus for me it isnt fully com-
pleted- i will need a better tie-in than
i have now between the two focusing
devices

  bruce walked over to a piece of ap-
paratus he had set up on one of the in-
sulated benches there were two de-
vices about ten feet apart and directly
between them a third this third was
flat-topped some two feet square and
six inches thick one by one bruce
turned them on tubes began to glow

and the recording meters mounted as
the heaters began to throw out their
electrons

  shes hot now watch slowly he
began turning a control dial on one of
his machines abruptly something
snapped softly into existence on the top
of the little flat cubical box carefully
bruce focussed it- a loud speaker be-
gan to chatter tneaninglessly as abruptly
as the cloudiness had appeared it solid
ified and the speaker began to talk in-
telligibly

  three men bent over their work
they were clad in the white of the
freedom party the delicate apparatus
they were working on was taking shape
the scene was scarely twelve inches
high but the coloring the detail the
weave of the cloth even was in such
absolute perfection that lora gasped-
ten-inch-tall men working on inch-long
apparatus their tiny hands functioning
with perfect precision

  what will it he when we get through
jon this looks to me like the old
radio-receiving set circuit do you sup-
pose hes going to start a radio-broad-
cast station again

  i doubt it the polshins might pick
it up that would be bad it is prob-
ably something quite different remem-
ber that rdio-frequency currents were
used for thousands of purposes from
sterilizing foods under super-sonic
waves to aiding medical healing and
causing artificial fevers

  oh bruce its jon and mark and
ted theyre six blocks away through
granite walls

  not all of them lora not all of
them touch one of those images there
timidly lora advanced her hand and
half-frightened touched the image of
jons head her finger passed easily
through it-but there was a slight re-
sistance just the barest feeling of pres-
sure why-theyre sort of solid
the contest of the planets



 they are they are real images
they are part-formed electrons and pro-
tons this device here perfected will
mean more than anything we have ever
dreamed of it will surpass a million-
fold the televiso system of the old
days

 every proton and every electron
exists through all space part of the
protons and electrons that compose jon
exist in this space where we are-and
where the machine is that machine
cancels out part of the electron-wave so
that the rest no longer mutually cancel-
ing become real in our space those
images are one one-hundred-thousandth
real i have condensed them for great-
er solidity the microphone i have just
turned off picks up the tiny voices of
those images and amplifies them so that
we can actually hear them

  so far as i know-the device has no
distance limits

 bruce-you mean we could pick up
even the planets

  we can when weve built the big
apparatus and at that it is to be our
first step because-i can reverse the
process and make myself appear but
there i am limited i cannot appear
further than one thousand miles away
with any practical apparatus and at that
distance i must make myself a ghostly
image fifty feet tall

under bruces direction the ap-
paratus was begun within a week
they who made it did not know why
he installed all the elaborate timing de-
vices the careful clock-work and
bruce appeared only occasionally be-
cause most of the time he left the work
to lora

  week after week passed the appa-
ratus neared completion the freedom
movement spread through all nyak till
more than half the plehbs were enrolled
in it and had seen the city of the old

days that had been gradually built up
in the old mahtan district still the
polshins fat and comfortable in their
assurance of power not imagining such
a movement after centuries of peace
did not feel the growing tension

 the plehbs swung more briskly
through center cube now but still the
polshin guards loitered aimlessly laugh-
ing grinning-and occasionally still a
plehb girl disappeared as she attracted
the attention of one of those guards

  then bruce and don and the leaders
of the movement would have their hands
full suppressing the tendency for an
untimely explosion with a realization
that this was not just the normal
course of events came a new feeling
of rebellion before it had seemed as
inevitable as death now it was not

  silently the freedom scientists were
working bruce was not alone now he
was the director of a competent and
growing force of scientists one man
was studying the problem of insulation
against the shock-rods of the polshins
another that of the problem of hand-
weapons for the plehbs others were aid-
ing bruce in his studies of the atom more
and more bruce was realizing that he
studied not the atom but the properties
of space the gravity-field was one of
his greatest aids the magnetic field sec-
ond yet both of these had to be handled
cautiously-for their effects reached out
to infinity and powerfully to the sur-
face where some polshin might wonder
at them

  three months were needed to con-
struct the timing devices of the great
projector two months more saw the
two focusing machines set up a full
eight months passed all together before
the apparatus was ready for its first
trial all the staff that had worked on
it and many of the elected leaders of
the freedom party were present based


amazing stories

now on the planetary socialistic govr
ernment elected leaders ruled the party
these elected delegates gathered with
the scientists and bruce and don ar-
rived

  briefly to the leaders don wade
described the intended functions of the
machine with it they hoped first of
all to see the other cities of earth to
see whether there too the same system
of polshin and plehb existed then
they hoped to turn their giant eye out
to mars and venus to see what had
happened to the civilization of the
planets

  does it require so huge a machine
for shorter ranges such as looking at
earth-scenes  asked one of the dele-
gates

o bruce replied i can and
will make much smaller replicas
of the important parts of this machine
for that purpose but this machine is
intended for viewing the planets to
make that possible i had to mount an
enormously complex clock-work deviee
to follow the planetary motions for
instance to view a city such as thanton
on callisto i have first to neutralize
earths daily rotational movement than
to neutralize the effects to callistos
daily rotation her orbital rotation around
jupiter and jupiters orbital motion
around the sun all of this requires
an exceedingly complex apparatus and
already now sets similar to the primary
view-apparatus are in machine-produc-
tion we had to cut dies for that and
that is what took so long that and
the development work but the tech-
nicians are now working on a similar
device which will have an illimitable
theoretical range and a practical range
that would permit glimpses of life on
athena however this device will be
but two feet square and three inches
thick for viewing scenes on earth it

will be fully capable of anything we
need

  the big apparatus is ready that
stage there is ten by ten and i will put
on it life-size human images with one
ten thousandth real solidity the subr
jects which are viewed will feel a slight
electrical tensity but absolutely nothing
that will disturb them in the least

  i have adjusted the controls to view
the old city of shkaga this should be
the center ioop cube at the ground
level

  bruce walked to the main controls
and started them this was actually
and really the first time the machine
as a whole had been tested the tubes
warmed a low humming echoed momen-
tarily from the speakers then-ab-
ruptly solidification was complete on
the stage there was a portion of a
building fading off into misty unreality
at the edges of the focus dari rub-
bish lay at its base and on the pavement
there were no people on the stage all
was dark apparently

  bruce rapidly condensed the image
the building shrank and the whole of
the great cube was visible dark and
rubbish-heaped there are no men in
this section it is dark here evidently
the image is lighted by our lights here
in reality it is utterly dark i will shift
the focus the setting blurred seemed
to shimmer and change flashes of solid
rock obscured everything then suddenly
for an instant a flashing human figure
appeared and was gone instantly bruce
changed the setting back

  it was a passage lighted evidently
half a dozen human ures in grey
garb slunk disconsolately down the rocky
corridor at its end was a polshin guard
in the deep orange the polshins of
shkaga wore bruce raced down the cor-
ridor with his settings branched to a
larger one down that and finally reached
a small cube there were more people
the contest of the planets



here plehbs in grey and dark fed and
dark blue the red here was evidently
highest but the men recognized again
th plehb and the polshin

in swift succession bruce brought in
scenes from san franco washton
and a dozen other cities

  then in londn he found again the
polshin and the plehb in berlin and
ifi paris in tokyo and peiping in
every major city only three cities he
tried showed fio human life deserted
and utterly dead barcelona munich
arid lyons

  show us what the polshins are do-
ing above us called  delegate

  bruce smiled grimly don steel had
prepared for this request not for
nothing had he studied mass psychology
and he had searched for many minutes
on bruces original model of the machine
before finding the scene he knew would
most quickly and effectively rouse the
people suddenly the stage was a gar-
den a magnificent garden of flowers and
shrubs it was night but soft lights
made a dirft illumination in the garden
were scarcely a dozen figures two
young polshin men an older polshin
and three plehb girls in a group the
older polshin was bleeding freely from
five long gashes across his fat cheek
otie of the plehb girls was bound to a
pair of young stout trees the polshin
had a heavy whip and was beating at
her body with all his fat strength her
whole raiment was coldred by criss-
cross streaks of blood she hung loose
in her bounds perking feebly to each
stroke of the whip low moans came
from the speaker and soft cries from
the two other plehb girls held by the
two younger men watching the scene

  abruptly bruce cut the dials sharply
across a rumbling roar sounded from
the speaker a there were flashed on the
stage masses of tumbled jagged rock

green trees and solid mountain an
angry cry mounting up from the audi-
ence drowned out the sound as the scene
was established at last in a swaying
forest of piiies a ruined bridge flung
its broken members across a quiet
stream

  i think that will be enough of that
bruce decided harshly i did not pick
up the polshins at first because i feared
some such scene we did not have to
see in order to know we have heard
all this i think it would be best if we
used now the more complex features
and viewed mars that is the great
problem really have the planets suf-
fered a like fate has their civilization
fallen so far as has ours remember
we never did have anything but a
straight democratic government with no
proper controls mars started differ-
ently perhaps they have not falien
quite so low

  carefully he was setting his apparatus
now with the aid of two other trained
mathematicians one in training now to
be an astronomer

  the clockwork began to hum softly
theh was silenced to a barely audible
purr as it got into action

  i think we are ready we should
be within five thousand miles of the
planet you see--we do not know the
exact time we are not absolutely certain
even that we know the exact day the
old calendar was known to have defects
and we may be wrong however-

  the lights had been turned off in the
main part of the room now and only
some very carefully designed reflectors
lighted the scene abruptly-on the
stage appeared a floating ball some five
feet in diameter just within the limits
of the machines observation was an-
other ball a tiny ball scarcely larger than
a golf ball jagged and ruggedly shad-
owed in the light of the spotlight flood-
ing it the larger ball was edged with


amazing stories

a thin shining belt of light bright in
the powerful spotlight

ars said bruce and even in
the old days they had nothing
to equal that we will win out i am
sure

  the planet expanded swiftly the tiny
satellite became hazy ghostly and van-
ished at the edge of the scene tiny
spots appeared on the very slowly turn-
ing globe spots of black and glowing
light those are lights on mars
bruce said his voice tense lights shine
as lights even in this device the
surface came nearer toward one of
those shining clumps of light it grew
and as it grew the rotation of mars
became evident the scene was turning
past them bruce centered it again and
engaged another piece of clockwork
the scene steadied - and expanded
abruptly

  they were hanging it seemed some
ten thousand feet above the city it was
a great city of black and gold and silver
and colors the buildings towered slim
and graceful ships flew through the air
around them and into them only here
there was no perspective bruce altered
the setting and the whole city in min-
iature was on the stage now the ships
flew across the stage and tiny crawling
dots moved in streams below

  abruptly there appeared a section per-
haps two blocks square only half the
buildings were visible the upper halves
soaring off into the upper air people
thousands of gaily dressed people it
seemed flowed along on the moving
ways they were smiling laughing
happy a scene such as no plehb had
ever seen brisk clear sounds came
through the speaker the sounds of
voices mingled faintly the hum and rush
of vast business

  civilization didnt fall there gasped
don they have all the civilization

they ever had they must have ships
space ships-

  bruce twisted the settings until the
scene on the stage shrunk and grew
tiny the buildings reappeared dimin-
ished the city became small and the curve
of the planet showed itself again the
ships sailing about the city seemed con-
centrated near a great open square
bruce re-expanded the scene entering
on this view the square was huge so
great that the great ships even seemed
small it was fully three miles on a
side the city actually built around it
and as they watched they saw some-
thing dart into being on the screen a
huge something that settled on the field
and occupied a space half a mile long
a titanic space freighter

  a space ship bruce exclaimed
why do they never come here if they
have them lets look at callisto-
venus-

  the stage grew blank with the night
of space in seconds the giant of the
solar system appeared mighty jupiter
a six-foot ball with smaller balls mov-
ing slowly about him planetary in size
themselves callisto-it separated cen-
tered on the stage then abruptly clicked
into immobility as the clockwork was
thrown in in moments bruce had lo-
cated thantor

  thantor was a mass of moving happy
people small transplanetary ships
moved about slightly larger inter-moon
ships and gigantic interplanetary ships
circled and moved freely

venus-more ships moving freely
space seemed full of them only
on the moon and earth were there no
great space ships

  why asked every man of himself
why is earth alone deserted thus  why
was earth left to a savage feudal sys-
tem in an ultra-machine age

  muttering stupefied men left the hall

back to their jobs and to the men who
had sent them back to tell of other
earth-cities under the crushing rule of
the polshins back to tell of plehb girls
bound and beaten to death by heavy
whips in gardens of beautiful flowers
and tinkling fountains of hundreds of
millions of happy people on the other
planets happy people from mercury to
far out athena and misery and terror
and hate only on earth no brutal pol-
shins taking plehbs as mere animals liv-
ing solely for their amusement save on
earth

and in the hall furious work was
going forward nearly twenty of
the electron-wave visors were set up
within three days the stamped parts com-
ing out in a steady stream now the
force of permanent dwellers in mahtan
increased now to nearly two hundred and
fifty even the polshins beginning to
notice a slight difference in the city
were working at furious speed smaller
simpler clock-dri ves worked nine of
these wave-visors nine of these ma-
chines were in constant operation ob-
serving on the nine planets ahd the
great machine was examining the satel-
lite worlds which it alone could follow
recording cameras took down every-
thing seen

  the other machines operated con-

  stantly day and night were observing
  things on earth five of them observed
  in nyak the other six were trained
  on shkaga san franco washton
  felfya st loui

  swiftly now the campaign with the
city was gaining and now new dies
were being cut dies to make the pro-
jection apparatus bruce had mentioned
in every city men were being chosen
without their even being aware of the
examinations for the local leaders

  bosn felfya shkaga and washton
would be the cities where the first starts
would be made these cities were within
the possible range of bruces projector
here he would be able to reach out and
speak to the men the personnel which
directors chose

  and bruce worked constantly at his
other problems still he had merely be-
gun they had communication-but not
material communication time ahd time
again he had tried to make the appara-
tus transmit the entire piece of matter
it viewed time and time again-on the
tiniest particles-he had failed- when he
reached the half-transmitted point in-
stantaneously some terrific force seemed
to wrench all space with unutterable
violence terrific flaming arcs played
momentarily over his apparatus-and it
fused in ruins

  so bruce worked on something else

the jvorld zaflame

by isaac r nathanson

in this story  r nathanson delves into the world of the atom in which
such marvelous potentialities are locked up which we may hope for man
to eventually set free and utilize it gives a strange picture of natural
forces exceeding mans control and making one almost afraid of the future

chapter i

deep silence reigned in the
lecture hall the listeners
sat with wrapt attention
drinking in every word
that fell from the speak-
ers lips professor samuel mendoza
admired and revered by the entire stu-
dent body was an inspired lecturer

         indee the professor was
saying in his concluding remarks it is
almost impossible for the human mind
to conceive of the vast energies residing
within that microcosm we call the atom
from what other source come the prodi-
gal radiations of sun and stars think
of it within one pound of ordinary
prosaic matter if annihilated there is
enough energy to raise  tons
of water from freezing to boiling tem-
perature 

  when the day comes that we can
hitch on to the mighty energies locked
away within the body of the atom a
truly new age of man will be ushered
in all the past achievements of the
human race will be as nothing the fire
of prometheus a mere plaything in com-
parison even flight to other worlds in
space-greatest miracle perhaps of all-
may then follow as the inevitable devel-
opment what this alone would mean
in revolutionizing life no one in our
generation can even begin to visualize

  here the professor lapsed into a
dramatic pause his dark eyes aglow
with the fire of the prophet his tousled
iron-gray hair brushed back from a
massive forehead accentuated the spiri-
tual expression of a face which was
more that of a poet or musician than of
a hard-thinking mathematically exact
scientist his gaze shifted from one to
the other of his listeners rested on the
lean handsome almost ascetic face of
young james tomlinson

  and the conquest of the internal
energy of the atom the professor then
continued is not as far off as many
think of this as you have seen it has
been my happy privilege to present
some measure of proof

  but-pointing a long finger as his
listeners as if sounding an ominous
warning-with the coming of this all-
powerful jinni of science comes also
unequalled responsibility responsibility
most solemn and tremendous upon those
charged with the proper use of this
illimitable force entrusted to mans care
these intra-atomic energies are too vast
and fundamental to be ill used or trifled
with with such power in his hands a
time may well come perhaps not so
very far off when the very life of the
race-the stability of the planet itself-
may depend on how mankind chooses to
make use of such a priceless gift

  in all earnestness i close with these


                      xmm

an indescribable electric tension filled the air a sputtering crackling roar
assailed their ears tingled every nerve and cell of their bodies


amazing stories

solemn words uttered from the bottom
of my heart man will either rise to
the heights of the gods or if he does
not take care he may just as gasily de-
stroy himself

hphe lecturer had finished the post-
graduate students filed slowly out of
the room strangely silent as if still un-
der the speakers spell he always had
that uncanny effect upon all who listened
to him he breathed life and drama even
into the most abstract and technical of
subjects

  james tomlinson brilliant pupil and
great favorite with professor mendoza
as well as his tireless assistant waited
patiently while the professor evidently
still under the momentum of his lecture
slowly and absent-mindedly collected his
papers

  ah yes jim have you finished
with those equations

  last night sir theyre in my room
checked them over most carefully
better go get them and meet me in
the laboratory in half an hour

  jim left the building crossed the
spacious grass-covered campus sweet-
smelling after a recent rain and hur-
ried toward his quarters all the way
his thoughts eager and aflame were
full of the prodigious experiments on
which the professor was embarked he
could scarcely believe that he jim tom-
linson obscure and unknown should
have been so signally honored as to have
been chosen by the great mendoza to
assist him in his profound researches

  the substance of the lecture he had
just heard kept running over and over
in his mind particularly the concluding
remarks uttered with such solemn and
passionate earnestness was there a hid-
den meaning more than his mere words
had indicated which had passed over
the listeners heads surely there could
be no serious physical threat in their

latest experiments which they were
pushing through with such fanatical
zeal the chief himself didnt think
there was-with proper precautions
but as he often remarked when you
step out into the cold realm of the un-
known strange things are possible
no professor mendoza must have re-
ferred to the improper nay inhumani-
tarian destructive even senseless uses
to which the greatest of scientific dis-
coveries are often put by the world at
large perhaps in many ways it might
prove only too true that in the not far
distant future the very life of the race
would depend upon how it chose to
mlake use of the new forces released by
science could it be true that man was
toying with the lightning that would
destroy him in the end

chapter ii

when jim entered the great
laboratory the chief was
already hard at work despite
his sixty-seven years the scientist was
remarkably youthful in appearance and
might have been taken easily for no
more than fifty the fire in his eyes the
energy of his hand and brain seemed to
have lost none of the vigor of youth
though jim himself was a glutton for
work he often marveled at the older
mans tireless energy

  the professor nodded to jim without
looking up the younger man imme-
diately donned his laboratory smock and
was soon also absorbed in the elaborate
experiments on which they had been
working the last two years daily often
far into the late hours of the night they
had thus driven ahead figuring testing
experimenting studying more than
once they had seemed close on the trail
of their quarry yet somehow it always
eluded them with the characteristic
patience of true scientists they were not
the world aflame



the least bit discouraged rather im-
portant results only drove them on all
the harder

  the hours on that particular after-
noon came and went in their eal both
forgot their evening meal the long
summers day turned to twilight became
dark outside still they worked on with
intense concentration exchanging only
the necessary words

  though both knew that the special
experiment on which they were just
then engaged was far advanced toward
possible success neither of them
dreamed that during the later hours of
th same night they would so suddenly
and with such dramatic fierceness suc-
ceed in unshackling the chains of the
awful jinni of atomic energy still less
could they dream of the ultimate con-
sequence of that particular nights work
to the whole earth to everything that
lived and ran and cradled or swam or
grew on it or flew over it

  the laboratory itself was one of the
best certainly the most thoroughly
equipfted in the world its upkeep es-
pecially the enormous expense incident
to the elaborate and profound researches
and experiments was not infrequently
objected to by some of those in control
of the university funds but was more
or less grudgingly acquiesced in due to
the quiet insistence of the master phy-
sicist and the influence of some of his
able colleagues in and out of the uni-
versity

  the main portion of the entire labora-
tory wing was set aside for the ex-
clusive use of the great mendoza this
was specially equipped and very few
had access to it without his special per-
mission there surrounded by a maze
of extraordinary apparatus the scientist
was to be found at almost all hours of
the day or night most prominent in
the center of the huge laboratory was
the multiple battery of forty gargantuan

xray tubes built at an enormous cost
these were arranged in a near circle a
large peculiarly designed mechanism of
shining petal was spaced between dvery
ten tubes dividing the battery into four
main divisions the whole linked to-
gether end to end could be operated as
one mighty unit-the wonder of the
scientific world all around was an im-
posing array of mechanical and electro-
magnetic apparatus mostly of a kind
and design altogether new to the eves of
an ordinary engineer or laboratory
worker huge generators were hum-
ming their song of power another
special feature immediately arresting
the eye were the two -foot spheres
of highly polished metal which served
as the negative and positive terminals
of an enormous electrical field the
highly charged apparatus gave to the
air of the room a sharp tang of ozone
now and then would come a forked
flash of dazzling intensity followed by
a loud crackling explosion that shook
the walls of the building

 so far so good prof mendoza
spoke in a slow quiet voice now
we are ready to concentrate the entire
force of our voltage on that piece of
beryllium i believe we have reached a
point in our experiments where there
should be no hit or miss when we step
up that stream of speeding protons we
should score at least twenty per cent
hits enough to split the beryllium nu-
cleuses wide open-but well have to be
careful

  shall i turn on the power jim en-
quired in an equally calm tone al
though his heart was pounding it was
to be the crucial test

 yes increase slowly when the
beryllium atoms begin to kick out neu
trons heavily well turn on full force
and see what happens

  isnt that-the younger man moist

tened his lips and hesitated-rather
risky might burn out something with-
out stronger insulating shields

  perhaps but this field has already
speeded up before to near  million
volts with no bad results another hun-
dred million or so should not get out of
hand besides we cant get any more
money right now for a more powerful
set of insulators so guess well just
have to take a little chance and go
ahead nothing ventured nothing
gained you know but stop quickly
when i call out are you ready

  jim nodded and pushed the main
switch part way gradually increased the
power

  the bombardment of the beryllium
metal got under way with a powerful
stream of protons produced from ion-
ized hydrogen the extreme power of
the plant at their disposal was capable
of  million volts but that was only
a beginning for this mighty power
could be gradually stepped up to an
even vastly greater voltage by means of
the tremendous circular electro-magnetic
field which could accelerate the shoot-
ing protons to hundreds of millions of
volts-a power never before dreamed
of in laboratory science as the enor-
mous voltage increased speeding the
bombarding particles at ever greater
velocities the electrostatic charges of
the atomic nucleuses which ordinarily
repel the oncoming protons began to
break down completely permitting an
ever deeper penetration of the nuclear
hearts with more frequent collisions
aiding mightily in the new process of
atomic annihilation as devised by pro-
fessor mendoza was a piercing concen-
tration of super-gamma rays of cosmic
ray intensity further and further went
the switch  ten million volts the
mighty x-ray tubes glowed fiercely with
their surcharge of power from the
rest of the complicated apparatus came

  a humming and vibrating and crack-
ling

  now lets try full power the pro-
fessor commanded

  jim shoved the main switch to the
limit    twenty million volts  

million

they held their breath it was the
first time they ever dared the full
load an indescribable electric tension
filled the air a spluttering crackling
roar assailed their ears tingled every
nerve and cell of their bodies under
the concentrated bombardment of the
terrifically speeding protons magnetic-
ally controlled and guided to effect the
maximum number of nuclear hits com-
bined with the intense flood of piercing
super-gamma rays the beryllium plate
began to radiate with intense brilliancy
and as the process of accelerating the
bombarding protons by means of the
circular electro-magnetic field continued
the voltages climbed to fantastic heights
    million volts the temperature
at the focal point recorded the unimag-
inable intensity of  degrees
centigrade comparable only to that
which obtains in the interior of the
stars no such artificial heat had ever
been thought possible as if in pro-
test the specially designed thermometer
suddenly exploded in a cloud of gas

professor mendoza slammed shut the
anti-radiation screen of the insulated in-
closure from behind whose thick quartz
windows they were taking observations
and well for them that he did so for
just then something let go with an aw-
ful explosive roaring like that of es-
caping steam under a tremendous head
the brilliantly incandescent beryllium
suddenly turned to a strange bluish-
white radiation of such dazzling inten-
sity as to all but overpower the senses
so overwhelmingly fierce became the
light rays which pierced every nook and
the world aflame



cranny of the laboratory it was im-
possible to open the eyes for more than
a moment even when they turned their
backs to the source at the same time
despite the protecting screen the sear-
ing rays became unbearable

  quick turn off the power the pro-
fessor yelled

  almost at the same instant young
tomlinson threw back the main power
switch to their fright as well as
amazement the overpowering rays and
heat and the deafening roaring con-
tinued unabated the power apparently
would not turn off

  somethings gone wrong the switch
wont work the younger man gasped

  the older man turned swiftly to the
control panel shading his eyes with his
hands to see its in working order
all right quick lets disconnect the
cable

  they worked frenziedly to discon-
nect the power but that did no good
either a suffocating rush of gas and
deadly heat rays penetrated their shel-
ter the two were forced to flee for
their lives in the corridor outside they
halted momentarily shaken and unde-
cided what to do they were sure the
power had been turned off but that
would not put a halt to the thing which
they had started the laws of nature
refused to work as expected it was
mystifying and it was at the same time
terrifying

  the building shook and trembled so
that instinctively the two ran outside
upon looking back at the huge wing
which housed the laboratory they were
horrified to see a burst of white hot
flames shooting from every window in
a thrice the whole wing was enveloped
in fire and smoke the flames spread
rapidly to the rest of the immense build-
ing forcing them to retreat to a safe
distance

  while they were standing bewildered

  so suddenly had it all happened some-
body turned in an alarm in no time
came the loud siren of the speeding fire-
fighters a huge crowd gathered
people flocked from all directions ham-
pering the work of the fire department
as the fire grew rapidly worse a gen-
eral alarm brought almost every piece
of apparatus in the city to the scene
the immense phjsics building was soon
an inferno of flames even threatening
the other buildings while high above
the crackling flames the falling walls
the shouts and other noises the two
scientists could hear the terrific roaring
of the disintegrating beryllium whose
blinding and searing radiations made a
near approach to the burning building
very dangerous

  in a short time the building was in
complete ruins the fire-fighters bent
all their efforts toward keeping the in-
tense flames from spreading to the other
buildings on the campus eighty
streams of water from many lines of hose
thrown with great force from the high-
pressure mains with which the city was
provided seemed of no avail the water
turned to steam almost as ast as it fell
on the burning building and from the
costly laboratory continued the same ter-
rific hissing and roaring the same blind-
ing and searing heat undiminished and
unquenchable

  outside among the milling and ex-
cited spectators the two scientists pale
and temporarily unnerved turned to ex-
change significant glances they were
almost like two frightened children who
had been playing with fire and gotten
badly burned

  jim the older man spoke up finally
regaining his usual composure we have
at last unchained our jinni of atomic
energy

  well thats what we have all along
tried to do isnt it the younger man
answered with a wry smile

all that night and throughout the
next day and the nights and
 days which followed the roaring
and flaming of the disintegrating ele-
ment continued with no apparent dimin-
ution in its intensity to those that came
and beheld the spectacle it was fascin-
ating and was somehow frightening it
was a sort of intensified version of
moses burning bush

  somebody oughter put a stop to those
cfay scientists and their fool experi-
ments one overawed onlooker remarked
to those standing near him some day
theyll blow up the damned town

  i dont see the good of any more in
ventions another all-knowing being de-
livered himself to a group of listeners
too much machinery and unemployment
as it is if it was up to me id pass a
law prohibiting any more newfangled
inventions until everybody had a job
mark you men if hew things keep
cropping up as fast as theyve done
machinery will be doing all the work and
everybodyll be thrown out of a job
you cant put the blame on those
fellows for that countered a listener
under the right industrial system the
work of inventors and such will only
create more wealth for everybody
industrial system hell whats that
got to do with furnishing those nutty
professors with oodles of dough so they
can putter around with expensive dew-
dags while thousands are starving right
now

  while this impromptu forum was
gathering heat one of those nutty pro-
fessors was standing not far away
wringing his hands at the sight of his
expensive dew-dags which had taken
so many years to develop undergoing
irretrievable destruction a woebegone
expression was on his ple face at his
side also sad and forlorn stood his

worshiping assistant now and then cast-
ing a side-long glance of mingled sym-
pathy and anxiety at the older man

  well have to do something and
quick came from professor mendota
almost in a groan im worried over
the possibilities his teeth were chat-
tering as if with cold

 you mean-

  well you know the disintegration
of that beryllium-might communicate
itself to other elements unless neutral-
ized look pointing to several small
molten streams brilliantly incandescent
that were flowing out of the ruifted
building fortunately that piece of
beryllium i small and may perhaps
radiate all its substance before anything
happens to the intra-atomic structure of
other matter

  and if it does infect-

  the professor shrugged his shoul-
ders come weve got to do something
no time to lose he was now himself
again

  at his urgent request after voicing
a possible danger the university heads
in cooperation with the city and county
authorities aided the scientist in assem-
bling the necessary powerful electro-
magnetic and other equipment which he
called for it took ten days of stubborn
fighting on the part of professor men-
doza and jim tomlinson aided by a
corps of technicians before they suc-
ceeded by means of a reverse process
in so retarding the fierce rate of atomic
radiation which was annihilating the
beryllium as to finally bring it under
control

ell thats that the professor
sighed with huge relief the
next thing is an effective means of con-
trolling this jinni and of making it work
for us whether it comes from beryllium
or any other element

  but the mighty jinni of atomic energy
the world aflame



were not so dodle as to be conquered

thus easily by mans genius it is al-
ways easier to let loose or distroy than
to synthesize and create

  the repercussions of his momentous
discovery was not to end here it was
but the first of a chain of events of
which professor mendoza was the in-
nocent and nobly-intentioned initiator
that was destined to end in such an all
consuming catastrophe for the whole
earth the scientific genius which should
and could be used for the glory and
achievement of a greater humanity and
a finer civilization is often as not
garbled and misused and misdirected by
others for personal or selfish aims to
the detriment nay tragedy of countless
numbers

  on the morrow after professor men-
doza had succeeded in subduing and
finally nullifying the atomic outburst
which had so amazingly kept up its fierce
radiation long after the building itself
had been reduced to a shapeless mass of
steel and masonry he was called into
conference by the dignified president
of the great university

  to understand more clearly the tor-
tuous psychological twistings which op-
erating within the narrow confines of
some human skulls have so often pro-
duced such mournful results we must
digress slightly on the character of the
head of the university

  dr quentin ixrman the somewhat
past middle-age president had entered
into his duties as the head of the great
institution of learning about a year prior
to the disastrous fire earlier described
if a signally imposing appearance fine
carriage and grace of manner is any
indication of inner abilities let alone
character then indeed the board of di-
rectors had made a fine choice unfor-
tunately however exterior appearances
do not always tell what lies inside a
mans head still less his heart

  as a university president dr lor-
man undoubtedly was a far better poli-
tician that is he had a far keener eye
to politics behind adequate finance and
on which side the universitys bread not
to mention his own was buttered than
matters pertaining to mere learning he
was therefore extremely careful of any-
thing in the way of deeds or even mere
unconventional utterances anywhere
within the realm of the institution under
his jurisdiction whether by student or
teacher that might offend the delicate
sensibilities and still more delicate pock-
etbooks of the influential donors and
keepers of the school certain it is there
had been a rumor among those who pro-
fessed to be in the know that the dig-
nified dr lorman owed his high posi-
tion to an extent few appreciated to his
well-connected political association rather
than to his profound educational or
other abilities

te that as it may the good dr lor-
man was thoroughly dismayed and
quite put out by the recent disastrous
fire which had wrecked the newest and
finest building on the campus and came
uncomfortably close to destroying some
others at the same time to say the
least he was quite annoyed at the dis-
tinguished physicist who had been the
careless if unwitting and unhappy cause
of the disaster more than once before
since taking office it had occurred to
him and now came to him with even
greater certainty that the physicist
granting his great distinction had all
along been allowed too much altogether
too much of the lately restricted uni-
versity funds for those never-ending and
costly experiments of his could there
be any doubt of it now the school
needed a new gymnasium for one thing
much more there was a crying need
voiced by a large and vociferous major-
ity for a new and larger stadium after


amazing stories

all he had his obligations to the student
body not to mention the alumni be
sides he doubted if the professor con-
sidering his age could accomplish much
more anyway and even allowing for the
utmost charitable view what did the
professional work of one man mean
alongside the larger needs of the school
as a whole and since he had for a long
time intended to cut down the pro-
fessors huge laboratory appropriations
right now was as good a time as any
without arousing too much antagonism
on the part of those more scientifically
minded

  furthermore-and this was of prime
importance despite the mans renown-
he did not like to put it mildly the
professors entirely too open and critical
views on such public matters as religion
politics industry and society in general
views radically at variance with his
own there was great danger of such
open expressions contaminating the de-
veloping mind of many an innocent
student whose parents certainly had the
right to expect protection of their off-
spring against such radical doctrines if
the learned professor personally such
an admirable fellow would only stick to
his grubbing scientific experiments that
in itself aside from the expense would
not be so bad but his utter indiscreet
ness-he would not term it fearlessness
when it came to his radical utterances
anyway the shoemaker should stick to
his last again regardless bf the modem
hollyballoo for science and still more
science dr lorman could not restrain
a secret belief that it was somewhat over-
done the scientist was getting alto-
gether too much attention

  my dear professor wont you have
a seat the president began in his sauye
voice his florid face wavering between
a polite smile and a veiled frown its
been quite a disaster quite a disaster

  yes i know for this i am truly

sorry no doubt there was full insur-
ance

  well hardly and he gave the luck-
less scientist an icy stare you see the
insurance companies take the stand that
in view of your highly dangerous ex-
perimentations there can be no expec-
tation of adequate insurance

  professor mendoza looked down on
the floor a sad worried expression on
his scholarly face and shook his head
in silent contrition

  and even if there were im sure
the board of directors would be against
any more such large scale experiments-
at least for the present i may add for
your information that there has been
considerable adverse criticism at the
state capitol already i fear legisla-
tive steps will be taken to cut down our
total of appropriations for the univer
sity it is being said this is no time for
expensive researches especially of such
a doubtfully practical nature when there
are many other crying needs

  he paused in momentary silence to
let his words sink in deep the tips of
his fingers pressed together in a benign
attitude

  i regret very much my dear pro
fessor but for the present at least you
will have to confine yourself to lectures
and other academic duties

chapter iv

stunned and grieved professor
mendoza went about his now re
stricted activities also grieved
although more chagrined and rebellious
was his brilliant assistant jim tom
linson

  the professor suffered in silence de-
prived of the expensive apparatus which
had taken him so many years to build
up and now a melted and twisted heap
of metal with no visible funds to re
sume those profound researches which
the world aflame



had occupied him for so long-the
amounts required were beyond anyone
but a rich individual or institution-he
felt himself utterly lost bitterly he re-
flected that here he had come to the
verge of perfecting perhaps the greatest
discovery of all time and still the men
in control of the necessary funds lacked
the vision and imagination to allow him
to continue

  well prof mendoza tomlinson
spoke cheeringly i should say if you
will permit me that there are other
ponds in this wide world to swim in
with your reputation it should not be
hard to get going elsewhere

  prof mendoza thought for a while
and smiled sadly

  other ponds to swim in-yes but
our apparatus will have to be entirely
rebuilt and that will take a long time
and lots of money and with almost
every institution retrenching again these
days - he shrugged his shoulders in his
characteristic way

  true genius however is not easily
to be denied it has a way of striving
for its purposes despite all handicaps
prevented from going ahead with his
profound researches at the university
where he had spent so many happy and
fruitful years prof mendoza decided
to go elsewhere

  but here as he had feared disap-
pointment awaited him for although
the fame of the distinguished professor
was known throughout the world and
although many a university in america
europe and elsewhere would have been
gladly honored by his presence in their
midst there were few at that time who
could or would take him under the con-
ditions he stipulated-large financing for
the purpose of concluding his experi-
ments on the structure and control of
the internal energy of the atom in ad-
dition he ran smack into another diffi-
culty he never dreamed to exist to the

extent it did a difficulty unspoken of
and usually soft-pedaled in academic
halls but effective in its power of disci-
pline-religious and political intolerance
against anyone of radical views some
that might have been willing and well
able to take him under his conditions
had heard of his radical utterances in
the realms of politics economics reli-
gion and what not that always marks
a man regardless of his other attain-
ments or qualifications many were will-
ing to let him lecture on his favorite
science but that was all

  undaunted after wasting a precious
year his soul chafing under the restraints
at the university the professor sought
aid outside the confines of houses of
learning he was promptly snapped up
by the laboratory division of a great
industrial corporation he was offered
an enormous salary which he declined
except what he needed for his modest
living expenses and was given full lee-
way to go ahead with his unfinished
work

  taking his valuable assistant and col-
league with him tomlinson being now
a full-fledged ph d he lost no time in
plunging into his interrupted work

but try as they would and though
they spared themselves no hours
nor respite from their grueling re-
searches they made no progress what-
soever in the all important goal which
was their aim-a practical means of con-
trolling the fierce atomic energies so
they could be safely harnessed for use-
ful purposes as it was all they had
learned to develop so far was an im-
proved method of releasing these basal
energies of radiating matter but they
always were forced to follow immedi-
ately with a terrific struggle to halt the
dangerous process in quick time more
than once they risked their very lives
for so fierce and terrific was the out-


amazing stories

pouring of energy once begun--even
when the process was operating at a
partial rate-that they dared not allow
it to reach its full amplitude fearful of
their inability to control it utterly and
apprehending the possibly dire results
from a too prolohged contact of the dis-
integrating element with other sub-
stances they worked with only a bare
pinch of the elements under experimen-
tation finding that hard enough to con-
trol as it was once started it was rlip
and tuck to stop it the most refractory
substances melted and volatilised almost
immediately from near contact with the
fiercely disintegrating element try as
they would no receptacle or form of
container could confine the force of these
radiations for a period sufficient to de
velop practical use without everything
within a considerable radius disappear
ing in explosive clouds of incandescent
gas and rivulets of molten matter

  thus matters stood when on account
of thorough going retrenchments forced
by the bad economic conditions which
descended on general industry the world
over a halt was called on professor
mendozas expensive researches in vain
he pleaded with the high officials of
the company to permit him to continue
just a short while longer that he was
on the right trail and truly on the verge
of a successful outcome to his long-
sought quest he was politely but firmly
informed that the electrical products
corporation had for the time being gone
along that line as far as it could

  fearful lest iii the meantime his
great secrets pertaining to his discoveries
should fall into irresponsible hands
should perhaps be put to dangerous uses
the professor decided after due con
sultation with tomlinson to entrust all
his secret formulae priceless data as well
as the specially developed apparatus in
his possession into the keeping of the
federal government with the reserva

tion that he or his disciple could have
access to their use at any and all times
this the responsible officiate had at least
the good sense to accept and carefully
file away for possible future use

  followed another fruitless year for
professor mendoza as well as for tom-
linson the master scientist languished
from the let-up of his many years in-
tense researches into atomic physics
nevertheless he did not give up hope
even though for the time being he was
obliged to confine his main activities to
lecturing and minor researches in and
between he delved as much as he could
into his favorite subject and in this
quest used up the very last of his private
resources

  but deep discouragement as well as
his advancing years began to tell al-
though the fire in his eye and the flame
of his genius never faltered a severe
attack of pneumonia following a short
illness brought about by overwork and
self-denial proved too much for the
aged scientist he died a penniless and
broken-hearted old man his passing
came rather suddenly the only ones
present when he breathed his last were
his idolized daughter esther the only
child by a former marriage and the
devoted and worshipful jim tomlinson
outside of the scientific journals where
his great accomplishments were given
their just recognition the passing of this
superlative physicist received scarcely
more space in the daily press than the
tawdry doings of many a minor athlete
or thrill producer

  in passing it is perhaps not too much
to say that this of all the strange quirks
in the public psychology is perhaps the
most maddening and to men of true
genius nothing so thoroughly heart-
breaking as this indifference and oft-
recurring blind-spot in regards to so
many of the truly great souls of the
world until long after their death
the world aflame



chapter v

but though professor samuel men-
doza gteat thinker and outstand-
ing genius in the realm of science
passed on into the great beyond without
realizing his greatest ambition he left a
great pupil full worthy of himself in the
person of the tall lean-faced and person-
able james tomlinson who had wor-
shipped at the shrine of his great
teacher

  with the persevering grit of true
genius and a determination to carry to
completion the unfinished work of his
revered master the younger man set
about accomplishing that great object
in this he was perhaps not a little en-
couraged by the beautiful esther men-
doza beloved daughter of the late phy-
sicist throughout the years of jims
association with her father the limpid
dark eyes and curving lips of the girl
had a lure for the young scientist the
extent of which he hardly dared admit
to himself and her shy yet compelling
personality and oft reddening cheeks
when in his presence on more than one
occasion-had he been less gifted with
the divine spark of genius-might have
proved disastrous to his scientific en-
thusiasm for the subject in which he and
her father were so absorbed

  by dint of his great inherent abilities
as well as of the prestige derived from
his former association with the re-
knowned mendoza jim now known as
dr tomlinson made rapid strides in the
federal bureau of scientific research
his efforts finally reached a point where
it seemed that before long the great aim
to which he had sworn to devote him-
self and which since the death of the
late professor had long been held in
abeyance seemed in a fair way to get
going again

  but here once more a perverse fate
stepped in to the detriment of all man-

kind for just as dr tomlinsons
ceaseless efforts to pursuade the proper
authorities had met with success in the
form of a generous appropriation but
before he could launch into actual oper-
ations a great devastating war burst
upon the world his fond hopes were
annihilated

  in the new alignment on the side of
the associated central and southern
nations the acsn was the greatly
enlarged japanese empire conditions
do make strange bed-fellows the
country of the rising sun had long since
cut a wide swathe clear across asia and
this was the moment she had long waited
for-her complete hegemony over prac-
tically the entire vast continent of asia
in this she had been held in check only
by the fear of the anglo-american-
french alliance

  knowing the secret plans of the en-
emy which was to strike first at france
and england overwhelm them at one
blow and then proceed in full force
against america france britain and
the other members of the alliance which
included poland the traditional ally of
france the nations of the acsn took
the jump without waiting for the blow
they knew was coming they immedi-
ately declared war

  all the leading countries of the world
were soon drawn into the conflict with
the exception of the union of soviet
socialist republics the latter decided to
remain neutral and sat back to await
the now long-overdue world socialist
state which they proclaimed was at last
to come inevitably as the outcome of this
new world war

  in those last decades of the th cen-
tury no country no matter how far re-
moved could long remain untouched by
the horrors of war the new aviation
could span the widest ocean as easily
and by taking to the stratosphere al-
most as swiftly as though it were a mere


amazing stories

jump the rival air fleets of the fighting
nations soon brought the war home to
everybody from then on things moved
with appalling swiftness and the results
were horrible and terrifying to com-
batant and noncombatant alike the
rulers of the world more or less hide-
bound by tradition and far behind the
advances of the latter-day science should
have foreseen the dreadful results of
such a conflict and long ago should have
taken steps to forestall it

  but with the details and general con-
duct of this horrible war the onus for
which can this time be laid at the door
of the group of misled nations whose
lust for world power and mad ideas
sought to achieve their object by forcible
means-with all these we are not here
concerned our aim rather is to trace
the causes which so unhappily led to a
far vaster catastrophe than any war
in itself could possibly have inflicted oti
a whole planet the war but reveals the
unworthy nay ghastly uses to which the
greatest and noblest products of mans
genius can be put by irresponsible and
hate-maddened individuals and peoples

chapter vi

late one evening shortly after
hostilities had commenced dr
james tomlinson was in the
private archives of the research bureau
where his secret plafis and data on
atomic energy were kept and to which
according to the agreement he had ac-
cess at any time with him was a col-
league oliver maywell

  while pouring over these plans the
two men were startled by the sudden
unexpected entry of four intruders a
glance showed they were heavily armed
how they had gained entrance to the
carefully guarded precincts he did not
know but there they were and tom-
linson was soon made painfully aware of

their mission the foremost grated
some harsh order in a foreign tongue
and the intruders immediately pounced
on the two unarmed men the sharp
struggle which followed was soon over
cruel blows on the head laid them out
cold

  when tomlinson came to the in-
truders were gone despite the pain in
his head the red blurr in his eyes he
quickly discovered what they had come
for-his priceless plans and equations
were gone staggering outside tomlin-
son and maywell reported the theft to
the military authorities they released
several guards who had been over-
powered also but the foreign spies had
succeeded in making a clean get-awy
the only clue was a swift plane of
enemy design headed eastward at an ex-
treme altitude and sighted momentarily
by a searchlight near the continental
shores just before it was swallowed up
in the darkness ovef the brooding at-
lantic

t the end of a year of frightful
l  carnage with the a g s n-
japanese side on the verge of losing the
war an ominous thing came to pass
the dreadful results of which no one
dreamed of at the time

  in a carefully camouflaged under-
ground retreat somewhere in central
europe buzzed strange activity hun-
dreds of men were hurrying about like
a swarm of ants in a burrow ift the
labyrinth of huge underground chambers
of bomb-proof steel and concrete
hummed and throbbed a titanic assem-
blage of complicated machinery of a
kind strangely resembling those devel-
oped by the late professor mendoza and
james tomlinson only vastly larger and
more powerful in still another cavern
was a monstrous mechanism resembling
a cannon of grotesque size the fright-
fully gaping muzzle the tip only of its
the world aflame



many hundred-feet length was all that

showed above the surface of the ground
 the uncanny enemy mind had devised
an engine of destruction as frightful as
it was dangerously sujcidal the world
was about to learn something new of
the old spirit of frightfulness which
had lost none of its previous ruthless-
ness  but this time science had placed in
their misguided hands a power that
should never have been trifled with
desperate and virtually beaten instead
of bowing to the victorious western
allies the crazed central rulers permit-
ted the launching of this final and sense-
less engine of frightfulness at their
near-victorious enemies

  toward the close of a hot day on
the th of august secret word went
around among those actively engaged in
manning the engines that promptly at
the stroke of midnight would commence
the first of that series of long range
bombardments which was to strike
terror into the hearts of the allies and
force them to their knees

  the awful messengers of destruction
about to be hurled at the allied home-
lands weighed no one knows how many
tons and were ingeniously freighted
with an immense charge of matter in
a state of fierce atomic disintegration
only minds erased with hate and des-
peration could have deliberately em-
barked on such a dangerous course the
misguided brains the technicians who
understood and built the dread engine
of destruction surely must have realized
in large measure at least the world-wide
threat involved but who can fathom
the infernal depths to which fanatically-
crazed minds can descend

  the giant projectiles of such un-
heard-of size were in reality a combina-
tion rocketrtype design their construe
tion as much as can be gleaned from
the meager details obtainable consisted
of a series of thick shells one within

the other marvelously insulated and of
some amazingly refractory material
previously unknown in the center was
the immense core of matter in the
initial stages of atomic annihilation
whose awful radiations nothing could
long resist

  after its terrific expulsion from the
giant mouth of the howitzerike engine
took place the combination rocket me-
chanism with which it was equipped
kept the projectile going at a swiftly
accelerating rate by the time it reached
its objective by way of the stratosphere
the last of the multiple outer shells
would be almost reduced to a trail of
incandescent gas by the internal heat of
the core the multiple shell construction
served merely to convey the disintegrat-
ing charge before it struck home

  it was necessary that the projectile
leave the muzzle of the firing engine at
the very moment the state of true atomic
annihilation commenced the muzzle
velocity was two miles a seeond which
was soon accelerated by the terrific ex-
haust of flaming gasses from  the
rocket-type construction to five miles a
second capable of taking it to the shores
of america in about ten minutes every
thing required split-second precision to
avoid a premature release of the atomic
energies before the charge could be
hurled on its way during its brief
flight practically all the multiple outer
shells despite the marvelous system of
insulation rapidly melted and volatilized
the destroyers counting on results after
the disintegrating mass of fiercely radiat-
ing matter had buried itself in the enemy
lands

  such in brief were the terrible engines
that were to start on their way beginning
that night

from a young central officer named
mueller lone survivor of the hun-
dreds who comprised the personnel


amazing stories

comes an eye-witness story of the shot
which destroyed the earth

  thirty minutes before midnight
he tells in his vivid way everything
was ready for the first shot sharp at
the stroke of twelve the radio signals
in secret code were coming in strong
from our planes which were that minute
approaching new york city to direct
our range

  everyone was excited and nervous
it was the first time anything like that
had ever been tried even the experts
were not absolutely sure of the results
and an underground rumor to that effect
had passed around among the men one
thing was stressed above all the im-
portance of coordinated precision in the
timing

  he goes on to say the main ob-
jectives of these long range shots were
first new york boston philadelphia
washington and other important eastern
centers then range further inland to
include the niagara falls power plants
buffalo the important pittsburgh area
cleveland detroit chicago and finally
westward to all the populous centers
clear to the west coast buenos aires
rio de janeiro and other south ameri-
can centers were also on the list a
similar bombardment of the nearer cities
of the allies-including paris mar-
seilles london liverpool warsaw-
was to follow as soon as possible in
order to grip the entire alliance in one
great fear one or two hits for each
center was considered enough

  outside above the ground as the
young officer told it the virtually de-
serted country-side where the great
works lay hidden was dark and de-
serted not a solitary light was allowed
to draw the suspicions of a possible
enemy the moonless sky was clear and
thick with stars not a sound outside
of those made by the night insects no
one passing by would have dreamed of

what was going on far below the surface

  as the interviewer long afterwards
retold the story mueller here paused
and a sad look came over his handsome
face the while he closed his eyes mo-
mentarily as if to efface some horrible
memory then the young fellow con-
tinued 

  but you should have seen the bee-
hive of activity far down below the
surface in the deep caverns which housed
the works officials were buzzing and
running around giving last minute
orders the mammoth engines were
primed and ready the enormous power
tubes the electromagnetic and other
works were beginning the process of in-
ducing the state of atomic disintegra-
tion of the great core within the huge
rocket-projectile the long muzzle of
the gun was pointed and corrected ac-
cording to the latest signals

  i took my appointed station far for-
ward and off to one side to observe
the initial course of the shot and to
that i owe my life an unhappy sigh
escaped his lips my position was in
a specially built observation station just
below the surface i looked at my watch
the seconds ticked off interminably
seemed to pound in unison with my
heart came the warning last signal
fifty seconds more and the atomic charge
would be ready the moment for the
first shot would come simultaneously i
knew the timing had to be perfect

  i had my eyes glued to my instru-
ment when there came an awful de-
tonation followed by a sickening rumb-
ling and earth-shaking i was almost
laid flat the darkness of the night went
suddenly brilliant as with sunlight the
change was blinding i had but a fleet-
ing glimpse of the flaming projectile
as it streaked westward across the sky
the incandescent gasses which streamed
from its wake left an enormous comet-
the world aflame



like tail that was visible for a long time
afterwards

  here ends the officers account of the
epochal tragedy-filled exploit worthy of
a better and more humanitarian cause

the gigantic messenger of destruc-
tion already incandescent the mo-
ment it left the muzzle of the huge firing
engine grew ever more brilliant a it
streaked westward toward the ameri-
can continent observers who happened
below the path of its trajectory noted
the daylight brilliance with which the
darkness of night was disgelled the
length of its fiery comet-like tail its
immense trajectory took the projectile
some hundreds of miles beyond the
earths atmosphere and in exactly 
minutes and  seconds bridged the
two continents

  however the best laid plans often
go awry despite the vast amount of
care which went into the first shot it
failed to strike its objective-new york
city-by a wide margin partly it seems
that an atomically disintegrating pro-
jectile is hard to manage partly the
enemy pilots who had risked their lives
high over new york to direct the shot
had been spotted almost at the last
moment caught in a maze of search-
lights they became the center of a hurri-
cane of fire from above and below and
their final signals just before they were
brought down were too hurried the
net result was that the flaming projec-
tile roaring with the noise of a thou-
sand express trains passed new york
far to the north and fell with a terrific
detonation in an uninhabited section
in the heart of the catskill mountains
burying itself deep in the ground

  this was the first and the last shot of
its kind that was ever fired the at-
tempted firing of the second shot which
took place some time later that very
night proved disastrous to themselves

the lone survivor relates that some-
thing must have gone wrong as the
second projectile was about to be dis-
charged nothing remained of the elab-
orate hide-out but an immense crater two
thousand feet in diameter the exploded
and melted equipment together with the
personnel were scattered to the winds
scarcely a trace was ever found

  but the harm was done beyond re-
call

chapter vii

the morning news reported the
unprecedented long-range attempt
at bombardment and its apparent
fiasco most of the space was devoted
to the well deserved self-destruction of
the would-be baby assassins as one
radio apnouneer put it fitting punish-
ment for the apostles of frightfulness

	leading french paper commented

  but very little or nothing was said
at the time about the flaming and roar-
ing and earth-shaking volcano-like out-
burst in the heart of the peaceful cats-
kills where the dazzling brilliant pro-
jectile had fallen for no one happened
within miles of the deserted spot where
it fell during the dead hour of the night

  expert geologists who arrived on the
spot sent thither by the county and
state authorities declared it was not a
true eruption although it exhibited
many of the usual phenomena that go
with volcanoes certainly the usual vol-
canic cone was absent that the flaming
projectile was at the bottom of this
most experts who journeyed thither had
no doubt

  however in so far as the center of
the fierce consummation was in a de-
serted mountain spot devoid of in-
habitants and since after the surround-
ing vegetation was consumed there
seemed no serious threat of further
danger outside of some poisonous gasses


amazing stories

and falling hot tinders no one got ex-
cited over it the papers and the radio
occasionally commented on it and a
few views came over the television
the war now in its concluding phases
tended to drive all else from the public
mind so that few gave the small but
fiercely belching artificial volcano much
attention in time it was assumed it
would burn itself out

by an unfortunate streak of fate the
one man in the whole world who
would have realized at once the dire
danger inherent in the spectacular but
local and apparently harmless eruption
was just then confined in a hospital ward
in the city of washington suffering
from shock and wound as a result of an
enemy aerial raid in force which had
occurred on the capitol the very hour
the projectile fell for four days tom-
linson lay in a delirium of sickness and
fever ignorant of what was transpiring
in the heart of the catskills

  on the fifth day the fever left him
and although still suffering from the
pain of his wound which was not ser-
ious he was more himself again esther
the late mendozas daughter now his
devoted wife was at his bedside the
first thing he asked for was news of the
war

  do be quiet jim she pleaded
nothing of importance has occurred

  read me the headlines esther-
please

  after reading the main features to
him she turned the page and read 
catskills still erupting

  erupting- he eyed esther ques-
tioningly

  oh i fotgot the enemy fired a long
range shot and it fell into the catskills
its been burning ever since they tried
to fire a second shot but the report is
that something went wrong and the whole
works blew to smithereens-serves them

right you know from the description
i think it must be an atomic bomb of
some sort which they shot over prob-
ably got the idea from those stolen plans
-whats the matter dear she broke
off and looked anxiously at the wounded
man

  tomlinson who had been listening to
esther with eyes and mouth wide open
suddenly sat up

  my god burst from his tremulous
lips my god he repeated in an agon-
ized tone as he attempted to get out of
bed

  frightened almost out of her wits
esther signalled for help and with diffi-
culty persuaded the wounded man to
lie back in his bed

  please jim for my sake do calm
yourself she pleaded what has gone
wrong suddenly anxiously she peered
into the frightened eyes of the man
she adored

  i must get up esther dont you
understand-that atomic bomb   
havent you been long enough around
your father and me to realize what that
might mean quick i must do some-
thing there is not a minute to lose
over four days its been burning you
say good heavens it may be too late
already   

  it was now her turn to stare at jim
with frightened eyes for well she knew
that her scientist husband great dis-
ciple of her great father never spoke
idly

  but what can you do now she
pleaded the womans fear for her be-
loved outweighing everything else you
are too weak the doctor says you are
not to get up for several days

  no time to lose i tell you he fell
back on his pillow with a groan and
closed his eyes from weakness after a
few moments esther dearest you
must get me in touch immediately with
dr grey at the bureau tell him its
the world aflame



absolutely urgent that he come here

  an hour later dr mortimer grey
head of the federal bureau of scientific
research sauntered in leisurely and sat
down at jims bedside he eyed the
wounded man sympathetically after ex-
changing greetings

  without wasting any words jim be-
gan

  i have called you with regard to the
atomic bomb disintegrating in the cats-
kills he paused a moment to moisten
his dry lips before continuing

  oh that there was just a trace
of annoyance in greys voice as if he
resented being thus urgently called upon
for something so trifling--when he had
so much else to do that was important
nothing worth while bothering about
that my dear man is there doing no
serious harm from all reports will
bum itself out no doubt with time

dr grey looked up at the house
doctor who just then stepped in
glanced with mild suspicion at the drawn
face of the sufferer gone to his head
poor fellow the thought flashed through
him the trace of annoyance vanished
and gave way to sympathy

  well i must be going he spoke ris-
ing impatient to be off glad to see
you getting along sa-

  dont go dr grey the sick man
sat bolt upright and began to speak in
a cool collected tone as if he were dis-
coursing an academic subject that erup-
tion up there in the catskills is not an
ordinary eruption the bomb which is
causing it is not an ordinary bomb do
you remember the plans and equations
those spies stole over a year ago well
   the enemy has evidently succeeded
in producing a state of atomic disinte-
gration on a vastly larger and more
complete scale than either professor
mendoza or i ever dared to try fur-
thermore they have somehow managed

to confine it sufficiently long to be able
to shoot it over to our shores

  now a tiny charge such as we ex-
perimented with and the release of a
large mass containing perhaps tons of
fiercely disintegrating matter liberating
blind energy at a rate more than enough
to run all the industries of the world
is a totally different thing altogether
tomlinson paused and held his lis-
teners eye

  the annihilation of atoms on such a
huge scale may communicate itself to
other elements once allowed to gain a
sufficient start    may set the earth
aflame    perhaps detonate the whole
planet    does that mean anything to
you 

  dr grey leaned back in his seat a
half-startled a half-dubious look on his
usually serene face was he listening to
the gibbering of a madman or-- he
shook his head as if warding off an un
pleasant thought

  but my dear man he began sooth-
ingly arent you perhaps the least bit
over-alarmed i grant that you of all
living men are perhaps best qualified to
judge of the possible effects of such

a thing but- he stopped when he

noticed the rising tide of impatience in
the wounded mans face the fire of anger
and scorn in his eyes

  dr grey his voice became im-
perious there is not a second to lose
on you at this moment rests the awful
responsibility of averting a major ca-
tastrophe of unthinkable proportions go
to the state or federal authorities at
once and tell them what i told you
have some of them come here to me if
they wish regardless-there is no time
to lose in assembling the necessary
equipment i have the complete plans
and specifications for just such an
emergency and pray god that it may
not prove too late

  as the head of the research bureau

stood hesitant a mixture of infected
anxiety and incredulity he added dr
grey you are my superior and it is not
meet that i should speak to you in such
a tone but if you refuse to carry my
message to the proper authorities   
and disaster comes  i shall point my
finger at you

chapter viii

when the good dr mortimer
grey left the hospital after hav-
ing promised to do whatever he
could he no longer doubted the youthful
scientist was perfectly sane and in his
right mind and what was more was
deadly serious about the great danger
which he believed threatened but truth
to tell though he himself was by now
quite perturbed and in a measure in-
fected with the grave misgivings im-
parted to him and though he had much
respect for the young dr tomlinson
especially in view of the latters recent
collaboration with the great mendoza-
more than he cared to acknowledge to a
subordinate-somehow the more he
thought about it the less it excited him
and the further he got away from the
burning eyes of the wounded man the
more ready he became to take it all with
a generous pinch of salt after all it
was hard to believe that such a thing
could come to pass but then again the
new physics    remotely possible-
hardly probable and he shrugged his
shoulders and breathed deeply of the
good air took in the pleasant sunshine
and felt the gradual return of his former
cheery outlook on life and the good
universe in general

  still he had promised and whatever
else dr mortimer grey was a man of
his word his conscience at least should
be clear the burden would have to be
taken up by others

without wasting any time for he was

anxious to get it over with so he could
be about his usual pressing duties dr
grey immediately arranged for a con-
ference in albany he followed tom-
linsons advice not to waste any time
with the county authorities as the mat-
ter was something of too great a mag-
nitude for them to tackle as head of
an important national bureau he found
no trouble in obtaining a respectful hear-
ing almost at once

  among those present were the chair-
man of the new york state conserva-
tion board the lieutenant governor
major general wilkinson ranking mili-
tary defence official of the entire eastern
seaboard the congressman of the district
and several other highly placed federal
state and military officials

  dr grey did his best to convey tom-
linsons fears but as his own fears
kept dying away he took pains to make
it clear that the views he expressed
were not his own that he himself was
loath to subscribe to them if pinned right
down to it

  this young scientist i make bold
to say he went on in his quiet mon-
otone way of speaking is unquestion-
ably highly capable and i feel sure
knows a great deal about certain prob-
lems relating to the internal structure
and radiant energy of matter but that
is all that i would care or dare to say
in recommendation most certainly i do
not wish to arouse any baseless fears
in your minds gentlemen for i know
you have enough worries without it i
have merely done my duty you will
have to decide for yourselves he con-
cluded

   the important officials listened blandly
and with a measure of curiosity-these
scientists always did come up with some-
thing new and startling but when dr
grey had finished presenting the case
including the possible dire results as pic-
tured by tomlinson it was plain to see
the world aflame



that much to the speakers embarrass-
ment the majority of those present
looked askance some partly amused the
rest almost resentful at being called in
for a conference on a matter which had
been given them to believe was of such
paramount importanuce but which to
their way of thinking was not some-
body was evidently trying to be rid-
iculously sensational

  it can hardly be sp bad as all that
one of them thoughtfully remarked in
an all-knowing way voicing everyones
sentiment tell this man tomlinson
whoever he may be that i for one ex-
pect the seasons to roll around and the
grass to grow just as green long after
all of us are gone

  the rest laughed good-humoredly
and someone clinched the decision by
remarking that surely he cant ex-
pect anyone to get insanely excited over
l mountain woods fire far from the
nearest town

  dr grey whose fears whatever they
may have been before were now quite
dissipated by the confident self-assur-
ance of the others stood up to leave
with the uncomfortable feeling that per-
haps he had made a rrnstep and risked
ridicule for even remotely espousing
such a far-fetched idea before these im-
portant men

  the meeting closed with some good-
natured banter about making their wills
before the world comes to an end and
degenerated into a discussion of the clos-
ing phases of the war and other subjects
which to them were important and in-
teresting

  grey busied with other matters
waited a few days before going to the
hospital to report the result of the con-
ference to tomlinson he went with a
feeling that he had done his duty even
though he shouldnt have allowed the
young man to infect him the way he did

  upon hearing greys light-hearted re-

port of the almost indifferent reception
of what to him was a matter of perhaps
world-life or world-death tomlinson
let out a loud those damned idiots
much to the shocked ears of his dignified
superior the latter with a well ive
done all i could refused to commit
himself in any further way and took
himself off quite eager to escape the
scornful remarks and the burning eyes
of the scientist

two weeks later tomlmsqn still
weak and somewhat wabbly from
his confinement left the hospital pale
of face but soul on fire after hearing
and reading about the long-continued
eruption in the catskill mountains he
boarded a plane and soon was in the vi-
einjty of the fierce conflagration to see
for himself

  approaching as near as he could what
of the terrific heat the dangerous rays
and the gases let alone the constant pelt
ing of hot ash tomlinson soon saw
that his fears were far from being
groundless the exploshe roaring which
he knew so well the intense light and
heat which even at a considerable dis-
tance was unbearable and unapproach-
able all these to his trained mind were
but harbingers of the dreadful aftermath
which might follow-unless something
and at once was done about it

  careful inquiry of those who had been
observing the eruption from its begin-
nings elicited the information that in-
stead of abating it had grown worse
especially the last few days this only
confirmed his horrible apprehensions
a pall of scarlet-hued clouds of poison-
ous gases made a closer inspection even
with the aid of gas masks impossible
but he saw and heard enough    was
quite sure of one thing-the intra-atomic
activation through its inconceivable
power of disintegration was communi-
cating its state to other matter was

slowly even if very slowly spreading

  fired with dread apprehension not
only for himself and his loved ones but
for the whole world-the very existence
of the earth itself and all it contained
--james tomlin hurried back to wash-
ington once more he sought the chief
of his bureau but the latter this time
turned a deaf ear to his pleas and re-
fused under any circumstanuces to take
an active part

  im afraid youll only end up in
making yourself ridiculous was his
parting advice

  undaunted and with the fire of con-
viction burning with him jim sought
out one by one and not without con-
siderable difficulty the officials whom
grey had formerly convened as be-
fore they refused to become alarmed
and it was not until two more hectic
weeks had elapsed that after much
wire-pulling he managed to obtain a
short interview with no less a personage
than grover t hammond the assistant
secretary of war to whom he was re-
ferred and who was said to have enor-
mous influence with the secretary of
war and even with the president himsel f

  the right hand man of the secretary
of war listened to the serious scientist
with full respect for a few minutes but
just as soon as he caught the drift of
tomlinsons remarks he arose with
great politeness from his comfortable
chair and stood up

   my dear sir im not a scientist but
you know we are in the midst of a
war my business is to do what little i
can toward conducting this war to a suc-
cessful conclusion

   but this is infinitely more important
than even the war-which is about won
ajiyway

  the assistant secretary looked at the
speaker with calm compassion pacifists
were no new thing to him but that any-
one should consider a scientific curiosity

going on somewheres in a little known
corner of a deserted mountain side from
the nearest village as more important
than a gigantic war in which all the im-
portant nations of the earth were en-
gaged-well the human mind certainly
had strange off-shoots

   better see the new york state au-
thorities thats something for them to
worry about

  i have already done so mr ham-
mond

  then why come here

   i was referred to you they claim
to have done all they could and any-
how wont take it seriously

  do you expect me to

  you would if i could make you
understand it

  hammond chuckled with amusement
and lit a cigar politely offering one
to tomlinson better see miss hark-
ness secretary of the interior ive got
too much to look after that should
fall within her jurisdiction anyway
with that he dismissed his caller refus-
ing even to consider tomlinsons request
for arranging an interview direct with
the secretary of war himself over
such a petty thing as he termed it
with a shade of ironical exasperation
in his voice

   those impractical scientists he mut-
tered to himself as tomlinson closed the-
door next thing i suppose hell ask
of the great general staff to side-track
the war for a little while to put out that
fire in the catskills more important
than the war ha ha he chuckled to
himself and then burst out laughing
aloud much to the amusement of the
comely young lady who just entered
with a stack of mail

miss harkness secretary of
the interior in the presidents
cabinet a thoughtful woman of near
middle age who had attained her high
the world aflame



 position due to her great abilities lis-
 tened with interest to what the scientist
 had to say she had an intelligent lay-
 mans curiosity in things scientific with-
 out understanding a thing about them
 her fine gray eyes set in a not unattrac-
 tive face took in the handsome features
 of the scholarly scientist with secret ad-
 miration her long experience in the
 hard-boiled world of men told her that
 here was one of an altogether different
 kind

    off hand i dare say that although
 im not a scientist it seems to me you
 are needlessly frightening yourself
 surely that fire which is arousing so
 much curiosity should burn itself out
 i shortly just because of its very in-
 ti tensity

 tomlinson smiled grimly but that
 is not a fire as you call it in that moun-
 tain side lies buried an enormous charge
 nf matter weighing at least several tons
 ipi a state of swift atomic disintegration
 comparable only to the process no doubt
 gening on in our sun and the stars do
 yoiji realize the amount of atomic energy
 locked up in the tip of the pencil you
 hold in your hand well right now in
 that catskill mountain more concen-
 trated energy is being released and at a
 faster rate than all the power engines of
 the wonld could generate if this process
 of disintegration should communicate it-
 self to ovher substances-and i fear that
 this has already happened to a partial
 extent-if allowed to go too far then
 indeed is the world doomed

    grant that such is the case still as
 i understand it you and the late pro-
 fessor mendoza have started and stopped
 the process many times during your ex-
 periments without burning up the
 world and she gave a soft musical
 laugh surely therefore it ought
 not to be any trouble now if it comes
 to a point where it is desirable to take
 it under control

  in the case of the enormous charge
now activating in the catskills the
amount and power of the equipment that
would be required to neutralize it even
right from the start is enormous and
in view of its long start and undoubted
spreading since it began to activate over
a month ago i fear it quite probable
that from now on it may accelerate
faster than we can construct and as-
semble the equipment necessary to fight
it now do you see tomlinson gazed
expectantly at the secretary

  i see i think i understand but
still- she looked away and her del-
icate fingers toyed with the platinum
pencil in her hand just how much
would you say would it cost to take
the necessary measures granting i
could be influential in getting them ap-
proved and under way

   i cant say offhand but no doubt it
would run into millions

  millions secretary harkness
straightened up as if from an electric
shock oh im afraid that would be
quite impossible-right now at any rate
if it were only a matter of some thou-
sands or even a few hundred thousand
that would be different but when you
talk of millions why i would not even
have the audacity to sponsor such a
thing my dear man dont you realize
the country is all but bankrupt right
now as a result of the war

  the present center of atomic dis-
integration does not recognize the
troubles of war finance labor or cap-
ital it is mightier than either or all if
necessary capital and labor and material
may have to be conscripted miss hark-
ness and he leaned forward in his seat
his pale face stern as the face of a
prophet miss harkness if something
is not done about it and at once without
any further quibbling or delay regard-
less of the cost to each and all-our
sun will all too soon become a binary

a momentary wave of alarm
spread over the secretarys face
a startled look in her handsome
gray eyes but this almost at once gave
way to her usual unruffled calmness

  arent you a bit sensational in this
dr tomlinson consider what you are
saying- do you expect the masses even
the more intelligent and better posted
to believe such a thing

  the masses never initiate they fol-
low

  but the legislators remember if
this is a national threat congress would
have to pass on any such large appro-
priations as you mention

  they too are only sheep that follow

woman studying each other as serious
minded people often will

  well i shall see what i can do i
cannot promise anything right now
everybody is taken up with the forth-
coming armistice which all are praying
for but i shall confer with the ranking
members of congress perhaps sound
the governor of new york i may even
mention it to the president and get his
reaction

  this woman has more brains than
half a dozen of the men i have talked
to put together tomlinson remarked
to himself as he left the office

  the famous secretary of the interior
under the pressure of her manifold
duties delayed taking any action on the
matter until nearly a week had passed
by her first move viso-telephone con-

versations with responsible new york
state officials met with the assuring re-
ply that the state forestry department
had done all it could in safeguarding
the areas adjoining the eruption she
was told that the few settlers in the
danger zone had been removed and well
cared for that aside from the still rag-
ing center the fire was purely local
and of no consequence and should soon
burn itself out

  thus valuable weeks slipped into
months and nothing was done about it
secretary harkness with womanly sen-
sitiveness fearing that if she laid too
much stress on the subject she might
lay herself open to ridicule for senseless
fears especially on account of her sex
-something she felt her high position
could not afford-decided to drop the
matter altogether besides after all she
was not perfectly sold on the idea at
any rate she reasoned if the disturb-
ance did take a serious turn for the
worse-a thing which nearly all she
spoke to seemed to scoff at-there should
be time enough then to act without in-
curring the danger of ridicule espe-
cially the sharp darts of those who still
were old-fashioned enough to believe
that women had no place in high
politics

  this decision she finally communi-
cated to the more than ever concerned
tomlinson who was a frequent visitor
to her office when she quoted some of
the remarks made by responsible officials
who refused to be moved he replied
grimly

  in not so long to come they will all
be falling over each other to vote not
millions but billions to finance a flight
to mars but it will then be too late

in his unflagging determination to
awaken those responsible for public
opinion and safety tomlinson went so
far as to seek an audience with the
the world aflame



president himself in this he was unsuc-
cessful the war-torn peresident kindly
haggard and overworked referred the
matter to others who referred it to still
others who pigeon-holed it and let it
die a natural death through indifference
and neglect

  despairing of his efforts to arouse
the world to the danger which threat-
ened he addressed himself to leading sci-
entists scientific and other organiza-
tions in america as well as abroad in-
cluding even the late enemy countries
he sent a number of articles to lead-
ing publications whose staid editors re-
fused to publish them on account of
as it seemed to them their extreme
sensationalism in truth his was a voice
crying in the wilderness

  some of the articles were however
published in a certain section of the
press and some of the lesser magazines
whose editors considered it good for
their sensation-hungry readers although
they themselves took no stock in it
some articles on the subject by others
did appear a little later on in a few of
the technical journals whose content in
the main recognized the scientific possi-
bilities of tomlinsons warning if not
the probabilities and still later a few
scientists and technical experts of note
even went so far as to espouse his ideas
and lent their voice to his but by far
the larger majority of scientific opinion
held aloof refusing to be drawn into a
controversy which if they proved them-
selves wrong might be injurious to
their hard-won reputation a theory was
not a theory until proven

  as time went on however and the
strange phenomenon showed no signs
of abating but on the contrary was
distinctly if not almost perceptibly on
the increase scientists from all over the
world became more and more attracted
to the spot most of them came away
shaking their heads some including not

a few of note were of the opinion that
the danger as pictured by tomlinson
wras too far fetched true the activating
mass buried deep underground with its
vast store of internal energy might
well continue radiating for years had
in a measure already communicated and
would perhaps continue to communicate
its fierce state of atomic disintegration
to other matter previously uneffected
still they did not think in the light of
accepted knowledge of the day that the
process could continue indefinitely but
must gradually thin out and eventually
die out

  as to those scientists of central
europe even if a few did have definite
opinions these were strictly gagged and
muzzled by their policy back home
which had put a tight lid on all freedom
of thought

  dr james tomlinson ground his teeth
it was not the first time that something
new to the wisdom of mankind had to
fight for its life before it was ac-
cepted

 thus the world came and went
each engrossed in his daily round
-the ant heap that saw not the poised
foot

 chapter x

twelve months whizzed by in a
deserted section of the catskill
mountains off the beaten path a
fearful eruption small in area as com-
pared to a natural volcano but incom-
parably fiercer and more terrifying in
the intensity of its ceaseless roaring and
flaming was shaking the mountains
the eruption which starting with the
fall of the gigantic projectile over a
year ago and continuing unabated had
grown slowly but steadily in extent and
ferocity for the last few weeks espe-
cially it had taken on a truly ominous
turn as if it had waxed subter-


amazing stories

raneously as well as on the surface its
gathering strength had all at once burst
out in a mighty upheaval which blew the
entire top off a whole mountain and sent
thousands of tons of rock and gravel
far and wide the temblor of the shock
which accompanied the explosion were
felt over most of the states of new
york connecticut massachusetts new
jersey and the eastern half of penn-
sylvania the roaring and hissing and
electric-like crackling could be heard for
miles and miles and the lurid skies at
night lent a garish light clear to albany
on the north and visible as far as new
york city to the south

  the menace which up to that time had
been receiving slight although gradually
increasing attention by its sudden out-
burst brought itself violently to the pub-
lic eye

  and well it might the heat which
it generated made anything like a near
approach impossible trees and vegeta-
tion within an increased range of twenty
miles scorched and died almost at once
residents and vacationists who thought
themselves within a safe distance fled
for their lives considerable streams of
molten lava flowed down the mountain
sides thick falls of ash and hot cin-
ders buried everything within the danger
zone were carried far afield by the
winds enveloping all was a thick pall
of bright coppery-red smoke capped by
flaming incandescent gases several miles
high through which lightning-like flashes
played and thundered at times during
a sudden rift in the gaseous clouds the
blinding intensity at the core of the dis-
turbance dazzled and overwhelmed the
eye its blueish-white rivaling the sun in
intensity and more immediate the
winds which blew from the affected re-
gion carried a poisonous breath to dis-
tances that spelled deadly danger

  a conference of well known scientists
and practical engineers was called im-

mediately at the behest of the new york
governor to consider ways and means
of fighting the menace curiously enough
the one man who despite his compar-
ative youth understood best the intri-
cate science of atomic physics and knew
most about what could or might be
done was not called upon in the field
of science youth sometimes has its dis-
advantages for it usually takes many
years to gain a solid reputation indeed
one or two of the high state officials
who remembered somewhat vaguely
their being warned the year before of
the coming danger could not even re-
call tomlinsons name and inexcusably
enough did not even think it worth
while to ascertain his identity in view
of the many eminent experts who were
already sitting in

  another priceless month was thus
wasted in fruitless surveys and base-
less plans all of which came to naught

  a number of european and other for-
eign experts including some from the
former enemy were called in they
came saw made their surveys handed
in their expensive bills for their ser-
vices and departed for their homes
openly admitting there was nothing they
could do some held the optimistic view
that natural forces might of them-
selves step in to right the unbalanced
danger zone

  to all of which jim tomlinson in his
study at home would smile grimly and
continue with his own constant studies
toward a solution of the problem

at a congressional session a com-
mittee was appointed with full
power to investigate the situation and
bring hack recommendations as to the
steps that should be taken after dele-
gating this work to a committe and vot-
ing a generous appropriation to care
for a thoroughgoing survey and work-
able plans-as if squelching the eruption
the world aflame



was a routine matter that could be taken
care of by legislation-congress iron-
ically enough turned its attention to
other matters before it which only
proves that even great bodies of serious
men and women convened for serious
purposes can if they lack vision and
proper knowledge be easily shifted from
the all important to the insignificant and
the inconsequential

  again a number of leading scientists
and others were convened by the import-
ant congressional catskills committee
this time dr james tomlinson at the
urgent request of secretary harkness
and several other officials whom he had
formerly approached was also called to
the meeting

  as none of the eminent men present
could offer definite and practical work-
ing plans harvey c bradner the
chairman of the committee prompted
by miss harkness who was also pres-
ent called upon tomlinson to state his
plans

  dr tomlinson the chairman ad-
dressed himself to him as i have been
given to understand you have quite
definite ideas on the problem before
us we should therefore like very much
to hear from you

 mr chairman members of the
committee friends yes i have very
definite ideas on the problem before us
-very definite and what is even more
important practical plans without which
ideas alone wont count without stoop-
ing to point out that certain responsible
leaders whom he had approached long
ago had failed to measure up to the
gravity of the impending danger he
went on to explain the type and manner
of the gigantic works that would now be
required if there was to be any hope of
successfully combating the menace be-
fore coping with it grew absolutely
hopeless then he went on to say

  but unfortunately the cure has been

delayed unreasonably long much longer
than good judgment would warrant and
i for one cannot guarantee an efficacious
cure at this late date however it is
imperative that something be tried and
regardless of the cost the consequences
of failure are too horrible for me to
dwell on

  how much do you estimate the cost
to be one of the committee inquired in
the manner of one deciding on a busi-
ness venture and clearly showing he
had not the slightest grasp nor believed
the danger was as pictured

  well i cannot say exactly but off-
hand i should estimate in the neighbor-
hood of five or six hundred million dol-
lars-possibly a great deal more tom-
linson answered laconically

  the entire committee and others
present jumped as if bitten by a scor-
pion

  how much did you say the chair-
man queried incredulous please state
it again

  five or six hundred million most
likely more

  phew several let out a concerted
whistle

  ovdy five or six hundred million-
a mere trifle walters another com-
mitteeman ejaculated at that rate
guess itll pay to let it burn the whole
catskill area is hardly worth half of
that

  tomlinson rose to his feet a bitter
mocking expression on his fine face
scorn in his voice

  my dear sir addressing himself
bluntly to the congressman who had
thus delivered himself with all due
respect for your position on this im-
portant committee it is plain to see
you dont know what you are talking
about this is not a question of money
or effort but to save the whole world
from going up in flames is that worth
a half or even a whole billion to you


amazing stories

  man alive do you realize what such
a sum is the congressman looked at
tomlinson pityingly those unbusiness-
like scientists talk of billions as if they
were marbles he felt like saying

  yes and i have no illusions that
any of you here will recommend much
less vote any such sum until it is too
late to do any good he answered
scornfully

chapter xi

  and then one day it happened the
- area of atomic disintegration
which up to cow had on the sur-
face kept within certain bounds but had
evidently eaten its way deep into the
bowels of the earth suddenly blew sev-
eral more square miles of mountain to
smithereens huge blocks of rock and
pulverized material some of it danger-
ously incandescent and radioactive
rained down over a wide territory
there came such a terrific flare-up and
earthquaking as to strike terror into mil-
lions of hearts to add to the ferocious-
ness of it all immense quantities of mol-
ten matter and asphyxiating gases
poured forth in true volcanic form out
of the interior of the earth

  from then on the situation became
truly appalling tomlinson who had felt
the shock clear down in washington
hurried at once to the scene but was
unable to approach within more than
twenty miles of the fiery edge of the
disturbance from what he could gather
the heart of the raging inferno had now
grow to at least a half mile in diameter
between slight rifts in the enveloping
clouds of incandescent gas and ashes
there shot forth the stabbing radiations
which were too brilliant to look at the
heat even at a distance of more than
twenty miles was unbearable

  sadly and with fear in his heart his
worst apprehensions now on the road to

realization he returned to his washing-
ton home

  esther met him as he came to the
door one look into his eyes told her
the story

  too late too late was all he said

  she clung fearfully to her husband
jim must we and our kiddies-every-
body    cannot something  is
there no way out hopefully and with
a womans confidence in a capable hus-
band she looked up at him

  he shook his head beyond anything
man can do

  she was brave but the thought of the
horrible fate in store for herself and all
she loved was too much for her she
buried her head against jims shoulder
and cried softly the while he gently
kissed away her tears

  but isnt there some way out she
wailed

  perhaps but not on this earth he
answered quietly

  she lifted her head and looked up at
him with a mixture of startled hope and
fear what do you mean

  this planet is doomed the only
salvation for mankind is to trek to
another

  but jim youre not serious and
a trace of a smile came to her tear-
stained face

  never more serious in my life

  but how where

  that is the problem that will have
to be solved there is no other way
out

they were startled by a sickening
temblor under their feet pictures
shifted on the walls windows rattled
from the dining room came an unnerv-
ing crash as several pieces of china fell
to the floor

  look jim cried pointing a finger
outside a fine gray ash was falling like
snow covering washington with a
the world aflame



ghostly mantle he had noticed it when
he had first disembarked at the air-
port but it was getting much worse
another temblor more severe followed
frightened people some with a shocked
unbelieving expression on their faces
as if doubting their own senses were
scurrying about others stood in uncer-
tainty in excited milling groups

  the visophone rang an officials face
appeared on the screen as esther came
to the receiver

  dr james tomlinson please
tomlinson stepped over to the vis-
ophone

  dr tomlinson your presence is re-
quested at the white house at  a m
to-morrow the president has called
an important meeting of his cabinet and
others please bring all the plans and
important data you may have relative to
the catskill eruptions thank you
when tomlinson arrived at the white
house at the appointed time the session
was almost ready to begin he was di-
rected to the new wing which had
been added a few years before and im-
mediately ushered into the spacious
presidential hall

  as he entered he was surprised to
note the large number present besides
the regular members of the cabinet
everyones eyes turned with ill-concealed
curiosity in his direction rendering the
usually reticent scientist extremely self-
conscious miss harkness shook hands
with him very warmly and introduced
him to some of the notables

  a few minutes later the president
himself came in and the session com-
menced in earnest it was the most his-
torical and in many respects perhaps the
most dramatically strange meeting of
the kind ever held

  tomlinson listened silently to the pre-
liminaries he knew he was signally hon-
ored to be called to such a notable gath-
ering and yet he could scarcely repress

a feeling of frustration of bitterness
the thought came to him why do so
many people wait until the devil him-
self is upon them before they will listen
to reason there came over him a long-
ing for his departed great teacher had
professor mendoza been alive he felt
sure the threat would have received the
proper attention long ago and the dread-
ful emergency might never have come
to pass

  at the end of an hours discussion pro
and con tomlinson was called upon to
speak when he stood up all trace of
nervousness and bitterness was gone
a dramatic silence fell upon the room
it was plain he was the master

 mr president members of
the cabinet friends i am in-
deed glad to have the honor of address-
ing so distinguished a gathering to par-
take in deliberations so vital to the life
of our nation at the same time i feel
constrained to say that i speak with a
heavy heart for nothing that i can say
or do nothing that we can all of us say
or do will avail to alter the fatal course
of circumstances then he went on to
state the case as it stood from the very
beginning to the fatal stage to which it
had been allowed to go continuing

  the neglect can be laid at the door
not only of the public leaders but of the
rank and file of those high in office
who no matter what their other qualifi-
cations have proved themselves woefully
short of imagination ignorant of im-
portant facts of science lacking even
in true intelligence governor sim-
ons of new york coughed and scraped
his feet a crimson spot appeared on
hammonds cheek others looked down
on the floor

  the bogey of money has proved our
undoing a few millions right at the
start could have supplied the necessary
means to put the atomic bomb under

control later on a few hundred mil-
lions more or less might have perhaps
turned the trick bradner and wal-
ters of the former catskills committee
squirmed in their seat but now
he concluded we must face the bitter
truth it is too late at any price

  he sat down amidst a deadly silence
surely the president found voice
to say in his quiet forceful way-
surely it cannot be that our latter-day
science and engineering should acknowl-
edge itself incapable of subduing this
terror which the thoughlessly- cruel and
malicious act of our former enemies has
inflicted on our fair land a way must
be found his powerful and command-
ing personality idol of the nation
breathed an infectious confidence that
seldom failed i am prepared to go
before congress at once and demand un-
limited funds to combat this great evil
which has overtaken us i believe the
might and resources of this great na-
tion should be equal to the task
tomlinson shook his head sadly
mr president i cannot express my
grief in saying this but no power on
earth can stop this thing now the doc-
tor has been called too late all the
money in america will not suffice to
undo what has been done if all the
capital and labor of the entire world
were conscripted even if all mankind
worked as one without stint or let-up
it still would not avail it is dreadful to
admit but the reasons are simple we
could never build the necessary equip-
ment fast enough and powerful enough
right now this very second there is
pouring out of that center of disinte-
gration jn the catskills more energy
many times more than all the energy
and power we could muster against it
with all the science and engineering re-
sources known to man long before we
could even finish the gigantic works that
would be required granting it could be

done which it cannot the area now in
a state of atomic disintegration will have
increased many times faster than any-
thing we could hope to muster to equalize
it my equations which can be checked
by any competent scientist prove this
beyond a peradventure of a doubt

  but the effort must be made-shall
be made and the presidents iron jaw
closed hard

cjome things are beyond man
 whether he wills it or not mr
president members of the cabinet and
friends resign yourselves to meet your
maker my estimate is that in twenty-
five to thirty years at the most life on
earth will have become insupportable
in one hundred to two hundred years
from to-day or sooner long after the
last germ of life has perished off the
face of the earth a small new star com-
panion to the sun will have announced
itself to the rest of the universe its
fiery face lit by man itself there will
then be no man or beast on the lifeless
incandescent earth as it careens around
its parent sun in its yearly pilgrimage

  dr tomlinson paused the disting-
uished gathering remained like par-
alyzed a mingled look of terror and in-
credulity on everyones face after a
long painful silence he continued

  but-there is perhaps one ray of
hope and the only hope no not for
our globe that is doomed finished
make no mistake about that i mean for
humanity a momentary expression of
relief on the part of his listeners gave
way to bepuzzlement the only hope
is-his words came slow and almost a
whisper-a mass migration to another
planet

  there was a slight lifting of the ten-
sion a scraping of feet a faint murmur
everyone present stared hard at the
speaker as if undecided whether to
doubt his sanity of the accuracy of their
the world aflame



hearing a few smiled it must have
struck his listeners as more than odd
almost as if the speaker had allowed
himself an ill-timed jest in the midst of
solemnity

  the president found his voice his
face still solemn but there was a quiz-
zical look in his eyes

  afe you serious dr tomlinson
  utterly

  how pray may such a feat be ac-
complished 

  interplanetary navigation

  but the idea is-er-fantastic to say
the least

  not at all on the contrary quite
possible-if we set ourself to the task
given the will and ample funds a mere
trifle as compared to other items in the
usual governments budget i believe a
way can be found already the necessary
power in the form of atomic energy is
here a little more experimentation and
study and it can be brought to a point
of control where its terrific power in-
stead of destroying us may be utilized
for our salvation for practicable pur-
poses the interplanetary vehicle will
have to be worked out most likely in
some rocket form much work has al-
ready been done in that direction all over
the world more than is realized by the
average layman and with the govern-
ments active interest rapid progress in
that line can be accomplished

  but where would you go

mars    venus    any solar
planet that is found fit for human life
the room became a beehive of voices

chapter xii

three more years dragged by
dread omens-worry and sleep-
less nights for responsible heads
of government for all those who at last
understood loss of life and property to
thousands within a large radius name-

less uneasiness and wondering to the
masses of the north american contin-
ent particularly those living east of the
entire appalachian range notes of
warning by prominent scientists had
appeared in european and other foreign
centers but these were promptly sup-
pressed by their governments out of fear
of creating an uncontrollable panic among
their population

  for there was now no longer any pos-
sible shadow of a doubt in the minds
of those who knew that the prophetic
warnings of dr tomlinson and later of
others which should have received more
intelligent heed long before it was too
late were only too dreadfully true the
ferociously radioactive release of incal-
culable amounts of energy brought
about by the atomic annihilation of thou-
sands of tons of matter the intense rays
and terrific heat of an order totally dif-
ferent from any that mankind had ever
experienced before mere chemical elec-
trical or other forms of energy these
continued to induce a like state in hith-
erto uneffected matter embraced an even
larger and larger territory

  so far the historical council at the
white house three years before from
which so much was expected had proved
a fiasco little good had come from it
outside of panicky and futile efforts to-
ward controlling the danger several
great councils of leading scientists and
practical engineers were convened by
the government these met frequently
and long tomlinsons figures were
checked and rechecked there could be
no doubt about it his contentions were
sustained there was not enough counter
power available in all the worlds coal
and oil and what not-the practically
unlimited amounts of the necessary elec-
tro-magnetic and other equipment with
which to fight the accelerating terror
could not possibly be built in effective
time
amazing stories

  and yet deep down despite the rag-
ing calamity drawing ever nearer and
strange as it may seem to-day the gov-
ernment authorities could not get over
a secret feeling that everything would
come out all right in the end after all
the world was too big it had lasted too
many billions of years if the scientists
were to be believed to suffer such a
fate as pictured it could not be that
god almighty would permit such an un-
thinkable thing it was the old story of
the intense wish being father to the
thought

  about the only good that came from
it all was that dr tomlinson was
granted unlimited means to conduct the
most thorough-going researches into the
problems of atomic energy control in
this tomlinson working day and night
with a corps of able colleagues made
tremendous progress and was well on
the way to devising a practical engine
whose motive power was to come from
the controlled annihilation of tiny quan-
tities of matter but when it came to
taking any stock in his advice that all
efforts should be concentrated toward
developing a practical means of leaving
the planet--that the main authorities
considered as altogether fantastic and
absurd and anyway impossible such a
thing was too much for their training
and powers of imagination

  however later on he was allowed
means to take up seriously the prob-
lems of interplanetary flight but not
till the pressure and active financial sup-
port of influential private citizens and
organizations had taken a hand

  then came another of those savage
spurts in the otherwise slow but steady
advance of the violent disintegration
which blew the entire eastern half of
the catskills out of existence the re-
sults were frightful the entire moun-
tain area and beyond became a flaming

furnace of incandescent gas large
pieces of radioactive matter thrown to
great distances started new centers of
infection the steady desertion of new
york albany new haven philadelphia
and other cities which had been going
on for over a year now gave way to a
mad stampede north and south via land
and air and sea which quickly depop-
ulated a wide swath of the eastern states
for hundreds of miles up and down
only a providential downpour of rain
unusual in amount and duration cooling
the overheated atmosphere prevented a
holocaust right then and there then
too be it said for the authorities some
such outburst was not unexpected and
they were in large part prepared for it
many who could fled oceanward toward
european and other shores

  up to now the government through
its various channels of control had
minimized the extent of the danger in a
mistaken desire to allay the fears of
the populace at large a tight lid was
clamped on to keep as much as possible
the full news of what was transpiring
from reaching the general american pub-
lic they feared the nameless reaction of
an unreasoning mob-psychology the dis-
organization that comes from an up-
rooted population the loosening of social
ties much irretrievable time was thus
frittered away by such tactics instead
of their belated and wasted efforts to
avert a calamity whose hopelessness was
borne in more and more upon those
competent to see the authorities should
have directed themselves long ago
toward a planned and systematic re-
moval of the entire population of the
crowded eastern seaboard to regions
west of the appalachians and not to
have waited until driven out by the
inexorable march of the fiery terror

  when the truth of the inevitable
which faced the american people could
no longer be suppressed or minimized
ttte world aflame



the public explosion which followed was
almost frightening government heads
high and low fell right and left a few
not gently at the hands of enraged
mobs the governor and the entire state
legislature of new york were the most
unhappy butt of the public storm the
president himself his cabinet the
house of representatives and senate
all came in for an unmerciful lashing
from the press the radio and the pulpit
indeed it was fortunate that the public
was given a quick opportunity to let off
steam but two weeks later when the
general elections came the national gov-
ernment and practically all state in-
cumbents everywhere were turned out
bag and baggage cleaner than a whistle

the new president immediately con-
vened congress in a special session
extraordinary with characteristic en-
ergy and the true spirit of a true leader
of men he demanded the immediate pas-
sage of the save america act a
state of extreme emergency was passed
unanimously empowering the president
to take any measure he saw fit

  perhaps now tomlinson remarked
bitterly to esther something will be
done besides methods that were like
squirting toy water-pistols at a forest
conflagration

  with the fire of energy and decision
which characterized him our great pres-
ident spencer at once formed a save
america council composed of the
ablest men in all walks of life with
himself in supreme command he ap-
pointed dr james tomlinson as direc-
tor in chief of the council which had
unlimited power to take whatever steps
were necessary it was announced that
capital and labor should immediately
prepare themselves for conscription as
needed there was to be no dilly-dally-
ing evasion- or chiseling of any kind
the situation could brook nothing like

that and a firing squad would attend to
obstructionist tactics

  this had an immense calming effect
on the entire public

  the council set itself to the twin
tasks first the completion of a prac-
tical mechanism that could control and
utilize the awful jinni of atomic energy
at once the death-threat and the possible
saviour of mankind it alone could fur-
nish the tremendous energy in small
bulk that was needed to take large
masses from the gravitation of the earth
second a practical means or space-ship
to take a party of intrepid explorers on
voyages of inter-planetary discovery to
find if possible a new home for human-
ity tomlinsons estimate was that only
about twenty-five years perhaps still
remained in which to accomplish this
almost superhuman task before the earth
became unfit for life

  as to the former that is an effec-
tive atomic-energy engine except for
certain important refinements which
would come as a practical certainty with
a little more time tomlinson had by
now virtually solved the great problem
of the latter that is an effective vessel
for taking a party into interplanetary
space that had to be almost completely
worked out

  in the meantime the immediate plans
as adopted by the council under tom-
linsons able leadership called for a
series of high and mighty walls two to
three miles in height and spaced some
two hundred miles apart to be erected
west of the appalachians these were
only partly for the purpose of tempor-
arily stemming the rivers of molten mat-
ter what was of supreme importance
these would serve to deflect the hot
poisonous breath of the terror and con-
fine as much as possible the fearful
clouds of incandescent gas the over-
whelming quantities of pulverized mat-
ter the cinders and the ashes that were

carried to great distances inland with
every shift of the winds

  as the atomic conflagration bit ever
westward north and south inevitably
overwhelming these walls others to be
constructed far in advance would take
up the burden of holding back if only
for a time the devastating breath of
death

  gas-proof suits and gas-masks were
also distributed to the entire population
with training in their proper use to-
gether with sufficient fire-proof places
to house everyone in case of a sudden
shift in the hot gases immense reserves
of food and other necessities were
stored west of the rockies the uprooted
population of the east were settled and
cared for most admirably and with as-
tonishing order the entire industrial
machine had to be almost reorganized
the fortitude and the orderly manner
with which the uprooted millions ad-
justed themselves to the unprecedented
calamity was the wonder of the world

chapter xiii

thus matters stood at the end
of the fifth year the fiery cancer
which was slowly consuming the
earths substance continued its march
in an ever widening circle for some un-
explained cause it moved seaward more
rapidly than in other directions it
marched to the edge of the hudson
obliterated the mighty river in clouds of
dense steam filled its bed with white hot
lava and overflowed eastward the entire
seaboard from massachusetts to virginia
was covered by the molten flow the
capital of the nation fled to chicago
hissing rivers of lava emptied into the
atlantic steaming clouds blew east-
ward

  so far south america europe and
the other continents remained untouched
distance lent a sense of security the

ruling authorities across the seas true to
their ancient conception of what was
best kept their peoples in as much
ignorance of the deadly menace raging
on the american continent as possible
editors were prohibited under pain of
arrest and confiscation from printing
the full news of what was going on in
france and free england switzerland
and the scandinavian countries where
the glorious spirit of freedom kept its
head and saving sense-there the public
followed with interest and apprehension
and sympathy the news from their
stricken sister democracy across the seas

  russia and asia africa and australia
felt themselves too far removed to be-
come immediately concerned and some-
how in the minds of almost everybody
abroad there was a strong belief that
the mighty atlantic and pacific would
prove effectual barriers and confine the
fiery cancer to the western continent
keen observers and students of science
with great misgiving kept a close eye on
what would happen when the real edge
of the atomic vortex first reached the
shielding waters of the atlantic

  to jolt the peoples of other lands out
of their false sense of security dr
tomlinson and the save america coun-
cil by special and open appeals through
whatever channels the authorities over
there allowed pleaded with those who
would listen to make haste and follow
the american efforts toward finding a
way of escape from the earths confines

  only about twenty-five years more at
the most remain before the earths at-
mosphere will have become unfit to
breathe even if the atomic disintegration
does not attack every continent in that
time tomlinson pleaded my fellow
men make haste while there is yet time

  to this plea the british isles and
france responded immediately by em-
barking on the construction of mighty
steel and concrete walls on the wester-
the world aflame



most shores two miles or more in height
similar in design to those erected in
america to deflect the poisonous breath
which was coming similar bulwarks
was begun on the northnorth-east
shores of south america

out never was a false sense of se-
curity more rudely shocked than
was that indulged in by most of the
inhabitants of other countries partic-
ularly those masses whose guiding au-
thorities had kept them mostly in the
dark well-meaning or otherwise

  long before the atomic fires finally
reached the edge of the atlantic the
terrifice heat of the rays still miles
away caused the shore waters to boil
and steam furiously the raising of
huge clouds of white steam prevented
ocean-going air or water vessels from
touching any but far northern or south-
ern portions of the united states east-
ern shores and when the real activat-
ing edge of the disintegration which had
eaten its way many miles deep into the
earths vitals began to bite underneath
the ocean floor there came such an erup-
tion as to strike terror even greater than
what had gone before the shock was
felt clear around the globe hundreds
of square miles of ocean bottom blew
up and became a seething incandescent
inferno that roared upward to the strat-
osphere under the disintegrating forces
the oxygen and hydrogen of the oceans
waters disassociated and united again
and again in tremendous and continuous
explosions

  the long felt security of the euro-
peans and others was shattered all at
once an appalling tidal wave which
resulted from the last upheaval struck the
european continent followed by dense
clouds of water vapor mingled with
volcanic dust and poisonous gases the
unprepared multitudes especially of coun-
tries bordering the sea paid dearly

  in their rage and feeling themselves
duped the populace of central and
southern europe spain and portugal
turned upon their rulers in that raging
fashion in which people unaccustomed
to the liberal methods of true democ-
racies often turn upon their dictatorial
rulers and ruling classes the timely
action of the british and french how-
ever in building the great sheltering
walls finished not a day too soon for-
tunately broke the full fury of the tidal
waves which struck their shores deflected
the sulphurous winds and thus saved
their countries from preventable losses
torrents of warm rain fell and fell and
from then on continued to fall often and
heavily

  as for the teeming millions of china
india and other parts of the world far
removed if they thought of it at all
they must have thought of the calamities
which had befallen their western broth-
ers in much the same way in which the
westerns had always viewed the recur-
ring famines floods and other disasters
which had afflicted the oriental peoples
for generations back too bad but noth-
ing they could do about it who is
the person who gets excited aside from
mild sympathy over the afflictions of
people unrelated to him in blood and
culture whom he never met as for the
backward natives in the hinterlands of
south america africa and other far
places these went on in blissful ig-
norance of the coming fate or if they
heard something about what was trans-
piring they shrugged their shoulders as
if it were no business of theirs

the first active breath of the fiery
terror which reached continental
europe which should have immediately
prompted them to unite in a common
brotherly defense against whatever
threatened caused instead stupefaction
selfish bickerings and wide-spread dis-


amazing stories

cord all the evils of centuries of in-
tolerance animosity and prejudice and
unreasoning hatreds rose to the sur-
face instead of helping each other
the general tendency in many quarters
at first seemed to be to let the devil take
the hindmost those that could fled to
the safer reaches of more easterly lands
much valuable time was lost improperly
caring for those who through frequent
and disastrous hurricanes and tidal
waves were made homeless and still
more valuable time was lost irrevocably
before everybody at last woke up to the
necessity of organizing for the great in-
evitable and of erecting a series of high
protecting walls and the preparing of
the general populace against the gaseous
winds which began to blow the subject
of finances that specter of the civiliza-
tion of those times caused much delay
red tape and inexcusable blundering
as well as selfish and shortsighted seek-
ing of private gain in the face of cal-
amity

  as tomlinson remarked to esther one
day during the few hours he allowed
himself for rest those people remind
me of a man who has a weapon aimed
straight at his heart but still refused
to surrender his pocket-book what
deprivation and suffering many people
will stand for before parting with
money

  how much longer the delays and
bickerings of those in control of the de-
luded countries would have gone on no
one can say but the deadly progress of
the earths cancer did not hesitate to
wake them up none too gently the fiery
consummation progressing in all three
dimensions not merely on the surface
affected the ages-old stability of the
rocky layers of the earth in many widely
scattered sectors unexpectedly and like
a bolt from the blue a number of belch-
ing volcanoes burst out all over central
europe in places that had never known

such things before at the same time
practically every known volcano on
earth including some long since extinct
beside many new ones burst into fur-
ious activity

  at last the whole world woke up the
thing was at their door

chapter xiv

it was the tenth year in every civ-
ilized land earnest able men labored
to shield themselves as best they
could from the fiery consummation the
greatest brains worked incessantly on
the problems of successful interplanetary
flight the free interchange of thought
and new discovery all went toward the
conquest of the imperative world prob-
lem

  laboring mightily with all the force
of his great genius james tomlinson
having finally conquered the problem of
an atomic energy power plant then con-
centrated all his energies on the vehicular
method best suited for reaching another
planet with unlimited power available
in the compact form of controlled atomic
energy the most obvious vehicle was the
rocket principle long recognized but
never fully developed coordinating the
many refinements and improvements and
endless experiments of many master
minds dr tomlinson at last succeeded
in constructing the first rocket-type en-
gine capable of a flight through the
void

  it was a great day for the harassed
and thoroughly frightened people of the
world when he announced the first trial
flight this took tomlinson and his aides
several thousand miles from the earth
and was entirely successful

  in a great speech over the visoradio
at the conclusion of the flight he urged
that now not a moment should be lost
in constructing as many vessels as
needed to transport the worlds popula-
the world aflame



tion including the necessary supplies
and other things desirable the time is
short and universal unselfish devotion
to the cause is imperative if salvation
is to come everyone must not give their
mite but their all lest we each and all
perish

  but the defeatist spirit residing with-
in a large number of individuals would
not altogether down why add to our
present miseries voiced many a critic
by undertaking such a vast amount of
construction before a suitable planet is
found perhaps the idea of other
worlds is a myth and all our efforts will
be in vain what then admittedly the
solar planets are our only hope for even
if other planets existed in far-off stellar
systems there can be no hope of bridg-
ing the vast distances in ample time but
what if after the solar planets were
reached which still remains to be
achieved and these are found uninhab-
itable why plunge the world into a
frenzy oi construction only perhaps to
be followed by disillusionment and the
dreadful reaction that will come from
futility

  to this tomlinson and his supporters
replied even if the quest for a habitable
world should prove unsuccessful there
was nothing to lose by the immediate
construction of vast fleets of space ves-
sels improvement would thus follow
improvement at any rate if a habitable
new world should be found as there
was every reason to hope then the im-
mediate construction of sufficient ves-
sels to remove the earths population
was imperative and might not otherwise
be completed in time

  it is remarkable to what depths of
stubborn foolishness some men will be
carried by ignorance demoralization and
the defeatist feeling and indeed there
were large numbers throughout the
world who could make no sense of such
a fantastic idea as the bodily transporta-

tion of all humanity to some far-off
twinkling star to such people a star
call it planet or otherwise had always
been a star just a blinking point of
light for star-gazers to rave over and
poets to laud but as an abode of life
a possible homeland for humanity-
in fact many people declared they did
not believe such a thing as getting up
there possible there was a large
school the religious fanatics who were
more or less openly against any such
tinkering to thwart the will of god
others of whom there were not a few
doubted to the very last if the total de-
struction of such a large body as our
earth would ever come to pass these
predicted that tomlinson and all the
wise ones as they were dubbed in
some quarters would be confounded
when in the end god did not forget
his children opposite were those who
saw in this disaster the coming of the
true end of the wicked world and
many a pulpit thundered against a sin-
ful humanity and the deserved coming
of this last and final and greatest sodom
and gemorah

  esther spoke up her husband one
day did you ever see a burning stable
filled with frightened animals refusing
to be taken out

  no but ive heard of it
fortunately however by far the vast
majority of the more clear-headed and
the practical were in the saddle and the
work was driven through without further
stint of effort

  above the haunting fear and dread
l  sounded a clear clarion note of
hope great excitement prevailed but
it was a different kind of excitement
that for the time almost drowned out
the inexpressible terror that clutched
at every heart the lilting tones of a
possible deliverance somehow communi-
cated itself to the mass-soul of all the


amazing stories

people throughout the entire world

  the first of the great atom-driven
rocket-ships that was to span the il-
limitable spaces in search of a new home
for despairing mankind was at last fin-
ished the news ran like the proverbial
wild-fire the entire world was elec-
trified ah something definite tangible
at last

  first to complete the hitherto thought-
of-as-impossible mechanism that could
turn the trick was dr tomlinson and
his capable colleagues to america the
first and so far the greatest sufferer
went the glory and the honor of a new
and greater kind of leadership

  from the great roofless take-off
platform in the outskirts of chicago the
mighty spaceship was ready to be
launched into space a public holiday
of thanksgiving was proclaimed the
people by the hundreds of thousands
came to see the new miracle which man
had wrought

  with dr tomlinson himself in com-
mand despite the protests of those who
claimed his life was too valuable to
humanity to risk the most vitally im-
portant expedition in all history was
awaiting the moment of take-off the
personnel besides a trained crew in-
cluded a company of the most promi-
nent scientists and specialists in many
fields

  the goal decided upon was the planet
mars the ancient planet of war but now
a welcome sight in the heavens mars
was chosen as the objective of the first
expedition because of its then being
nearest in its orbit and because of its
apparent similarity except in size to
its sister planet the earth just then at
opposition near perihelion which occurs
every fifteen to seventeen years the
ruddy planet was shining with extraordi-
nary brilliance and only about -

	miles distant a long journey in-
deed  but at the speed of which the ves-

sel was capable this was a distance that
could be covered in a few weeks or less

at a wave of tomlinsons hand the
 great ship took off smoothly and
swiftly the propulsion coming from
flaming exhausts of incandescent gas
generated by the atomic engines the
initial rate of speed was easily regulated
due to the enormous power available
the take-off therefore though swift
was comparatively slow thus avoiding
the danger and discomfort which a too
sudden release would bring those who
were present at the epochal event will
never forget the dramatic scene in a
few minutes the huge space-ship became
an invisible speck to be seen only through
a powerful glass

  soon to follow under the command
of oliver maywell one of tomlinsons
chief assistants was another vessel a
twin sister ship which was rapidly near-
ing completion its goal was venus when
she approached inferior conjunction
other expeditions were being rushed to
take the place of the first two in case
something went wrong

  across the seas the british the
french and the italians were working
might and main not to be outdone in the
race for carving out their share of a new
world utilizing the successful principles
first devised by tomlinson to which they
added ideas of their own they were not
far behind their american rivals their
expeditions not long afterwards fol-
lowed in the depths of space

  spanish efforts were severely ham-
pered by their belated erection of pro-
tective barriers and the terrific tidal
waves which struck far inland one after
the other with disastrous force the
great technical genius of germany was
unfortunately lost to the world during
those trying times on account of the
violent volcanoes which burst out in
that land in overwhelming numbers
the world aflame



driving practically the entire population
eastward

 the u s s r with their high
geared industrial machine their country
so far the least touched of any nation
in europe set themselves the task in
addition to two separate expeditions to
mars and venus of discovering what
the favorable conditions were for set-
tling on the jovian or saturnian satel-
lites particularly saturns titan almost
half the size of mars to cover such stu-
pendous distances as the outlying solar
system presented within reasonably short
time they counted on the special high
velocities to which they claimed their
ships could accelerate

  japan though as yet untouched by the
direct force of the atomic terror was
suffering almost as severely indirectly by
one continuous horror of earthquakes
flaming volcanoes and mountainous tidal
waves the terrific pressure of the
force that was eating its way deep into
the earth was causing vast dislocations
in many parts far removed from the
immediate center of disturbance the
japanese too in spite of all handicaps
were but little behind in the race for
interplanetary conquest one of their
objectives on the way to the solar plan-
ets was a stop-over on our moon the
practical japs were not going to over-
look any bet so close to home if a way
could be found to colonize the sup-
posedly airless satellite

  india was also hard at work prepar-
ing an expedition to mars or venus nor
was china neglecting her share in the
general race for salvation

  altogether there was an intense but
friendly rivalry to get there first but
under the surface although not openly
admitted the various governments had
a keen eye toward carving out the choice
portions of whatever planet or planets
if and when they got there that was
worth carving out for their teeming mil-

lions the great stakes aside from the
dire necessity for escape were worth
racing for and lightened the burdens of
despair even in his moments of great-
est peril the economic instincts of the
acquisitive human animal could not be
altogether downed perhaps so much the
better

chapter xv

a prayerful humanity filled
with new hope settled down to
await the return of the various
expeditions as one after another de-
parted from their respective homelands

  anxious days uncertainty suspense
was americas lot after tomlinsons ex-
pedition departed particularly as their
country embraced the center of the
fiery cancer five millions of miles out
their velocity having accelerated to over
ten miles per second their powerful
radio transmission system could not
make itself felt on earth from then on
the silence of infinite space swallowed
them up

  the american sister vessel which fol-
lowed two months later bound for the
planet venus which was drawing near
to the earth took off the very same day
as the first british expedition with
venus the latters goal also some days
later they were followed by a french
rocket-ship much larger and said to be
better equipped than any of the others
and the month following the union of
soviet socialist republics dispatched
two separate expeditions into the great
void with japan and india close on their
heels from then on from various of
the civilized nations of the burning
globe one expedition followed the other
bound for the various likely planets or
their satellites with each regardless
under what flag went the hopes and the
prayers of all humanity an anxious
world awaited the return of these first
argonauts of space


amazing stories

  six months later despair was eating
at every heart so far not one of the
expeditions had returned not a word
not a signal of any kind every instru-
ment every telescope was trained heaven-
ward to all intents and purposes they
were as completely swallowed up in the
immensities of space as if they had
never existed other expeditions that
bravely set out to find what had become
of their lost brothers were as com-
pletely swallowed up

 tomlinson was now many months
overdue it gave the entire world a sick-
ening feeling a sense of frustration
the spirits of humanity fell to the low-
est possible level was the conquest of
space to prove an impossible feat after
all-a chimera of the tortured soul of
man the reaction was on the point of
taking a fatal turn

then suddenly just when all the
expeditions were given up for lost
and the mourning was universal the
world was electrified by the safe return
of tomlinsons expedition of all those
who had departed with such high hopes
his was the only one ever to return all
the others with the later on exception
of the japanese were never more heard
from several as was learned long after-
wards had crashed fatally in the act of
landing others had evidently been un-
able to take off again for the return
journey to earth still others must have
lost control and continued on endlessly
into the depths of space or perhaps
met with some unknown collision or
other accident the japanese expedi-
tion had partially crashed on the moon
and had been unable to take off again
they were later found and rescued by a
belgian party that was exploring the
satellite just as the japs were about to
perish from lack of air and water

  these first disasters of interplanetary
travel were the unavoidable price which

all pioneering adventurers have always
had to pay much of it was due to the
lack of astronautical experience ac-
curate charting of the abysmal depths of
space is a new science highly compli-
cated the swift movements of the
heavenly bodies made it quite easy for
the tyro to miss his mark by many mil-
lions of miles perhaps forcing a long
chase after the retreating globe which is
apt to prove disastrous it is also very
important to learn how to avoid the in-
numerable small and large bodies which
circle about the sun or the various plan-
ets a collision with any of these mov-
ing at cosmic velocities spells finish
instantly

  another most important factor that
counted heavily against the unfortunate
first expeditions were certain serious
defects in the construction of these
earliest space ships a similar fate had
come within an ace of snatching tom-
linsons expedition also although his
vessel had succeeded in landing safely
on mars it was not without a severe
crash due to trouble which had unex-
pectedly developed with the control sys-
tem fortunately and partly due to
tomlinsons supreme genius their equip-
ment and preparations were such that
they were able at last to effect the neces-
sary repairs in time although not until
after several months of agonizing un-
certainty

  with the safe return of his expedi-
tion however it was now possible to iron
out most of the serious unlooked for
defects in the new science and art of
space ship construction as well as the
better to avoid the errors incident to
astral navigation

tomlinson reported that mars
was habitable although far from
being an ideal planet for the needs of
a transplanted mankind for one thing
too large a proportion of its available
the world aflame



surface was a hopeless desert the col-
onizable areas entirely too limited for
the full life of the teeming terrestrial
millions second the water supply
though ample was badly distributed
most of it confined to the frozen polar
caps and would require an immense
amount of engineering before it could
be made available on the needed scale
rainfall was very scanty and practically
non-existent over large portions of the
planet the air was very thin and dry
and much like that on the highest moun-
tains on earth then there were the
terrifically cold winters about twice as
long as the terrestrial the martian per-
iod of revolution at a mean distance of
 y million miles from the sun is
 days although the daily rotation in
 hours and  minutes and the axial
inclination is practically the same as
the earths

  there were of course the peculiar draw-
backs due to its small size only 
miles in diameter and the still more pe-
culiar conditions incident to its small
mass which is only about one-ninth that
of earth but tomlinson was overjoyed
to find there was life on the ruddy
planet although it proved to be of a
very low order and of vegetable type
confined chieflv to certain narrow tracts


traversed by the summer-time streams
fed from the polar caps all in all the
planet was not a very inviting world

  but it was something and under the
stern lash of necessity it is surprising
what can be done if nothing better
turned up the red planet could be made
to do for the atmosphere even if
rarefied was fairly invigorating and for-
tuntely adaptable to mans nature
of water an ample supply could be
achieved with the aid of art and science
despite the severe conditions imposed
by most of the available supply being
impounded in the polar caps much gen-

eral preparatory work of course would
be required

not content however tomlinson
immediately announced his plans
for another and greater expedition to
venus the cloud-enshrouded planet
would shortly again approach inferior
conjunction and be at its nearest

  his plans for this new expedition
were on a much more ambitious scale
it comprised six of the largest and new-
est type atomic-power driven rocket-
ships which incorporated all the best
ideas gained from his previous voyage
without the defects which had proved so
disastrous to all the others and which
was well nigh fatal to his own alto-
gether over eight hundred men departed
on this great expedition

  and successful it proved to be this
time venus the evening star at near-
est inferior conjunction-only about

	miles away-proved an easy
conquest five of the expeditions fleet
of six vessels spanned the distance in
only fifteen days landing safely in
perfect condition the sixth unfor-
tunately was lost in a meteoric storm
something that with experience could
in the future be avoided

  venus as explored by tomlinson re-
vealed itself to be a raw young world
lifeless and uninhabited this was at
first sight very disappointing but after
closer study the planet was found to
have tremendous possibilities in its favor
as a future homeland for outside of
life itself which had never developed
there the planet contained within itself
practically all the essentials for life as
required by terrestrial creatures

  almost the same size as its sister
planet the earth or to be exact 
miles in diameter with a somewhat
larger proportion of ocean covered sur-
face and large copious watered contin-
ents it offered according to tomlinson


amazing stories

and his colleagues a fit world for col-
onization far preferable to the small
and arid martian planet to be sure the
atmosphere was heavy and quite below
the oxygen content to which human be-
ings were accustomed but far from de-
ficient with time and the agencies of
transplanted vegetation and human art-
ifice this could be brought up to the de-
sired content adaptation too if need
be could be relied on the temperature
of course due to its nearness of -

	miles from the sun was hot and
humid but this was considerably com-
pensated for by the thick envelope of
moisture laden clouds which prevented a
great deal of the killing heat from reach-
ing the surface an important drawback
was the excessive amount of carbonic
acid gas but not dangerously so it could
in fact be turned to advantage as con-
ducive to a rapid and luxuriant growth
of transplanted vegetation a number of
years of intensive preparation and pion-
eering work would be required before
a general trans-migration of the human
masses could begin

  altogether however and in spite of
other drawbacks such as the long days
and nights and the unequal seasons and
temperatures which prevailed the planet
should prove a fit place for an up-
rooted humanity anyhow it was the
best there was to offer and there was
every reason for a dispossessed mankind
to be grateful for this gift of the
heavens

  tomlinson further reported that be-
fore leaving venus he had staked
out in the name of the united states of
america a continental mass in keeping
with the power and needs of his country
the other countries of earth were free
to stake theirs first come first served

  subsequent expeditions which shortly
afterwards explored not only venus but
practically all the other solar bodies
agreed that venus was incomparably the

best bet although mars too could be
colonized after a fashion especially by
the highland races accustomed to a dry
and rarefied atmosphere

  then began a feverish race to build
rocketships and still more rocketships
time was short the fatal days when
life on earth would no longer be sup-
portable was drawing shockingly near-
fifteen to twenty years at the most

  and there was in very truth a whole
world of things to be done a most
stupendous and to many a seemingly
hopeless task what of the few brief years
remaining made still harder by the han-
dicaps presented by the already dislo-
cated conditions on earth

  first of all there was the necessity of
outfitting vast pioneer organizations for
the arduous and tremendous preparatory
work on the new homeland before the
first of earths teeming millions could
even begin to be moved to break the raw
ground for the masses that would follow
as fast as with safety and with reason
under the lash of necessity they could
be transported and settled

  powerful electrolytic plants were the
first thing to be set up in various parts
of the new world to release vast
amounts of free oxygen from the abund-
ant ocean waters the disassociated hy-
drogen would have to be expelled into
space to avoid dangerous explosions
the lifeless soil had to be prepared and
fertilized this in itself would have been
an almost insurmountable task in the
short time remaining were it not for the
inconceivably great power now available
through the controlled use of atomic
energy the vegetable kingdom without
which human or other life could not ex-
ist had to be rooted in the new world
billions of seedlings planted a compre-
hensive system of forestation domestic
and useful animals and birds moved to
their new habitat rivers and lakes and
the world aflame



oceans stocked with edible and useful
fish and other of the multitudinous mar-
ine forms necessary for a full and happy
life even the useful but invisible bac-
teria and other necessary micro-organ-
isms which did not exist on venus had
to be transferred to it in this the great-
est care had to be taken not to include
the destructive forms which had in-
flicted mankind on earth also desir-
able wild life animal and vegetable
those that flew or ran or crawled fruits
and flowers-in short everything neces-
sary for the complete life-cycle as it
went on on earth

  the task was overwhelming in its im-
mensity but the cruel lash of necessity
drove a frenzied humanity on and on and
the toil such an undertaking required
which ordinarily would have taken cen-
turies to complete was crowded through
in a few years nothing now mattered
but brains and brawn and skill and the
ability to stand the utmost number of
grueling hours of work and hardship
the entire populations were called upon
from the little children who could con-
tribute their tiny mite to the doddering
oldsters work and still more work was
demanded finance and ownership and
hours and what not so dear a part of
the pre-catastrophic age were thrown
overboard as so much useless baggage
fortunately too venus was as rich as the
earth in all the minerals and metals and
other necessary elements

  nor was artificial spur necessary to

the time was near with the vast
engineering and prepartory work
on the new world still far from
complete although more and larger ar-
mies of frenzied workers were trans-
ported and thrown into the work with
the flaming disintegration approaching a
planetary crisis it became imperative
for the wholesale transportation of the
earths masses to begin that could not
be put off another day as fast as ships
were rushed to completion humanity and
necessary supplies streaked venusward
and the ships returned for more there
was no time for niceties the main thing
was speed and more speed with safety as
the imperative goal

  and as rapidly as the first masses
fortunate to escape from the earth were
settled and organized on the new home-
land by their respective governments
they too continued at the herculean task
of planetary preparation of home-build-
ing of fabricating and manning the
endless number of rocket ships needed
to remove their terror-stricken fellow
men who awaited their turn to be taken
the populations still remaining on earth
more or less disorganized and demor-
alized were less and less able to help
themselves unspoken was the fear that
the work of escape for all those millions
who still remained might at any mo-
ment become impossible

  came the critical months the end
was not far off the work of rescue and
removal became ever more difficult mil-
lions still remained to be moved espe-
cially the more backward peoples who
lived in countries less advanced in the
arts of civilization and were therefore

almost incapable of effecting an escape
through their own efforts many of these
unfortunates it was feared were
doomed and about to pay the supreme
penalty for their low state of develop-
ment in the arts and sciences

  the air became increasingly bad
necessitating the constant wearing of gas
masks and protective suits the heat
was torturesome scarcely relieved by
the now incessant downpour of hot rain
none of those still remaining could
longer aid in the work or even help
themselves the work of rescue from
now on had to be altogether directed and
carried out from the new homeland

in the midst of these last frenzied ef-
forts with the vast work of re-
moval almost complete there came a ter-
rific explosion that rocked the earth
from pole to pole the ferocious disin-
tegration which by now had worked al-
most half way across the floor of the
atlantic suddenly lifted thousands of
square miles of sea bottom in one vast
upheaval that sent flaming elements
hundreds of miles into space showering
the entire remaining surface of the earth

  it was the beginning of the end an
appalling hurricane of dust and gaseous
moisture soon enveloped the entire
planet blotting out the sun completely
the tortured surface heaved and rolled
tidal waves truly mountainous in height
swept everything that was not at a
higher altitude

  to the very last moment the heroic
work of succor went on into the thick
of it directing guilding planning was
james tomlinson without rest or sleep
as supreme head of the international
great council he had given orders that
the work should continue until the very
last man and beast shall have been re-
moved as long as there was any pos-
sible chance happily with the exception
of some unfortunate primitive inhabi-
the world aflame



tants of mountain jungle and desert who
could not be reached the great work
was done the fiery hurricane then
forced the last of the recuers to leave
    

high above the thick fiercely crim-
son clouds which enshrouded the
eastern hemisphere of the burning earth
james tomlinson in his great rocket-
flyer hovered his heart was heavy and
sad it was sure death to venture more
unto the surface

  with a sigh he signalled the vast
rescue fleets some laden with man and
beast of earth some unhappily empty
there was nothing more to do they
streaked away toward their new home

  arriving high above the cloud-cov-
ered surface of venus and about to
brake in a long spiral preparatory to
landing tomlinson now a man with
greying hair looked back at the dis-
tant globe which for so many countless
aeons had been the sheltered home of
terrestrial life he could scarcely be-

lieve that all this had actually happened
it seemed more like the substance of a
realistic dream he gazed long and ar-
dently at the tragic yet brilliant spectacle
presented by terra aflame the great
dazzling spot formed by the main cen-
ter of the atomic vortex stood out al-
most sun-like in its brilliancy

  through his mind flashed the closing
words of his long departed great teacher
before that class so many years ago   
that warning prophecy   

  stricken terra great giver of life
mother of man victim of thy own crea-
ture that being with the mind as of a
god yet with a heart that is not from
now on thy sister planet will take up
the work which thou hast finished

  then a feeling of happiness surged
through him a feeling of work well
done eagerly he dipped the prow of his
rocketship below the friendly mantle of
white clouds which draped the new
homeland all that he held most dear
was now safely housed on its rich
surface

by robert page preston

we are now concluding this serial and it is enough to say in these few
lines that the end justifies the means it departs a little bit from the spirit
of the proverb because the means have been extremely good and we know
the readers will enjoy the interesting climax of this story so skillfully

brought about by the author

conclusion

ti-san and his brother mu-
kan had put over the idea
of domesticating the troad and
hundreds of the beasts were
being trained in agriculture
and for use in war the soil was now
turned by steel-tipped plows instead of
being scratched with a stick as hereto-
fore when these beasts are captured
young they assimilate their training
easily but the adult beasts either break
free and return to the forests or else
sulk eventually i expected that they
would play an important part in the
defense of the nation

  the drilling of the army occupied a
certain period of each day at some
time or other we expected to make
energy guns for all at the present time
they depended mostly upon the bow and
arrow archery had been developed to a
surprising degree of efficiency our army
was built around a small corps of gun-
ners using the weapons that we had
brought from earth supplemented by
aerial attack with the ship in addition
we had a force of nearly a thousand
cavalrymen mounted on troads the
rest of the army was composed of archers
with an assortment of types of bows from
the huge cross-bows with a range of
over a thousand yards down to the less

powerful but far faster long bow all
the men were equipped with a short
spear and sword it had been a long
time since any of the sen lev had been
sighted near the settlement but i felt
sure that with a man such as ig for
their leader we would hear from them
at some time nor was i wrong

  the women of the nation took a
greater share of the task of teaching i
found time to make occasional visits
to these classes and we spent many
hours in writing down for them as
much as we could of the sciences that
we knew all work was done on a
substance similar to slate which be-
came as important in the lives of these
children as their notebooks to the scholars
of earth in the course of time the king
and his leaders expected to find some
substance that would play the part of
paper but at present they wrere con-
cerned with getting as much knowledge
as possible in a short time in a few
short months they had obtained a
knowledge of the most important steps
in the ladder of progress they had a
knowledge of architecture the use of the
metals the domestication of animals
weapons and a knowledge of military
tactics and most important of all an al-
phabet and the power to put thought into

amazing stories

form fully elaborated and indestructible

  for centuries our ancestors on earth
had struggled with these problems be-
fore they had mastered them then to be
retarded for countless years when our
world had been lost in a maze of super-
stitions and unnecessary wars in this
region of mercury there is no definite
night or day which is perhaps the rea-
son why superstition plays no important
part in the lives of these people for
night is the time of mystery when the
mind of man conjures pictures of evil
spirits and evil deeds i have often
thought that this is the reason that there
is no counterpart of the evil spirit in
the religion of these men nor anything
that is similar to hades we have never
tried to alter these beliefs

  during these months i had insisted
upon a patrol far beyond the limits of
the valley the king had laughed but
consented even hughes was inclined to
believe that i was overcautious but i
had persisted and obtained this guard
that in the last few weeks had become
much more efficient mounted on the
tireless troads for the same reason i
had insisted upon the speeding up of the
completion of the high voltage barrier
that surrounded the domain they
seemed to believe that bested in a small
skirmish with only a few of their avail-
able men in action the men of the land
of darkness would leave us alone i did
not believe this i had seen their chief
ig and knew that he had far more in-
telligence and ambition than the average
dar also i had seen the look of en-
during hate that he had bestowed upon
bill and me when he had parted from
us on that night so long ago

  as was my custom i had emerged
from the terminals of the city one day
and climbed to the mountain top to
watch the signals of the guards upon
the range to the eastward i never tired
of studying the sharp contours of the

land accentuated by the shortened hori-
zon the colors of the leafless trees
and the surface vegetation mystified by
the hazy light it was perpetual twilight

  through my glasses i picked up the
flash of signal-pistols sen-lev the
lights flashed many many of them

  ti-dan i shouted to the captain of
the guard a fleet runner to the king
and the white giant bring the war-
riors here with all equipment hordes
of the barbarians are attacking so make
haste

  one of the fastest messengers de-
parted for the city below i turned my
glasses again eastward over the plain
came a warrior mounted on one of the
steeds i marveled at the speed of the
beast and the natural skill of the rider
fast as a swift horse would travel they
came unhindered by the rough ground
and the bad light he was carrying a
special message i surmised

  call the scouts in ti-dan we do
not wait but will attack as an army
first however we must learn how many
we face and where we shall meet them

  the vereans were assembling now
among the first to arrive were sen eo
bill and dianna she was commander
of the reserve forces an army in itself
composed entirely of verean maidens
who demand equal rights in battle as in
the other walks of life to men un-
familiar with their customs as bill and
i were this might seem wrong to the
people of sen ver it was but natural
they have done so since the beginning
and do not draw the lines of sex very
finely while not as strong as the male
the women are oftentimes more alert
and they stand the hardships of a
campaign to an amazing degree possibly
the action of battle instills in their
hearts a true hatred of bloodshed which
is passed on to the young for all of
them detest slaughter a strange para-
dox desiring peace above all things
land of twilight



yet their very existence depends upon
their ability to fight i hoped that soon
the time would come when they would
not find it necessary to be always ready
to do battle when they could pursue the
occupations of normal men as they
wished to do

  the crew had gone to their posts in
the ship which was always ready to
take off i lingered to speak with hughes
and the king i will scout their posi-
tion from the air they must still be a
great distance away i will report to you
in the passes of the first range of moun-
tains since it is agreed that we shall
await the sen lev there and attack from
that point

  happy landings partner said bill

  i turned to board the ship to find
dianna waiting for me there a brave
and handsome picture she made as she
stood beside the outer port she was
clad in the conventional garment of the
vereans with a purple band around her
flaxen hair from which arose a plume
of three purple feathers insignia of all
higher officers for a weapon she had a
short officers sword in a golden scab-
bard smiling she extended a slim hand

  i wish you happy landings too
david

  on the spur of the moment forget
ting that this was a princess unmind-
ful of the fact that i was an outsider
without a thought of anything except
that i loved her more than any one i
had ever known i drew her to me and
crushed the rose-petal lips to mine had
she resisted me it would have done her
no good i was not sure that she did
realizing finally that i could not stand
this way forever i tore myself away
and entered the ship as we rose swift-
ly into the air i could see my loved
one below sword raised in salute
swiftly we sped across the valley and
over the mountains beyond

chapter xv

the electric soldier

over the plain beyond the range
of mountains we came upon the
enemy they could not see or
hear us at the altitude at which we were
flying my worst fears were realized
this was no mob of beasts but an army
of men with some semblance of order
they were encamped below us and huge
fires were blazing away as i studied
them through the glasses i could see that
nearly all of them were armed with long
bows and many with swords the sight
brought home the fact that men are the
ultimate artists in mimicry a few short
weeks hughes had been amongst them
still they had learned from him to make
fire on one occasion only had they seen
bow arrow and sword in action an
agile brain among the mass had regis-
tered the value of these and put them to
use against this was the fact that for
ages untold they had lived and died
and no being amongst them was able to
think of his own accord of any of these
advancements

  i called to mu who with glasses was
estimating the numbers below us how
many of the enemy do we face

  there must be about seventy-five
thousand of the savages he said when
he had completed his survey that is
three times the number of troops that
the sen ver have mustered even with
the regiments of maidens

  we shall go back to meet our forces
and call a council i said and as the
council votes so shall it be if we shall
make an attack or retreat behind the
barrier which we have set up

  in a very short time we had returned
to our forces made camp and the
council had met and i reported condi-
tions as we had seen them

  men and women of sen ver we face
a very grave danger i advised not


amazing stories

only do the wild men outnumber us by
three to one but they are quite well
armed and seem to have been trained to
a fair degree of efficiency think well
before we attack we can return be-
hind our barrier no doubt such action
would save many lives

  much to my surprise it was dianna
as leader of the women who voiced the
first objection

  no she cried there is no reason
why we must always run from these
beasts we have superior weapons we
have a force of mounted men and when
it becomes necessary to retreat we can
always do so at a faster pace than the
savages are able to maintain a long
and heated discussion followed hughes
and i both being in favor of returning
at once but we were over-ruled by
dianna and her following i suppose
that either they had not much faith in
the wires that we had strung around
over the landscape or else as some of
them had intimated they were tired of
being chased around by the enemy

  if we are to give battle i said
when finally i saw that it was of no
use to argue further the supreme com-
mand should be placed in the hands of
a man who has had military training
otherwise in your ambition you will
lose more lives than there will be any
necessity of losing and may become en-
circled by the enemy hughes is such a
man bill was a west point man had
been an officer in the army this sort of
warfare was new to him of course
since on earth for many years all wars
have been won or lost for the most
part in the air however he was well
versed as an army officer must be in the
methods of ground warfare the distribu-
tion of supplies care of the wounded
and all the many details of a campaign
this was to be guerrilla warfare fighting
from behind trees and rocks our plan
of action was to meet the enemy at the

base of the range the mounted men
armed with most of our supply of
energy pistols in addition to their regu-
lar equipment would attack all along
the line of battle my crew using the
big guns of the ship would cover the
attack any of the opposition that
broke through would meet the main
body of archers

  in the valley below the enemy was
spread out in an encampment about
twelve yurgs in length far up on the
side of the mountain our line was made
the same length as that on the plain be-
low the first action would begin at the
edge of the wooded slopes

  our thousand of cavalry advanced
first to meet them and from the air i
gave the signal to attack simultaneous-
ly we opened fire with the big guns
aboard the ship the mounted troops
using indian tactics were strung out
in a long line always moving along
the enemy front the fire from the ship
was supposed to clear a path for them
the arrows of the archers to take care
of any that they missed i knew that if
the first burst of firing did not demoral-
ize the forces of sen lev we were in
for a long hard battle the outcome of
which was really doubtful as we did not
have enough ammunition for the energy
rifles to carry on a sustained attack
the supply that we had brought from
earth was nearly exhausted and we had
not as yet found time to make more
the leaders of the nation had expected
some attack by their enemy but had not
thought that it would come so soon nor
by such a large force

  the enemy had been well trained
as soon as men began to fall and they
knew that our attack was on they made
use of their natural ability for camou-
flage amid the small growth they could
not be seen either from the air or by
our ground forces their mottled skins
blending with the colors about them
land of twilight



  i can not see anything at which to
shoot the gunners reported

  then hold your fire i replied
since our stock of ammunition is low
i had not been able to see any of the
enemy for some time except those that
were at a distance by the aid of glasses

  our attack on the ground was also
failing the riders being unable to locate
targets while they were open to arrows
from hidden bows the casualties were
few however as the sen lev are poor
shots and the arrows will not pierce the
tough hides of the troads only occas-
ionally did a rider fall from his steed

  i see a signal from the cliffs
shouted the look-out i levelled the
glasses in the direction that he desig-
nated and received the message to come
in hughes from his vantage point
overlooking the whole of the battle had
seen that we were getting nowhere the
cavalry and other ground troops had
also been ordered to cease the attack

  the sen lev advanced as we retreated
as our troops had definite orders to
attempt no battle with them at close
quarters

  this docs not mean that we are
beaten by any means i consoled the
men of my crew many a battle has
been won by a strategic retreat

  from the air and with the force of
cavalry among the ground we wreaked
havoc among the enemy troops when
they crossed the stretches of naked
rock where their colors failed to hide
them and where they could be seen to
shoot at this slowed their advance
made them cautious in exposing them-
selves but this could last only as long as
our dwindling supply of shot held out

  we must retreat beyond our barrier
of wires bill told the council you
have not much faith in that defense
since you have never seen what it will
do we lose too many men in this
style of fighting when we have no

more ammunition our losses will be
greater the sen lev have lost many
more than we but i am told that they
have reinforcements coming up we
have none but should they break through
the electric wall we can fight them with
the fire balls if we must we can aban-
don the city temporarily recapturing
it when we have made ammunition
enough for the big guns

  the dissenters were overruled and we
made a forced march back over the
route we had traveled when our pur-
pose became clear to the savage hordes
they came in full pursuit there was not
much danger from that source however
because they cannot travel at the fast
pace of the vereans the mounted de-
tachment cut down those that ventured
ahead of the main body further slowing
their advance the barbarians scent-
ing ultimate victory did not halt but
kept on the march and we were thus
forced to continue with no rest but we
forced the pace at the last outdistancing
our slower enemy

  inside the fifty yard wire barrier we
halted and replaced the movable sections
as quickly as possible and soon we
had a current at sixty-six kilovolts
traveling over the wires this i counted
upon as our best defense we waited
in battle formation in case the enemy
broke through

  it is an awesome sight said the
king see the lights which dance above
the wires he referred to the corona
around the conductors caused by the
ionization of the air in the vicinity in
the dim light this could be plainly seen

  there they come bill shouted as
the vanguard of the attacking party
came on at their fastest pace they are
sure of victory-we shall soon know

  conversation ceased as a few more
eager than their fellows swept far
into the lead the first man touched the
obstructing wire-a short hideous scream


amazing stories

rent the air followed by the odor of
burned flesh others attempted to cut
the barrier wire with their heavy swords
and were electrocuted as soon as the
blade touched the wire those that
touched any that were connected to the
system became a part of the circuit and
immediately died the vereans gazed
in awe-struck wonder

  tiva the king exclaimed it is a
terrible ending struck down by an un-
seen power

  wave upon wave of the men from
the inner lands charged against the
barrier-only a few lived to return again
to the main body

  they are going to attack at a point
further away said groten

  it is no matter i replied the re-
sult must be the same the only way they
can check the power is to cut off our
water supply for the power which kills
comes from the water that flows so peace-
fully a few hundred yards away

  the forces of the sen lev stopped
their futile attack a detachment ap-
proached the barrier slowly and stopped
a few yards from it in their number
i recognized ig leader and cause of the
bloodshed he raised his hands clasped
above his head in the mercurian truce
symbol and shouted across the space

  the chiefs of the dar would parley
with your leaders

  he spoke in the darian tongue which
bill translated to me we hastily dis-
cussed the situation and king eo gave
them his answer

  send your forces back into the hills
only your chiefs may parley with us
when this has been done you may come
beyond the enclosure

  there was a lengthy council over this
among the darians which we could not
hear but finally they reached a decision
and their forces took up the march to-
wards the dim distant peaks with my
crew i scouted the march fearing treach-

ery we did not return for many hours
not till we had seen the last of them
beyond the point where they could stage
a surprise attack following a much
needed rest we met late the following
day to hold council with the men of
the land of dar no sealed and signed
treaty could be drawn up since these
men could not write we met on the
level land just inside the harmless ap-
pearing wires which had proven so dead-
ly most of the vereans that were phy-
sically able to be there formed a huge
throng before which the dar chiefs
were assembled they were about three
hundred in number the circuit had been
closed and the current turned on in the
barrier the high voltage hissed and
smoked along its carriers

  bill having spent considerable time
among the dars was ordered to be our
spokesman by the king and council

  great chief ig and all chiefs of dar
we are here to make peace what pur-
pose can be served when creatures of
intelligence slay each other there are
beasts in plenty among the forests and
birds enough in the air to furnish food
for all in all directions lie the fertile
lands more than enough for centuries
to come the men of sen ver wish no
bloodshed but for every verean that is
killed they promise that ten of his
enemies shall fall you ask then why
did not the verean hold his ground when
you met him in battle in the open field
the answer is that the magic of the
stick that kills was low the sen ver
expected you to attack but not so soon
they will make sure that in the future
enough death-dealing magic is ready
then there is the wall of flame which
they have made and can control through
which no living thing may pass we
desire to take for our own as much land
as we may need that verean hunting
parties may not be slaughtered and that
the women of the race shall not be
land of

twilight



spirited away in return for this the
vereans promise not to molest the dar
to teach to the agent of ig all the arts
except the secrets of war these we
must keep because we are few in num-
ber against the many

  for a long time the savages discussed
my friends words heatedly and more or
less violently this in itself was a good
sign since it presaged that the ultimate
decision would be sincere to a greater
degree if they had consented to our
terms too easily we should have had
good reason to expect that they would
forget them as soon the ultimate de-
cision on their part i felt rested with
one man ig i watched him closely
but as yet he had taken no active part in
the argument but remained aloof though
listening carefully to all that was said
once more i felt that here was an ex
ceptional character among his kind he
was thinking about the problem and in
this lay the qualities that separated him
from his fellows for when a man
ceases to let his impulses or passions
guide his speech or his deeds but debates
them to himself in the cold light of
reason then indeed does he start to ad-
vance the limit of his advancement is
controlled only by his ingenuity and by
the time the great director has alloted
him to play upon the stage

  at length ig called for silence among
his chiefs and such was the power of
the man that he obtained their complete
attention- that he ruled them by sheer
physical dominance mattered little the
important fact was that he did rule them
for about five minutes he spoke to his
leaders and their decision was reached

  he approached hughes and spoke
leaders of the sen ver we have come
to a decision on what has been said
we have had visions of power visions
that must be abandoned i can see that
we cannot conquer the pale men from
the outer lands your terms are fair

while i am great chief of the dars
they shall be kept

  the great mass of the attacking party
took up the march back into the lands
from which it had come the great chief
and a few of his leaders were staying
with us for a short time they were
given the freedom of the place to a
certain degree but were not allowed in
our quite modern electric plant or to
study certain other things that we were
doing after a time they also departed
and we again took up our work where
it had been interrupted at the time of
the attack upon us

chapter xvi

north of the equator

interspersed with the work of
repairing our ship we made many
flights over the surface the pur-
pose of these were twofold first to
map the whole terrain and secondly to
search for a place where another colony
might be started we felt sure that no
attacks upon us would succeed against
our defenses particularly the system of
electrical wiring that we had set up
and so the entire population had moved
to the surface the abodes inside the
mountain were kept intact in case of an
unforseen emergency but everywhere
houses were springing up in the valley
given the ideas of surface structure
the native mechanics soon put them into
operation

  the one valley was adequate for the
needs of the present population but with
the means of protection that we now had
in operation it would cease to support
the vereans of a decade hence

  venturing farther afield on one of
these tours we followed the plain at
the end of the great morass in the dis-
tance we sighted a great body of water
extending inland according to our cal-
culations we were about one degree


amazing stories

mercurian measurement north of the
equator

  numerous streams empty into the
outer sea but this one was the largest
body of water that we had encountered
extending from west to east

   i believe that this is a sea quartering
the globe i told our assembled party
which consisted of the king and queen
dianna the regular crew of the ship
bill hughes and myself and that it
will be of considerable width we have
as yet found no suitable location shall
we turn inland or cross this body of
water  we have food enough for
several weeks and fuel enough to com-
plete the circle of the globe can be
carried in a mans pockets

   by all means let us continue said
the king i would like very much to see
if this northern continent is like our own
land

  we brought the ship down however
on the southern shore before continuing
we found that this was not a sea but
a river of huge proportions as there was
a perceptible current flowing in the di-
rection of the sea we flew over the
great river early the next day and found
a land similar to that on the south ex-
cept that the plains were more exten-
sive the mountain ranges not as high
we had travelled many miles north with
bill using the glasses when he suddenly
spoke to me

  there is a queer phenomena dis-
played below large areas of the sur-
faces are opague i am unable to see
through them

  i looked through the glasses and
passed them to the vereans thinking
that possibly with their superior vision
they might pierce the veil and discern
what was below

   perhaps it is some natural condition

i said we can land on an elevation and
investigate

  my curiosity was aroused certainly

these invisible areas were similar to
nothing that i ever had heard of or seen

  we landed on a small ridge of land
beside a small valley through which a
stream wended its way it was a good
place for a camp the elevation was suffi-
cient for us to see a good distance in any
direction most of the personnel taking
advantage of a chance to exercise left
the ship and we started down the length
of the small valley on a preliminary
tour of exploration

   as usual my insatiable curiosity urged
me on and i drew away from the main
party we had seen no signs of life and
the possibility of danger did not enter
my mind i came to a small intersecting
valley from which flowed a trickle of
water thinking that i would find a
spring back in the shadows i entered i
was very thirsty and longed for a
drink of cool water most of the water
on mercury is very warm except when
its source is underground or in small
springs i found the spring and ob-
tained my draught of water

  as i arose from the rocks i could
see that the main party was entering
the opening through which i had come
about two hundred yards distant i
shouted to them that the water was very
cool and decided to wait for them there

  they had covered more than half
the distance when i raised my eyes
along the steep sides of the fissure and
saw something else on these slopes
were beings completely enclosed in
armor of some black substance they car-
ried a peculiar sort of weapon or in-
strument a large bellows was carried
under one arm and a flexible tube ex-
tended from it which was manipulated
by the opposite hand from these tubes
were issuing sheets of an opaque vapor
which hung dead and lifeless in the air
these opaque sections were man-made
and were not a natural phenomenon
their object was to envelope our whole
land of

twilight



party as the vapors were being directed
towards the mouth of the valley and
travelling in that direction with con-
siderable speed

  run vereans i shouted attack
from above

  i drew my pistol and fired at our at-
tackers but the missiles struck the
vaporous substance which they had
craftily laid below the level on which
they stood and were deflected from its
surface one of them carelessly left half
of his body below the veil i brought
him down the sides screaming horribly

  i could not make the entrance bill
and dianna had stopped he was vainly
trying to urge her on losing precious
time

  run you fools i shrieked lapsing
into english

  my friend picked her up bodily and
started on again but the load slowed his
speed and the cloud of vapor was over
and beyond them dipping downward to
catch the balance of the party the
three of us were in the trap but i could
prevent the capture of the others

  in my pockets i carried two small
bombs of storbite a terribly high ex-
plosive quickly i adjusted the deto-
naters and threw them at each side of
the valley beyond the curtain and back
of our retreating comrades the ex-
plosive burst with a terrific crash as
the sides of the narrow valley caved in
leaving the three of us effectually bot-
tled up but cutting our assailants off
from entrance into the larger valley
i knew that our friends had time to
make the not far distant ship

  i came up to bill and the girl who
were waiting for me

  the opaque wall is settling around
us said bill i wonder if we can
break through

  i do not think so i answered
shot from my pistol will not pierce
it we fired a volley at the wall but

  to no effect we could discern no altera-
tion at all in the substance at any point
where our shots should have pierced it

  we can only await developments-
look-it is dissipating already they
are probably using the same weapon but
another compound to counteract the
first

  they are coming forward now said
dianna

  true enough as the mists disappeared
we could see six of the number ap-
proaching while the others remained at a
distance those that were nearest did
not carry the funny looking but effective
weapons

  do not shoot bill i warned as
i saw him reaching for his pistol the
others would only cut us down

  the leader opened the helmet to his
suit revealing a smooth shaven face
in his eyes large and bright an ex-
pression of cruelty predominated

  i fear that we can expect very little
mercy from these men dianna exclaimed
and exactly the same thought was in
my own mind he addressed me in an
unknown tongue i answered in verean
but he did not understand bill spoke
to him in the language of the dars and
much to our surprise our inquisitor
understood and answered him i had
never learned the language of the wild
men so upon my partner must fall the
burden of interpretation

  what desire you strangers in the
land of nimara

  only to see what lay north of the
water answered bill our land is an-
other world than this from which we
came in the ship that travels in the
air doubtless you have seen it

  nithon for that was the leaders
name stepped closer to dianne looking
at her with covetous eyes

  perhaps that is true of yourself and
the other man but the woman must be
a species of sentor


amazing stories

  i had been inwardly boiling with
wrath because of the manner in which
he looked upon her when he reached
forward and touched her reason left
me swift as a flash i readied out with
a blow to his uncovered jaw which felled
him before he could lift a finger to pro-
tect himself none of the people of
mercury can match the speed with which
an earth man can move those guard-
ing came closer with weapons ready
for action but the leader now recover-
ing from the blow got to his feet and
waved them back

  tell the hound to keep his hands off
the girl and take us to his superior i
said to bill

  i am the ruler answered nithon
when this was translated

  you have a false tongue said bill

  my surmise was correct he was
only a military sub-commander

  our weapons were taken from us but

i	was not extremely bothered by this
fact since i had been robbed of my
weapons so often since coming to this
world that it was becoming a habit
quickly they marched us away from
that locality always keeping to forest
trails until we were at a point beyond
where the others who had returned to
the transatel ship could locate us on
the inarch

  a camp was made and a curtain of
their protective vapor was spread over
the camp there were hundreds of
these opaque sections over the land it
would be practically impossible for our
friends to locate the right one even if
they did they could not attack it suc-
cessfully we remained there for two
days and nights until the scouts re-
ported that the ship had ceased its bom-
bardments of the different umbrellas
the nimar give this protective covering
the name of tourij which may mean
umbrella in their language we never
learned the language of the nimar as

  they speak a daran tongue as well and
have little to do with their slaves in any
event the general shape of these
gaseous envelopes is that of a huge
umbrella

  we were not molested again and
when the transatel ship had been re-
ported to have flown into the south the
whole party was loaded into motor
transport vehicles that had arrived for
this purpose and we departed for the
north

  this race of men have developed
motor transportation to an amazing de-
gree of perfection the vehicles are
much more powerful and smoother in
operation than any that we have on
earth perhaps this is because on earth
practically all transportation except
freight has taken to the air the nimar
have never constructed a successful
heavier-than-air craft for flight and so
have concentrated their ability oft per-
fection in another direction actually
the conditions that prevail in the mer
curian atmosphere are not altogether
favorable for flying

  at the first of the journey over in-
ferior roads as they called them our
speed was from fifty to sixty miles an
hour in a few hours we came to the
beginning of the great nimar highway
system and our speed from that point
on was steadily better than one-hundred
miles per hour

  internal combustion engines are used
but they are powered by a fuel of which

i	know nothing except that it is ex-
tremely efficient and practically noise-
less the vehicles that they use are also
much better sprung than any that i
had seen before

  the highway systems are on the same
principle as those of earth express
traffic all going in one direction is over
head only specified stops are made
slower traffic and cross traffic travels
on the surface-not much different from
land of

twilight



our surface travel on earth but faster and
better regulated a large settlement
loomed in the distance

  our speed is slower said bill we
must be approaching our destination
we entered a huge terminal shop and
came to a stop news of our coming had
been sent on ahead a guard of armored
soldiers awaited us armed with their
queer looking but efficient weapons
there was also a great crowd of civilians
both men and women in the few mo-
ments of waiting we had an opportunity
to study them the men invariably gave
the appearance of high intelligence and
the women were extremely beautiful

  they appear as cruel as images
carved in stone said dianna what-
ever our fate may be i do not think
that we can expect any mercy or help
from any of them

  we were transferred to another
vehicle and were soon moving through
the streets of the town

  where do you take us bill asked
the leader of the patrol that was with
us

  to duneen thiunter our ruler he
answered your disposal will be upon
his judgment were you from the inner
valleys we would throw you in the slave
quarters without his counsel since you
are of another race he must decide
not a very pleasant outlook i said
when the rather lengthy speech had
been translated i only hope that we
can keep together these men are cold
cruel and sensual

  if we must be separated my loved
one i cautioned dianna -put on an
appearance of ignorance and uncleanli-
ness

  we had obtained no chance to remove
the grime of our long journey dianna
surreptiously worked the dirt into her
fair skin tangled and mussed the flaxen
hair and her eyes assumed a vacant look
the change was miraculous i hoped

that in comparison with the beauty of
the native women she would be over-
looked by any of the nimar

 your appearance is certainly
changed said bill i would not know
you for the same woman

  am i bad enough she asked in a
rough strained voice

  if you can only keep the part i told
her but dont drop the masquerade
soon our car stopped before an im-
posing building fronted by a huge stair-
way of solid metal the building was
constructed externally of some burnished
metal which i assumed must be of very
light weight doors slid back noiseless-
ly for our entrance inside we passed
through an immense hall decorated in
a marvelous manner with gold and silver
predominating in the scheme silent
guards were everywhere the regal guard
i assumed at the end of the long hall
gilded doors opened and we entered a
smaller chamber in which were assem-
bled a number of men

  one an elderly man sat behind a desk
on a raised dais the others were grouped
in a semi-circle of seats on the floor
below the whole effect was not unlike
a court room on earth our guard ad-
vanced to a position in front of the
raised dais saluting smartly when bid
to do so he made his report in the
native language during which time the
ruler and his aids looked us over

  the two males are of a race unknown
to nimara the woman is not you say
that the large one speaks the mouthings
of the imar

  the leader turned his attention to
bill and questioned him at great length
about his origin

  you would have us believe that you
and the other man have come here from
another world there is no other world
nimara ends at the great waters north
and south the boiling seas to the west
and the waters of the great pits far

away extend into the land of no light
but if you have explored to the east
you must have seen the stars in the
sky bill argued it is from one of
these that we have come

  the lights in the heavens are there
but they have nothing in common with
our world

  when this had been translated to me
i could understand how a very complete
civilization had been built up here with-
out any attempt at exploration these
men were convinced that their world
was flat that the limits to which they
could travel were imposed by the laud
that they could see to venture beyond
this meant extinction dropping into
nothingness and so they had never ven-
tured beyond the bodies of water which
surrounded them

  take them to the slave-quarters
said duneen i do not believe their
story

  we were marched out of the palace
and into the car we were taken out of
the citv and into another of ramshackle


quarters and dilapidated huts which for
the most part at this time of day were
deserted we drew up in front of what
looked to be a headquarters from the
interior issued a number of men in
general appearance like the dars all of
these were injured in one way or an-
other they ordered bill and me out of
the carriage

  bill spoke to the leader

  what of the girl where are yon
taking her we supposed that whatever
happened we should not be far separ-
ated

  the leader leaped to the ground ig-
noring the question and grabbed bill
by the arm as if to pull him from the
seat my friend left his seat readily
enough and hit the ground with a rush
one terrific blow felled the leader i
followed snatching one of the nimars
weapons which i trained on the re-

maining four they were clad in their
protective armor but as is customary
when not in action the helmets were
thrown back they could not use their
weapons

  the imars witnessing the brawl dared
not interfere in our behalf but i could
see that they were enjoying the rough-
ing of one of their hated masters it was
some moments before the man recovered
from the wicked punch that he had re-
ceived

  i am afraid that we cannot fight them
very long bill i said

  i know he replied i have prob-
ably let us all in for this mans ven-
geance but we must know what they
intend to do with dianna it would be
better for the three of us to die fighting
right here than for her to become the
plaything of this type of man

  we had spoken in english he now
addressed the leader who was rising from
the ground

  will you answer my question now
or must i beat you to death even if it
costs our lives

  i dont suppose that this captain had
ever been crossed in this way or slugged
quite as hard in his life his expression
certainly showed surprise-and hate

  the woman goes to the female slave
quarters you will pay dearly for strik-
ing a royal guard

  keep your courage i said to
dianna i believe that in some way we
can outwit these people clever as they
are as long as you are amongst the
slave women you are safe if it would
gain anything for you we would make
a last stand here i see that you still have
your deadly amulet use it only as a last
resort there must be some means of
communication and i will let you know
if we can do anything if i should
crush you close now it would be some-
thing for them to hold against you hence
i must refrain

slavery

our fellow slaves for there was
now no doubt as to our status
here collected around us one
fellow a larger man than even the
famed urd came forward his arm was
in an improvised sling

  you are not of imar great man
he said to bill yet you speak the
language of our fathers from whence
came you and the others

  from another world comrade bill
replied a world beyond the darkness
of the inner lands and far away on one
of the stars that may be seen from your
homeland

  i have seen them answered zuth
for this was the mans name for i was
born a free man most of the captives
slaves the nimar call us were born
here

  i noted that zuth did not doubt our
story of coming from another planet
it demonstrated the fact that in some
ways the mind of the ignorant savage
was more open than that of his well
trained and educated master the nimar
ruler and his following had refused to
accept our explanation of our presence
upon nimar soil because their books
have said that there is no other land than
nimara these simple men accepted our
story without question

  there were more than one hundred
slaves in this building and i saw that all
were incapable of doing work from one
cause or another this seemed to be a
sort of a hospital and a very poor one
at that that these men held us in great
respect was evident from their attitudes
those able to do so crowded around bill
asking him many questions we learned
much of their history and mode of living
in a short time we also found out a
great deal about their masters some of
these men-imar is the name of the race

had been captured in the lands of dark-
ness and brought here a greater num-
ber had been born in captivity all hated
and feared the men that they slaved
for but none seemed to have the resource-
fulness to organize a successful revolt
although outnumbering their masters a
number of sporadic attempts at escape
had been made within the memory of
zuth but the results had been so dis-
astrous that they were at the point of
complete submission i wondered why
the leader had thrown men such as bill
amongst these but could find no other
explanation than that he rated us as
very inferior in intelligence or else was
secure in his belief of the infallibility
of nimar defense

  a plan was forming in my mind we
had numbers if we could learn the
secret of the nimar armor or of the
weapon that they used we might stir
up and direct a revolt bill and i talked
this over for some time and finally he
addressed the men gathered about us

  you say men of imar that you have
never been able to escape from the men
that hold you to us this seems strange
as slaves of the nimar some of you
must know the secret of their weapons
and of the material that prevents them
from being destroyed by the gas that
they use as a method of destroying
others

  to this zuth replied in such a way
as to show us conclusively how the
few could hold such a large number of
men much stronger physically for so
long a time he said in reply to be
sure we make the armor and the wea-
pons that the nimar oftentimes uses to
slay us but they guard their secret well
if they find that any slave has given
knowledge of the materials used or if
they find any of those materials missing
they simply slaughter all of the slaves in
any way connected with the manufacture
of these things we could easily gain


amazing stories

the knowledge but it would be of no
use to us under these circumstances
i was dumfounded at the extent to
which the nimar carried their cruelty
as just unfolded to us by zuth natural-
ly no slave would dare to let as much
as a word about these secrets cross his
lips we understood quite readily that
any break for freedom would have to
be planned differently but bill was
scheming for the same result from an-
other angle

  it seems to me men of imar he
said that you have neglected to use the
most effectual weapon of all and one
that can never be taken from you as long
as you live

  what is that he was asked

  your great physical strength and the
speed with which you can hurl a stone
at least the dar of the southlands who
resemble you very much have these
attributes

  yes said zuth our people still
are adept at the hunt and we have con-
siderable chance to practice for in this
manner the nimar obtain much of their
food supply all of the younger slaves
particularly delight to have a turn at
this work as it is the only pleasure
that we ever know our masters realiz-
ing this make of it a sort of a reward
for faithfulness as they consider it
bills plan in short was that all the
imar should be informed that a break
was to be made sometime in the near
future that under penalty of being killed
by their fellow slaves no mention was
ever to be made of this plan except at
the time when we were locked in quar-
ters for sleep at which time we were
sure that no inquisitive ears would hear
our conversation we planned to dig
our way out of our quarters capture
our guards by surprise and armed with
their weapons and armor to fight our
way to the land of darkness the suc-
cess of our plan was dependent upon

our attacking the guards before they had
time to bring their weapons into play
until a number of us were armed after
that our armor protecting us from the
gas we planned to kill any others with
their own weapons or failing that to
beat them to death we counted a great
deal on the fact that the guards except
when actually in combat leave the hel-
met of their suits open and that we
could put them out of action before they
could prepare to fight

  the imar argued over this long and
heatedly most of the older men con-
sidered it as impossible but the younger
slaves were all in favor of some sort
of action they had lacked a leader
zuth a powerful influence was hesitant
undecided

  you say argued bill since he
wished to win zuth over that all may
be killed it is only a living death that
you have now there must be many of
you who like zuth were born far away
under the light of the stars and to
whom the first years of life are remem-
bered as free ones then there was no
lash to sting your back when you were
so exhausted that it seemed that you
could not go on you had only to kill the
game to feed yourself and your family
only the worry of finding a cave suitable
to sleep in to men of spirit freedom
is worth dying for if necessary he
finally persuaded zuth that the plan had
a very good chance of success and so
won him to his views

  we had talked a long time an imar
posted at the door shouted to us that
slaves were being driven in and that of
course guards were with them soon
after that the hundred men in the long
room were herded into line and
marched to another long low building
where we were fed much to our sur-
prise the food though coarse was
wholesome and there was plenty of it
apparently the nimar were crafty
land of

enough to realize that a creature
whether man or beast can do more work
when well fed no conversation was
allowed while eating and the table was
ringed by a number of guards with
weapons there was no time for con-
versation in any case since a man must
grab what he desired quickly we won-
dered at the haste displayed and dis-
covered the reason when we were or-
dered away before my companion and
i had found time to satisfy our hunger
we were hurried back to the first build-
ing and it was barred from the outside
i was thankful in one respect in that
no move had been made to separate
hughes and myself i would have been
greatly handicapped had our captors
done so since i knew only a few words
of the tongue excitement was at a high
point after our guards had left zuth
and his companions were gravely dis-
cussing the ideas that bill had given to
them

  we learned that the imar women of
whom there were not many as compared
to the males were kept in a separate sec-
tion of the town each day they were
transported to the city proper where
they performed the menial tasks of the
household meetings between the two
sexes were few in spite of their mode
of living the imar were much further
advanced in civilization than the wild
men of the southlands living in con-
tact with a civilized scheme they must
of necessity absorb considerable of that
scheme conversation soon ceased in
the building and they all slept we were
soon to learn the reason that sleep was
the sleep of complete exhaustion in the
dim light of the following day we were
routed out by the guards and herded
once more to the mess-room bill and
i taking our cue from the experience
of the previous day wolfed our victuals
the same as the others managing in the
confusion to fill our stomachs

  conveyances were lined up outside
waiting for us and we were soon in the
foothills of the mountains the gang
that we were in were mining copper
which existed here in a huge vein of the
native metal for five hours we were
compelled to swing a heavy hammer
drilling the holes that other slaves would
fill with explosive it was man-killing
toil without a moments rest if the pace
slackened for a moment we felt the
lash of the guards great whip across
our backs

  t begin to see the hand of the cap-
tain of our guard in this i said i
notice that the other drilling crews are
not rushed at the pace which is forced
upon us

  i imagine that we will be continually
harassed answered bill since that is
the nature of the cruel man wherever he
may be

  we were allowed fifteen minutes in
which to eat a midday meal i was so
exhausted that it was necessary for me
to force the food down my throat but
knowing that i would be in better shape
if i ate something i did so then we were
driven back to our work i noted that
the other drilling crews were changed
but that my friend and i were given
the same assignment the latter half of
the day passed somehow we were in
the best of physical condition but unused
to hard physical labor i was thankful
indeed when the signal for a halt was
given and we were marched to the cars
and started on our return journey

  in the seat beside us wtas a young
iman who opened conversation as soon
as our vehicle was under way

  the nimar intend to kill you by
work he said i overheard two of
the guard talking in niman some of us
understand their language though they
know it not the big captain that you
struck cannot have you killed outright
but should you refuse or be unable tq

work he will have his guards beat you
to the death if we could help you we
would

  thank you friend said bill the
only way that you can help us will be
to persuade the men to organize into
a revolt should the labor be not more
severe than to-day we can get along
they have put you to the hardest
work that there is as you may have ob-
served in the other gangs they take turn
about and only work one-half the day at
the hammer and drill we did not be-
lieve that you could last the day

  we can last many days hughes
replied but as soon as the nimar dis-
cover this they will find other means of
getting rid of us

  the routine in the days that followed
was much the same as the first we
were fed and locked up each night in a
hut that contained the physically fit men
the aged one zuth i saw was in the
same shanty he told us that he had
been returned to the mining gang

  we have had word of the she that
was captured with you he said one
night she has been taken by one of
the wives of duneen as her personal
slave she will be safe from any nimar
except perhaps the ruler himself being
more comely than the imar women her
mistress will take pains to protect her
from all other nimar

  every night for one hour we tunneled
under our prison walls one thing in
our favor was the fact that once the
doors were barred our guards never
molested us unless the covers were
lifted from the lights which was never
permitted to happen during this time

  one month from the day of our cap-
ture word came in from all sources that
the imar were ready for the break to
me it was pleasing news i swung the
hammer almost joyously that day under
the glowering baleful glare of our
guards

  two hours after we had been checked
into our building i pulled away the
false support that held up the scant six
inches of soil that remained between us
and the outer air very carefully we
scraped away this layer until a hole big
enough for egress had been made i
poked my head above the surface and
took a hurried look around the guard
on our side of the building was just
disappearing from view around a cor-
ner of the structure

chapter xviii

a surprise attack

with a low spoken word direct-
ing the others to follow i
grasped my club and went out
after him i reached the corner of the
building around which he had disap-
peared and in the shadows i awaited
his return as he came into view his
helmet open i recognized him as one of
the many who had crossed my back with
the lash leaving scars that would re-
main with me for many years seeing
me he reached for the visor of his
helmet to close it but he never had a
chance the heavy club painstakingly
fashioned from the poles of flooring de-
scended upon his head crushing the skull

  the two remaining guards to this
building were stalked surprised and
killed before they could give an alarm
bill and i left the disposal of the corpses
and recovery of weapons and armor to
some of the others and ran to tfi
nearest adjoining building as we made
our attack there the slaves inside came
through and joined us and so we
spread our conquest throughout the
vicinity as we collected numbers and
obtained armor and weapons from the
slain guards i called some of the lead-
ers to conference bill said to them
men of imar the other white man
and myself being swifter will run

down and kill any that may get free
you men of the inner lands must bear
the brunt of the attack

  the buildings were invariably guarded
by three men sometimes one in a few
cases two of the guards would escape
the slaves who are very slow of move-
ment our earth-trained muscles en-
abled us to run these down before they
could escape and clad in their own
armor the weapons did not harm us

  our forces were now large enough so
that some sort of campaign could be fol-
lowed we called the council together
once more zuth was chosen by them
as their spokesman bill gave him his
instructions

  very soon the nimar from the other
city will be here in force if they have
not been warned already our plan of
action is to lead them away from their
headquarters on to the open plain
there we will destroy all of their con-
veyances and prevent them from re-
turning to their city pick a strong force
that shall remain concealed near the
bridges after the nimar have crossed
they shall come forth to prevent any
from returning

  we went on and soon came to the
section of the town housing the nimar
women this section was not nearly as
large as that which held the men the
imar women were few in number
quickly we went through their quarters
but no where did i find dianna

  bill questioned one woman where
has the strange girl gone

she must still be in the city upon the
hill i will get you a woman who was
quartered in the same hovel with her
do so at once there is no time to
lose

soon the woman put in an appearance
they keep the white one at nights
now i do not see her often but she
tells me that she has to entertain the
nimar

  the slave town was in our hands now
and but for this circumstance we were
ready to leave it bill and i called the
imar together they were all near as
there had been strict orders that there
should be no looting no disturbance to
rouse the upper town now the order
was changed we called for a score of
men to follow us to the regal quarters
where i believed we would find dianna
the response was not as spontaneous as
it would have been if we had been deal-
ing with vereans who would gladly
follow either of us through fire al-
though in justice i must say that the
dissenters were greatly in the minority
at last we picked a score of the young-
er more daring only to find that none
knew the upper town they had never
been bejond the river in their cap-
tivity but we soon found a woman that
had been there many times

  twenty minutes after we cross the
bridge create as much noise as you can
until you know that the entire nimar
town is aroused retreat to the open
country leaving men to blow up all the
bridges but the one those men are to
wait for our raiding party here

   we sallied forth a small band against
a great town our advantage lay in the
fact that nearly all of the populace were
asleep we had no means of knowing
what policing system prevailed here we
had traveled a considerable distance
when one of our party spied a sentinel
the imar have sharper eyes than their
masters the party came to a halt

   i will circle around him i said to
bill since if i am seen less notice will
be taken of me your great stature
makes you a marked man in any com-
pany here

  the man was standing partly in the
shadow of a building that faced the
street he had not moved since we had
sighted him but the imar told us that he
was not apparently directing his atten-

tion to us i went over into the next
street and hurried along its length till
i had him in a position directly between
myself and our party i was returning
slowly towards him when suddenly he
started in my direction twelve feet
above my head was the railing of a
porch i leaped in the air with my arms
outstretched i was again thankful for
the lesser gravity of mercury as i
grasped the railing and hauled myself
over tensely i waited as he approached
but nothing seemed out of place to him
as he sauntered along when he was
directly underneath i launched myself
at him kicking out hard with my feet
as i neared the bottom of my leap to
give the blow the necessary power he
fell to the ground-dead the body had
hardly ceased to convulse when bill
came up ready as ever to take part
in any trouble that might develop how-
ever the episode had passed so swiftly
that no one had been aroused

  we signalled to the rest of our party
to come forward so that we might con-
tinue on our way behind us at the edge
of the river pandemonium broke loose
heavy explosions sounded and fire broke
out in many places as the imar follow-
ing our instructions wrecked buildings
near the river front

  in the shelter of a huge storehouse
we heard the alarm sounded in the
streets about us in a very short time we
saw from our hiding place the nimar
forces marching en masse to the settle-
ment across the river i climbed to a
point on the roof and made as accurate
a survey of their numbers as was pos-
sible i was able to estimate their num-
bers quite accurately as they collected
at the bridges and were in the full light
of the burning buildings there were
about five thousand of them when all had
arrived practically all of the male popu-
lation from zuth we had learned that
there were between twenty-five and

thirty thousand nimar in the city at-
tended by a force of about forty thous-
and slaves the large majority of the
slaves were adult males this was what
we hoped for that the noise would
call all of the fighting forces to the
lower town leaving us an easier course
in what we wished to accomplish i left
my post and hastened to join the others
because from now on we must work
swiftly

  as fast as the imar could travel we
hurried through the town our objective
the palace of duneen which was located
on a hill overlooking the town

  there will be guards here bill i
said spread them out use clubs and
stones

 the dozen guards in the outer
grounds fell under the blows of the
imar their armor could not protect
them from blows delivered the same
armor on our persons rendered us im-
mune from the gas that issued from
their weapons though that same gas dis-
integrated sticks and stones in the few
times that they had time to bring it into
play the element of surprise was what
beat them

  the grounds are cleared now one
of the imar reported i have learned
that sanu knows the way to the slaves
entrance it is unguarded she says

  then take us there immediately

  through the barred windows i could
see a light upon the second floor and
faint sounds of revelry came to us oc-
casionally we skirted the building fol-
lowing the lead of the imar woman
who was running as fast as she could
in that direction but at a pace which
seemed unbearably slow to me

  intuition telepathy or whatever sense
it is that at certain moments whispers
to us of the future was telling me that
the one i loved above all others was in
that lighted room and that she needed
help
land of twilight



  first to arrive i found the door
barred i could make no impression on
it with my weight as it was built securely
and made of metal

  let me at it master said one of
the imar for a long time i have wanted
to break one of these apart bring me
yonder big block of stone he pointed
to a large obelisk at the head of the
walk a short distance away

  four of our number lifted the slab
as if it were a toy and brought it for-
ward

  place it so that i can wedge between
it and the door while i get rid of this
clown suit

  his back and shoulders against the
door his feet braced against the stone
all of his powerful strength was exerted
his legs began to straighten as the
center of the door began to buckle i
heard a click as one lock snapped fol-
lowed shortly by another as the other
lock gave way it was a marvelous ex-
hibition of brute strength

  i was inside the building almost be-
fore the door had stopped swinging

the whip

ome on bill lets hurry the
rest can come on as fast as pos-
sible

  it was poorly lighted here on the
ground floor but i could see illumina-
tion streaming down from above at a
not far distant stairway i was up the
stairs in a flash my friend close behind
me from the noise there seemed to
be a party in progress at the other end
of the corridor at a doorway stood two
guards i thought since they wore armor
and carried weapons i had lost my
club but in my present state of mind i
never gave it a thought their inter-
est was centered in the room that they
were guarding i was close to them be-

fore they knew it although i took no
pains to make my progress quiet

  perhaps for this moment alone had i
put in eight seasons upon the gridiron
i sped over the remaining short distance
left my feet and hurtled through the
air this time as i desired i took out
two men sending them both spinning
to bring up with a crash against a wall
minus their weapons

  get their weapons bill i shouted
and guard the doorway

  i entered the room the noise in the
hall had attracted the attention of its in-
mates but it had been over so quickly
that they had not been able to arm
themselves and bill had the drop on
them as i entered well in front of the
main group stood a man in his hands
one of the slave whips at one side
lay dianna covering her nude body as
best she could across her back were
great red welts from which blood
streamed all this i saw at a glance
but vengeance came first escape later
bill stood ready to use the weapon

  do not use the gas i said this
brute is going to get some of his own
medicine

  as i advanced the man with the lash
drew back his arm yet before the
motion forward was completed i was
upon him speed has its place and an
important place is in combat across
my shoulder his arm was bent the
wrong way i was greeting him with the
devil hand-shake and i used the
trick to its fullest degree of harm the
result was a broken arm

  as he lay on the floor writhing in
pain i tore the clothes from his back
and picked up the heavy whip where it
lay on the floor you like the lash i
snarled not realizing that i was speak-
ing a tongue that he could not under-
stand you shall have the lash

  time and again the whip bit deep into
his bodyas i vented some of the pent-

up fury that was in me upon him he
would not forget this beating soon and
he was not the only one that would
know my ire in common with most
cruel men he could not stand punish-
ment i turned away from his screams
and babblings disgusted and advanced
upon the ruler of these merciless men
it was only fitting that he should get
some of the same sort of treatment
while his subjects looked on in helpless
fear i advanced and gave him stroke
for stroke the number of lashes that i
had received from nimar guards

 we had better be on our way
david my friend interrupted or per-
haps i would have lashed all of the
nimar present the nimar will re-
turn soon this would be a bad place to
get caught he turned to the woman
who had accompanied us clothe the
girl he ordered stay where you are
people of nimar perhaps your country-
men will return and free you it is pos-
sible that we may destroy the building
of one thing you may be certain if you
attempt to follow us you will be killed

  wre barricaded the two doors to the
room this would hinder them greatly
and left the palace at once

  did they harm you very much my
loved one i anxiously inquired

  except for the terrible lashing to-
night i have not been hurt

  your world is a land of superla-
tives the  vereans docile to a high
degree the nimar extremely cruel the
dar abysmally ignorant even nature
manifests her wonders in contrasts of
splendor and gloom she rears her
mountains in bold relief contrasts the
riot of color of the vegetation with drab
skies on earth many of these conflict-
ing qualities exist but side by side in-
deed often existing in the thoughts of
one human being each quality in its
proximity tempering the others

  we found the one remaining bridge

in the possession of the imar who had
hidden themselves in the vicinity while
the main force led their enemies a run-
ning battle out into the open country
when the fighting had been carried to
a certain distance they had emerged and
wrecked all the bridges but one

  in possession of armor and weapons
the slaves now slaves no longer waged
an even contest only retreating because
they wished to do so always making
their way towards the range of moun-
tains and into their own land

  soon we overhauled the rear ranks of
the nimar and in the confusion of the
battle we worked our way to the front
ranks forging on ahead of the main
body of troops it was surprisingly easy
to get ahead of the nimar forces in the
guerrilla type of fighting that was taking
place but some of our men were clubbed
to death before we could convince our
own forces that we were not enemies

  now we can begin an attack of our
own i said to bill lead a force to
flank them on the other side of their
column while i circle them on this side

  the nimar attempted to outflank our
forces but smart soldiers that they are
they did not have the numbers or the
weapons as soon as they saw that they
could not succeed that they stood in
grave danger of being surrounded and
slaughtered their ranks closed into regu-
lar formation and they started their re-
treat i called a halt

  there is no use in pursuing them
said bill

  but we can capture the entire band
argued zuth

  that you cannot do in the first
place you are not able to march as fast
as the nimar secondly without doubt
a message has been sent to other cities
they can recruit a sufficient force to
capture us if indeed such a force is
not already on the way

  for many years the imar had acted
land of

on the thoughts of others like every-
thing else it becomes a habit in the
course of time soon we had dissuaded
them and were continuing on our way

       chapter xx

 t t workerul  s t again

  l i free a soft voice whispered
in my ear as i sat apart from
the others in our first camp

  we have still a long way to go be-
fore we see the city of man dianna
of course i am anxious to see my
mother and father and to set at rest the
fears of my people yet the journey
will pass too quickly

  i do not feel as happy as i should
but why is it that you are not
because soon you and the other man
will vanish into space and leave us for
your own earthland and you will prob-
ably never return you will be famous
men and probably one of the fair maid-
ens of your own race will claim you
something in her eyes the wistfulness
of her voice both aroused in me the
desire to break the barriers of custom
and race that had ever seemed between
us i clasped her tightly

  will you dearest can we persuade
the king and queen would the coun-
cil-

  the answer to all is yes she mur-
mured happily

  but what of bill

  bill can take care of himself fair
lady a voice near at hand replied i
have been waiting a long time for my
bashful friend to make up his mind
congratulations to you both i have no
desire to leave this interesting land
permanently

  i can name the girl in one guess
said dianna she is the younger sister
of groten

  bill turned a share redder and jiggled

from one foot to the other like a big
kid who has been caught stealing jam
romance had been in progress right
under my nose and i had never even
suspected its existence he couldnt fool
the woman however so the congratula-
tions were mutual

chapter xxi

homeward bound

our sentries must have slept at
their posts i could not find it
in my heart to blame them the
preparation for our revolt working
long hard days at the same time fol-
lowed by the unusual and violent exer-
tion of the last twenty-four hours could
easily have been enough to slow their
sensibilities not being trained soldiers
who realize that they must stay awake
no matter how safe the position may
appear they had undoubtedly grown
careless in a sense of security

 hughes shook me roughly awake
from a sound slumber

  come out of it dave we are sur-
rounded 

  quickly he explained the situation to
me

  the nimar are using different
methods they have thrown up a breast-
works entirely around the camp all
about us they have put down a curtain
of gas masking their movements we
can walk through this those of us that
are armored but they are using explo-
sives in the form of bombs it appears
that they intend to starve us into submis-
sion 

  we were walking around the inside
of the wall of gas i lighted a pipeful
of the mercurian substitute for tobacco
that bill and i used thoughtlessly i
cast the match from me and it landed
still aflame at the base of the gaseous
substance

look dave bill shouted it will

burn quick smother it before it
burns through the wall we are not
yet ready to make use of the fact

  the stuff was burning quite rapidly
but by working fast and with the aid
of several of our men we succeeded in
getting it extinguished before it had be-
come noticeable to the opposing force
a ticklish procedure since we knew not
whether the armor that we wore was in-
flammable or explosive fortunately it
was neither

  we had organized the imar into
units of a score each choosing as lead-
ers those that in our judgment were
mentally best fitted to lead the men
were responsible to the captains and they
in turn to us

  find the leaders immediately bill
ordered the imar present and send
them here at once

  when they had assembled he said to
them

  our best chance is to set fire to the
wall on the semi-circle towards the val-
ley when the wall burns through it will
make much smoke if the majority of
the enemy concentrate on that side those
of us that have armor can break through
the wall nearest the hills and take their
fortifications the ones that have no
armor must burn the barrier after we go
through you will have to work fast
before they return to cut us off as
soon as they learn that we have tricked
them

  we were only partially successful
the gas burned very fast as the blaze
gained headway but the force that op-
posed us was both desperate and well
trained they ceased trying to use their
deadly gas falling back and relying en-
tirely upon grenades of high explosives

  some of the men however won
through and set fire to the outer film of

gas that the nimar had spread over the
whole sector it went up in a blaze
of glory

  dianna bill and i kept together for
the two of us harbored one thought and
that was to protect the girl as long as
possible also if the battle went against
us we were determined never to be
taken alive again

  dianna with her keen eyes saw it
first coming up swiftly from the south
in the dim light it was less than a
thousand feet up and rapidly coming
closer the great searchlights cut the
air

  back imar to the center of the
circle

  we sent the command along the line
of fighting men powerful glasses i knew
were up there searching the field below
to separate friend from enemy

  the nimar located the transatel ship
but in the confusion we got clear of
the first lines then the big guns of the
ship went into action supplemented by
the smaller arms as the vereans sent a
rain of steel from the clouds before gas
weapons could be brought into use the
issue was settled those that remained
of the enemy force were in full flight
across the plain such is the power of
rapid fire small bore weapons when used
by men who know them

  in a few days we had covered the
march of the imar beyond the first high
range it then seemed unlikely that they
would be immediately followed and we
left them to make their way to their
homeland

  it was with satisfaction that at the
controls of the ship in the mystic half-
light that is neither night nor day i
lay our course southward into the land
i had learned to call home the one i
loved seated at my side

cposi and nega

            by joe w skidmore

we have another episode in the lives of the two interesting little beings
posi and nega whose protonic and electronic lives are so full of strange
adventure and adventure not a whit more strange than the unvarnished
truth of the history of molecules would read if put down in cold print

proem

a gain we adventure with posi and
 nega our diminutive electronic
friends in past prefaces of posi and
nega narrations i have rashly promised
you that the little beings will some day
live in the brain box of a great scientist
and philosopher-that you and i might
attempt to share the thoughts of the
mighty

  such a vast temerarious conceit on my
part shakespeare in hamlet wisely
observes conceit in weakest bodies
strongest works the eaglet must flutter
its weak wings before it may soar this
weak pen too flutters and falters-so
hold with me in patience mayhaps again
posi and nega may-

  after all its not important what my
impotent pen records of posi and nega
even you and i are not important in the
vast incomprehensible scheme of things

  but it is important that you and i
think-and think atlantean thoughts
and that we marvel in reverent wonder
at the incredible scheme of things-the
vastness-the smallness of things

  so lets hope-the mighty hopes that
make us men tennyson

here are we now
vibrated nega the
trim young negative
electron her speed-
ing flashing orbit
glowed an agitated purple

  say you dumb female electron
snarled posi the positive electron ive
told you before were on our way to the
ocean were in a cursed sewer built by
those stupid tellurians of all the bad
luck this is the limit

  nega politic as women can be ignored
the fury of the angry proton and turned
to other electrons in her atom of oxygen
for information

  posi and nega the two tiny electrons
had experienced many incredible adven-
tures together in various elements they
were born far out in the cold places of
endless space-mothered by the mysteri-
ous cosmic rays and fathered by that in-
comprehensible energy that gives life and
motion to electrons

  posi was created a positive electron
sometimes called by tellurians a pro-
ton nega came into life a negative or
orbital electron they were first met in
an atom of helium gas for countless
eons they lived and loved drifting hither
and yon in the vast voids of space a


they are drowning even now the dirigible is fast breaking up
the engines and heavy structures have torn loose and sunk


amazing stories

care free existence whirling and dancing
strange dances of love singing vibrating
hissing melodies with the amazing speeds
of their flashing orbits a diminutive
solar system-that atom of helium with
plenty of room for posi and nega to
oscillate with only four positive protons
in the compound nucleus partly bal-
anced by two orbital negative electrons

  strange but posi was  times
heavier than the radiant vivacious nega
the mighty and inscrutable intelligence
that directs all life and motion has vested
negative electrons with an astounding
power in the composition of the ele-
ments known to humans it usually re-
quires but one tiny negative electron to
balance one of the massive positive
electrons

  posi the positive electron was male
nega negative or female-as it is in
human life

  posi was many thousand years older
than nega and had braved many dangers
on various planets and stars then in
the mighty vastness of space they by
chance drifted into the powerful pull of
the suns gravity for years they sped
with ever increasing velocity toward the
blazing exploding furnace of the sun
had they been drawn into phaethons
fiery blaze they would have been ex-
ploded the positive charge of their atom
would have helped with its infinitesimal
bit to form a sun wave or pulse of energy
-to warm and light the planets

  thus electrons are transformed into
energy to add to the heat and light of
the sun to prevent that mighty orb from
turning cold and freezing the entire solar
system just a small unit of the incred-
ible and orderly scheme of things i

  a giant space car picked them up
barely in time scooping millions of the
helium atoms into one of its forward im-
pellation tubes the space car carrying
hundreds of vega travellers and en route
to earth collided with an immense me-

teor in the frightful heat developed at
the impact posi and nega were trans-
mutated by the terrific heat and pressure
into the structure of an iron atom

  the meteor and the space car now a
fused shapeless piece of metal being
within the attraction of earth plunged
to arizona soil for years posi and nega
led a very dull existence in their iron
atom  feet under the soil

  a party of earth scientists ever search-
ing for truths and facts dug a shaft to
the meteorite and took samples for ex-
periments posi and nega were among
the countless billions of electrons that
made up the mass of the tiny fragment
of the meteorite taken by the scientists
for laboratory tests then followed for
the two little beings horrible experiences

  the scientists put their iron atom
along with billions of others into a deadly
alpha ray machine tbe tiny frag-
ment of iron was bombarded with rend-
ing streaking rays the scientists were
trying to disintegrate atoms

  the result was a mighty debacle of
atoms protons and electrons gone mad
incredibly small solar systems flying ber-
serkly from their orbits worlds-uni-
verses-smashed-disintegrated

  by some miracle posi and nega
escaped destruction not being struck
squarely by any of the darting swording
alpha rays they were however
driven into the lead lining of the device
to become part of a lead atom

  years passed the alpha ray device
worn out was sold for junk to the su-
preme disgust of the excitable posi who
was exceedingly vain and proud of his
knowledge and experience brought about
by his long life on many planets and
stars

  the lead was finally sold to a factory
where it was melted and cast into bullets
posi and nega in their lead atom that
helped to make up the mass of a bullet
experienced a very exciting adventure
an epos of posi and nega



a human used their bullet to murder an-
other unlucky human

  after a mighty explosion in the lab-
oratory of the crazed doctor who com-
mitted the murder posi and nega found
themselves literally blown into an atom
of oxygen they drifted in the atmos-
phere and to the added indignation of
posi were breathed into the lungs of a
human infected with typhoid fever
they were introduced into the patients
blood stream and were carried to the hu-
mans alimentary system there they
were attacked and eaten by a dreadful
typhosus bacillus posis rage knew no
bounds when they suffered the indignity
of passing through the diseased humans
digestive system-into a sewer

  thus it is we find posi raging with
stark fury and nega sweetly and mildly
excited on their way to the ocean

  fine piece of business snarled
posi suddenly breaking a long
and sullen silence but at least were
out of that infernal sewer

  where are we purred nega eager
for information and glad to observe
posis better humor

  watch your orbit vibrated posi
sharply as if the whole universe de-
pended on his command nega in her
excitement had oscillated the slightest in
her speeding flight

  watch your own flight hissed nega
ive as much orbital pride as you im
getting sick and tired of your surly

growling i-

  wait a minute dont get excited
my darling nega i just wanted to make
you mad do you know my sweet you
look so lovely when you glow that charm-
ing angry red it fits you like the tail
of haileys comet

  posi smugly fancied in his vast conceit
that he was the great lover of the atomic
universe jurgen in the novel boasted no
greater conquests of love than posi did

  nega ever gullible and eager for flat-
tery-as women usually are-was in-
stantly mollified

  please tell me where we are negas
vibrations were beseeching

  were now in the ocean called the
pacific by those dumb humans weve
been carried out to sea about five miles
by offshore currents posis humor was
better as he went on academically

  this pacific ocean is a great place
after all those foolish tellurians are
very proud of their land but they dont
realize that their little planet earth is
surfaced by many times more of an area
of water than of land maybe this wont
be so tough after all youre always
with me

  what is this water that makes up the
mighty oceans purred nega archly
pretending great ignorance that her lover
might appear important you are so
wise posi you know everything

  it seemed that the colossal conceit of
the positive electron fairly increased his
mass as negas words vibrated on his
consciousness

  my dear nega buzzed posi with
vast importance and using his best
scholastic manner ocean water is a most
interesting liquid we will drift about
and meet many electrons who live in dif-
ferent elements of course you know
that oxygen atoms and you and i live in
one of the oxygen atoms combine with
hydrogen atoms to make pure water ive
lived in ordinary water before and it
was not so exciting but in sea-water its
different the salts in sea water are
seventy-eight percent sodium chloride
fifteen percent magnesium salts and four
percent calcium salts

  but thats only ninety-seven percent
sang out nega quite critically and proud
of her numerical observation what is
the rest

  oh just various-other-substances
whistled posi quickly to cover his con-


amazing stories

fusion and lack of knowledge yes my
darling nega we will meet lots of fine
magnesium sodium and calcium elec-
trons oh dont ask me i know you
want to know what these elements are
you stupid female electron well here
goes watch your orbit

  magnesium is number twelve in atomic
number and has an atomic weight of
twenty-four and thirty-two hundredths
taking hydrogen as  as a conse-
quence it has in each atom twenty-four
protons like myself and each nucleus is
balanced by twelve free orbital negative
electrons like your own trim self mag-
nesium is a silver-white metallic element
ductile and light as to its specific gravity
i once met a female electron named mec-
tro on the planet venus-the planet of

love mectro was lovely and oh so-

  never mind about your ancient love
adventures snapped nega in a sudden
bitter rage what is calcium

  calcium hastened posi anxious to
cover the slip of his amorous retrospec-
tion has in each atom forty positive
electrons  with twenty planetary
negative electrons like you calcium is
a silver-white soft metal of the alkaline
earth group when heated it burns with
a brilliant light and tarnishes quickly
when exposed to air and my sweet but
ignorant negative one if you want to
know more calcium melts at eight hun-
dred and ten degrees centigrade and has
a specific gravity of one and fifty-six
hundredths calcium is bivalent a con-
stituent of the highly basic oxide ca 
quicklime and hydroxide caoh
slaked lime and other compounds valu-
able to these elemental humans those
ignorant tellurians didnt isolate it until
their calendar year of eighteen hundred
and eight then one of their truly great-
est scientists named davy discovered it
i suppose buzzed nega with omi-
nous vibrations that you have flirted
with many negative calcium electrons

  yes on the planet mercury where
the temperature is seven hundred and
fifty degrees fahrenheit i met cacel a
young negative electron-i-oh now
what am i talking about i was just
dreaming lied posi shrewdly remem-
bering his former social error and hasten-
ing on to cover his embarrassment you
wanted to know about sodium my lovely
radiant sweetheart oh yes sodium has
twenty-three protons or positive elec-
trons i am a proton you know in each
atom with eleven free or orbital nega-
tive electrons each one just like your
own beautiful mass sodium has a spe-
cific gravity of nine seventy one-thou-
sandths and a melting point of ninety-
seven and five-tenths degrees centigrade
it oxidizes quickly in the air reacts vio-
lently with water producing caustic soda
and hydrogen the erudite tellurian
scientist davy also found sodium for
the first time in the earthly year of
eighteen hundred and seven

  and i knew about sodium a million
years ago-and that concluded posi
finishes your chemistry lesson for this
time my stupid but exquisite pupil
my we are certainly going to meet a
lot of electrons in this nice ocean thanks
posi you darling for the information
lots of good it has done i dont
suppose your feminine mind will retain
any of it wait here is some news
that is news were going to have an
adventure posis sudden glow of pur-
ple showed his keen excitement

  what is it shrilled nega

  more bad luck snarled posi quickly
changing to an angry vibration weve
just been breathed in by a large fish

  i dont understand whined nega
are we in any danger

  no but this cursed flounder that the
tellurians call a paralichthys dentatus is
a most remarkable fish it inhabits the
deepest waters where fish can withstand
the terrific pressures and it has a habit
an epos of posi and nega



of migrating frequently to shallow waters
near the shore lines dont you see this
flounder fish may take a notion to take
for deep water and we may have to live
in the deeps for countless ages pilet
says it is about time for the flounder to
swim for deep water

  who is pilet shrilled nega

   pilet is a positive electron living in a
bismuth atom in the tiny brain of the
flounder pilet has been there for many
years and is much discouraged about his
dull existence as soon as we were
drawn into the flounders gills i estab-
lished a fine line of communication along
the energy that flows through all elec-
trons until i have a perfect line of con-
tact billions and billions of oxygen posi-
tive electrons are listening in pilet is
almost crazy to hear news of the uni-
verse hes a talkative cuss just like you
female negative electrons

  why did the fish draw us into his
gills-and what are gills nega allowed
her orbit to oscillate as she asked the
questions in frenzied excitement

  what ignorant clucks you negative
electrons are grated posi the fish
has to breathe it must have oxygen
our flounder draws water into his mouth
and expels it through the clefts between
the bronchial arches of his gills thus
aerating his blood stream which circu-
lates in the thin-walled gills from its
heart which has but one auricle and one
ventricle we will pass by the ventral
aorta again to the gills and from there to
various organs of the fish and unless we
are stopped to restore some tissue or
cells the blood we are in will return to the
heart in a venous condition while i tell
you this we have made several round
trips just now we are in the gills again
-and here is news

  what now  is it exciting  squealed
nega as she saw posi glow a sullen
angry violet

  exciting its worse than the sewer 

its rotten luck weve just been ab-
sorbed by a nogagiis latreillii

  cosmos shrieked nega what is
that

  posi did not reply for some time nega
did not know he was trying to re-estab-
lish his contact of communication with
pilet who lived in the brain of the
flounder

  weve been absorbed by a dirty fish
louse posis tones carried supreme

disgust

  a fish louse from nega for once
her feminine complacency shaken

the smallest of microbes barely vis-
ible to the most powerful human mi-
croscopes are made of elements that are
in turn composed of atoms and electrons
each atom of the millions comprising one
single germ are in turn made up of
countless diminutive solar systems the
scheme of solar systems whirling orbit-
ally and spinning in amazingly orderly
flights is the theory of the basic plan of
all matter from a tiny grain of sand to
the mighty universe

  this impotent pen again poises uncer-
tainly would that it possessed inspired
power to describe the wonder of that
vast intelligence that directs the timed
flight of the smallest electron and like-
wise that of the mighty star

  yes a louse shrilled posi still angry
humans have lice their domestic an-
imals and other animals have fleas and
lice and our flounder has parasites or
fish-lice if you wish thousands of
them that infest the fishes gills our
louse a nogagus latreillii is a member
of the true copepods you see nega
these lice live in the soft feathery folds
of the gills where the blood is almost
exposed for oxygenation these parasites
suck a little blood from the sponge-like
thin walls of the gills thus it happens
that we are in the stomach of this louse

  im just as happy sang nega


amazing stories

were still in our atom of oxygen and
what difference does it make 

  none i guess at least to you
snapped posi yours is a case where
ignorance is certainly bliss i dont like
this place but one thing it wont last
long for the life of this pesky louse is
only a few hours by tellurian time
hold fast heres news this may prove
exciting

  what is it now nega fairly sibilated
in her excitement

  our flounder started for deep water
and has just been attacked by a large
and vicious barracuda this roving terror
of the ocean has torn our flounder to
pieces and is gorging the large portions
there we go our louse is now floating
in the water quite free from the struggle
we are free nega at least we will be
soon for the louse has died of old age
and is beginning to disintegrate due to
the eating by even smaller bacteria in the
water

  then what will happen to us

  i dont know rasped posi i hope
we are near to the surface so that in a
thousand years or so we may be picked
up by the sun in the form of water
vapor

  what is water vapor asked nega
oh dont bother me for a few years
snarled posi i want to establish some
new lines of communication

  ill be glad to leave you alone re-
torted nega dont forget there are
seven other nice handsome protons in
our atom of oxygen

  truly the retort of a woman in love

time the ever-flowing force of the
timed intricate dance of the uni-
verse flowed on and on in its mighty
dimensional stream time is it a force
tellurians have called it the measure of
duration which is rather an evasion

  posi did not know the true meaning of
time but he and nega did realize that

many years as figured by tellurians
passed all this while their atom of
oxygen drifted hither and yon with the
urge of whimsical currents for a while
they lived in the body of a floating argo-
nauta a large specimen of the genus
cephalopoda with eight arms or tenta-
cles-then in the soft body of a drifting
jelly-fish a medusa of the order cteno-
phora a giant sperm whale a ninety
foot specimen of the genus mystaceti
scooped in the jelly-fish along with mil-
lions of others and posi and nega trav-
eled a thousand miles in their immense
hosts sluggish blood stream before a
coursing group of the ferocious killer
whales orca gladiator literally tore
the huge whale to small pieces to appease
their incredible appetites and once
more the two little beings were floating
freely in the ocean

  posi and nega drifted for months with
the warm japan current toward the shore
line of north america by this time the
irrepressible posi was reconciled to life
in the sea and was his usual vivacious
cynical self

  well nega he sang in happy vibra-
tions we are now almost at the surface
of the ocean theres an upward cur-
rent and the sun is high and hot this
is a chance in a million we may be
picked up-evaporated by the sun

  i dont understand tell me more
pleaded nega

  posi hastily glowed his best color and
began the smug little positive proton
was ever eager to show his knowledge
it pleased his vast conceit ten million
years old was posi and still but a young
chap he had lived on many planets and
in various elements a great talker and
a good fellow he had acquired an aston-
ishing fund of information

  listen carefully my dumb but beau-
tiful nega the land of earth must have
rain water out of the ocean in the form
of water vapor is drawn into the air by
an epos of posi and nega



the powerful pull of the suns rays the
process is called evaporation heat is ab-
sorbed in the process of evaporation-
but the more heat the more rapid the
creation of water vapor normal air con-
tains oxygen and water vapor all neces-
sary for animals and humans and also
carbon dioxide for plants and tree life
and nitrogen to dilute the oxygen

  moist air is lighter in weight than
dry air this because when moisture en-
ters air it displaces other components
mostly oxygen and nitrogen an oxygen
molecule is nearly twice as heavy as a
water molecule and a nitrogen molecule
weighs a little less than one of oxygen
therefore an increase in water vapor
means a decrease in density of the air
whereas a decrease in water vapor causes
an increase in the proportion of the
heavier components and therefore an in-
crease in density

  more water is evaporated by the sun
at the equator of the earth than on other
portions the sun draws at the equator
about eight cubic feet yer year per square
foot of the ocean the sun evaporates
over five hundred pounds of water from
every square foot of surface in the
polar regions the evaporation is only
about one-tenth as much

  it rains from the clouds when the air
reaches the point of saturation when it
will hold no more moisture i dont sup-
pose any of this is registering on your
stupid female mind but-

  oh yes my dear posi i understand
perfectly lied nega

  all right my beautiful one went on
posi a cubic foot of air at fifty de-
grees fahrenheit will hold about four
grains of water vapor at sixty degrees
fahrenheit about five and three-quarter
grains at seventy degrees about eight
grains and at eighty degrees about
eleven grains so its like this-suppose
a large mass of air at eighty degrees
fahrenheit holding eleven grains of

water suddenly enters an area where the
temperature is colder and where it re-
duces the entire volume to fifty degrees
fahrenheit dont you see-each cubic
foot of air will have to lose or discharge
seven grains of water which of course
will be precipitated to earth drawn there
by the force of gravity do you see now
why it rains

  oh yes purred nega in her sweet-
est vibrations of course i do-its
caused by the force of gravity

  cosmos groaned posi in dismay
whats the use of trying to explain any-
thing technical to a woman

  oh posi dont be angry tell me
about humans and how they make love
well now thats different laughed
posi swing in your orbit a bit closer
you see my sweet one its like this
there love is my dish just a little
closer my sweet

tater all important to human life
  and comfort is a remarkable liquid
hydrogen is the simplest form of all the
known elements number one in the
atomic scale and  in atomic weight
thus hydrogen has a nucleus of but one
proton or positive electron with one or-
bital or negative electron this monad
or univalent element is a colorless taste-
less odorless inflammable gas free hy-
drogen occurs only very sparingly on
earth though it is abundant in the atmos-
pheres of the sun and many stars this
scientists are able to prove by the use
of their spectroscopes though not re-
sembling the metals physically hydrogen
is electropositive and is the positive ion
of all acids

  oxygen eight in the atomic scale and
sixteen in atomic weight is a colorless
tasteless odorless chemically active gas-
eous element occurring in a free state in
the atmosphere of which it forms about
 percent by weight and about  per-
cent by volume oxygen is the most


amazing stories

abundant of all the elements on the
earths surface each atom of oxygen
contains  protons positive electrons
and eight bound electrons in the nucleus
with eight free orbital electrons oxy-
gen is absolutely indispensable in respira-
tion

   pure water that fluid so necessary to
humans animals and plants consists of
hydrogen  percent and oxygen
 percent by weight

  a strange paradox that water without
which man could not exist is slowly de-
stroying the earth-but infinitely slowly
water is drawn by evaporation from
oceans and lakes into the air wind cur-
rents carry the clouds laden with water
vapor over the land and mountains rain
falls each drop wind-driven cutting
away a tiny particle of soil or rock the
drops form rivulets rivulets form
brooks brooks form rivers that rush
to the seas lakes and oceans almost
all eventually flowing into the ocean as
the waters rush from the mountain slopes
to seek their level man harnesses its fall
to give power and uses it for irrigation
but every drop of water that eventually
reaches lake sea or ocean carries a tiny
burden of soil or mineral that it has ab-
sorbed that is why the oceans are salty
because for eons rivers have been de-
positing water laden with salts and min-
erals while the sun evaporates and picks
up only pure water

   so the mighty liquid cycle of water is
a steady relentless process wearing down
mountains and hills there will come a
time in infinitely remote ages when the
ever-moving water will have worn down
all land and our globe will be a vast
sphere of water but providence will
find a remedy-perhaps by the cooling of
the sun that the air may not absorb so
much water to become rain

  all matter-even planets stars and
suns seems subject to decay-to self-
destruction but many million million

million years will pass before such a
catastrophe and long long before that
the human race will be able to move to
other stars or planets or will have suc-
ceeded in controlling climate and water
erosion

f in ally an upward current of
warmer water pushed a mass of water
to the surface of the gently heaving
pacific posi and nega in their atom of

with startling suddenness after a pro-
longed silence cosmos were at the

  what do you mean posi

   just this buzzed the happy and ex-
cited proton i believe were going to
be evaporated our luck is great as
betelgueze conditions are perfect but
theres some risk connected with this
evaporation business we stand a chance
to become separated as we change into
water vapor hold tight to me with all
your pull

   i do hope we wont be separated will
something happen to our atom negas
questioning vibrations were harsh

  small chance consoled posi as
we turn into water vapor our water will
be changed to tiny molecules so that they
can be lifted by the suns rays but i
never heard of an oxygen atom being dis-
integrated by evaporation i guess were
safe and it will be a thrilling adventure
to be back in the atmosphere again i do
hope we lose that funny hydrogen atom
that insists on crowding our oxygen
atom only one proton in that hydrogen
atom and hes a nut he is an awful
braggart says his hydrogen atoms are
the building stones of the universe and
his stupid negative electron shes a

  who cares you dumb but beautiful
negative one all that matters is-were
going to have some new and wonderful
adventures

  will we fall again as rain after we
reach the clouds persisted nega in her
sweetest vibrations

  stars of pegasus snapped posi
you would think of that were almost
bound to fall again as rain water and
if we fall in that cursed ocean we will
be right where we started our only hope
is that strong wind currents will carry
us well out over the land before we fall
as rain

fate or kismet had plans for elec-

trons-and schemes for mice men and
stars chance-or i should write fate-
drifted the mass of water vapor of which
posi and nega were infinitesimal parts
into a colder area and instantly posi and
nega were plunged toward the ocean
again as rain water

into the ocean purred nega quite
composed as usual

  just a few seconds began posi
we-wait weve had great luck a

picked up a drop of our water and
were in that drop what splendid good
fortune but were only on the smooth
fuselage of the plane and we may slip
off into space again no we wont

a break were going places

  where are we going buzzed nega
how do i know whistled posi i
do know its warm in here and our
atom of water is fast drying out were
going to lose those funny hydrogen
atoms that cause us to be water we
are becoming free oxygen gas again
fine were floating free in the air
now here we go the human pilot-

years in the brain of this human and
what do you think my beautiful but
dumb sweetheart  its good news our
oxygen atom has lodged securely in the
crystalline lens of this humans eye
well no doubt stay here for a long
time and just think there are only
a few trillion atoms between us and
pitron talking with pitron is a cinch
and ive a lot to ask him so keep
quiet a few hours will you nega you
can talk to the other seven stupid posi-
tive electrons in our atom-but mind
you-dont flirt

  the business of life for humans is
birth play fundamental learning work
love marriage procreation more work
and finally the inevitable and total dis-
integration of cells a busy whirling
useful cycle of life all guided by a
mighty impulse or instinct

  the business of life for electrons is a
cycle or service much the same as for
humans the little electrons whirl and
vibrate in their orbits various numeri-
cal combinations of the tiny beings form
the different elements which in turn
make up sealing-wax and kings who
can safely say that electrons the basic
elements of all matter do not actually
possess life and intelligence who dares
to make rebuttal

  man toiling at the bottom of a vast
sea of yet undiscovered wonders gazes
at the stars with his puny telescopes
and smugly claims that life does not
exist in the atom or the planets he
fancies in his vast conceit that all the
trillions of stars and moons were placed
in the heavens merely that he be dimly
lighted by night

  such a colossal ego-such unmitigated
self-importance why should man yet
but an infant in knowledge and unable
to comprehend the mighty stars set up

that electrons are but tiny lifeless par-
ticles of electrical energy

  man will always toil strongly and
bravely man will always gain in
knowledge but will always wonder-
and wonder-

  i wonder in my soul

  what you would ask me that i should
deny-shakespeare

sumes its way nearer and nearer to him
what a horrible way to die pitron
tells me the mad scientist is now flying
to his laboratory there he plans to
carry out his plan to destroy all exist-
ing matter

  but how can he do that shrilled
nega

  posi glowed importantly as he con-
tinued

  the mad scientist has discovered a
way to disintegrate all atoms and since
atoms are the building stones of all mat-
ter it looks mighty serious pitron
tells me the scientist has worked for
an epos of posi and nega



many years to develop atomic power for
the iary humans to use say if we
electrons possessed those wonder hands
wed be glad to use them the scien-
tist discovered how to greatly speed up
the self-disintegration of atoms such as
occurs in the element radium then
one unlucky day this scientist accidently
discovered a powerful ray of static
electricity which will cause the protons
and electrons in an atom to actually
meet and coalesce a sort of cosmic
short-circuit for instance i am a
positive charge of electricity you are a
negative charge-if we were subjected
to this ray and forced into actual con-
tact our charges would cancel or neu-
tralize each other and we would in-
stantly become a splash of energy in the
ether and spread out in electro-magnetic
waves carrying us off as energy its
awful nega instantly our atoms ex-
plosion would explode our next atom
and on and on all mass and matter
would instantly disappear and energy
would take their places we would be-
come cosmos knows what perhaps
a seething incredibly hot heavy gas
like some of the younger stars it looks
like serious trouble ahead for us my
dear nega the scientists reason
snapped when he made this awful dis-
covery his poor half-rotted brain be-
came obsessed with this insane scheme
to explode the whole universe and all
because the terrible cancer is eating up
his brain cells

  what is a cancer  begged nega ap-
parently undisturbed by the threatened
debacle of atoms and worlds

  a cancer buzzed posi importantly
is a large group of anarchist cells that
sometimes attack humans normal cells
that make up the soft weak bodies of
those humans stick to their job of re-
storing worn and damaged tissue they
cooperate with all the humans other
cells in a well-ordered mutual scheme

of common benefit but disloyal or
anarchistic cells group together and eat
off other cells without any regard for
the common weal so the multiplying
cells of cancerous tissue expand and
grow without organization-no cells act-
ing as carriers or scavengers-no nerves
no veins to relieve the growth of dis-
ease a cancer is the essence of all
evil-selfishness it-

  oh thats enough posi dont tell
me any more its too horrible begged
nega now thoroughly alarmed

  well well snapped posi you
asked me

  where are we now mollified nega
for some time the irrepressible posi
did not reply nega knew from his
deep purple vibrations that the tiny
proton was receiving some important
information

  well my beautiful nega from posi
in great agitation now were in real
trouble it looks like the finish for
us-for everything the crazy scientist
has landed his plane and is now in his
laboratory pitron is sending out a gen-
eral alarm to all us protons this in-
sane tellurian is going to blow up the
universe with his infernal atomic dis-
integration machine he-

  what good will the general alarm
do buzzed nega we electrons can
do nothing to prevent the scientist from
destroying the universe

  keep quiet hissed posi pitron
is calling an emergency council of all
positive electrons within the range of
his vibrations

  how many will that be in number
vibrated nega apparendy unconcerned
as to the impending fate of the uni-
verse

  cosmos whistled posi what a
question and at such a time you fe-
male electrons are surely stupid i
should say about a trillion raised to the
trillionth power now my dumb but


amazing stories

exquisite one you count them while we
have this great conference and keep
quiet this is a mans job maybe
we can do something to prevent the
scientist from starting his deadly ma-
chine weve got to do something quick
for hes adjusting the device right now

  nega remained quiet and anxiously
watched posis color turn to a deep
portentious purple minutes passed that
seemed eons to nega her fear and
anxiety increased as she noted the orbit
of posi was oscillating and his usual
repellant force to her was suddenly
weaker she knew that some mighty
fear or problem had possessed her lover
in sudden feminine sympathy and un-
derstanding she timed her circling flash-
ing orbit to compensate for posis er-
ratic movements instantly she vibrated
an urgent warning to the other seven
negative electrons in her atom of oxygen
to help hold the rhythm of their atom
nega now realized that some great crisis
threatened she was posis woman-
she must help

  a perfect woman nobly planned
wordsworth

  dangers and catastrophes make all
mankind kindred a nation invaded
lays aside all personal internal matters
to better resist the common enemy so
it was with posi and nega and the
countless trillions of their kind but no
mans courage ever knew the mighty
fortitude and bravery that is womans
in time of greatest dangers

  usually impetuous yet now nega
waited with a mighty patience-and
spun well her tiny part in the vast
scheme of things

  finally posis orbit and color re-
gained normalcy his harsh excited
vibrations almost hurt negas conscious-
ness

  nega my dear sweetheart it looks
like the finish for us be brave my
sweet one the crazy scientist is about

to start his cursed atomic engine pi-
tron is a mighty leader-a great proton
he once lived in the brain box of the
great archimedes there is a bare
chance for the world-for the universe
tell me begged nega what chance
have we

  theres some hope began posi with
incredibly rapid vibrations at the
mighty conference of positive electrons
we just held many plans were discussed
some of the greatest electronic minds
in the universe had a voice it was de-
cided to kill the mad scientist and save
the universe

  but how can electrons kill a hu-
man sang out nega in amazement

  listen carefully my sweet one
were trying to kill him now its
amazing yet simple you see nega
in the soft weak body of this insane
scientist are many millions of selenium
atoms selenium is element number
thirty-four in the atomic scale each
atom of selenium contains thirty-four
negative electrons like your own sweet
self and in the nucleus of each selenium
atom there are seventy-nine positive elec-
trons like me now get this carefully
arsenic element number thirty-three in
the atomic scale has in each atom thirty-
three negative and to form the nucleus
of each atom seventy-four positive elec-
trons and arsenic is a deadly poison
to those soft humans from each sele-
nium atom in the scientists body four
glorious positive electrons and one nega-
tive electron have heroically volunteered
to die and save the universe what
noble martyrs what splendid self-
sacrifice 

  but how shrilled nega i dont
understand

  dont you see my lovely one when
four positive electrons and one negative
electron in each selenium atom destroy
themselves by deliberately dashing them-
selves together and ceasing to exist all
an epos of posi and nega



the selenium atoms in the scientists body
will then have the same atomic number
and atomic weight as arsenic atoms all
the selenium in the humans body will
instantly become arsenic and the dan-
gerous scientist will die of arsenical
poisoning

  but what about all those heroic elec-
trons where will they go

  i dont know puzzled posi no
one knows not even the aged and wise
pitron they will die

  great deeds cannot die tenny-
son

  for a time posi was silent nega
knew the little proton was listening in
for news finally posi sang out in
joyous vibrations

  it worked nega we have destroyed
the insane scientist the universe is
saved pitron says the scientist collapsed
and died of arsenic poisoning just as he
was about to start his devilish machine
humans on earth will never know how
we saved their little globe and the other
billions of stars moons suns and worlds
we electrons never get credit for what
we do

  what will happen to us now buzzed
out nega

  ive been too busy to think of that
replied posi of course were now in
the dead body of the scientist say
posis vibrations became a sudden snarl-
ing whine this is not so good our
bad luck has caught up with us again
these ignorant tellurians have a barbaric
custom of interring their dead so we
stand a good chance of being buried un-
der the ground for a few thousand
years adib of draconis what cursed
luck

  never mind posi strummed nega
we have each other and just think
we electrons saved the universe its
wonderful

  but the irrepressible posi was not to

be so easily cheered-even by the minis-
trations of the delightful nega

  some considerable time passed and
posi remained silent glowing a sullen
violet time man has wondered how
to best define time cogent and careful
thought proves that a mass or body
must be of three dimensions-length
breadth and thickness but a mass or
body to exist in these three planes of
space must also exist in time for most
certainly my pen that is now scribing
these impotent phrases has the three
dimensions of space and without ques-
tion this pen exists in time and that
time is now not yesterday or to-mor-
row-but now so is it not an incon-
testable summation that my faltering pen
exists in length breadth thickness
and-duration 

  time is therefore the fourth dimen-
sion  but this is not an essay of science
to deal and conjure with abstruse the-
ories it is a record of posi and nega
and their atomic love emotions and
adventures and also this unlearned
pen is getting into deep waters so
let me record-that it was quite a while
before posi buzzed out of his intense
angry silence

  well nega from posi at last we
must make the most of it we may
escape being buried there is great
excitement in our dead scientists labor-
atory the silly tellurians have dis-
covered our dead scientists body and
what do you think these humans are
making a great fuss over the corpse
they are grieving and proclaiming he
was a great benefactor because of his
scientific work for the human race
skat of aquarius what fools these
humans are if they but knew what
their so-called benefactor was planning
to do it makes me sick even now
our miserable corpse is being conducted
through the streets in high state a
great crowd of these stupid pomp-loving


amazing stories

humans are standing bare-headed a
famous minister is giving a fine oration
he is eulogizing this madman who
planned to destroy them sirius of
canis but i wish we could get away
from this stupid planet earth

  why i think its all been very ex-
citing purred nega

  you female electrons are surely ig-
norant snarled posi cant you realize
that when this pomp and ceremony is
over the earthlings are going to bury
this cursed corpse and it will rot
with filthy worms gnawing at us and we
may be under-ground for thousands of
years im a young chap and i want
to see the universe

  ha ha teased nega youre not
so young your atmospheric rings have
turned a bit silver in the last ten thou-
sand years

  say you dumb female shot out
posi with sudden anger you-wait
heres news that will ruffle your
feminine poise were going to be
burned

  what do you mean shot nega in-
stantly forgetting the impending quar-
rel

  the humans are going to cremate
the body of the dead scientist

  great cosmos nega squeaked
will it hurt us when we are getting
burnt 

  sadr of cygni flashed posi with
happy vibrations you negative elec-
trons are stupid do you think the
temperature these foolish humans can
produce in their crematory furnace will
harm us electrons the heat will re-
duce this filthy cadaver to gasses and
ashes but the higher temperature will
only exhilarate us besides my stupid
but charming nega this is a great
break we stand a good chance to
escape in one of the light gases which
will form as the dead body burns and
then we can have some new adventures

if we could only get into some other
kind of an element for a while this
oxygen is a shifty tricky element be-
sides im getting fed up on the silly
other seven positive electrons in this
atom theyre a dull bunch

  negas orbital speed increased with a
quick rise of rage she flashed a quick
retort across the distance that separated
them-a distance as vast in relation to
size as the space between the planets
i notice youre not tired of the other
seven negative electrons in this atom
youre always flirting every time i go to
sleep you couldnt be true to one
woman for a thousand years

  well well sizzled out posi can
i help it if the decorative sex admire
me 

 never mind you-you hopeless
flirt hissed nega tell me whats
happening to us now

  hold everything screamed posi
were in the crematory furnace cant
you feel the heat  and our orbital speed
is increasing

  oh posi whimpered nega it
seems terrible to be cremated

  what feels the body when the soul
expires

  by time corrupted and consumed by
fires ovid

  the ancient philosopher empedocles
classed fire with air earth and water
and called fire the fourth element aris-
totle added a fifth element-ether which
he thought composed the stars suns
moons and planets even the mighty
shakespeare was influenced by these
earlier great minds for the bard of
avon wrote-

  does not our life consist of the four
elements the modern scientist says
that fire is the principle of combustion
as manifested in light and especially
flame and in heating destroying and
altering effects flames are usually the
result of chemical combinations with at-
an epos of posi and nega



mospheric oxygen smoke is one of
the products of burning organic ma-
terials smoke is rendered visible by
the presence of small particles of car-
bon and hydrocarbons and soot smoke
is always the result of imperfect
combustion

  all this to say that when the body
of the mad scientist was cremated by
fire it was but changed in element forms
the body became heat energy gases
smoke and ashes every electron that
existed before the cremation rotated on
and on but perhaps in another element

  man can neither create nor destroy
energy he may but change it from one
form to another

  things are happening fast nega
shrilled posi hold tight were
going to experience a change of ele-
ments the heat has reached us the
heat steam and pressure are disrupting
our atom try and hold your orbit
around me as we change spica of
virgo here we go

  posi was old in years and experience
he suddenly changed his usual repellent
force to nega to that of a powerful
attraction--that their chances of remain-
ing in the same atom be greater posi
and nega experienced no discomfort
from the afnazing transmutation that
occurred from the heat of the tellurian
furnace a mild vortex of shifting
atoms and electrons the irrepressible
posi was in a great ecstasy of delight
nega but mildly and sweetly excited

  hold tightly to me nega whirred
posi were going into another ele-
ment cosmos look at those pretty
negative electrons crowding into our
atom then in a harsh vibrating
snarl to a strange and intruding proton
keep your distance you fool and
watch your rotation  im posi i-

  chfernistry is an tld and ancient art
-old as the history of man once it
was called alchemy and the early alche-

mists were most greatly concerned with
the vain hope of transmutating the baser
metals into gold-and to find the elusive
secret of eternal life these ancient
searchers for truths are fiot to be de-
preciated-their efforts paved the way
to great discoveries an old chinese
manuscript written two thousand she
hundred and ninety years before christ
tells of a great chinese alchemist named
wong tai this ancient father of
medicine prescribed crabs eyes for
stomach disorders and pulverized toad
skins for cures for other troubles

  dont smile-just think for modern
chemists now find that crabs eyes are
composed mostly of calcium carbonate
a fine remedy for stomach hyperaci-
dity and that pulverized toad skins
contain bufagin efficacious in dropsy
and ephedrine which is a splendid tonic
for weak hearts

  the erudite scientist of over four thou-
sand years ago could well smile at the
conclusions and findings of to-day but
such a future scientist will not smile at
the rungs we have fixed in the mighty
ladder of knowledge rather his in-
credible and tolerant mind will be
amazed at our small but important find-
ings and more greatly amazed at the
wonders yet to be unfolded to him

  nature in her marvelous laboratories
can in many ways surpass mans puny
efforts in mans laboratories a tn-
perature of two thousand four hundred
degrees fahrenheit-enough to melt pig
iron-is required to separate the carbon
and oxygen atoms of the carbon dioxide
molecule white sundrops and pink
abronias tiny flowers struggling for
existence on the sandy wastes of the
mohave desert and many other plants
can separate these atoms without dif-
ficulty in their tiny cell laboratories

  for a moment posi and nega felt a
queer shifting about of their positions
and orbits they were amazed to see

four positive electrons and two negative
electrons suddenly dart fast as light
from their atom it was astounding

  atik of persei gasped posi did
you see that were losing our old
friends

  im glad to see that negative electron
neta leave she was old and fat and
was always fairly orbiting herself at
you

  youre just a jealous female electron
nega sizzled posi smugly but
something has happened to the numeri-
cal composition of our atom wait till

i	get a line of communication and find
out what we are this is great luck

  nega conversed excitedly with the
other five remaining negative electrons
in their strange atom

  posis excited vibrations broke in with
happy impulses

  great luck nega weve been
changed by the chemistry of the burn-
ing from an oxygen atom to a carbon
atom carbon is such an interesting
element and were sure to have exciting
adventures and best of all my sweet
but dumb nega only a few atoms away
lives an extremely old and wise posi-
tive electron his name is proto hes
a million million years old and has
been everywhere he has wonderful
lines of communication i met him
ages ago on saturn we lived in the
same atom of sulphur i remember
nivel a beautiful negative electron we
had- posi stopped suddenly realiz-
ing his amorous slip of vibration-
never mind about that adventure now
-ill tell you some other time proto
has told me a lot already nega my
sweet were in an atom of carbon and
weve gone up in smoke

  what do you mean posi  tell me
more

  were afloat in the glorious sky
sang out posi were in an atom of
carbon which is part of soot which in

turn makes smoke so my darling
negative sweetheart were up in the
air in a cloud of smoke

  how interesting nega purred and
what is carbon

  chara of canis i expected that
question carbon said the conceited
but wise little proton raising the pitch
of his vibrations that all the negative
electrons in the carbon atom might hear
is the sixth element in the atomic
scale you know now of course that
there are twelve of us positive electrons
here in the nucleus of this carbon atom
and that six of you lovely negative elec-
trons revolve around our nucleus and
make up our atom weve more room
to oscillate in this carbon atom

  i knew that already impulsed nega
tell me more about carbon

  propus of the twins  snarled posi
but youre getting wise but do you
know that carbon volatilizes at sixty-
three hundred and thirty-two degrees
f  did you know that chemically carbon
is bivalent and quadrivalent does your
dumb but sweet little brain know that
our atom is a most interesting one--
that it has the remarkable property of
forming complex compounds because
our carbon atoms can unite with others
in chains and rings just now were
only soot drifting about in the air but
anything might happen to us now if
we should happen to be subjected to
enough heat and pressure we become
part of a diamond and diamonds are
interesting why do you know nega
the male human gives a diamond to the
female when theyre in love

  love purred nega is love an

  say you gossiping dames youre
missing something heres news ive
just learned from proto that our car-
bon atom in the soot is settling back
to earth that means some new ad-
venture for us wait a minute heres
news our carbon atom has settled
to earth weve struck something solid
hold everything till i find where we
are

  nega waited patiently as possible and
finally posi flashed

 furud of canis what do you
think nega were in a crows nest

  a crows nest shrilled nega
what is that

  its this way sizzled posi in his

best scholastic vibrations these stupid
earthlings have built a large gas bag
which they call a dirigible airship this
craft is just now leaving its hangar for
a flight and vve were lucky enough to
fall on it so were going to take a
nice flight

  but what has that got to do with
a crows nest asked nega

  youre such a dumb cluck rasped
posi on top of this big gas bag is a
lookout station where one of these silly
humans stays to watch and help navi-
gate the ship its called a crows nest
some of our soot settled into this look-
out station and by a strange chance
we fell squarely into the muzzle of a
signal pistol if something happens to
this dirigible the human in this look-
out may fire the signal pistol and we
will fly out into the atmosphere again
heres more news from proto

  for a considerable time posi con-
versed with the learned proto while
nega waited glowing an impatient pur-
ple

  nega impulsed posi at last heres
fine news these earthlings who built
this large dirigible are making a test
flight they think its large-its eight
hundred feet long

  how long is a feet asked nega
my beautiful nega squealed posi
its a shame your delightful sex has no
brains but it doesnt matter any-
one so alluring has no need of brains
listen my hearts delight our atom
is one hundred millionth of a human
inch in diameter twelve of those
inches make a foot so figure it out
yourself dont be so stupid

  im sick and tired of your wise
cracks about us women being stupid
shrieked nega in a sudden bitter violet
rage i guess were just as important
as you male electrons dont i fill just
as important a part in our atom as you

red and her speed increased until her

  zosma of duhr muttered posi to
himself this little dame is getting into
a temper ill have to change my line
hold everything nega heres news
the dirigible has been flown out over
the ocean and has encountered a severe
storm proto says it looks bad for the
foolish humans on board this silly craft
you know this dirigible is lifted by
helium and we know helium like hydro-
gen loses some of its lifting power when
it enters an area of low barometic pres-
sure such as occurs in storm centers
the huge craft is sinking this looks
bad if we strike the water we may
have to live in the cursed ocean again
for years there proto says were
climbing again but the storm is growing-
worse it looks like more trouble for

  what do the humans use these dirig-
ibles for asked nega

  to make war on other organized
groups of humans i know the humans
are ignorant but i cant understand why
they construct these slow costly and
bulky dirigibles-even to make war they
are quite useless for anything especially
warfare for their unwieldy bulk and
sluggish maneuverability would be a
ridiculously easy target for anti-aircraft
guns and fast airplanes besid s they
are so large and fragile proto says even
now the light aluminum braces of this
craft are breaking up because of the
terrific twist of the storm on such a large
bulk only a few minutes more and this
great craft is a total wreck

  but why do humans make war on
each other

  they dont know any better replied
posi it was only a few million years
ago that humans were but single-celled
creatures in dismal thermal swamps
with evolution the protoplasms were ac-
tivated by the cosmic rays and took
strange forms and crawled-some re-
mained aquatic things that swam some
developed feet and walked humans in
some mysterious way developed the
power of reasoning of course but yet in
a small way and what was just as im-
portant for these soft weak humans
they developed hands-fingered wonder
hands humans owe to these marvelous
fingers their supremacy of the earth as
much as to their yet slight reasoning
powers humans are advancing in
knowledge and a time will come when
they will not kill each other they are
toiling upward strongly and bravely of
course theyre not so wise as we elec-
trons for they have the fearful handicap
of living on earth less than a hundred
years and look at me im ten million
years old and just a young chap yet
wait heres news the dirigible
struck the center of the storm which has
an epos of posi and nega



a powerful twisting downward air
draft the structure of the huge craft
is bent and warped from the twisting of
the storm until it will no longer respond
to the engines and controls there
weve struck the ocean with a fearful
crash this dirigible was traveling a
hundred miles an hour when it struck
at that speed the water would be as a
solid mountain of rock what a shame
the poor humans on this unlucky craft
are doomed they are drowning even
now the dirigible is fast breaking up
the engines and heavy structures have
torn loose and sunk wait proto is
calling me

  nega buzzed excitedly with the other
negative electrons they were all excited
and nervous

  posis vibrations suddenly flashed in a
high pitch

  nega the strangest luck has come to
us the great dirigible broke up and the
forward part with our crows nest has
risen from the water and is rapidly gain-
ing altitude were on our way to the
sky again theres three humans-poor
fellows-in the crows nest they are the
only survivors of the wreck unless hu-
man boats picked up some of the others
from the water these three humans
have no way to communicate with other
humans their soft weak bodies are
suffering horribly from cold and the thin
air for our gas bag without the weight
of motors and rigging is steadily ascend-

the tale of the zatom

      by philip dennis chamberlin

twar spun his motor-chair deft-
ly about and rolled over to
the blue enameled all-metal
cabinet pulling out a draw-
er he withdrew a small in-
strument and sped back to his slate-
topped workbench once there he made
a few adjustments in the weird machine
that stood upon it

  a weird machine it was a jumbled
mass of wires that led to a small
porcelain-like chamber within which the
wires seemed to be fused into a solid
mass above the chamber was a com-
pound microscope of peculiar shape
with a double eyepiece and a sort of
keyboard mounted on its side there
were other peculiar things about the
miscroscope for instance had one been
able to examine it he would have
noticed that all the illumination was
provided through a microscopic aperture
underneath the chamber and that the
light was artificial provided by a mer-
cury lamp of some type and filtered
through two lenses before it reached
the hole had atwar been in a talka-
tive mood which he never was he would
have explained that the purpose of those
lenses was to increase the magnifying
power in a peculiar system of his own

  atwar was quite proud of the affair
for from bottom to top it was his own
invention and the thing he proposed to
do with it of course with the help of his
assistants would undoubtedly astound
scientific circles if he succeeded and he
knew he would succeed

  while he made a minor adjustment
with two right hands he prepared a pad
and pencil with a left hand and reached

for a bottle of small transparent crys-
tals with the other left hand an as-
sistant rolled briskly into the room one
of at wars four huge compound eyes
turned from the instrument to him in
silence the assistant received the thought-
order and sped out of the room a sec-
ond later he was back bringing with him
a group of thought-readers who were to
read atwars mind during the experi-
ment and to accurately record his im-
pressions at first hand this made it
equivalent to having four separate people
perform the experiment

  silently atwar bent over the micro-
scope two huge eyes focussed upon the
stage a third was on the paper pad on
which he would write the results of the
experiment while the fourth eye gazed
straight at the group of thought-readers
in order to facilitate their task for it is
through the eyes that the mind is most
easily read with deft six jointed fin-
gers he picked up a pair of tweezers and
placed a minute crystal of the substance
which was in the bottle upon the
stage he fingered a button on the key-
board and the stage became illuminated
under the enormous magnification the
myriad of wires no longer seemed fused
together rather they were seen to be
skillfully woven into a fine screen of
some sort and on that screen lay the
crystal he adjusted the focus

carefully he twisted the knobs
that controlled the microscopes ad-
justments the crystal faded into vast
nothingness but was it nothingness
the blackness seemed to be filled with
small blowing points he gave the
the tale of the atom



knob another twist slowly materializ-
ing out of the blackness a dull reddish
ball about the diameter of a cent ap-
peared and about it spinning at great
speed were minute specks like grains
of dust in the sunlight or was it only
his eyes his fingers adjusted the knobs
and the red ball grew to the size of a
small orange covering the whole stage
he slid the stage slightly to one side
and three of the specks came into view
now as large as pinheads by careful
manipulation he counted eight it was as
he had thought now he must finish the
committee met at seven and he wished
to have a report ready he made a
rapid calculation as to what wire the
atom must be over and pressed a but-
ton there was a flash that half blinded
him but that was all he had miscal-
culated speedily he worked out the
correction on the pad by his side and
pressed another button

   	  

  the earth was terror stricken men
no longer rode daily to their work in
the great synthetic food plants the
huge pleasure parks were deserted for
in the year g the end of the world
had come at last panic had descended
upon the earth and science was help-
less prophets of a god who had been
forgotten over seventy-eight thousand
years before and reckoning in old
time it was now the year  ad
were arising and proving by a forgotten
volume called the holy bible that all
this had been prophesied years ago and
that now was the time for repentance
there arose also another and more gen-
erally followed cult which held the di-
rect opposite of the first namely that the
end was here and now was the time for
pleasure the streets of the cities were
the scenes of wild debaucheries and rob-
bery and murder were rampant also
there was a small group which strange

to say kept their heads they were
chiefly the great scientists of the planet
those who knew it was up to them to
save the world all day long and far
into the night they worked trying to
devise schemes that stood a chance of
being successful they had all the labora-
tories of the world at their disposal and
they worked with feverish haste most
of them even taking to a vice which
had died out centuries before-dope-to
keep them going and they had to go on
if they failed the world was doomed

dr alice noah was undoubted-
ly the head of the group she had
been head of the government laborator-
ies for a bare two years when the catas-
trophe came but already she had a
world-wide reputation and she was
unanimously chosen to head the body a
part of her speech of acceptance of
leadership is quoted in order that the
reader may understand the situation

  my colleagues she said we all
realize that it is on us that the fate of
the world depends we have been called
together in the eleventh hour to under-
take a task it would be difficult to com-
plete in a lifetime and we must do it
   we should have taken warning
three hundred years ago when sirius
was wiped out by a strange flash but
our ancestors took no heed and now we
find ourselves attacked without adequate
or even partial protection  we all
know what is threatened something is
rapidly exploding in the sun unless it
is stopped we have only six months
left before we shall be without a-solaf
system and we shall go flying out into
space a dead cold meteorite ladies
and gentlemen it is up to us to see
that it is stopped already the sun
is showing signs of vast electrical dis-
turbances and from mount wilson
comes the report that a blue flame of
some sort is rapidly approaching sol


amazing stories

our sun my friends we know that
flame is the same thing that destroyed
sirius and unless something is done it
will do the same thing to our sun i
await your suggestions

  many ideas were advanced and rejected
for the most part they were as foolish
as the theories of those who set out in
space-ships for mars not realizing that
with the break-up of the sun mars
would be as badly off as earth a num-
ber thought of establishing some sort of
a counter-current but it was pointed out
that it was not known whether or not the
destroying flame as the religious fan-
atics had named it was electrical or
not and that if it were such there was
not enough electrical power on earth to
successfully neutralize it another group
tried to make out that the dangers were
overestimated but without successfully
convincing even themselves the great-
er part of the group however could
think of nothing and so they remained
deadlocked for two months

  it was the sixteenth of sol thir-
teen-month years had been adopted cen-
turies back that dr hubbard gran-
stedt proposed his plan and the en-
tire convention stood amazed at the
bearded old patriarchs suggestion for
two precious weeks it was fought for
and against but the doctor had his facts
and figures so clearly disposed that it
was finally adopted then all the body
went into action and by that statement
it is meant that twenty billion tireless
robots started to labor day and night
to complete the terrific task

  everything was in readiness by sep-
tember eleventh and the world was wait-
ing waiting breathlessly for the result
of the test of the forlorn hope of
humanity from points all over the
globe huge structures like the long range
guns of a bygone day were pointed sky-
ward and a network of some sort of
pipes completely checkered the globe

an anxious world was waiting its
time

the eighteenth of september was
the fatal date at three-thirty in
the afternoon the blue flash streaked
across the solar heavens heedlessly an-
nihilating venus and haileys comet in
its course and struck the sun there
was a huge flash the like of which had
never been seen before and the sun
crashed into hundredsof flaming pieces
which flared up in the solar heavens each
a little star in itself throughout the
entire universe there was a jar as the
stars readjusted themselves to the loss
of their brother and things started to
quiet down

  it was the instant the flame had struck
that dr granstedt had thrown the
switch which was to save or ruin the
world from the vast network of pipes
that lay over the world had arisen huge
clouds of gasses that dimmed the ex-
plosion of sol to all human eyes slowly
in great billowing clouds they went up-
wards until they seemed to merge into
one vast mass that completely sur-
rounded the atmosphere then the
change took place the clouds seemed
to lose all cloudlike aspect and to take
on the appearance of a solid ceiling
there was a singing sound as of metal
understrain and then all was quiet an
experimental rocket was projected up
up it went until it reached the ceiling
then it seemed to strike something solid
and in another instant it was falling
back to earth its steel head buckled by
the impact of a collision dr granstedt
smiled for the first time in many
months it was as he had hoped and
planned the gases no longer warmed by
the heat of the sun had solidified and
formed a solid casing around our earth
and her atmosphere terra had re-
treated within her shell

  to an observer from the outside terra


the tale of the atom



now had a strange appearance it was
no longer truly round for at intervals
huge spike-like tubes protruded from its
coverings tubes which an instant later
began to shoot forth streams of fiery
gasses into the void there was a horrid
lurch and the planet started to move-
terra was seeking a new master the
world was in search of another sun-

  it was a long journey through space
the world had become a new and gigantic
space-ship propelled by huge atomic
rockets and carrying its natural atmos-
phere and heat hermetically sealed with-
in its transparent man-made shell it
was not so hard to reach its new sun
as if in preparation for the catastrophe
from time immemorial the sun had
been rushing toward vega at an incon-
ceivable speed and now the earth under
its own power completing the last
lap of the trip for it was toward vega
the independent planet was traveling

  it took nearly a year to complete the
journey but then as if prearranged the
earth fell into an orbit about the star
and took for itself a place where the
heat from the second sun would be
adapted for human life dr granstedt
had calculated the flight to perfection
it was six of the new length years 
days before the semi-transparent outer
shell was melted off into gaseousness by
vega and when it happened a strange
sight was revealed there lay the
world still surrounded by its atmosphere
and still temperate in climate but there
was some difference where were all
the mountain peaks that had once risen
into the atmosphere where were the
long low plains everywhere things
seemed different where was the land

all over the surface of the planet was
a vast shallow sea with here and there
a tiny island dotting its surface all the
main land was submerged dr gran-
stedts travel idea had been perfect but
he had forgotten one little thing he had
left the moon behind

it was a horrible death that the hu-
man race had suffered the uncon-
trollable water had swept the land clean
of life the very surface of the earth
without the moons continual pull had
buckled and twisted throwing masses
of lava into the steaming sea the
earth had become a chaos in which no
life could have hoped to exist however
hardy it might be but that is all over
now and scientists on one of vegas inner
planets are still trying to figure out in
their reptile heads for intelligence is not
a strictly human feature what brought
the watery planet to join the huge stars

i knew i could do it he said or
rather his eyes passed on the message
for his race carries on all conversation
in that way not having been equipped
with vocal cords i always have said
that the atom could be exploded and
now ive proven it it was all as i ex-
pected it to be except that i cant under-
stand what made the third electron jump

editor amazing stories

  this letter is to announce the advent of a
much needed science fiction organization in
new zealand would you be good enough to
publish it in the discussions section of your
excellent magazine

  the new zealand science fiction associa-
tion is to be a body for the promotion of this
type of literature in new zealand and a medium
through which all members may communicate
and express their views we aim to bring all
lovers of science fiction together in this cause

  would all new zealand and australian
readers interested please communicate with
mr n patton pokeno new zealand or my-
self to such enquirers we will mail further
information the subscription rate will be low
and we are thinking of publishing a small
monthly bulletin through which we may come
together and discuss science fiction of the
month this will come when we have reached
a sufficient membership to warrant it mean-
while wishing amazing stories every success

asked for

editor amazing stories

  this is my third letter-but it wont be my
last although i have not yet seen any of them
in the discussions column

  amazing stories is fine nowadays-much
better than the old ones of course im tak-
ing it as a whole not individual stories i
managed to pick up an old number the other
day and read seeds of life by john taine
and i dont think ive ever enjoyed a story
so much his characters lived and he didnt
go over the bounds of possibility    which
made the story perfect that story in fact
has been instrumental in introducing a s
to many other friends of mine    they are
now regular readers and eager for more stories
like that  they all agree in saying that morey
knows more about the illustration racket than
anybody else    and theyre right although
he used to be terribly scribbly he seems to be
paying more attention to details now

  i see one yes just a feeble one letter in
the discussions column from england which
asks for an english editor of amazing over
here to this i add my signature its a grand
idea its stupendous its colossal-i when are
you going to start it working

  jules verne i see is continuing to appear
in our mag ed a poe too is on the pages
say why not send over here for some works
by shakespeare these stories are good
enough in their place but why the heck must
they take up the room in which a modern story
could be set we want modern stories written
in a modern less colorful language granted
the mag is nearly perfect but why not make
it  per cent

  if theres anybody listening from england
id be glad if theyd write up and agree with
me theres a helluva lot of your magazines
sold over here-and im doing my best to
increase the demand which is growing steadily

  anyway heres to modern science fiction and
so long to victorian blah-and of course
good luck to amazing stories

england

  recently we have received a great many
letters of foreign correspondents especially
from english readers this one is especially
interesting as it is the second one in which a
writer asks us to publish an english edition
there is nothing we would like better to do
and there is no knowing what the future may
bring about we are still in the middle of a
depression here and it is an open question how
soon our peculiarly academic government in
washington will get us out of the trouble we
have not given reprints for several months so
that rather eliminates your criticism we thank
you for your good wishes-editor

science fiction societies in england

editor amazing stories

  it is so common for you to receive letters
from england nowadays that this epistle of
mine will have no distinction other than this
the writer has been one of the most enthusias-
tic and admiring of your readers english or
otherwise since  and has a collection of
your magazines commencing with the decem-
ber  issue

  another thing for almost as long i have
done my utmost to interest my friends and
strangers in science fiction which i believe
january 

amazing stories



to be the greatest force in modern literature
despite the fact that it is practically entirely
neglected by british publishers-a sin that i
have also tried hard to rectify

  it really amazes me the large number of
english readers letters there are published in
your pioneer magazine in  there must i
believe be thousands of science fiction fans
in this country to-day though when i myself
became converted there were very few indeed

  as secretary of the ilford science literary
circle which i formed some years ago with
the object of furthering the movement i com-
municated with a considerable number of these
english readers many of whom in their turn
have now formed similar organizations and in
many cases much more successful ones it
affords me great pleasure i can assure you to
see their letters in your journal from time to
time

  but even if british publishers refuse to
appreciate the existence of these fervid ad
herents of science fiction british authors who
have the ability necessary to write such en-
grossing material have not been so asleep

  i had the pleasure some time ago of mak-
ing the acquaintance of mr j m walsh the
gifted english writer of many excellent mys-
tery stories who in the name of h haver-
stock hill recently contributed the terror
out of space to the columns of amazing
stories at that time he was very anxious to
write science fiction but there was and still
is little scope for it ver here anyway the
british publishers loss in this respect is your
gain for mr walsh was quick to seize the
opportunities that presented themselves in
america

  then there is john russell fearn another
english enthusiast who wrote to me a few words
of encouragement when i first formed the
science circle here and who has since blos-
somed out as an author in your columns-
and very successfully too judging by the com-
plimentary letters you have published concern-
ing his work

  yes science fiction has made progress within
these shores since i first became familiar with
your earliest issues seven years ago

  but there is one thing that has yet to be
done there are now many organizations
scattered throughout england whose members
are devout followers of the movement but who
have no means of knitting themselves together
in order to further the cause of science fiction
more swiftly and efficiently than they can do
separately these numerous clubs-some of
them an offshoot of american societies some
self-centered and others affiliated to bodies in
germany france and elsewhere-could work
much better if they were co-ordinated into one
parent body publishing its own official organ
by means of which they could keep in touch

  my object in writing to you is to ask you to
publish this request for secretaries of all british
science fiction societies to communicate with
me to see if something cannot be done to bring

about this co-ordination and so enable us to
achieve still greater things in the name of
science fiction

  i shall be glad to receive suggestions as to
how best to go about this great but to my
mind worthy task not only from secre-
taries of the various existing bodies but from
all english readers of science fiction as one
who has been actively identified with the move-
ment in this country for some time and has
therefore acquired an extensive knowledge of
the subject i shall be pleased to render as-
sistance and do my share of the work that
will have to be done

  i will not dwell upon the subject of what
things could be accomplished as the result of
such a union but appeal to you mr editor to
expedite the publication of this letter so that
we can get on with the good work as soon as
possible

  for i have no doubt that all english
science fiction fans will agree with me that
we shall progress much farther in unity than
in the loose scattered state in which we now
exist and so hasten the time when science
fiction will be no longer regarded in this country
as something so out of the ordinary as to be
beyond all serious consideration and take a
deservedly prominent place in english litera-
ture

  hoping to be deluged with letters and trust-
ing that we shall have the continued support
of the first science fiction magazine amazing
stories i remain

a letter from ao-tea-roa-the land of
the maoris

editor amazing stories

  about two years ago my brother who was
perusing some of my short story manuscripts
inquired why dont you have a pop at writing
for amazing stories do not be alarmed
mr editor i am not aspiring to contribute to
your magazine what are amazing
stories i asked in surprise wondering how
i could have missed anything of so interesting
a nature as he appeared to regard that of the
magazine

  i bought two copies and that is how i be-
came acquainted with amazing stories

  now i await with the greatest of eagerness
the arrival of the next months copy i have
only just received the february number so
you see we are late in getting them here in the
land of ao-tea-roa the pretty maori name
for new zealand the interpretation being
long white cloud


amazing stories	january 

  when i see amazing stories in a sta-
tioners shop window it seems to leap out from
all the other magazines owing to the unusual
cover design i hope you will always adhere
to that style

  the february number was especially nice
mr morey has done very well the expression
on the martian leaders face being so enigma-
tical that one could not resist turning to
terror out of space to discover that it is
a story of merit the author mr h haver-
stock hill deserves all the kudos he must be
receiving as he seems to be a gentleman of
culture and erudition i am awaiting the next
instalments with great impatience

  i like the stories best dealing with inter-
planetary travel and time i also like your
slogan if i may call it so extravagant fiction
to-day    cold fact to-morrow in fact
i like everything about your mag

  the editorial by dr t oconor sloane
phd is always good and gives the magazine
a real scientific standing

  for years i have read very little fiction
now i think it a great relaxation after read-
ing say sir james frazers golden bough
to delve into the refreshing pages of your
most excellent magazine

  there seems to be some controversy re-
garding the size and the quality of paper used
what does it matter when the quality of the
contents is so readable and the cover design
so artistic besides the smaller size is easier
to manipulate when reading in bed in trains
or tram cars although i must admit to a
feeling of disappointment when i first viewed
the new size but i am one of those individuals
who do not take too kindly to changes

  i think our editor deserves great credit and
our warmest thanks in compiling a monthly and
quarterly of so high a standard as amazing
stories

  with very best wishes to the editor and
staff also to the extremely large family of
keen readers of our good old amazing
stories the magazine par excellence

  this is a letter from new zealand it is
especially interesting as coming from a lady
in a distant land where the race of maoris
formerly held sway the writer gives us the
name of new zealand in the maori tongue
and ends up with what we suppose are the
aboriginal words for sincerely yours the
combination of good wishes and really intelli-
gent criticism gives the letter a true value and
we always find that letters from the fair sex
are especially pleasant reading for the much
criticized editor of a magazine of course
criticism from readers is part of the game
it is never resented as such-when expressed
in what your old country people call good
form-editor

  i have only read your magazine for a short
time so perhaps this letter will head for the
waste-basket

  i have read many magazines westerns de-

  among your authors i like neil r jones

dr keller and j lewis burtt the lost
city and the master minds of venus were
swell

  i dont know much of science as i am but
 and i read amazing stories just for the
thrill i get out of the stories your october
cover design was terrible

and perhaps i may live to see the day when

  sixteen seems to be a critical age for it has
produced so many letters by readers of that
age this letter comes from canada where we
have recently arranged to publish our maga-
zine for the benefit of residents in that country
it is rather a good example to the world that
between us and canada there are over two
thousand miles of frontier entirely unfortified
and yet neither country has the faintest idea
of attacking the other the fact that both speak

the same language probably operates to increase
friendship but in europe austria and germany
have been having a rather disagreeable time al-
though both have the one language-editor

an interesting plea for giving reprint
a place in the sun

editor amazing stories

  although i have been a reader of amazing
stories since volume  number  and have
written several letters to the discussions col-
umn they have been completely ignored do
my letters go into the waste basket without
being read because i have no typewriter

  i would like to have my say on reprints for
that seems to be the main subject of discussion
in your columns at the present time

  i have ready an answer for all arguments
against them

  first the works of poe and verne can be
found in any library

  now my answer to that is-i consider my-
self a very sincere s f fan as much a fan as
anyone else half of the kick i get out of
it is making a collection of every bit of science
fiction i can lay my hands on or that i can
afford a book from the city library must be
returned while poking around in a second-
hand book store recently i came across a very
nice looking set of the complete works of jules
verne

  how much is that i asked

  eighty dollars was the very nonchalant
reply

  if the works of jules verne is given a little
at a time in amazing stories along with many
other excellent new stories for a quarter it
seems to me the readers are getting something
for their money

  second most everyone has read verne and
poe

  i believe the latest census reports placed the
total population of the world at two billions
or so now how can one person or group of
persons consider themselves of such importance
among such a vast multitude

  third the stories of poe verne and
wells are old fashioned and smell of moth-
balls

  where can a better more original story be
found than vernes a purchase of the north
pole stories by the above authors may some
of them be rather dry reading but there are
many people who enjoy real literature the
characters created by the old masters are real
people but the heroes put into stories by many
of the modern authors could not possibly sur-
vive the many hairbreadth escapes from death
they go through the law of averages says
they cant thus they are not real people i
am not taking in all of the newer writers in the
above

  as for the smell of moth balls-i dug a copy
of wells time machine out of a trunk so
i re-read it i found the camphorish odor did
not in any way diminish my enjoyment of it

it was certainly in a very well-preserved con-
dition too-get it

  fourth give the living authors a chance to
earn their bread and butter

  says i-if any living author turns out a
story of merit that is not a rehash of plots
originated by the dead authors he certainly
should be able to sell it if reprints will keep
mediocre  stories or just plain trash out of the
s f mags by all means give us reprints

  to those readers who might argue that back
numbers of munsey publications science and
invention and amazing stories can be had
most certainly they can but let them pick out
just one story in even as recent a mag as the
first amazing stories and really try to get it
i have been quoted a price as high as  per
copy of vol  num  of a s then let him
go still further back to bring together a com-
plete serial in the old all-story or science 
invention it is not a simple or a cheap task

  to those fans who might say they do not
care to make a collection of science fiction i
suggest that they try it not just to save their
new mags but to try to collect those back num-
bers it is really a very fascinating game any
money spent on back numbers now will realize
a profit if at any time the fan decides to give
up collecting

  i am heartily in favor of the three serials
running in each issue for the reasons set forth
by mr cahendon in the august discussions

  to those who argue they must wait too long
between installments let them wait until they
have the complete serial

  they will then say that two or three short
stories is not enough reading to last a whole
month anyone with common sense can see
that if three or four part serials are run-
ning at once one of them is almost bound
to end in each issue so if he reads  pages of
short stories and about  pages for each in-
stallment of the complete serial he will have
read about  pages which is about the size of
any one issue of amazing stories

  so much has been said against the publica-
tion of reprints in amazing stories that it
seems quite odd to receive so long a letter ap-
proving warmly of their publication just for
the present we do not anticipate giving any re-
prints or possibly one in the near future one
magazine of very high grade published in this
city gives nothing but reprints one thing we
do observe about your letter is that it is well
thought out and you know what you want to
say and express it very well-editor

a very interesting letter from an english
reader with suggestions and criticisms

editor amazing stories

  this is the first letter i have written you al-
though i have been reading amazing stories
since the beginning of 

  it is going to be a long letter but i hope it
wont bore you too much when something is
being sent about  miles a fiftieth of a
light second which doesnt sound much you
might as well send plenty i am writing to ask
you to publish an english edition of a s i
have about  friends who are all s f fans
and they all agree with me if this were the
days of the chartists i would send you a
petition but it aint wheres miss robb they
grumble about the quarterly being late over
where you are but here weve only had one
quarterly on the bookstalls during the last
fifteen months the july and august numbers
didnt come over to england i hear from the
bookstalls and from what ive read ive sure
missed something the february number was
a fortnight late imagine six weeks again
between the triplanetary instalments ive still
got to wait a week for the third instalment
while you finished it and also terror out of
space which looks promising im sure an
a s magazine would be extraordinarily popu-
lar in england recently a new practical
science magazine has started up over here they
sold  copies of the first number in a
week all s f fans read it as it gives de-
velopments in science im just showing how
popular an english s f magazine would be
and the sooner the better

  i had a bad shock when i saw your sur-
prise was a reduction in size to the present
shape but still its the stories that count
though i shall be pleased when you return to the
larger size i know how bad the trade has been
hit over in the u s a but i have just heard
the weather forecast it said a depression
moving slowly over iceland so perhaps it has
left america

  with the exception of january  the
first s f mag with a decent cover ive en-
joyed every a s ive read that january
number though it had as much science in it
as could be written on your little finger nail
what with the new cover i looked again to see
if i had a s or what but the stuff since has
been the goods keep up the standard and you
will have  faithful english readers even if
the magazine becomes a pamphlet

dont have any reprints ive missed what
january 

amazing stories



 must be good stories including most of the
 skylark series but its not fair to other readers
 i wish i could get those back numbers but by
 the time ive written the offers have gone
 i would like some nice considerate a s fan
 to save me the back numbers he wants to sell
 and let me know all about them

   i hope i havent been too blunt but i would
 like to see a s rise to its pinnacle of last
 spring

                          england

  the writer of this letter must remember
 that our so-called quarterly is really a supple-
 mentary publication which does not appear
 regularly a great many of our readers say
 that they like the small size as it fits in the
 pocket and is better adapted for the ordinary
 bookcase it sometimes seems that we have
 so many readers that whatever we do it will
 please some and displease others we are very
 much interested in noting that the english
 reader seems to be waking up to the value of
 the type of literature which we publish-
 editor	t

  another young critic gives us his views

 editor amazing stories 

  there once was a time when i didnt have
 much respect for our mag as it is sometimes
 called those times were when you printed
 such stories as borneo devils and also many
 more of that type those were best suited for
 the cheaper dime novels

   at present you print none of these stories
 amazing stories has improved very much
 in the past year or so while your chief com-
 petitor has improved little

  please dont print any more of vernes or
 poes stories there is no need to say more
 because almost all of the readers say the same
 thing i cant say much about the editorial
 because there are many different opinions

  i would enjoy corresponding with another
 reader in the same mood i am  years of age

   we do not agree with you on your criticism
 of the story entitled borneo devils it im-
 pressed us as being kiplingesque and we cer-
 tainly enjoyed it a great deal to formulate a
 good opinion about the writing of editorials
 treating science popularly you should try writ-
 ing one yourself we have not seen the many
 different opinions which you mention at the
 end of your letter-editor

  a letter from the space landing field
 from a traveler to mars
 editor amazing stories

   i am sitting in the space port at new york
 wiiting for the  earth-mars space liner
 and reminiscing back over a period of forty

 years to the good old year of  when i read
 my first amazing i remember the september
  issue my favorite story in that issue was
 master minds of venus by w k sonne-
 man i often feel that were it not for a s
 we would not have space travel now well
 now ill close but ill write again in another

some good material and we hope when you
do start for mars that you will have a few
copies of amazing stories to give to martian

master minds we suppose that we may
assume that we have your thanks for having
shown you the way to interplanetary travel-

a very friendly letter with an enigmatical
ending

editor amazing stories

  with your permission i would like to reply
to sennor carlos diaz koller whose letter ap-
peared in your october  issue

  it seems that friend koller has taken the
viewpoint that we are a bunch of writing
nuts to the contrary senor we are not to be
classed as nuts but as true lovers of science
fiction and amazing stories

  certainly you could not find a greater or
truer lover of science fiction than forrest j
ackerman mr ackerman is a friend of mine
and i know that he writes his letters with real
interest at heart interest in amazing stories
not in being a master of the pen

  mr koller speaks of persistency on our
parts the few letters that i have had the
honor of having published were not the result
of persistency doctor sloane will vouch for
this i am sure

  when i sit down and pound out a letter to
a s it is like writing to a friend i know
that all editors doctor sloane not excluded
appreciate criticism and kindly suggestions and
comments from their readers by this and only
this can they determine what their reading
public desires

  perhaps mr koller will admit that he has
judged us nuts a bit too harshly please
understand that our letters are not written for
the mere purpose of self-glorification nor to
see our name in print they are written to
help the science fiction cause by lending our
views and helpful suggestions cest tu

tors must fall by the way there is a theory
which is really a good one to the effect that a
person who never makes a mistake is far from
interesting we cannot imagine a writer who
develops fiction of the type which we want
not making some mistakes in his work the
editorial staff of amazing stories watches out
for these mistakes with the firm conviction
that some escape us we have put in your con-
cluding french sentence as you wrote it we
wonder if you meant cest tout-editor

  favorable criticism of recent stories-
the larger size preferred
editor amazing stories

  i have noticed an improvement in the stories
in the past two issues of amazing stories
this is gratifying indeed and i only hope this
change for the better continues

  the pool of life i found so fascinating
i could not lay the magazine down until the
story was completed come often mr miller

  eighty-five and eighty-seven by eando
binder is one of the best shorts you have pub-
lished in ages plenty of science but written
in such a way that the story was not at all
text-bookish and dull i demand a sequel

  through the andes is turning out to be the
type of story i remember verrill for the
characters certainly are interesting the fault
with a good many science fiction authors is the
fact that they do not pay enough attention to
characterization

  moon pirates ended quite happily

  buried in space by lawrence smith was a
nice short

	  

  if you could use a smoother finished paper
the print would be much cleaner and easier to
read the covers would show up better if a
more glossy cover paper were used

  i hope that you do return to larger size at the
beginning of the next volume as it will be the
beginning of amazing stories tenth year
please correct your volume numbers to read
vol  no  with the april  issue in-
stead of vol  no  you skipped an issue
last year and there should have been but 
issues in the th volume you can still make
the correction by having but  issues in the
th volume

  you are right in your remarks concerning
the characters in verrills story they are
drawn with unusual skill and could well be
studied by story tellers as regards the size of
the magazine theres no telling what the future
may bring forth-editor

  a note on our best authors and on
some stories
editor amazing stories

  i have one hundred and two amazing
stories on hand and have read them all i

have found that the types of story which ap-
peals most to me are the ones dealing with
prehistoric times and adventures far below the
surface of the earth

  the best authors in my opinion of this type
of story are a hyatt verrill and edgar rice
burroughs

  verrills through the andes starts out
excellently

  you have published only two of burroughs
novels namely the land that time forgot
and master mind of mars i enjoyed these
stories immensely why not reprint more of
burroughs works there are many to chose
from and i am sure they would be well re-
ceived

  comments on a number of our stories

editor amazing stories

  the august cover of amazing stories was
not quite so august nor amazing it would
have been much better as an inside illustration
morey has fallen down lately a good cover
with plenty of scientific apparatus and exciting
action has not graced the cover for a long
time if morey would only draw another
cover like the one for the lady of light

  the editorials continue to be interesting

  life everlasting was great superb and
marvelous keller is a master his stories
are masterpieces i repeat the story was
excellent

  the velocity of escape was excellent
skidmore is swell the story was well written
and exciting i expect a sequel soon moreys
illustration for this story was a great im-
provement

  stanton a coblentz came through again
with his in the footsteps of the wasps the
idea is not absolutely new but was written well
enough to cover his point coblentzs style is
truly enjoyable

  north gods temple was very good i
expected something different though

  shot into space was also very good in-
terplanetary stories are still welcome the
idea of space-voyaging still retains its fascina-
tion for me

  photo control was a good story it had
me guessing the termination was certainly
odd it was the last thing i expected to
happen

  the september amazing stories cover was
much better however there is still much
room for improvement

  editorial o k

  the two serials promise to be good

  the plutonian drug was good i wouldnt
like to play ghost with clark ashton smith
i would aot have the ghosi of a chance

   the master minds of venus was excellent
the story was interesting well written and
much to my liking

  the beam was very good although the
science seemed faulty after all a human is
not a yeast cell and does not reproduce by
fission

  the barrier was  k harl vincent has
done better

   the molecule trapper was very good

  now for some advisory hints the title
amazing stories on the cqver should be
changed to the old comet tail its reminiscent
of the magazine and can be noticed more
easily on the stands

   the august cover of amazing stories has
been greatly admired dr keller certainly dis-
tinguished himself in this relation we feel
that it is one of his best he certainly has a
wonderful knack of writing if we may so
express it as a leading authority on psy-
chotherapy fairly standing at the head of his
profession he is peculiarly fitted to write such
a story as life everlastingyou speak of
there being room for improvement in our
covers there are very few things in this world
in which there is no room for that the
trouble with changing the letters of the title on
the cover is that there is hardly room for the
old inscription-editor

a letter with a nice bit of humor at the end

editor amazing stories

  although i am a constant reader of your
magazine i have never written before i
find the comments on the stories very inter-
esting but i have a suggestion which i and
others may find more interesting comments
in discussions heretofore have been mainly
based on the literary value of the stories my
suggestion is to devote a few pages to discuss
the science involved or connected with a s
in these few pages extravagant fiction could
be made to seem more realistic and scientific
question puzzling the minds of the readers
could bi expounded another reason for the
including of these pages is that the literary
value of the stories would be improved
although the scientific facts in the stories are

interesting they sometime clutter up the
story and detract from the emotional interest
and if the beloved editor allows me let me
say that the work on these pages would be
trifling since many of the questions could be
answered by the authors of the stories and
readers who are versed in technics this is
just a suggestion but i think it is a practical
one there is just one test that is to get the
opinions of the readers and now for other
things that fall quarterly is a wow i
enjoyed everything in the issue except the
breathing of fishes and i especially enjoyed
the sunken world bartons island the
malignant entity and radio robbery were

also swell even though i have read them
before one thing however does not leave
my mind at rest that is that democracy is
no longer considered as the best form of gov-
ernment by most of the learned people please
give us some more humor i la bob olsen in
the stories when reading the fourth
dimensional auto-parker the rest of the
family thought i was nuts because of such
frequent bursts of laughter until this letter
appears in print i am

  there is one section of our magazine which
in a sense takes care of itself and that is the
somewhat extended number of letters from our
readers which are put in with very few altera-
tions but practically word for word as they
write them you must realize that our maga-
zine is read by many whose knowledge of
science is very elementary and we rarely feel
that the simpler facts of science appear too
often in our stories editorially we wish they
appeared more often you will get a lot more
from bob olsen who is a fast friend of
amazing stories and you are only one of
many readers who are quite devoted to this
writer how you could object to the few lines
about the breathing of fishes was as deep a
mystery to the editor as is the breathing of
fishes to him-editor

you or your mag the first time i read a copy
was some years ago the skylark three was
running at the time then i lost sight of it again
-only to see it recently and now more of
them triplanetary was one of the best i
have read will ed smith write another yarn
around the same characters in the near future
and about the posi and nega stories will
there be some more give us a reprint of
the skylark series i missed part of them
