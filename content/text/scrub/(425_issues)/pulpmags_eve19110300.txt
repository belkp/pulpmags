look up and not down

    kak old edward everett hale
    pastor of boston of the united
     b states of the world preached
    i sermon when he was young

 which grows younger as the

world grows older

  was - look up and not down look out
 and not in and lend a hand

 just now there is abundant reason for apply-
 ing this to the business of our country

 from everywhere we hear business men talk-
 ing optimism  business looks tine they say
 to us when we talk with them about advertis-
 ing and its going to be better still
 advertisers are thermometers and baromet-

ers both they who invest tluir money in
the intangible asset of human nature through
advertising are the most sensitive men on
earth as to business conditions true bad
times altect them differently for when busi-
ness looks gloomy some of them advertise the
more and others less the difference is only a
matter of their own courage but when times
look good these advertisers all act alike-they
all want to advertise to catch the trade that the
country has ready for them

  to-day what the american advertisers are
doing is to look up and not down business
looks up credit looks up prosperity looks up

  let us all look up and match our advertising
friends with equal confidence

good merchandising on quarter pages

here is a pointed example of the
merchandising which everybodys
accomplishes for its advertisers in
the following letter you note two things

  	that the scott paper company offered
one article direct to the consumer and that
everybodys brought more returns than all
the other publications put together

  	that the other article advertised was
sold in stores the advertising aiming to awaken
public interest in it-and that the jailers
were widely influenced by this advertisement

scott paper company

                  philadelphia december s iqio
robert frotiiingiiam

        everybodys magazine

   dear sir it will interest you to know of the returns
received from your publication on the products we are
advertising therein

   oascotlissiie tawds the hygienic paper towelon which
we used a number of magazines on a mail-order basis
we received more dircct returns from everybodys

than from all the other publications put together and
from a class of people which use this towel in large
quantities such as schools factories hotels ctc in
nearly every case we have received orders

  on sunilissue the only balsamized toilet tissue the
direct returns are much harder to trace but the writer
on a recent trip found that the trade referred to the
advertising in everybodys to the exclusion of all other
publications used and this same condition has been
evidenced in the letters received here from the trade

  these results demonstrate to us beyond the question
of a doubt that the influence of everybodys on the
trade is greater than that of any publication that we
have used and that your readers are of a class that are
quick to appreciate the value of a superior article

  so our campaign has been laid out for the coming
year as with this practical demonstration of your
efficiency in mind

very truly yours

arthur h scott

  but one thing is not mentioned in that letter
all the advertisements save the last were
small only quartet pages which shows once
more that no advertisement in everybodys
is so small as to escapc the eyes of its readers

who was there that you knew

   louk with care at this ghostly picture-this strange old civil war photograph perhaps
among these union soldiers about to venture into petersburg-or among the besieged con-
federates who tensely waited for the fire of this gun-which roared destruction just after
this photograph was taken-perhaps in that dread place some one near and dear to you
moved and fought and fell

   to every american who gazes on a scene like this comes a sense of his own heritage
for the great crisis that tested both north and souih fuund neither wanting in skill or cour-
age and made our national government our unity brotherhood and character

   but where did we get this war-photograph why do we print it here that makes a
story in itself for in securing this picture we secured three thousand five hundred more-an aston-
ishingly vivid panorama of the greatest struggle in modern times

    we will send you that story well printed and illustrated by more pictures

 ivil war i lie  photographs taken were bought by  -
the i nited states government for js and promptly  rie

took the photographs kept a duplicate set for him-   slw mac

with a pocket-book so slim that you arc
afraid to touch it the clover club a club
organized and run by the best known magazine

to you a recipe guaranteed to fatten the thinnest
purse

   tn other words the clover club offers any
girl and every girl who wants more money the

letters of girls who are trying the
clover club wav

i am very very much in love with
   the clover club it is indeed
   easy to accomplish the light task
   you set and i am very thankful
   to you for showing me this rosy
   way to make money

i think it such pleasant work that
    i am devoting every minute to
    it

it is great fun belonging to the
   clover club and gives me lots
   of pleasure as well as profit

many many thanks for the

   check it really seems as if i must be some
   one else for i have never before had showered
   upon me so much good luck

it is certainly delightful to be receiving money
    for the little i do i flunk you heartily anil
    wish every success to the clover club

   every mail brings letters like this letters
that would convince even a sour old cynic that
theres nothing difficult nor disagreeable about
earning money a la clover club

    and best of all there are no conditions to bar
out any girl that wants to join in the first
place there are no dues of any kind then it
doesnt matter one single bit where you live

riding hood or as old as mother goose and
still find a warm welcome within our ranks
we have girls of eight and girls approaching
eighty

   a great many of our girls arc married but
that tact in no way hinders their being one of
u i fee as enthusiastic about it all writes
one as though  were a really truly girl instead
of  married woman with a little girl of my own

   you may devote as much or as little of vour

the club brooch
of solid gold set
with a genuino
diamond

time to the work as you like and last hut not

money of your own-money that does not have
to be asked for nor accounted for to a single soul

able gifts from the treasurc box for instance

in the first place its solid gold
and in the second place it contains
a genuine diamond and in the third
place it comes from tiffanys

club

get a little idea of its beauty and
heres a letter or two that tell you
what the girls who arc now wearing

which i think perfectly beautiful

tainly appreciate it and am so proud of it

a new and modern work of reference adapted
to modern needs

the appearance of a fresh and original edition of the encyclopaedia britannica has been welcomed by
scholars and by book-huyers generally throughout the english-speaking world as a prime nwl of the day
those who hair never jounj any mirk of refireiue exactly suited t their needs will find that thc new edition
will bear the closest scrutiny not only frn the point of view of its scholarship iut ix-causc of its efficiency as
an intelligent recorder of the newer activities of the world of thought research and experience activities whicharc-
dealt with adeijuatelv in no other work the eleventh edition i not  bonk only for the erudite but more par-
ticularly for thc average reader being a complete inventory of extant knowledge ami an epitome of the worlds
progress reduced to an a b c simplicity of arrangement

      those who apfirffiite the value of an eneyelotiaejia and already possess the ninth eiiition will utter un-
derstand how inadequately that work meets present-day needs when they consider that grant was president
when thc first volume wasissued f s that livingstone lml not ln-en found by stanley that volume v gives
the population of chicago  may  as ioooo that the article on the i nited states gives the number of
states in thc union as that the article on germany states that the armor-clad ships of germany consist of
 frigatescorvettes  floating batteries that the satsuma rcl llion s was the last word in japanese historv
further throughout the whole work will be found those contradictory statements that are inseparable from pub-
lication at long intervals faults from which the eleventh edition by reavn of its simultaneous publication will
be found to be free

      those -who loujit unauthorised reprints of thc ninth edition in many cases found them to be incomplete
and mutilated to them the present offer gives an opportunity to replace th sc imperfect and now antiquated
editions with an entirely modern and authoritative encyclopaedia britannica based on the latest research the
new eleventh edition ining protected bv the recent copyright ct cannot ix- reprinted r reproduced in whole

rux your finger across the map from
baluchistan to singapore an eighth
of the globe between these points lie
the mighty states of the indian kmpire
towering mountain ranges and broad and
stately rivers-the indus the ganges the
brahmaputra the irawadi the martaban
-all flowing to the sea from the high
himalayan gable of the earth in this vast
area with its jungles ils deserts ils tum-
bling hill country lies one of the worlds
greatest hunting grounds a region of big
game second africa alone

  my one wish was to test my nerves on a
tiger time and again around the camp
fires of the african veldt i had heard tales
of the big striped cat men that knew told
me there was no quarry afoot that compared
with it in cunning and ferocity in their
minds it was the most difficult to hunt of
all the hunted ones and so with a re-
solve to test the truth of the cantp-lirc

stories i took ticket for calcutta siree
there are no tigers in africa and from there
pushed deep into the indian jungles

  it will no doubt astonish many to hear
that india runs so close to africa in its
wildness one easily pictures africa as a
home of big game comparatively speak-
ing it is sparsely populated and much room
remains everywhere within it for uncounted
hosts of wild things but that india teem-
ing with a population of more than three
hundred million souls should still have
space for big game of many kinds seems very
nearly incredible for the empire averages
one hundred and sixty-seven human beings
t the square mile

  then again this astonishes not only is
there room for game in plenty but much of
it is of the most dangerous sort on an
average india loses every year twenty
thousand persons and fifty thousand head
of cattle from the depredations of wild

beasts consider these figures-statistics
compiled by the government they show
both the abundance of man-killing game
and the mortality due to their ravages

  in one year hyenas killed  elephants
 bears  leopards  wolves  tigers
s snakes  and other animals 

  a total of  there must be many
others not accounted for in the same
year  cattle fell a prey to marauding
beasts remember too that crocodiles
which are heavy destroyers are not men-
tioned in the list but that the destruc-
tion is not all one-sided may be realized
from the fact that during the same period
that is in a single year- dangerous
animals were destroyed besides 
snakes could such a condition exist else-
where than in india i think not

  the indifference of the natives toward
this situation is unbelievable for ages
they have suffered have paid their toll of
death and yet they remain passive like
their cattle europeans that know the
country will unite in telling you that the
timidity of the native encourages the beasts
to attack human life one white man cyn-
ically remarked to me that the life of the
average hindu was so miserable anyway
that he made little effort to preserve it at
any rate it is true that the hindu willingly
leaves the country to its wild life by the
millions he crowds to the cities where he
is content to fester to exist in hopeless pov-
erty and squalor

  out of justice to the hindu however it
should be said that to a great extent the laws
made by foreigners are responsible for this
the conqueror will not let the native own a
rifle lest he may some day wish to rule and
so turn the weapon  his british overlords
naturally without a means of self-defense
the native shuns the jungle

  hut though india is the habitat of the
leopard and the tiger -two of the world s
most dangerous beasts it is not to be com-
pared with africa for its perils of course
if one hunts for danger in india it may
be found there readily-danger enough to
daunt the stoutest heart but for the
most part the indian methods of sirt arc-
little more than childs play beside the dark
continents perilous amusement

  in india for one thing there is no hard-
ship most of the shooting i- dune from a
howdah strapped to an elephant- back in
which one is literally carried to the same

men with one arm or one leg or otherwise
crippled may hunt with success in indian
jungles but not in africa where as a rule
the hunter faces the game afoot in africa
furthermore one usually hunts alone
with a native shikaree and perhaps an
extra gun-bearer in attendance hut in
india the crowd turns out it is a party
ordinarily

  for the outsider however shooting is
made difficult in india permission is re-
quired from the british ruler and also from
the districts native rajah unless you be-
long to a party of officials military or civil
you might as well seek elsewhere for your
hunting a smattering of hindustani is
imperative you will require also the
trained shikar elephants and as these are
owned by officials and native princes unless
you have the proper introduction you can-
not rent them for love nor money and
elephants are absolutely essential on ac-
count of the nature of the hunting grounds

  providing however that you have the
influence the best ground awaits you be-
tween the himalayas and the river ganges
and in the country along the brahma-
putra burma assam and singapore are
also splendid shikar grounds but apart
from these domains perhaps the best and
most accessible place i northern bengal
any part of which can be reached by rail-
way it was at jubbulpur in this region
that  took part in my first indian hunt

  by good fortune in calcutta i found
mr mortimer an english friend who was
just starting on a tiger hunt through
him everything was made easy for me
after our passports were issued our outfit
made ready and our servants engaged we
boarded a train of the indian railway for
a great stretch the line parallels the ganges
traversing the depths of a miasmatic jungle
an impenetrable mesh of foliage defended
against human invasion by a riotous pro-
fusion of thorn vines and other creepers
one saw at a glance here why one needed
an elephant to lake one through the jungle

  on our arrival at jubbulpur where the
governments elephants are stabled i was
astonished to find that a number of women
were to go with us on our hunt in fact
what struck me first at the stables was the
sight of them strolling under their parasols
among the big beasts and the native at-
tendants to my eye now the shikar be-
gan to take on the aspect of a big picnic
evcrvlo  ys magiizinc

there were thc huge white tents the pic-
turesquely dressed and undressed natives
the soldiers the women in white dresses
ready to watch thc jungle tragedy from

the autiiok and his pet
leopard cud

a loy on their elephants hack the men
in white duck and pith helmets-almost
a fete it mtmcd almost everybody too
was a lord a ir or an honorable all related

to some one having a hand in the british
indian government and in amount and
quality the provisions brought along would
have done credit to a first-rate hotel

  c very thing was ready now the ele-
phants were driven up and commanded to
fall upon their knees men and women
climbed to the howdahs by ladders the
head shikaree gave the signal each elephant
heaved to his feet like a mountain in an
earthquake and off we started in a long
string toward the nerbudda river

  to me it looked as if the big cat would
not have much of a chance squatted on
the neck of each elephant sat its mahout
thc native driver a steel goad helped
him to guide the unwieldy beast and im
bound to say the mahout used it freely
these were shikar elephants we rode
trained for the hunt suposed to stand
when a tiger charges and not to flinch
when a rifle is fired from the howdah i
say supposed for few elephants live that
do not fear the tiger later you will see
what mine ditl-incidentally what he did
to me - when charged besides these
shikar brutes there were other elephants
used for beating up thc game on them
our native aides rode along unprotected
by a howdah and sitting on pads strapped
to thc elephants like saddles

  my howdah like all the others resembled
nothing so much as a big cradle it was
fitted with side racks for the guns gener-
ally two rifles are carried one a small-
bore high-velocity arm of say seven
millimeter caliber and a double-barreled
express running between  and  cali-
ber the double  is still a great favor-
ite among indian sportsman justly so
too for its bullet has a crushing impact cal-
culated to stop the charge of almost any
beast many indian hunters favor also a
twelve or an eight gauge double-barreled
shotgun using spherical balls a great
advantage of such guns is the ease with
which they may be sighted for they have
only a bead at ihe muzzle and may be
sighted bv glancing down the rib at
close quarters to be able to take a snap-
shot with a good chance of hitting the
mark is a big factor of safety again
sights for long distances are superfluous in
thc dense indian jungle for nearly always
the game i seen elose at hand say at
between thirty and sixty yards so the
great necessity is to be able to shoot
tracking the man-killer

quickly with some feeling of confidence
in your aim

  after a consultation our shikaree turned
into a part of the jungle where a kill had
been made the night before a kill is
the carcass of an animal slain by the tiger
or other beast ordinarily the killer hangs
about in the immediate neighborhood
waiting to make a second meal at nightfall
and in the meanwhile driving the jackals
vultures and hyenas from its prey as the
tiger is nocturnal it dozes during daylight
in some shady spot near the banquet place
furthermore it usually shuns dens and
very rarely hunts long in one particular
district this accounts for the fact that
the lion has practically become extermi-
nated in india while the tiger is appar-
ently as abundant as ever

  as we approached the kill the shikaree
called the sahibs attention t a lluck of
gaunt vultures perched in near-by trees
it was an auspicious sign besides some
of the elephants were twitching their ears
and trunks and treading uneasily having
evidently got wind of their foe so to
rout out the beast the beaters made a de-
tour of half a mile to get behind it while
we the hunters took our stand at the jun-
gles edge we were to wait there until the
tiger had been driven up to our guns

  as the elephant walks six miles an hour
it was not long before the din of the drums
and shouts of the beaters reverberated
through the jungle scaring monkeys pea-
cocks smaller birds and dozens f other
jungle dwellers before them sambur deer
barking deer swamp deer broke past us in
twos and threes and a diminutive mouse
deer not over twelve inches high plunged
between my elephants legs with a snort
of fear the huge beast turned to bolt and
had it not been for the mahouts steel goad
i might have been carried off into the thorn
jungle and perhaps brained against the
branches this nervousness on the part
of my mount did not give me much faith
in his alleged courage before a tigers charge

  the din made by the beaters grew louder
and we heard too the peculiar drumming
sound made by some of the elephants-
their sign that a dangerous animal was
near this brought us to our feet in the
howdahs lingers on triggers just then a
deer in wild fright flew past us and the
shikaree pointing to the left whi-iered
tiger sahib i saw him then before

me was tile mighty cat his jaw almost to
the ground as he sneaked half crouching
through the jungle ii stood for an instant
in suspense then as i was about to shoot
my elephant with a scream of rage charged
straight at the beast shaking me clear out
of the howdah into the bushes which luck-
ily broke my fall at the same time one
of my companions fired and wounded the
tiger altogether there was plenty of ex-
citement for a moment my rifle exploded
as i landed and that with the elephants
trumpeting the tigers howling roar and
the cries of the beaters made a nerve-
racking din but the tiger was undaunted
he met the charge of my enraged elephant
and with a lithe spring was on its head
sinking claws and teeth into the huge
beasts neck and trunk while the mahout
beat at him with his goad and the ele-
phant tried to crush its enemy on the
ground because of the position of the two
combatants it was impossible for my com-
panions to shoot

  resenting the blows of the mahouts goad
the big cat sank his claws into the fellows
thigh and tried to pull him down this
revived me to action and seizing my
rifle  fired the remaining barrel into the
tigers spine with a roar of pain he fell
backward to the ground and the maddened
elephant bleeding profusely from many
wounds tusked and trampled the beast to
a pulp bsfore it could be driven off

  the fascinating part of big-game hunting
is that the unexpected generally happens
i was not prepared however to have an
elephant that had bolted from a harmless
mouse leer charge a tiger but thats what
happened and you may be sure that i
kept this incident in mind during all my
future experiences

  our next tiger hunt was of a different
character it resembled more the hunting
in africa and was conducted from a look-
out platform r imuharii constructed in
a tree the village shikaree informed us
that a tiger was carrying off the village
cattle at night so to entice our quarry into
the vicinity of the nine hum half a dozen
domestic buffaloes were tied up as a bail
we were informed that the marauder was
an old offender and although a hundred
attempts had been made by the village
shikarees to destroy it ii had escaped all
their efforts in fact the villagers had
begun to believe the tiger possessed super-
it was a splsdll sht to sue the monstrous elephants take
to the water

natural powers hut mortimer and i de-
cided to try our luck on the village curse

  it is far from comfortable to sit in a
cramped position all night on an unsteady
platform in a tree that sways with the wind
waiting for a shot at a dark patch that
moves in the blackness while the fireflies
wave their lamps in your face and every
conceivable insect beats about your head
to say nothing of a lizard or two that crawls
into your shirt three hours of misery had
passed when i heard the bullock near me
begin tugging at his tether straining my
eyes for a glimpse of the expected tiger i
saw a black shape moving across the open-
ing a dull thud followed afterward there
was a bellow and for a moment sounds
of a struggle arose then all was still i
waited perhaps half an hour before i
heard the sloppy tearing sound that is
made by an animal eating un-bled meat
i could hardly see to shoot but i
leveled my rifle which had luminous
sights at the dark mass and fired a
roar of pain burst from the target telling
me i had reached my mark the echo
of the shot had hardly died away when
two loud reports on n-v right told me

too that something of importance was
happening with my companion

  descending the tree i made my way cau-
tiously to the black mass i had shot at cov-
ering it in case it should rise and charge
then my friend mortimer cried at the
top of his voice ive got him i have
too i answered and to make sure i fired
another shot at my fallen quarry it did
not move to make doubly sure however
i lighted a bunch of dry reeds and saw to
my astonishment that instead of a tiger
i had killed a huge leopard the unex-
pected again

  again while i was looking over my kill

i heard two additional reports from mor-
timers heavy rifle and then in rapid suc-
cession half a dozen shots from his auto-
matic pistol i knew there was trouble
and crying at the top of my voice ran
stumbling through the darkness toward him
loading as i advanced to my relief i saw
mortimer standing in an opening with the
huge form of a tiger at his feet

  he told me that just as i first tired he saw
his tiger he fired and the beast went
flown as it rose again he gave it the other
barrel and then feeling certain the animal
tilt shikari  haminc over the side of the howdaii discovekd
the tickrs iiall in the mud

was dead lie descended from his muchani
hut when he was within twenty yards it
again leaped up and charged he fired two
more shots in rapid succession thc beast
rolled over with a roar only to rise and
char- for a second time whipping out
his luger pistol he poured bullets into thc
beast as it came on until one well-directed
shot penetrated the tigers brain and it fell
at his feet

next morning when thc shikarees brought
the carcasses into camp to skin they found
nine bullets in the big cats body

an incident in this hunt illistratcs thc
peculiar mental processes of some asiatics
the government gives a reward varying
from thirty t fifty rupees to any native or
natives who kill a tiger so as soon as the
village shikaree saw mortimers tiger he
immediately recognized it as the cattle thief
and claimed thc reward from mortimer
saying that the sahib had destroyed his
tiger and deprived him of the government
reward mortimer who was rich decided
to pay rather than argue

then came another piece of brilliant
asiatic reasoning the reward was thirty
rupees for a tiger killed from a tree or an

 

 elephants back anil fifty for one killed on
 foot when mortimer handed over thirty
 rupees to the shikaree the native counted it
 with dignified gravity and tlun turning
 with a you-tried-to-cheat-me air said the
 sahib forgets i hat the reward for a tiger
 killed on fool is fifty rupees my friend
 roared with laughter and thinking the joke
 on himself was worth it he paid the extra
 twenty rupees what is more wc found at
 the end of our hunt that wc had to pay to
 all our natives a reward for cverv animal we
 killed

   my next tiger experience was with a man-
 eater an animal that preyed on human
 beings c lusively man-eaters are by no
 means infrequent and whenever one is on
 a raid it strikes terror into the hearts of
 every villager in the district  single tiger
 of this sort may prey on twenty different
 villages visiting one to-day another to-
 morrow to my mind there is nothing
 that so chills ones blood with horror as
 this sinister brute that passes silently as a
 clouds shadow from hut to hut looking for
 an entrance the native lies awake lool ing
 through the opening of the hut the crack-
 ling of a twig startles him lie striin- his eye-
e very bod ys m agazine

and trembles with apprehension he has
nothing but a knife with which to defend
himself all at once as if born out of the
silence silhouetted against the moons silver
flood there stands the apparition the man-
eater and after that the natives
crowd round the deserted hut and there is
mourning in the village a daily occur-
rence in india

  it was with exultation that i started off one
day with mortimer to a village where a man-
eater had been seen the day before i took
my nine-millimeter llaenel-mannlicher rifle
and a thirty-five remington auto-loader for
fast work at close quarters should the beast
charge when we reached the village we
were taken to a mticharn which mortimer
mounted fur it was already dark i re-
mained below as i thought i should like to
have it out with the tiger in the african
mode that is on the level of the ground
hour after hour passed without incident
it was getting toward morning and i was
dozing half asleep when mortimers double
express banged like thunder twice on the
platform over my head in a flash i was
on my feet an instant later i saw the
tiger not thirty yards away i fired hap-
hazard but did no evident damage and it
vanished in the jungle mortimer was con-
vinced he had wounded the beast so we
waited till daylight and searched for the
tigers trail it was eventually found by a
native who after following it for a few
yards picked up a large leaf of the teak
tree and cried  koon sahib koou  point-
ing to a drop oi blood this was a good
sign

  as we were afraid the beast might get
away we took after it on foot instead of
sending for elephants our shikarees how-
ever did not like the idea of hunting the
man-eater on foot and protested sullenly
so i told them to walk behind for i could
follow the trail easily as it passed down
the center of a dry ravine

  eventually we reached a point where the
ravine made an abrupt turn past a small
thicket of tamarisk we divided our forces
mortimer going one side and i the other
as i came to the end of the thicket a water
hole met my view and what i desired to
see more than anything else-there was the
tiger lying in the water with only his head
out taking careful aim i fired but though
my -hot hit it did not kill with a short
sharp roar the big cat sprang from the water

and rushed around the other side of the
thicket a second later i heard two shots
from mortimers express a roar and then
a cry for help running toward him at top
speed i saw a sight that made my blood
run cold mortimer was on the ground his
white clothing covered with blood while
standing over him its mouth dripping with
gore was the tiger the shikarees who had
our extra rifles and had gone by another
route to the pool came rushing up breaking
through the bush almost opposite the tiger
in a moment it charged them and they
opened fire but none of their shots stopped
the brute one of the shikarees dropped his
gun and ran the other stood firing as the
beast advanced when the magazine was
empty the native tried to reload it but too
late for the mighty bulk of the animal flew
through the air and bore the unlucky fellow
to earth for some reason the beast used
only its claws it fell over the body of the
man and then began wiping its face with
its paw like a house cat

  i got down on the ground and crawled
nearer to get a better shot a cobra in the
grass raised his head in front of me thrust
out his tongue and vanished at last i
was within easy range i got on my knee
and lired and at the shot the tiger sank in
a limp heap on its victim dead when i
reached mortimer he was sitting up wiping
the blood from his clothes with grass he
told his story youd no sooner lired than
the tiger came bounding round the thicket

i couldnt take aim  just lired hoping for a
lucky shot the tiger sprang at me-down
i went the blow blackened my brain for
a while when i got my senses i felt the
huge body of the animal across me and hot
blood flowing over my neck and head
whether it was my blood or not i did not
know i wondered how long i had to live
and just waited to feel his teeth in my flesh
to my surprise he got up and ran i am
pretty sore but still alive shake hands

  in the meantime the shikaree who had run
was attending his companion when we
reached him the poor fellow was hardly
breathing he was carried to the village
where he died in about six hours his skull
having been fractured by a blow from the
beasts heavy paw

  on examining the liger i found that the
tirst shot  tired which had an expansive
bullet had shattered the bottom jaw after
passing through the bridge of the nose for

that reason tin brute was unable to use its
teeth which no lull saved mortimers
life

  again the unexpected

  while on another tiger hunt  had the
good fortune u witness one of the grandest
combats a man could hope to see it was
a combat that would have made the em-
perors of rome applaud-one that brought
to me the realization of what the heroic
animal life of the jungle really is

  i was perched on a mucharu built in a
solid old tree on the jungles edge waiting
lor a tiger that had a kill not more than
fifty yards away the scraggy trees of the
swamp were silhouetted against a sun that
blazed in the west like a ball of incandescent
copper the day insects ceased their hum
and the fairy life of the night whose dawn
is the setting day came buzzing in myriads
from their hiding places like the ballet of
an elfin opera a stately crane stepped
daintily through the reeds and fat-breasted
little birds of brilliant plumage settled on
twigs kissed milled their feathers and put
their tiny heads beneath their wings i
breathed deep the swamp air sweet to
my nostrils almost intoxicated me

   then all at once  heard heavy feet forcing
their way through the tangle the giant
grass ahead of me swayed and bent down
and a moment later a splendid buffalo cow
breasted her way out of the entanglement
and stood in the open suspiciously she
sniffed the air and then throwing her face
toward heaven she bellowed like thunder
i seemed to shake in the tree a moment
later an answer came as if from miles away
and the cow replied she shook her mighty
horns and then drove them into the earth
she walked up to the tigers kill and sniffed
it again the thunder of her throat burst
the silence

  suddenly she showed uneasiness she
turned and looked with lowered head past
my tree my eyes followed hers my
tiger was there just on the jungles edge
within its protecting grass skulking silently
along with his white belly sweeping the
ground he saw the buffalo he stopped
motionless save for his twitching writhing
tail the cow scattered the loose earth with
a -troke of her hoof shoot i could not i
would not i wanted to see the jungle
drama slowly the tiger crept into the
open never straightening his elastic body
his eyes fastened on the cow his jaw hung

half open and dripping round and round
in a circle he went trying to get behind the
buffalo but she was too quick for him he
paused and drew himself into a ball his tail
lashing the ground

  then like a rocket his body shot through
the air as with a thunderous bellow the
buffalo charged her mighty horns leveled
they met in the air the shock hurled
both to earth in a flash they were up
and with another roar another bellow they
charged the tiger missed but his leap
landed him behind the buffalo and turning
swiftly he sprang upon her back but be-
fore his teeth sank into her flesh she threw
herself over and rolled the tiger to pro-
tect himself loosened his grip again he
seized her as she sprang to her feet but
the cow shook him off and with a roar
charged bowling him over and forcing
liim against the tamarisk blood was flow-
ing from her bellowing mouth streaming
too from the claw wounds in her back as
she retreated to get charging distance to
finish him

  but he was still fit to fight and again he
sprang he landed between her mighty
horns his body hanging over her face his
teeth sank into her flesh blood filled his
mouth and ran down the cows sides she
roared in pain and lowering her head
charged at a stout tree with her burden
a feeble roar told i he tigers distress in a
limp heap he fell to the ground the
buffalo drew back and measured her mark
a short rush forward a twist of the horn
and she had gored him mortally he tried
to crawl away a roar of victory shook
the swamp grass as the cow charged again
she lifted the huge beast on her horn and
dashed him to death

  night crept on and the cow disappeared
in the darkness that fell like a curtain over
the last act of the jungle tragedy i wanted
to say something to the splendid animal in
her victory to stroke her scarred skin and
never till then did  know the narrow limits
of human speech

  the leopard which shares with the tiger
the honor of being one of indias scourges
-both in india and elsewhere the cattles
greatest scourge-is another nerve strainer
for the hunter australia is the only conti-
nent without some variety of this animal
but though a wicked beast it affords
little sport and to gel a shot one has to
depend on luck as much as anything this

is because like the tiger the leopard has
no fixed abode no den

  it has more cunning and courage than
any other animal  have ever encountered
the tiger seldom enters a dwelling or house
of any sort that is reasonably barred against
him the leopard however will try to
force its way into any house or shed where
it can detect the slightest odor of prey and
failing to reach it will walk up and down
all night in the vicinity

  leopards are exceedingly fond of dogs
and will go to almost any extremity to get
one as the following incident shows one
night mortimer was in my tent writing
letters neither of us thinking an animal
would come near the tent which was well
lighted with a powerful lamp at our feet
was a line russian wolf-hound which had
accompanied mortimer all over africa and
india as the animal was prized greatly
it always occupied its masters tent and
on this occasion was tied to his cot pres-
ently  thought i saw something pass the
door and then decided it must have
leen my imagination a little later i
looked up again and saw the two green
phosphorescent eyes of a leopard  pre-
tended i did not see it and slowly sneaked
my hand round fur my pistol but the ani-
mal disappeared i jumped up and went
outside looking everywhere  could see
no sign of the leopard and was about to
give up the search when a howl of pain
sounded from mortimers tent and the
next instant the leopard bounded out hold-
ing the dug in its mouth as a cat holds a
mouse iike a flash  tired missed the first
shot and got in the second and third that
killed it but the dog was dead its back
crushed by the powerful jaws

  it is natural when writing of leopards
to associate with them the cheetah-an
animal whose natural hunting instinct lias
been cultivated in india for sporting pur-
poses since dark antiquity although the
animal is plentiful in africa it is there only
in a wild stale and while i have seen
cheetahs used as pets by french officers in
africa and have had one myself i have
never seen them trained to hunt as they
are in india

  most native princes have their cheetahs
which they use in the smrt of deer coursing
many of them reserve jungles where no one
is allowed to shoot even though a man-
eater may hav e made it his lair

  the coursing usually takes place during
the cold months when there is little grass
to hide the game and generally the quarry
is the magnificent and fleet-footed black
deer before the cheetah is taken to the
hunting grounds he is starved for twenty-
four hours to make him keen for he knows
from long experience that if he brings down
his prey his reward will be its blood

  the cheetahs that i saw in action were
the personal property of the rajah of pun-
jab whose keepers conducted the hunt for
the benefit and edification of his excel-
lencys guests

  we set out for the hunting ground with
drays drawn by two oxen each dray hold-
ing one cheetah and its keeper some were
in cages others just chained to the dray
and in every case hoods were kept over
their heads so that they would not grow
excited at the approach of game as it
chanced the first course was with a fine
herd of between twenty and thirty black
deer once they were sighted the drays
went on to get as near as possible before the
game was alarmed when they were within
three hundred yards the game bolted in
an instant the keeper slipped the hood ot
the first cheetahs head it sprang to the
ground hesitated a second as if picking out
its prey and then like a rocket the yellow
form shot over the gray-green earth after a
fine buck the fleetest animal it is said
on four legs

  spurring our horses we dashed after
them in a wild ride to be in at the kill it
was a picturesque scene-the galloping
native gentlemen in their striking costumes
on their splendidly equipped chargers
galloping after the flying buck and his pur-
suer thrice the deer doubled on its track
each time losing ground to the cheetah
it was a splendid but cruel sight to see
these two beautiful creatures racing for
their lives the buck to save its own the
cheetah to maintain his for it was the life
instinct of hunger that drove him on at last
in a cloud of dust the tragedy took place
the cheetah leaped at the throat of his prey
and down came the buck in a heap

  the cheetah held the poor beasts throat
in a grip of iron until the keepers cut it and
gave the hunter his reward

  his appetite satisfied the cheetah becomes
useless-he will not hunt unless hungry so
the hood is slipped over his head and he is
taken back to his cage cheetahs have a

peculiar almost sentimental sense for when
they fail to bring down their quarry they
will run away and hide and when caught
will sulk for considerable periods as though
ashamed of their failure

  like the tiger hunt a buffalo hunt in
india is a sort of picnic to an old african
hand although dangerous enough and often
fatal for the indian buffalo is no weakling

  the asiatic bultalo like the african
species makes its home in swampy country
it is generally found near large bodies of
water where it can make the wallow so
necessary to its existence our party
hunted the soune river a tributary of the
ganges there were twenty-six elephants
in the shikar host each howdah carrying
its white hunters some novices some old
hands our first herd we found in a heavy
jungle a part of the lowland where grass
grew at least fifteen feet in height it was
a good hiding place for any wild beast and
i may add a dangerous place to hunt in
twice i caught a fleeting glimpse of tiger
so brief a view in that tangle that i had no
chance to shoot in fact the jungle was
so thick that without elephants it would
have been impossible to hunt a man on
foot could see only the cane-like grass
around him and a little patch of sky above
against a dangerous wild animal in such
surroundings he would not have the ghost
of a chance

   failing to find the herd on thc east bank
we crossed the river it was a splendid sight
to see the monstrous elephants take to the
water they walked right down the bank
till they were almost submerged the shi-
karees and mahouts standing upon the small
patch of elephant hide that showed above
the water in this fashion the huge beasts
walked in single file straight as an arrow
flight to the bank opposite

   while crossing the river an amusing inci-
dent occurred in our party was an ex-
patriated american who disguised his na-
tionality under the mask of an english
accent it was only on rare occasions that
a slip gave him away among our ele-
phants was one that had only recently been
broken and following the elephant habit
it wanted to play when it got into the water
so at a moment when the english-aping
american was upholding the wonderful in-
telligence of the elephant to the two ladies
with him the green elephant raised it- trunk
and squirted a broadside of muddy water

straight into the howdah it came with the
force of a fire hydrant and deluged the
occupants

  gol darn yer soul  rose above the roar
of laughter in a strong new england twang

  when we had regained our composure a
young american in another howdah cried
say old sport the elephant washed out
your accent

  we had no sooner touched the opposite
bank than the mighty spreading horns of
a buffalo showed above the grass unfor-
tunately however it bolted before we could
get a shot the elephants were now divided
each half to act as beaters for thc other

  thus arranged wc had gone not more
than a quarter of a mile into the grass
when a rush and a grunt warned us to pre-
pare for action he elephants were halted
and a moment later a rhinoceros broke
cover-the unexpected again two of us
fired and thc beast fell without a struggle

  we thought that the day was to pass with-
out any further incident in the distance
we could see the white helmets of the other
party coming toward us above the grass
poor sport i said to mortimer

  in answer came the thundering crack of a
 express by this time we were getting
out of the long grass into shorter growth
the mahouts halted our elephants and we
waited we could see the grass waving and
hear the crashing of some huge body as it
rushed through suddenly a huge buffalo
bull magnificent to behold broke out of the
undergrowth blood and froth were stream-
ing from its nostrils and its eyes were glar-
ing without hesitation the mighty beast
with its formidable eight-foot sweep of horn
thrust forward rushed at the line of ele-
phants with a thunderous bellow i fired
but my elephant anticipating a light and
crouching to resist the foe threw my aim
off then the two huge beasts met with a
terrific shock i was jerked off my feet
and it was all i could do to hold myself in
the howdah as the elephant swayed mor-
timer now came to the rescue by putting a
couple of express bullets behind the shoul-
der of til infuriated bull even then it did
not fall but staggered back to make another
thrust at the elephant blood was gushing
from its mouth and the glaze was over its
glaring eyes but still it made the rush it
was the last however the huge brute
fell with a roar as it hit the bleeding side
of my mount

ter if lie loved her longed for her wove his
ardent dreams about her when he found
she loved another he gave her up with un-
questioning self-sacrifice that is his way
then he went to china to forget

  the manuscript he left behind  published
-disguised of course i know he never
really meant that  should but it seemed
to me too good to keep besides i never
dreamed he would come home in time to see
it but editors sometimes take a long
while getting round to printing things and
before it had reached type prentice was
back in america and had laid another and
far happier--manuscript on my desk li

almost fights over the question of printing
these inti	t ed records it is

enough to slate that  have finally won his
reluctant permission to make the second one

even two hundred and twenty-five pounds

expression of a romantic temjjerament

  the continuation of his iseless mi

fish and the ideal



  the suburbs have always been a vice with
me so many people live there whom one
never knows in the summer the suburbs

go to funny hotels along the coast lit-
l-oking hotels with no trees aliout and ulu 
you drive by you see them pluying tenns h
impossible courts without any back-stops
and the suburban girls luok at you in such
a delicious devouring way  have always
wanted to know the suburbs better per-
haps to spend a summer among them at one
of their hotels returning this season from
china  decided to gratify this perverted
passion besides for sundry reasons 
didnt care to meet anybody  know

  as the only spots on the maine coast with
which  was familiar were york harbor and
bar harbor  got a map in boston and did
a little ciphering i took the distance
between these two points divided it by
thirteen added that result to the distance
between boston and york and told the
conductor to tear out of my mileage book
coupons equivalent to the new total

  he put me off the train much to my
satisfaction in the heart of suburbia oris
with devouring glances were at the station
their lingerie waists disclosing the colored
ribbons in their underclothes  had al-
ways wanted to meet such irls i selected
the hotel nearest the water and told the
proprietor i desired two rooms he looked
at me in amazement why the second
he said

  i too expressed surprise why to
dump the sand in out of my shoes at night
of course i said

  i spoke in a clear strong voice sub-
urbia fancy-working in the lobby looked
up with mingled curiosity and alarm a
buzz followed me about the hotel when i
entered the dining-room one hundred and
three forks were suspended in air loaded
with sundry morsels of tish or vegetables
two hundred and six eves were fixed utnn
me there is mure than one way to attain
celebrity

  the hotel which fortune had selected for
me is on a rocky headland jutting into -

on the rocks amid the swaying seaweed at d
the buttering swinging rollers and d

  ladies of super-matronly figure and high-
pitched voice reposed upon rod cushions
in niches of the  iilt some were reading
novels some were knitting white shawls
some were doing hat kind of embroidery
when you clutch t hoop madly is it center-
pieces but mostly they were writing let-
ters on lap portfolios i am sitting right
beside the sea as  write this-that i
know is the way they all began now and
then one ol these females would lift her eyes

adore nature or else she would rise and
move to a more shaded rock with the grace-
ful motion of a terrified elephant on a tight-
rope

 there were young women too-the
suburban man-eaters a few had secured
victims and dragged them off to a lair
above the waves them i did not dis-
turb at their repasts others less for-
tunate had sought a substitute in a box
of molasses kisses and a volume of george
harr mccutchcon

  but i came upon odd game too round-
ing a huge bowlder i nearly tripped over
a small wizened bespectacled old gentle-
man with dandruff on his collar reading a
strange-looking book the characters were
hebrew lie saw my glance im reading
a little isaiah he said with a friendly
smile i like it in this setting

  who hath measured the waters in the
hollow of hi hand and meted out heaven
with the span-t i quoted looking more
intently at the funny little old gentleman

  do you read hebrew he asked hope-
fully

 i shook my head only german
french spanish italian romance french
anglo-saxon and a little latin i answered
humbly they leave hebrew to the di-
vinity school now

    not necessarily there any longersighed
the little old gentleman there is no call
in the library for hebrew any more

  still- said i to speak with that ele-
gance which the subject demands isaiah is
some pumpkins in the knglish

  the old gentleman smiled and made a
place for me beside him let us talk of
many things he said


   sliall we begin with cabbages or kings

 asked

     we will begin with i hat artist over there
he answered pointing down the rucks 
think she paints very well but i fear her
pictures do not sell i like her because she
paints the colors in sea fog-

  so we talked of her and sea fog and jap-
anese art and the venetian autobiographies
of the eighteenth century and the origins of
italian impromptu comedy-of many things
indeed while the lady artist in a long blue
apron worked on her canvas down by the
swashing tide her back toward us

  i loved the little old gentleman i
wanted to ask him what he was doing here in
summer suburbia but suddenly one of the
large ladies under a silly sun hat lumbered
round our rock laden with pillows fancy
work and e phillips oppenheim john
she said help me up to the house

   john rose spryly and bent his five feet one
to the task like a small jack under the axle
of a seven-passenger touring-car so the
suburbs can harbor an old grammarian
poor man i suppose he was thinking ab-
sently of some hebrew prophecy when she
proposed to him and assented before he
realized

  when he left me i clambered down behind
the lady artist she was not paul lii ugh-
erty nor was she trying to be without
seeing her face i could sec her picture she
was not after the smashing shoulder of a
wave nor the powerful suck of the recoil she
was painting one of those indescribably ex-
quisite pools left in the rocks by i he tide a
pool filled with crystal water red starfish
white shells a floating weed or two and
moss of a thousand shades of red and olive
and green she was working in oils 
thought water-colors the only medium for
the subject she felt my presence after a
moment and turned rather impatiently
around  stood just above her my face of
course wreathed in its habitual grin my
i itiiudinally ample form blocking the wcs-
ern sky

   water-colors said i water-colors

not thi new-fangled opaque kind but g

old translucent water-colors

  she was a slight woman maybe my agi-
which is none of your business maybe a
bit younger she wasnt pretty but she

 wa i liin  moreover her face vi one of
 i hose lively countrnances which interest you
 at once

   ilon i agree with you she said rather
 tartly

 i waved my hand few do said i

 it doesnt trouble me at all neverthe-
 less the essence of your subject is a kind of
 iright magic clarity of color seen through
 the crystal of water oils dont lit it 
 want the hint of thc white paper

  are you an artist she inquired

  no said i im a factory owner and
 an amateur philologist hats why i criti-
 cise art

 she smiled her smile was very pleasant
 however i believe you are right she
 said but nobody will buy water-colors

  w ill anybody buy oilsaskedicruelly

 her face betrayed an instant pain but as
 quickly it was conquered sometimes
 she returned brightly

  began to like her immensely do me
 this pool in water-colors and ill buy it at
 your price said i

 she colored and began to gather up her
 stool and brushes i i couldnt do that
 she said in embarrassment

 you can and you will i replied jump-
 ing down the rock to help her business
 is business you know

 hut you dont know my work she ob-
 jected feebly

  had the fresh cam as in my hand
 this is enough said  as a matter of
 fact it was so far as oils were concerned
 it was charming

 well she filially agreed i suppose
 business is business where shall  de-
 liver it 

 right at the hotel  answered im
 there too

 she smiled but im not im afraid
 i shouldnt cure for the hotel i live a mile
 tip at codfish cove

 not care for life at the hotel i cried

 why wc have school teachers for cham-

 ermaids and everybody in the place just

 e- nature and the merry widow

  exactly said -he

 i iiked up her stool and easel then
 it codfish cove i said and started on

 she regarded me in an amused way  do
 you actually fancy you arc going to carry
 my things home for me she asked

  no said i im certain of it if you
 dont live at the hotel you cant deliver the

picture and if i dont know where you live
i cant come after il and besides im a fat
foolish preposterous person that nobody
minds at all after a while you wont
notice me

  she accepted my escort as inevitable and
we moved along a little path through the
bay bushes just above the rocks where we
could liok up the coast at the white fringe
of the surf to a second distant group of
summer hotels and cottages presently the
path wound over a ridge and came down to
the shore of a rocky cove where a little tide
inlet made up into the meadows scaly
dories rode at their moorings on the clear
deep water of this cove between the rocks
and the water on a strip of shingle was
a group of gray weathered fishermens
houses with nets spread out to dry in the
sun and piles of lobster pots i noticed
studio lights in two or three of the fish
houses back at the edge of the meadow
stood a comfortable old white farmhouse
she pointed to it

  that is where we artists of codfish cove
live said she we work in the fish
houses come we will go to my studio

  we entered the low door of the mouse-
gray shed-or at least she did  paused on
the threshold for from within came that
coast of maine fish odor with overpowering
might

  what she cried gayly afraid of
my nice wholesome smell come right in
the odors fine

  thus challenged i advanced the in-
side of the shed was the most delightfully
incongruous place  had ever entered the
light came from a great window in thc north-
ern end looking out on the sweep of the
coast and then to open sea against one
wall stood an old mary e wilkins sofa
with rolled ends against the other a row of
lobster pots thc easel with a picture on
it was placed near the window and the
brushes stood upon an inverted fish bucket
immediately above the sofa and the lobster
pots the walls were hung with charming
marines brightly framed in gold aboye
them jutted the low rafters and on cross
-mips making a ceiling tor the room were
piles of nets the leads hanging down broken
oars a dory fish-lines an anchor and a
myriad other objects dedicated to the pur-
suit of the cod my hostess now stood
against the light from the north window
the blue sea growing pink on the edges
codfish ind the ideal

from the westering sun
made an aura in her
hair she was smiling a
little wistfully a little
triumphantly

  dont you think it is
nice she said

  i held my nose with
one hand now i can
pronounce it unqualifi-
edly delightful  an-
swered codfish and the

  you are laughing
she said   do not per-
mit people to laugh at my
studio

  madam i cried i
always laugh at every-
thin  cannot help it
my face works quite in-
dependently of my feel-
ings i have besides rite
role of fat man to keep
up actually  envy you
everything but the odor
and  should be willing lo
have even that and fifty
pounds more weight as
well if  could write out
my ideals my inner vis-
ions one half so success-
fully as you

   she looked at megravely
have you never tried
she said

  dusk was creeping into
the studio perhaps it
was that perhaps it was
the odor going to my head
perhaps it was the aura in
her hair and the friend-
liness i i her voice per-
haps it wa because i
had scarcely spoken to a
woman of my own race
for a year you get to
miss the creature so
then aguiit perhaps it
was because  am natur-

technique was faulty

  she seemed l ponder jr a moment the
propriety of reply i inalh she said per-
haps you fvjkrcted too much

    i expected said i  i hat romantic hap-
iinc-- whit h you dream about when you are
young and the world is dull

   i hat is not always idealism she an-
swered gravely  sometimes that is -iii-
i-lmess i must close the studio now i
shall begin your picture in the morning
may i come to watch you work i
asked glad enough now to crawl thus easily
out of the subject

  if you can escape the laities who just
love nature she smiled

  nature has aided me to do that i an-
swered mournfully

  not when they are really hungry she
ventured and with this she fled up the
path to the farm  watched her go and
then strolled slowly home pondering her
words about idealism and selfishness and
i came here to study suburbia   

   ler name is hattie  lattie walker was
ever a name more preposterously prosy
fancy its possessor following the gleam
searching always for the ideal expression of
a beauty fell in sea or sky r water pool and
sacrificing to the search yes i am sure
she has sacrificed much she is immensely
clever and if she desired merely to live well
by her brush she could hut she boils the
pot with the best that is in her my water-
color of the pool is a gem it stands on my
bureau completely obliterating the glass
and causing me to rut myself when i shave
how casually she took my check yet i
detected that her lingers trembled the
old grammarian says it is the first picture
she has sold i his summer hes an odd
duel snooping round with the fishermen
when he isnt reading hebrew and picking
up gossip about the run of lobsters and the
aliiirs of the artists at the cove

  ive bought him one of her pictures by
the way or ralher i took him to buy it for
himself one of the blessings of an honest
poverty is thcpride it fosters miss walker
would of course have yild me more oi her
picture but if she had she would there-
after have regarded me deferentially as a
patron but with a kind of smoldering
hostility i know these new englanders
she would sell me her choicest work but she
would cease to give me her choicest friend-

ship and that friendship she has given me
with less and less reservation as the days
have passed and i have burbled beside her
as she worked so  sent the old gram-
marian

  when i went to get him he was sitting on
the veranda out of the piping gale telling
a group of contemporary females about
kansas cyclones

  you know out there in the schools he
was saying they have cyclone drills in-
stead of fire drills each teacher has a long
rope with a noose at the end to put around
her waist and a lot of little nooses down the
length of it for the children at the signal
she adjusts her noose throws out the rope
each child springs into a little noose and the
teacher leads the way to the cyclone cellar
it is a very interesting sight the principle
is the same as that of the alpine climbers
r ipe

  well isnt that interesting chorused
the ladies

  the old grammarian just then spied me
mr iiper he added would make an
excellent teacher in kansas

  the ladies tittered respectfully my two
rooms have inspired a respect never before
accorded to me  drew the old gram-
marian aside

  you old reprobate said i youve
never been in kansas but now you are
going to buy a picture from miss walker

  i had to give him a detailed statement of
my income to explain to him exactly why
 couldnt make the purchase in person and
to paint the delights of ownership in glowing
colors before i could induce him to buy the
picture ior himself he was quite ready to
buy it forme but hi- pride balked at accept-
ing a gift  are the people i want to
help invariably the ones who wont let me
but finally i won him over

  i dont own a nally good picture- he
said wistfully  have some nice repro-
diuims though and two plates from
audubons birds which my wife doesnt
care for i have hung them in my little
study

  we found miss walker in her studio
 lady of the cod i said i have brought
you an admirer he is enormously wealthy
stick him good

  she looked up with her bright smile tak-
ing in the ld grammarian with her glance
his faded unpressed clothes his clerical
collar his shoulders stooped with poring
anp i bussl till iird for  kino rwll- iii iial - ml

over books the true librarians stoop-his
bespectacled eyes ludicrously belied my
words miss walker looked back at me
with a kind of frightened questioning i
nodded reassuringly however and we got
out the canvases

  the old grammarian was soon lost in the
delights of contemplation he especially
loved the more delicate aspects of the sea
which miss walker attempts t capture the
overtones of that mighty organ as it were
warmed by his enthusiasm h adjusted
lights she told of the composition her color
rose and i it back on the mary 
wilkins sofa and loved them both prbiect-
ingly when finally the old grammarian
pulled a fat roll of my bill- out of his pocket
assumed ownership of his picture with
triumphant artistry and counted out soo
-the price he insisted on paying though
she would have taken   think i was
never more happy in my life

  no  was happier still a few moment-
later tlu old grammarian stood with
his picture hugged under hi- arm miss
walker stood between us rosy with pleas-
ure  mr piper must bring you again -in-

said not to buy but just to look it my
work if you really like it liut it is mr
piper who should have been the artist
when you think hes talking nonsense you
suddenly discover that his eye is on some
beautiful effect and lie catches the spirit of
it in a sentence sometimes i come home
and paint his sentences

  what could i say nothing  -ii it
i stood there like a fat grinning booby with
little prickles of pleasure going up my spine
and miss walker smiled at me brightly with
i hat glance of level friendship whi li makes
some women so unspeakably dear then
the old grammarian became the fatherly
third person he beamed on us both
through his spectacles

  mr piper has little feelers out in all
directions he said grabbing softly at
the nice things in the world and a lot of
em are connected with his heart as well 
his head

  no i remonstrated im  jellyfish
not an octopus liut the dear ml -  n
smiled the more at my embarrassd plea-

  whenever there is a new arrival at the
hotel  ik r i he ladies first asking the pro-
prietor where she comes from and the next
day asking her new rochelle you
dont say so-  wonder if you know my
cousin there mrs roberts james rob-
erts you do yes yes thats her-short
and rather stout and goes to thc episcopal
church of course well well the world h
a small place after all this mighty truth
about the world has been borne in upon me
too

   the lady of the cod and i have a favorite
apple tree in a pasture a quarter of a mile
back front the coast it i- low and aged
and from its branches wc look across the
pasture to the white ribbon of road and
beyond that the rocky fields of bay bushes
and then the blue plain of the sea

  we sit in this tree toward sunset time
because just at that time the white sails out
toward the horizon turn pink and an old
man comes into view along the curve of the
road driving two cows

  yesterday we were looking out from our
eden perch and i was discoursing upon the
needs of a civic theatre to rescue such
people as my factory hands and their chil-
dren from the blighting mediocrity of mov-
ing picture shows or the crass vulgarity of
vaudeville and burlesque while the lady
listened with frowning brows contributing
now and then suggestions about pageants
which tired both of us with enthusiasm

  you shall come down with me next win-
ter  cried and well make a start on
working this thing out ive never done a
hundredth part for those people that i
should

  no i dont believe you have said

   was about to answer when i suddenly
-aw a runabout come around the bend of
the road it was two hundred feet away or
more but i could not mistake the figures
i latless in his inevitable white tlannels
marlborough saltonstall was at the wheel
and beside him sat alicia the silvery peal
of her laugh drifted over the pasture to me
like an echo from the past an instant and

they were gone  cannot describe the
emotions w ithin me -the wakened memories
of alicias kiss of her flower-like beauty of
the extravagant romantic longings of my
youthful heart of my dreadful torture when
her love turned cold to me and warm to
marlborough saltonstall and thc curious
sensation loo of having her cut across my
eager converse with this other lady she
who had never really followed with me a
serious train of thought in her life i was
stunned into silence

  what is the matter said a voice at
my side

  i turned to the speaker as if awaking
sin- had neve r pitied me for my preposterous
exterior-she had never seemed to recog-
nize the need of pity she had met me on
the ground of common interests and made
me her friend without a hint of sex she
who worshiped beauty had made a friend
of so unlovely an object as myself because
i too am a worshiper in my poor jocund
way again i thought of alicias flower
face and remembered my hungry longings
for her love but following stilling such
thoughts was the real image of this eager
grave clear-eyed face beside me and the
memory oi all the exquisite hours of the past
month when instead of the old emotional
unrest there has come to me the peace and
pleasure of perfect comprehension and the
mutual pursuit of beautiful sights and stim-
ulating ideas even her name suddenly
lost for me its preposterous prosiness

  the matter i answered the mat-
ter is hattie that the world is a small place
as the ladies say at the hotel

  she regarded me quietly gravely and
waited

    i think i told you i continued that
once i tried t write out my ideals in my
love for a girl hat was the girl

  she put her hand lightly on my arm

  my friend she said you have a roman-
lit heart you think every one as beautiful
as you want them t be as tine as your own
iancics you hunger for an enthusiasm and
sympathy as boundless as your own to
make you happy you wont find them
write out your ideals in real ink and paper

	r in the lives of your factory hands you
will be happier so and and nobler

  she withdrew her hand her touch had
been warm and friendly but it had been
something more to me it had kindled nit-
wit h a sudden desire to hold her shoulders
codfish and the ideal



between my hands look into her face and
read there what was really in her heart

  but i did not touch her something held
me back something besides the danger of
such a proceeding in an apple tree per-
haps it was the echo of alicias laugh still
drifting across the pasture i simply said
lady that sympathy and that enthusiasm
i think i shall find and  looked her
eagerly in the eyes

  she met my glance for t moment -a
hushed moment charged with  know not
what electric eloquence then in silence
we descended from the tree and in silence
followed the old man and the cows up the
white ribbon of the road   

  the lady is going to give her exhibition
of her summers work next saturday and
the old grammarian is cursing his poverty
sometimes now he sits with us while the
lady works reading aloud snatches from
the upanishads fancy his reading the
upanishads to mrs grammarian his
affection for us seems to draw us closer
together as in a protecting garment i be-
lieve the sweet old soul is living vicariously
in our younger friendship

  to-day he delivered a little talk on ro-
manticism apropos of some remark of mine
about literary tendencies the lady i
noticed quite stopped her work to listen

  romanticism he exclaimed  in lit
erature and life through the ages it has
been a search for an escape from the bond-
age of fact from the prison of the common-
place vet how often has it been a phari-
saical search a selfish search how often has
romantic literature been the sigh of a
dissatisfied soul yet paradoxically a self-
satisfied soul why does the prisoned soul
seek an escape is it because he feds a
divine unrest no but because he feels
that he personally is deserving of some-
thing better only when the romantic im-
pulse expresses itself in some word or deed
of sacrifice for others is ils unrest truly di-
vine the romantic shut up in his ivory
tower is detestable and his literature a
ham the romantic who forgets his own
little pains to make his dreams operative for
society is the one to admire i dont mean
lie must be a propagandist or a reformer but
his work must eliminate a sickly self and
speak to all men if he is a man in love
aucassin is not his ideal however beautiful
that ideal may seem to the heart of youth
he will not be sicklied oer with the amorous

passion but expanded ini i let -ynipa-
thv for his fellows

  even if he is jut a man trying to live in
the modern world he will not lie perpetually
discontented and moonstruck but perpetu-
ally trying to put his ideals before the eye- of
the less fortunate souls about him een if
hes only a poor librarian  he i- a novelist
he will not be writing idiotic tales about
spurious knights and ladicor mythical king
doms or imposrille deeds that is not to be
romantic but puerile he will with all the
grace and charm that is in him be writing
about the real people whom he knows and
showing how their lives however humble
are touched now and again by the gleam
we babble too much about romance and
realism huysmans said there are no such
things but only good literature and bad
but what is good in this world has always
about it some aura of ils infancy some
golden glint of the true romantic gleam
which reminds me my wife asked me to
bring her this novel

  he took a volume of current fiction from
under his coat grinned sheepishly and
moved away around the rocks

  its a poor sermon said i that doesnt
hit somebody in the congregation

  the lady said nothing and i continued
all my life i have been cherishing the de-
lusion that  was beautilully romantic but
all my life i have it seems been seeking
only a personal satisfaction you told me
the same thing i believe when r first met
once i loved i girl without any t hough i but
to he shut up with her in a tower for two
that love made me no more eager to help
my people no more sorry for any one less
fortunate than i no more desirous of mak-
ing my ideals of sweetness and light -if i
have any prevail in fact it made me
hate my fellow-men-one of them espe-
cially

  still she wa silent but she was regarding
me with a kind of frightened joy irangc
and puzzling

  i want now i again continued to
work out for my people in a humble way
that civic theatre idea of ours tlu-y as
much s we go to their cheap theatn  to
escape the grind of daily toil they are obi y-
ing a romantic impulse too i want to give
it no less a satisfaction than my own impulse
would demand that will be a way of mak-
ing my romantic dreams really  some use
wont it

  she mikd at mi you ari something
of a great goose she said eagerly of
course it will the very best way  know
you are not selfish  know you too well to
think that

    how do you know said  still puzzled
 i tell you all my life  have been pitying
myself because  was so fat telling myself
that i was cursed like job and deprived of
the romantic satisfactions which come t the
normal man and maid i w as self-centered
in my fat sellish egotistical way yet you
have taken me for a friend wnv have you
done it

  perhaps she smiled again because 
pity you how can i help pitying any one
who places such absurd emphasis on trivial
externals hen again perhaps  have
done it because  like you

   you have done it said i because you
and i blissfully love the same things and
dont fail to understand isnt that so

 rhcn if it is said she suddenly let
us stop this silly talk and think about that
mother-of-pearl light out on the horizon
let us think i answered about your
exhibition next saturday

    i think nf little else when  am alone
she answered with a look of pain it
means everything to me

  so our lecture on romance ended in prac-
tical figuring-where most romances end

       it was in the sudden sweetness of
pity- so much sweeter a thing than the
sensation of being pitied that full realiza-
tion came to me of my love for the lady of
the cod  knew that the ld grammarian
was right and i knew that  had found my
true romance at last how different from
my dreams of it not clothed in the ardor
 f a flaming passion with no lyric eloquence
and moonlit song had it come but with
instead a deep upheav al and expansion of
my nature almost as it love were a preacher

	sorting me and a kind friend loo leading
rhe on my first desire was to crown my

itilys exhibition v-ith success my second
i tell her of niy love to learn whether for
it too our friendship had become that
rofounder mystery of the heart

  there wasnt a soul at the hotel whom
i could enlist as a purchaser at the exhi-
bition except the old grammarian so i
had after all to make the hateful trip to the
harbor among the folks i know i found
jack hollis there better still i found his
sister i found my fathers old partner too

-a kindly if tight-listed lover of the arts
and stayed to tea in order to get his promise
to drive up to the exhibition-and to buy
there were three then finally  rounded
up billie barton who has become a grist
mill of best sellers since he used to write
pale pink imitations of pater in college
now he lives at expensive summer resorts
wears socks to match his ties and pretends
he admires his own books if he keeps it
up much longer hell end by really admiring
them i told him so

  well they all descended on the studio in
a body the lady was staggered for a
moment by the prospect of real purchasers
those segments of suburbia which were
present retired to a corner before the rustle
of miss holliss clothes to observe her
rather than the pictures and billie barton
actually forgot he was a best seller and
became once more the old appreciative
billie sensitive to the real thing bless him
he bought two pictures

  jack hollis wanted one of the golf links
but failing that he took a bit of sea which
showed a yawl-wrongly rigged he com-
plained but still recognizable his sister
met the lady with that beautiful friendli-
ness which she knows so well how to cast
like a spell over those whom she would set
up beside herself she is the truest patri-
cian i have ever known the lady happy
and rosy under this spell expanded shyly
fathers old partner watched her anil me 
could detect quite as much as the paint-
ings and grinned amicably but he had
been watching the pictures too as we
were about to depart he put his hand on the
gem of the lot-a strip ot shingle with a
phantom dory riding in the fog this
goes to our museum at home he said

  the ladv gave a happy little gasp miss
hollis smiled  cried thats the ticket
and youve got the best of them all

  young man -aid fathers partner i
am well aware of that i trust it will rc
produce in the catalogue- and  blessed
the lord for the kind friends he has given
me

  when my guests had departed under the
peering eyes of suburbia on the hotel ve-
randa i hastened back to the fish house

  on the way i met the old grammarian
coming along the path under the cliff with
his vicarious purchases hugged under his arm

   have left her almost happy he said

  why not quite i asked
codfish and the ideal



    jhat is for you to do replied the old
grammarian hut  was not angry with
him  sped with renewed vigor along the
trail

  again the light wa low and pink on ihe
sea and my lady of the cod stood alone
against the northern window an aura in her
hair

  she came forward with her hand out-
stretched how am i ever to thank you
fur this she said you have enabled
me to go tin you have been my fairy god-
father i fully expect you to drive off in 
pumpkin coach

  i held her hand in mine that lifelong
romantic hunger of my heart for an exalted
emotional excitement a thrilling happiness
which should burn steadily and bright was
satisfied anew but satisfied in a manner i
had never dreamed there may be a bloom
and a glory about romantic first love which
never comes again but there is a glory about
our later love our love based upon a mutual
recognition and understanding of each oth-
ers wider interests and desires which has
its graver and its sweeter charm there i
no fear of the future in it the years
stretch ahead in a vista of ever truer happi-
ness and comprehension dear lady of
the cod i said i am ugly and fat all
my life i have been a joke in the worlds eye
nobody but you has ever eenud entirely to

  lerhaps it was the fading light but i
thought there was a mist ill her ey - a -i
answered with a smile  you are lat

sditott note- what do you know about the railway problem do you realize that it
i liters into your east oj living no matter who you arc or what your occupation do you
realic that your food your clothing your furniture everything in your house everything that
you buy pays toll to the railroad at least once perhaps many times here is an article
that presents the whole railroad situation simply sanely without prejudice and corrects
many loose statements and fallacious impressions that so far have cumbered the issue
the railroad problem is your problem its final solution will be for you tv find here are
the facts on which vou can base your consideration and your conclusions

railway regulation is not a senti-
mental question

it ha been made to appear so

  it has been made sentimental by half a
generation of ill-advised accusation and a
defense on the part of the railroads that
seemed like perfume used to conceal an
odor

  the attack has been so senseless the
defense so sensitive that the ordinary man
hardly knows what to think he cannot
confidently advise hi representative in
government what to do his opinion is no
opinion it all it i an impression it is a
feeling in the bones

  before these articles were written two
hundred men of various stations in life
laborers clerks lawyers doctors mer-
chants government employees-were asked
casually their opinion about american rail-
way rates a composite of their answers
which were jotted down is about this

  stock-watering and manipulation have
been paid tor bv the public through high
late yi are gouged- you and i rates
should be lower government ownership

wouldnt work  guess i dont know much
about the question now that you ask things
in detail but it is robbery the people will
finally get on to it and stop it you can
tell it is robbery by the way these railroad
presidents and big financiers act-you can
sec they dont want the truth known we
need more legislation to lower rates cut
em in half

  the tragedy about this is that the voice
is the voice of the court of last resort

  who will settle the railroad question
not wall street not mr morgan or other
financiers not railway presidents not
investors not employees not politi-
cians not newspapers owned or corrupted
by the interests not shippers the
court of last resort is composed of the men
and women for whom this page was w ritten
edited set up printed and sent out across
the country

  the man who settles the problems of
railroad transportation will be the man who
finally pays for railroad transportation the
man who wants the service and pays for it

  this man in his home can see in the price


steel rails anil iron han-is



paid fur rocking-chair knives and forks
curtains rugs water faucet necktie closet
door poker and tongs overcoat rubber
boots ilour and saleratus the wall paper
the evening lump and the family bible a
percentage due to the cost of transporta-
tion let him look around the house for an
article that has not traveled on a railroad
most of these articles their parts or mate-
rials from which they are made have
traveled on railroads not only once but
many times the charge for transportation
each time has been added into the final
price it is there the consumers have
paid the promoter the financier the salary
of the railway president and officers the
employees the railway supply houses the
investors the bills rendered by the rail-
roads to the shipper

  collectively they have paid the whole
bill xot as a matter of sentiment but as a
matter of business not as a matter of specu-
lation but as a matter of fact it is the con-
sumers who must say the last word about
the railroads you can talk of the rights of
property till doomsday you can say that
the setting of the interests of mankind
above the rights of property is socialism or
anarchy or arson or christianity or altru-
ism or twaddle or you can talk of public
utilities and constitutional limitations and
reasonable rates and commissions until
chaos the truth is this

nil railroads and tui kamiv iioks

   it is a nation of consumers who say the
last word on service and rates not for any
other reason than t hat they can do it that
eliminates any sentimental or learned or
doctrinal notions at the beginning of the
subject that is the business of the situa-
tion they can do it theirs are the little
iron hands

   this is a good notion-it is the only air-
clearing notion to begin with in dealing
with the railroad question which is not
only a question of rates but-for goodness
sake let us remember a question of
service as well service something we
want done

  when a man finds il hard to pick out an
article in his home or office that did not
come to him over a railroad it is evident
that railroads have had some place in the
advance of civilization it almost seems
as it they are civilization and yet this

fact is something that every one i every
moment forgetting just as the virtue- t
the old family horse are forgotten the
service of the railroads i- forgot t- n m-t
thoroughly when the cost t the nation i
maintaining them is up for discussion just
as the faithful performance of the family
horse is most thoroughly forgotten when
it is remembered that he burdens us with
last months bill for hay and grain human
nature is just like that it pops up with
its sudden heat it becomes forgetful un-
thinking impatient and cosily to itself

  iii going at the regulation of railways from
any side it is blind vicious savage the
thing that corrects it is the cold business of
the thing which is not blind vicious nr
savage but knocks quietly on the door
while the fuss is going on knocks on the
door when the fuss is over and broken
crockery and furniture are strewn about
the house and knocks on the door when
agitators are out of breath and corporation
officials are through with their devices in
order to save trouble on both sides we
might as well open the door and let the
persistent thing in now to save expense
wasted emotion sentiment gone off the
handle and the knuckles of the cold-busi-
ness-of-lhe-thing that are knocking on the
door

  the story of the railroads in the inited
states is astonishing see the growth

  the main point about these figures is
their indication-only too slight-of the
inestimable and increasing service that
railroads perform if this service were
wiped out of existence or tinkered with so
that it was seriously impaired wc should be
willing to pay many times the price we pay
for it now to get it back ill ils present shape
 ld business sense says so and it is
not necessary to work up any sentimental
gratitude toward the railroads cold busi-
ness sense having said to the common citi-
zen the regulation of railways is in your
iittle iron hands now says the first
 iing you want is service

   it is true

  tlir heart of the raiway problem

  nevertheless the court of last resort
which may change even the constitution
a it wishes has at least one limitation of
i s authority it is constantly forgetting
it trying to override it neglecting it this
limitation is the characteristic of physical
matter physical matter will not move in-
telligently for the benefit of man by itself
mankind must move it we may have it
moved for us only in one of two ways wi
can have the government move it or induce
private parties to move it in exchange for
a reward we must have it moved iiy
should like il mated safely quickly -
-and at lltc least possible expense

  that last sentence - the heart of the
railroad problem

  now what has been the experience of
other nations with the railroad problem
comparison between railroad conditions

at home and abroad are the chief delight
of academic investigators the comparison
of impressions and reports and volumes and
statistics anil figures proves anything can
prove anything and has been made to
prove anything agitators for government
ownership and rates cut in halves-and
quarters-make the case look one way
railroads corporation men and finan-
ciers can make the whole thing change its
color skin stripes and spots men con-
jure with ligures showing the cost of a ton
mile of freight in one place and the other
these are empty figures it is like this
here is a sample the average per ton
mile rate is in

tlii- united states  cents germany  cents

but in this country the expensive traffic is
taken away from the railroads by the pri-
vate car lines and express companies which
charge exorbitant rates in germany there
is a parcels post and mail is carried free

yes but-

  yes but railroad materials are cheaper
in germany

  yes but in germany bulky commodities
yielding a cheap rate are carried by water

  yes but in the united states the gradi-
ents make investment and operation cost
higher

  yes but in the united states the per ton
mile figure is deceptive because it includes
the free carriage of goods for the companies
themselves

yes but in germany wages are lower

  yes but the average haul in germany is
s miles in the united states  the
shorter haul is more expensive

  there is no end to this when you have
gone far enough with it the best guess
seems to be that figuring everything in
the averagt freight charge in germany is
just about what it is in the united states

  the matter of freight rate is secondary
anyhow what about servicef what about
national development you comparisons
are more difficult

  the facts tv make them have never been
gathered having found out about what
each country pays you now lack any defi-
nite notion of what each country gets

  that is the sample yet perhaps it is
worth while to summarize the investigations
abroad
steel rails and iron hands

  england shockingly high capitalix-ation

collusion with owners of purchased prop-
erty rales far higher than ours dis-

successful and expensive periodical stupid

 situation a thousand times worse than
ours except os to safety

  belgium state ownership rates about
the same as here on freight extremely
low on passengers clean record as to
fraud and favoritism pay a fair return on
cost a situation better than ours and
probably best of all but of course our
own problem is different it is vastly
larger and vastly more complicated our
illness for government administration is
not so well developed

  russia largely government ownership
fraud general public deprived of bene-
fits still a part of a despotism

  italy government ownership failed
there were political frauds and rows sold
out to private interests a subsequent
history of poor service agitation discrim-
ination then four or live years ago the gov-
ernment under pressure of public opinion
bought back even though expecting to
suffer a deficit on operation history worse
than our own

  switzerland government ownership be-
gan in  after a decade of agitation
comparison as to service and rates diffi-
cult owing to light density of traffic and
mountainous territory kates much higher
than ours

  austria part government ownership
paternalistic management i   passenger
rates made to encourage people to travel
go to school live in the suburbs etc own-
ership was sold out to private management
in s and bought back in part in s and
since zone system of passenger rates
comparison of freight rates with our own is
difficult

  thai is enough the bald truth of the
matter is this as to service rates and
development of our resources by the rail-
roads and excluding the important matter of
safety to life and limb we in the united
states are no less fortunate than the aver-
age of other countries

  let us say all the good things first i here
are more of these satisfying facts not to be
denied

  die lirst i that the percentage of the
cost of living including savings hkh the
average consumer can charge up t- tr-ns-
portation is surprisingly low it averages
about seven per cent ol the total it is
true that each family has been paying niut h
more in these days than ten year ago it
transportation but as we have seen already
the population composed of many fam-
ilies is receiving a much larger service i he
average person as a member of the average
family pays a larger freight bill every year
because as a fact he is telling more freight
the consumption of commodities per per-
son is larger and one way of knowing this
is that the railroads carry more freight per
capita-an interesting consideration apart
from the railroad problem because it helps
to explain the high cost of liv ing

increase in rates iiasni ulch to x
with the cost of living

  then ii follows if one cares to figure
carefully that before the cost of living is
raised one hundredth from a direct effect
of freight rates these rates must be ad-
vanced over ten er cent

  considering the service rendered to the
nation the change in average rates per ton
mile is not very shocking in spite of the
general impression to the contrary espe-
cially is this true when compared with the
upward course of prices of everything else
and the rapid increase of cost of liv ing and
the decreasing value of a dollar these are
the rate per ton mile statistics

there may be watered -tuk in american
railroads i hat i then- may lie capitali-
zation which does nut represent an invest-
ment of money  is hard l think of an
easier thin to make people believe than
that railroads are all water but this is
not a sentimental question cold business
sense will knock on the door until every-
body i ready to admit that though the
history is thoroughly bad there is some
bright light as to the present capitalization
of our railroads

not so ml  watl-k in railroads now

  to begin with the total capitalization
carried by our operating roads averages
s a mile now though many other
countries show better construction which
makes the cost per mile higher we show
better equipment then of course density

	f traffic has much to do with capitalization
per mile thc density of our traffic is
greater than that in france less than that
in england and germany the greater the
density of traffic of course the larger the
proper capitalization will be because in-
crease in density means more stations
doubling of tracks more equipment more
expense to insure safety of travel bear-
ing these considerations in mind just see-
the approximate capitalization per mile in
other countries in iq  or s

  furthermore though there i some differ-
ence in opinion the least prejudiced ex-
perts believe that we could not dupli-
cate our railroads for u price less than
- a mile -the present capitalized
value note well however that present
value has nothing to do with the actual
amount invested in railroad property and
do not make the common mistake into
which many fall of thinking that our capi-
talization is evenly distributed among the
railroad we are just beginning to learn
that each railroad must be judged by it-
self some are capitalized away beyond
righteousness and earn dividends on that
capitalization some occupy defensible posi-

  tions it is folly for both kinds to set up
the same kind of wail against regulation
or even against agitation il is ridiculous
that they should join in presenting a single
front  it is equal folly for the public to for-
get the difference in their worthiness as
public servants

  finally it must be remembered that some
of the roads which have carried the most
water have for long periods failed to yield
dividends and that since the worst days of
stock watering receiverships and reorgani-
zations have squeezed much of the water
out-not at the ejense of the public but
at the expense of the security holders it i-
true that vast fortunes have been made by
crooked financial manipulation of amer-
ican roads but the very worst examples are
ancient history and because the investors
sometimes bore the loss the consequence of
the exploitation does not rest so heavily
upon the consumer the man for whom this
article is written the burden of capital-

i	ition is not so heavy to-day as it would be
if the railroads being annihilated any one

  government or private interests-should
try to refurnish the country with trans-
portation service

  these facts are sensational enough for
instead of showing that the situation na-
tionally is wholly bad they show a much
more surprising truth which is that it i
not wholly bad the consumer might as
well recognize this and do it now it is one
o the necessities for intelligent regulation

ill	mov i to kaisi rates

  let us then get down to a simple consid-
eration  our railroad problem there is
no belter way to approach the subject
than to seize the most timely question for
analysis flic consumer may become fa-
miliar with the ground over which he must
travel  reach a conclusion by looking at
a minor matter that confronts him at the
moment

  this minor matter is the present move of
rclroad- to imrrasi their rates the im-
portance of a general advance in freight
rates is enough to awaken the consumer to
a lively interest in a matter which is his
concern and in which his voice till now has
been silent while voices of financiers rail-
roads and shippers have been raised in a
hubbub of rather crude evasive and selfish
controversy which has enveloped the whole
steel rails and iron hands

  contention in an impenetrable cloud of eye-
blinding dust both inside and onside the
official hearings

more service-more money

  there never has been a more important
railroad question than that which was raised
by this battle-front of railroads asking for
an advance in rates it is only an opening
skirmish never has the interstate com-
merce commission had to realize more
keenly that the question of what is a reason-
able schedule of rates is a question which it
cannot really answer the perplexities of
the situation are increased by what may
be fairly termed an absolute failure on the
part of shippers and railroads to meet any-
where on a common issue where the welfare
of the consumer would be considered it is
necessary for any one who wants to make
an educated guess about the merits of
the railroads demand from the consumers
point of view to go outside the record of the
proceedings for light

   the case of the railroads is based on these
assertions and we may comment upon them
as we go along

  	there is a necessity to raise more
money for improvements and extensions
and to give the country the service that it
m-eds

  cold business sense admits this the
transportation facilities are inadequate
we want need demand and must have
servicc

increased rates vs gilt on the
ceiling

  	many of these improvements and ex-
tensions are of such a nature that the benefit
of them in large part goes to the public and
does not add to the earning power of rail-
road property that is new capital for rail-
roads sees railroad property being purchased
or built which docs not promise profits from
its use therefore they say there arises a
situation in which the whole property earns
less proportionately

   cold business sense admits this too with
qualifications there is some virtue in the
suggestion that rates should be high enough
to give a fair return of profit and also pay
at least in part for non-earning additions
which benefit the public more than they
do the railroads the traveler on american

   lines can see plenty of examples of property
w hich is non-earning

  look at that man putting new gilt on
the ceiling of this waiting-room said a
commuter i pay for that the road
wants to raise its rates and take the cost of
the job out of me

  surely said his companion who knew a
little more about corporation management
 youre the man that wants it there gilt
ceilings and big terminal stations beauti-
fully designed by high-priced architects and
lots of other things that you have been hol-
lering for in recent years are expenditures
that do you more good than the stockhold-
ers you would be astounded to know how-
large such non-earning improvements have
become it is the demand for non-earning
improvements that makes investments in
railways less attractive than they were and
makes financing more difficult

biiing tiie past to the present
consumer

  cold business sense winces a lit tie to be
sure this sounds plausible yet the trou-
ble-and a great difficulty it is- lies in the
exaggeration given to the fact by the testi-
mony of the railroads

  any business wan knows that parts of his
investment arc non-earning some non-
earning investment is a normal incident of
all business a mahogany desk in your
office earns no more than one of oak

  when the railway presidents this sep-
tember tried to point out on the witness
stand the need of higher rates to attract
capital so that they might make addi-
tions or to yield enough to help provide
for non-earning improvements out of cur-
rent earnings the business man asked
what are these new non-earning im-
provements

  oh safety devices said the presi-
dents and heavier track and faster service
and abolishment of grade crossings and ex-
pensive terminals and-

  here cold business sense interrupted to
say that to a considerable extent these mat
ters of furnishing safety convenience and
inducements to customers are perfectly nor-
mal incidents of business and that if the
railroads find themselves behind in these
things it shows a laxity in american rail-
roading in the past which cannot properly
be billed to the consumer to-day and yet
everybodys magazine

there is no doubt at all that the non-earning
property of railroads is growing proportion-
ately larger

   our ocraling expense has in-
creased say the railroads

  but so has your revenue says cold
business sense so has the density of
your traffic that helps you then again
how easy it is for you in spite of the ac-
counting system provided to show your
profits are less listen we know the
trick you can do it by making heavy
charges to your maintenance figures which
are a part of your operating expense you
can make expense show large that means
that you are investing your profits in your
own property how can you show that
this maintenance is not a process of con-
cealing profits or taking them in a different
form than dividends

juggling thk accounts

   oh we would not do anything of that
sort say the railroads especially as to
our accounting

   if it is illogical to spread credits it should also
be illogical to spread debits over one quarter
two quarters or  months

   my only interest of course is the effect that
it may have upon matters that arc now being
considered

  my dear mr smith replying to yours of
the th in regard to spreading debits

   you arc quite correct that it is illogical and
also illegal to spread debits over a period with
the single exception of such general classes of
work such as renewals or rails or ties as would
logically be continued through a series of
months and the benefit of which is applicable
to a year

  in view- of mr places decision the lake
shore dividend was not carried into the suc-
ceeding quarter but  have authority from mr
carstenscn to change our plan of renew ing rails
and tics so as to spread it over the entire year
which means that the march quarter will in-
clude one quarter instead of one tenth of the
entire amount and also to include in the march
expenses the figures reported by you covering
condemned locomotives this will increase
the expenses for march between  and


              yours very truly

  if this little departure from the regular
practice of the new york central account-
ing had not been made because of the
effect it may have upon matters that are
steel rails and iron hands



now being considered the new york cen-
tral would have shown an increase in oper-
ating revenue for the three months ending
march  of - instead of a
decrease in revenue

  it may be mentioned that this painted
decrease whatever reasons were back of the
manipulation not only had the effect of
making the public and shippers believe in
the railroads distress but helped to con-
vince wage earners that in order to have
better wages they must help the railroads
in an advance of rates it is not unfair to
say that the laborers are taken in by this
species of strategy-these doctored statis-
tics- which tend to show that a road is in
distress

  and now says cold business sense it
seems to me that recently the charges to
maintenance all along the line have jumped
it is a curious thing in a way-this leaping
of railway maintenance out of its skin in-
stead of seeing properties that are really
impoverished i see a good many that have
increased their earning capacity and have
done so by charging to maintenance money
which was yielded by the present rates
which came from the public in a sen-
tence concludes cold business sensr

  tiie railroads concealed profits

  sonic  you have been spending out of
money yielded by present rates amounts
uhich have increased much faster than the
prices  labor and materials or the degree of
thoroughness of repair a good deal of this
money goes to the railroad interest just as
much as it does when it goes in dividends
ft is a part of the profits of the business when
a new piece of earning property is added to
the total of earning property and this
profit cot lies out of rates

  let us look at the chicago hurlington
 quincy in  maintenance of struc-
tures way and equipment was 
in -the year of depression too-it
had gone to  the first three-
fourths of a year or nine months ending
april   showed 

  this course of expenditure on main-
tenance helps to explain why some of our
roads can make a poor showing to the pub-
lic by talking about what is left after oper-
ating expense has been deducted from
revenues nothing can be plainer than
that a road can make reports which serve

to conceal the true state of earning power
and it is a fact that just now these charges
to maintenance are aviating

iiow the public pays the piper

  what do the railroads say they say
that mileage has increased so that upkeep
must be larger the answer is that it has
not increased in any such proportion they
say that thoroughness of upkeep has been
enforced as it has not been before the
answer is that current upkeep is a part of
that revenue which any fair-minded person
wants the railroads to have over and above
a fair and liberal return with depreciation
reserve thrown in but the light in these
charges can hardly be called necessary for
current upkeep when in the recent past
good current upkeep has not been so ex-
travagantly phrased in terms of dollars
they say as to operating expense that in
good and profitable years the property
should be so strengthened that dividends
can be maintained in bad years the an-
swer to this is that no man of business sense
will deny the railroads that right so long as
the privilege is not extended beyond reason

  the complete answer to any attempt to
justify excessive maintenance charges is
that excessive maintenance charge or any
excessive operating expense means money
that comes out of the public and goes more
or less directly to the owners or more often
to the manipulators sooner or later di-
rectly or indirectly the increased value of
the property is capitalized then what

  then the public must pay rates that will
yield a return on this increased capitaliza-
tion which really is the investment of the
public it was out of the earnings yielded by
the public that the investment was made

higher wages-higher rates say the
railroads

  this is the first foremost and most im-
portant of the concealed profits of the rail-
roads it is so simple that a child can work
it it makes ridiculous any figures of rail-
road prolit that are based merely on dividends
paid

  but suppose for the moment that the
railways have been earning only a lair
profit or at least one which encouraged
them to keep  in business and apparently
was large enough to attract new capital

what is the principal basis for asking an
increase in rates to maintain that fair profit
because operating expense has increased

  wages

   it is true that in five years wages paid
by our railroads per average employee have
increased fifteen per cent or more it is
probably true that for the increased
amount less hours of work per laborer
arc received it is true that forty-two per
cent of the gross revenue of railroads is
paid out in wages it is true that consid-
erable increases have just been granted or
are under advisement but the introduc-
tion of labor-saving machinery has saved
some wage expense surely for example
the rock islands report for s shows
 tons of bridge steel placcd by the use
of a bridge-erecting car at a saving in cost
of about sixty per cent

railway labor playing cats-paw

  then when the total wages and salaries
paid are compared with the total operating
income there docs not seem to be any ex-
traordinary change in the status it looks
like this

per cent of income paid in wages



 ss   

 

ivoj



   under these figures there is no need for
any such excitement about increase in
wages paid for it follows that if wages have
increased there must be fewer employees in
proportion to the dollars of business done

   it is hard then to sec why railway labor-
ers should become very much excited in
joining with their employers to ask for a
rate increase as the only way to obtain
higher wages when they do so they for-
get that in the past wage increases did not
depend upon rate advances this was well
brought out in the cross-examination of
president mccrea of the pennsylvania the
truth of the matter is t hat railway labor has
in the past few months when it has advo-
cated rate advances played a title role in
the old old comedy of cats-paw

  and yet when all is said and done the
advances in wages must be reckoned with
so must the question of advance in the cost
of materials

  the advance in cost of materials was a
large phrase with which the railroads ad-
vanced to the fray it faded considerably
as time went on cost of railroad materials
is not increasing so very fast in fact when
the federal arbitration board was sitting to
adjust the wages of locomotive firemen last
june they were presented with a list of
sixty-two raw materials tools and basic
supplies with prices in  compared with
prices in  there were forty-four de-
creases in prices and ten increases here is

railroad materials with comparative price

  under the circumstances it may be better
for the railways to rest their case on other
grounds

  there are other matters to consider too
what of the new conditions of doing busi-
ness which tend to reduce cost of service
and what has been the effect of the in-
creased density of traffic

  the last few years have seen cheaper
methods of handling freight this saves
money

  longer trains ten years ago the aver-
age train carried about  tons now it
carries nearly  tons

  longer haul ten years ago the average
haul was  miles now it is iso

  easier grades larger cars increased
density of traffic

why not be frank

  the trouble with the general case of the
railroads was principally a trouble in prov-
ing the facts and their significance acting
together they asserted a heavier operating
expense as a need for higher rates this
case with the exception of its application to
some of the southern roads was not such as
to convince the court of last resort it
would have been a much better case if it
had argued outright for a more liberal re-
turn to railroad investment that kind of
a case is frank and open when the public
knows the facts about the real return to rail-
steel rails and iron hands

road capital and what standard of man-
efficicncy goes into the business the mad
with a good case lias nothin to fear in asking
for adequate rates it is to the interest of
the consumers-those with the little iron
hands-to keep the railroads in sound health
not as a matter of sentimental gratitude but
as a matter of cold selfish business sense
which realizes the need of service more
service better service plenty of it in the
judgment of what is necessary to have ser-

classes ol shippers nr lend an ear to old

  unfortunately not only as regards the
case itself but as regards its presentation
inside and outside of the interstate com-
merce commission hearings the railroads
made a wretched exhibition their lawyers
as a whole were constantly in the attitude
of holding the cover on the information pot
which by the way is the trouble with a lot
of these lawyers representing semi-public
corporations there was a tendency on t in-
part of the railroads to put witnesses on the
stand who could not answer from their own
knowledge as to vital matters and when
individuals who did know came along they
showed a reluctance to treat the situation in
a mans way some of the shippers testi-
mony was rabid and unfair

  mr mccreaof the pennsylvaniaseemed
to hang back in answering questions which
brought out the fact that pennsylvania
stockholders most of whom are women
have received in a year six per cent in
dividends and eight dollars a share in rights
during a period in which two and one hall
per cent went to the surplus he did not
seem pleased to say that the past year was
the most lucrative for stockholders of any
year in the past ten except 

  mr daly vice president in charge of
traffic on the new york central said he
could not tell what surplus his road had last
year and that he could not tell whether
there was any surplus

  the auditor of disbursements for the new
york central had an estimate of the wage
increase on his road which was 
it was pointed out that this did not show

the increase in wages of men employed in
freight business but included the increase
in wages paid men in passenger service at
a suggestion that the railroad furnish figures
indicating the distribution between the two
kinds the attorney for the road objected
 igorously

  president truesdale ol the lackawanna
testified that in ten years his company lost
about one million a year on operation of the
morris  essex which is leased to i he
lackawanna while fifteen millions were
spent  the leased road the fact was
later brought out that in the telling of this
loss it was not explained that the loss
n operation was calculated after seven
er cent interest had been paid on nearly
thirty-two millions of stock and bonds of
the morris  essex this was a typical
case of the other half of the truth-under
the hat incidentally the new york cen-
tral in five years has paid out over four
millions for the pleasure it takes in operat
ing the boston  albany

  the railroad men who testified to the in-
creased return demanded by investors in
railway securities knew very well that in-
creased return is demanded all along the
line-in municipal ixmds in industrial se-
curities their bonds have shrunk in value
no more than other i minds they knew it

how allotr kaikoah ll iu ii ncv

  these examples are not given to add sore-
ness to the subject but to indicate that the
consumer the man who is destined to have
the final say cannot yet open his mouth
and shut his eyes to receive wisdom nor
has this consumer in fact this for the
benefit of railroad officials and financiers
read without a smile items in the newspapers
about how mr so-and-so the european
financier who we find used to be a rail-
way publicity man says that foreign in-
vestors distrust our railway securities be-
cause they fear a rate advance will not be
allowed our ordinary suburbanite with
a derby hat and our ordinary farmer who
wears a collar heard the cry of the railroad
interests that railway securities held by
widows anti orphans and sav ings banks are
threatened but such people knew-of
course they knew-that this suggestion was a
hundred times more hurtful to the integrity
of the jk-oples savings than any rate
regulation they knew that if there came


everybodys magazine

any depression in railway securities it
could be charged not to the alleged cause
of the wail but to the pessimistic wail
itself

   there were two reasons then against the
general advance in rates proposed-and a
third

   the first reason was that with a few ex-
ceptions the roads failed to show that their
real profits had been reduced by new con-
ditions it must be remembered that
profits are not only in the shape of dividends
but also in the shape of i rights to sub-
scribe to stock at a figure less than the open
market will pay abnormal increase of
undistributed funds the railroads are now
enjoying the largest surplus ever stored up

	charges to maintenance or any oper-
ating expense which exceeds an amount
necessary for good honest current upkeep
of the road

   the second reason is that there is a good
old doctrine of equity that the plaintiff
must have clean hands somehow it seems
as if the railroads have come to court this
time with gloves on

   the third reason is the best of all it is
constructive to mr louis d brandeis
who as counsel represented eastern shippers
must be credited the suggestion and the
testimony drawn from railroad men them-
selves that gave the suggestion nourish-
ment the suggestion is this it is quickly
said and frill-less

   you say this first step in the advance of
rates you plan is a small increase a small
burden on the consumer and a small offset
to your enlarged operating expense but
a small decrease in your operating expense
would meet the situation just as well why
dont you try efficiency

  mr brandeis showed by his cross-exam-
ination that scientific business efficiency
practiced in competitive industrial enter-

prises was something of a stranger to most
railroad operation the presidents of the
pennsylvania and the baltimore  ohio for
instance pained and surprised at the sug-
gestion admitted that no standard costs
were kept for the variety of repairs on loco-
motives or freight cars an injection of
three per cent or thereabouts of efficiency
in operation would offset the much talked-
of wage increase and would increased
efficiency be possible it is a painful idea
nevertheless the expense accounts of the
insurance companies which were supposed
to represent the minimum that could be
reached through the efforts of high-salaried
men have since the investigation been
proved to have represented only seventy-five
per cent of reasonably attainable efficiency

  and there is the illinois central asking
for a rate advance and pointing to a de-
crease of some  in net earnings
this is joor grace in a management that in
two years lost  in car and equip-
ment repairs through fraud which might
not have been discovered at all such a
loss would have been impossible where
standard costs and modern scientific busi-
ness protected the investors yet the illi-
nois central has a large reputation for
efficient management

  what about this railroad efficiency

  this is a rich vein

  perhaps before rates are farther advanced
it should be explored

  surely the consumer-the man who pays
-is not attacking the railroads nor killing
the hen that lays the golden egg norputting
the widows and orphans in dangernor even
exhibiting any extraordinary anti-corpora-
tion animosity when he mildly suggests
that before he contributes a larger income
to the roads they on their part should sec
that nothing is wasted

   heres one thing about the alkali
j country or rather there aint one
thing - and thats petticoats ob-
served riley the foreman of the tres
santos with a yawn theres one or two
worse places than new mexico at that
he added

  its funny there aint more marries
mexes where its so near that or nothin
aint it remarked johnson the ditch boss

  ive seen the day when there wasnt a
white woman in thirty mile of here con-
tinued riley jack wilkins went clean to
san anton for his wife jack was allowin
that the kind of girl to stack up to an edu-
cated taste didnt grow in this valley which
they didnt either

  the same being why you aint fuller-
in a baby carriage i reckon suggested
andrews interestedly riley chuckled
andrews being ranch machinist and hence
indispensable when anything busted often
took liberties with the foreman

  the difference between you and me
jim riley retorted is youd be after
hamessin up with anything that done her
hair up the back and i aint that kind of
fool he arose for perhaps the tenth time
from his seat astride a bale of hay and
peered out of the barn door at the beating
rain which was soaking countless tons of

fresh-cut alfalfa and enforcing idleness upon
himself and four unmistakably pleased ranch
hands

  what a heap of fools there are replied
andrews languidly but say how about
jack wilkins for a married man with
a family id call the boss a right happy
lunatic

  anybody would be a fool not to marry
a girl like missus wilkins if he had a
chance urged riley patiently there
was a time though when even you jim
wouldve made a better match for her than
jack wilkins in the opinion of most people
hereabouts im savin that with all respect
for jacks wife too

  riley settled easily back and rolled a
cigarette he was rolling a second one be-
fore he spoke again

  in his day jack was something of a
rounder he said at length that was be-
fore some of you boys ever come to the val-
ley or knew there was such a place on the
map booze faro-jack he went the
whole route-and he went it too im right
here to remark his wife had domestic
troubles thatd make any woman that ever
hit reno nevada look like a blame cry-
baby beside her that was before a certain

  jacks early trainin hadnt had enough
bed slat in it for his own good to my way of
thinkin old jud wilkins was as savvy
a cow-man as ever lived but raisin kids
wasnt his line puttin the ditch strip into
farm land took all the old mans time and
besides that jack didnt have any mammy
from the time he was two years old

  the boy learned young  caught him
more than once soakin up tequila with the
mcxes when he was only a kid for years
he made a regular hangout of a crooked
roadhouse on the tunas trail drinkin
rotten whisky and buckin a brace-box thatd
busted a plumber in six deals  reckon he
wasnt over fourteen when he started this

  the worst mistake the old man ever
made was to send the boy off to college
honest we couldnt foller him for smoke
back there in the east but old jud was
aimin to give the young devil what he con-
sidered a fair chance so he kept sweetenin
the pot and worryin

  when the old man died the kid come
back sobered down something amazin and
said he was goin to run the ranch that
boy for all he was brought up right here on
the santos didnt know no more about
ranchin than  do about quiltin but the
place was his and as long as he behaved
himself we was satisfied

  there was something sanctified and
unnatural about that first month jack run
the ranch ben mcgrath and me drunk
every drop of whisky on the place sos he
couldnt get at it then we all held our
breath and waited

   well one day jack said he was goin to

el paso to get
some oil for
his machinery
he sure got it
too lubri-
cated wasnt
no name for
the condition
he come back
in a b u-
querque was
the next sta-
tion on the jag
route and
then he got his
gait inside
of another

month he was rip-snortin over the country
leavin a trail three states wide behind him

   but the worst of it was the way he took
to shootin up the exchequer jack got to
costin us so much  never knew when i was
goin to have enough to pay off the mcxes

  one day we near had a strike on our
hands all that kept the help from leadin
off the livestock was some little reputation
ben and me had got back in the cow-rustlin
days for handlin six guns well right in
the middle of my explainin that pay day
was cornin around jest as soon as the young
boss got back with the dinero jack lit on the
scene drunk he was towin along a big
soft-lookin souse he allowed was his fra-
ternity brother

  we sized the pair of em up ben and
me and decided to act so we watched our
chance and corailed the fraternity brother
im not sure but i think it was twelve hours
we give him to get a wire that his relatives
was sick and needin him i remember all
the time we was talkin ben was fondlin an
inch board with a barrel cactus nailed on
the business end of it that fraternity cuss
had a right smart respect for the uphol-
stery xatured endowed him with for he got
his telegram that same evening then i
braced jack

  jack boy i says i was foreman of
the tres santos before you was ever
hatched when your poor old dad cashed
in i promised him forty times if i promised
him once that i was goin to stick by you
and the ranch i says  when i done it i
says i didnt figure on runnin the old
place as no jag asylum with a blanket mort-
gage on it you either make up what you
consider to be your mind to cut this foolish-
ness out and settle down i says or you
and your ranch can go plumb to thunder for
all of me  says

  the next morning instead of flaggin
the santa fe and goin to town jack got
into some old breeches and rode ditch from
sun-up to sun-down the day after he
broke two sickles and a mower hagglin up
three borders but it was a days work for
him most surprisin of all was the way he
appeared to get a hand on himself things
perked up to beat the band

   but one morning he was missin and
we guessed it was all off the only thing we
were even speculatin about was what we
were goin to do to the fraternity brothers
if he fetched any of em back with him
tin worst mistake the old man ever m auk was to send the bov off to college

  we were all layin out in front of thc
house on sunday evening when all of a
sudden edwin summerville kent let out a
whoop that nearly ripped his linings out
you see edwin only had one lung and was
settin on the fence on account of the dew
well the next minute  was leanin against
the fence myself makin noises like windin
a dollar watch

  up the lane was cornin a rubber-tired
carriage behind a shiny bay inside was
jack wilkins dressed in ice-cream clothes
and settin alongside of a girl

  edwin showed the advantages of early
bringin up by steppin out lig as life and
hitchin their horse for em an then jack
lifted the girl out like she was a settin of
eggs the missus is pretty enough now
but she sure was a pippin those days slim
and round-big black eyes-this raven
hair they talk so much about-cheeks like
peaches and cream prettiest woman alive-
that was her these are the tres santos
boys roxie jack says  this is my wife
boys he says offhand-like

  i give a gasp for breath even yet some-
times when i think of that remark of jacks

for the next five minutes us fellows were
reddern an acre of ripe cow beets even
edwin was knocked off his pins blamed
if the girl didnt fetch a smile and get a little
red herself

  that aint no way to introduce any-
body she says to jack i want to know
their names she says her voice was like
little silver spurs a-jinglin jack bein
sober was stumped he told her hed been
away on business so much he didnt know-
all of us himself

  riley here hires em and fires em he
says ties got their names and pedi-
grees down cold then he introduced me
to her

  sure mrs wilkins i says when i got
my breath again but id rather not say
anything about pedigrees except that none
of the boys have been hung yet then i
begun presentin em this oldish-like
gent hidin his blushin features behind the
whiskers is mister mcgrathi says   

him tryin to get both his feet behind the

its drivin mules for hes fluent and per-

observe tryin to edge around the corner of
the house is mister anderson  says

  then  come to edwin the lad here
with the pale intellectual dome and the
specs is mister edwin summerville kent
from boston wherever that is  says if
theres one thing edwin is prouder of than
anyotlierits the sunburn on hisarms isays

   before shed been with us a week that
girl just naturally turned the santos upside
down just her bein with us went over
the ranch like a bucket of whitewash we
moved the mexes dobcs out back of the
corrals sos she couldnt hear em cuss but
lord we didnt need to- i never seen a
civilizeder lot than they got to be after she
come la scslora chiquita they called her

   jack he bought new furniture and had
the porch built and hired a decent cook
we all took to shavin we even wore coals
to the table till she asked us not to out on
the job when the belt flew off the baler
there was only the softest kind of cussin
because she was always ridin around on a
dinky little pony i gentled for her watchin
us germany got so he couldnt drive
mules for a cuss he was that scared shed
understand what he said to em

  kilev paused to take another look out of
the barn door but thc rain was pounding
down as hard as ever and he returned and
lighted another cigarette there would be
no more field work that day

  where does your plymouth rock or
huff cochin or whatever it was you said
perched on the rooftree conic in drawled
andrews

  riley gave no indication of having heard
the question i dont know as i ever
rightly understood the ins and outs of the
mess he continued i didnt need to

 did learn one tiling after a while though
which is that when a mans spent ten or
fifteen years cultivat in the instincts of a coy-
ote not all the angels of kingdom come tan
drive it out of him in a minute i know that
jack wilkins had a relapse all right

  one day  noticed the liquor signal in
jacks face the same day he went off to
el paso without sayin a word to his wife
before that hed as soon have left without
his head he come back four days later
boozed up considerable and sulky as a lo-
coed greaser the girl had kept to her
room all the time he was away and she come
down with her eyes red and her mouth
droopin the rest of us was eatin supper
when she seen the shape he was in some-
thing blazed up in her eyes and back she
went upstairs again ill tell you the scrap
that started that night like to never ended

  thc next time jack rounded thc curve
to where the little brown jug was settin he
went on a regular old-time tear the girl
moved clean across the house from him and
quit speakin to him

   from then on thc only time we saw em
was at meals once in a while ill never
forget one breakfast the girl come in late
with her eyes all puffed out from cryin as
they generally was about that time the
boys all said good mornin but jack
never looked up she smiled kind of pitiful
and set down at her end of the table when
the mexican girl handed her her coffee i
seen a tear splash in the cup

  well we et away pretendin not to
notice if somebodyd poured water on me
id have cracked like a red-hot stove i was
that mad  felt like gettin up and kickin
jack off the place just about then it was
i guess i happened to notice that edwin
summerville kent the kid with the specs
and the one lung seemed to have something
on his mind two or three times he started
the peace dove of the tres santos



to take a bite and stopped and looked at me
then he lays down his fork

  mister riley he says lookin kind of
scared is it customary for hens to set at
this time of year

  for the next two minutes a pin droppin
would have sounded like a cannon ball failin
through a bass drum it was that quiet
edwin got so red the sweat broke out all
over his face

  mister kent i says at last i aint
gone in for any exhaustin study of the sub-
ject but its been my observation that when
most hens take it in their heads to set they
set summer or winter and hell and high
waters notwithstandin

  i asked says edwin because theres
a speckled hen behind the corn box in the
hay barn been settin on four onions ever
since i come here

  that hen aint settin shes restin

  restin your eye says mcxary that
hen was settin on three spuds in the same
place six months before mister kent ever
come here germany allowed that the

same hen had
set on two
cowcumbers
to his posi-
tive knowl-
edge for all
of seven
months be-
fore that

 i throwed
the same hen
off a doorknob
in the sheep
corral many a
day two year
ago says lien
mcgrath

  well it aint any wonder shes wore all
the feathers off her chest is it edwin says
jack had to grin in spite of himself and the
missus giggled hen winked at me

  the way to break hens of wantin to
set edwin is to keep em soaked in water
he says some authorities breaks em by
pourin and some by immcrsin he says
it depends on their religious convictions
let her set i says she
aint hurlin nothin if every-
body was as anxious to settle down
and be domestic as that poultry
is theyd be better off i says

  break her of it says jack
gettin sore

  next day i run on to the whole
bunch of em in the hay barn
foolin around the corn box as
near as  could see the hen was
tendin to her own business but
her cluckin showed she was gettin
riled some

  dare you to pick her up says
edwin to old mexican charley

  i put it into mex for him
charley crawled in behind the box
and reached for her that hen
crowded him out so fast he nearly
knocked the whole top of his head
off on a loose board then she
humps up her back and squats
back on her onions

  ben got her from behind

    i bet she dont do no more
settin now he says he took her
straight to the waterin trough and
soused her under cut out your

a bee line for the
corn box

   yes but it

-he gets wise to
how wet she is

  she does
seem kind of
subdued-like
admits edwin

  oh she

says mcnary

edwin sidled
up and begun
strokin her on
the back

 says but i
was too late

by the t i m e
edwin had a
half-nelson on
her that hen
had wicked off all the hide the sun hadnt
already burned off and was squawkin for
more edwin got mad he let her soak in
the trough till the bubbles quit cornin it
took her a full minute to come to but when

she d i d she

almighty splash and a mud-colored streak
for the barn door it got so that hen was
the only bright spot in the all-pervadin

didnt talk of
nothin else
tryin lo raise
a smile from the
missus got to be
a regular game
with us

     boys says
menary one
day i believe
that fowl is

cious of this

about it either those onions has got to
hatch or this settin business has got to be
queered or that hens goin to croak
why he says that hen used to scratch
around and eat once in a while but nowdays
the only lime shes oil those vegetables is
when shes on her way to the trough or under
water or on her way back lo the nest im
thinkin the water cures no bueno he says

   just then the girl piped in  why dont
you take the onions away and give the poor
thing some real eggs she says it was the
first raise we had got out of the missus in
quite a spell

   oh i tried that long ago says ander-
son before shed hardly got the words out
of her mouth that was when she was
incubatin some early rose potatoes he

the peace dove of the tres santos



wont set on no eggs but her own and she
wont lay none so what are you to do
i guess shes a vegetarian he says

   by jinks we aint tried her out on egg-
plant yet says ben the missus stuffed
a napkin over her mouth and run upstairs

  ferget it says jack after hed nigh
choked himself on a glass of water

  it was kdwin that started things off
the next time jack was enjoyin one of
his morning-after grouches and the girl
looked like she was goin to break down and
have a boo-hex you see wed kept on
purpose from even mentionin the hen for
three days well we hadnt any more than
set down to dinner when edwin speaks up
and says gentlemen he says this time
to-morrow that hen wont be settin

  decided to cut her head off have you
kdwin i says

   you know better than that says
edwin ive been layin awake nights in-
volvin some plans he says well the
boys laid down their forks and looked
interested as the devil all in the world
youve got to do is to blindfold your hen and
spin her around about seven times and then
turn her loose says edwin

y---- howll she ever find her

	onions thenhe says

        j hecansmellemcanthe
        says germany winkin at me

   smell nothin says edwin	

that hen has such a cold in	

her head from bein soaked in
water she couldnt smell double distilled
ammonia asafetida and limburgcr cheese
all mixed together and held right under
her snoot

  whats to hinder a blindfolded hen
that cant smell from wanderin in a ditch
and drownin herself says ben

  oh theres other ways of curin her
says edwin if you object to that whats
the matter for instance he says with
puttin her in one of these squirrel cages
that spin round and round i guess about
all the settin shed do in one of those
would be  her head the girl near
choked but the boys never batted an eye
whats the next one we says

   here edwin hauls out a sheet of paper
this is where we call on science he says
if you gentlemen will study this diagram

ive drawed youll grasp the idear he says
the problem rests on whether or not
onions is conductors of electricity says
edwin let x be your battery he says
pointin it all out on his paper  p and q
are copper wires each terminatin in an
onion call one onion a and the other b
he says now then he says when 
which is hen squats down just after her
bath and resumes her settin stunt she gets
in contact with a and b simultaneous and
closes the circuit that minute blue sparks
will lje ilyin and shell get a shock thatll jolt
the liver out of her

  ill be hanged if jack and his wife didnt
bust out and laugh till they cried you
know how a person under any kind of strain
does when they do break loose it was all
the worse because they tried so hard to keep
from it i swear i near died myself

 i remember mcnary had a plan for
puttin the hens head in some kind of
stanchion so she couldnt do nothin but
stand up germanys scheme was to put
weights  her legs so shed have to set with-
out movin till she was sick to death of it
anderson was for changin her onions for
prickly pears and i remember i was rather
in favor of that idea myself ben said to
leave il to him and keep sousin her for luck

   i was off-saddlindown by the sheds that
night when up rides ben and yanks his
saddle off and heaves it over the fence i
could see he was good and het up about
something whats my time he says


everybodys magazine

     w il y
whats broke
loose now
says i

    oh noth-
in he says

	only the wild
burro that

o	w n s this
ranch tells me
hes goin to
fire every
man on the
place if this
settin hen
talk aint
dropped im
goin to save him the trouble so fars i m
concerned says ben

  i told him i thought myself we was
runnin the subject into the ground

  runnin hell ben says that fool
hen is a reasonin being compared with
them two they ought to be both of em
chucked in the trough he says

   look here ben i says it aint her
place to le cavin in with him actin the way
he is that poor little woman is a lot like
this hen the boys is houndin to death all
in the world she wants is to settle down and
live like white folks and have a home and
a family all that drunken yahoot does is
to throw her off the nest and abuse her

   if she wasnt so feeble-minded shed go
back to her people thats all  got to say
says ben and he wasnt just whisperin it
either lookin up i seen jack standin
not twelve feet away by a pile of bales he
was redder than fire but i guess neither of
us give a damn for him it wasnt jack
that made the two of us feel like crawlin
through the cracks in the fence standin in
the door of the sheep shed was the girl she
went there every day to feed a pet lamb she
was weanin from the ewe and there she
was with the bottle in her hand and her
cheeks bumin there wasnt nothin at
all to say and it was sure our move

  things was relieved of a sudden by
r n outlandish clatter which made us guilty
parlies jump like wed been shot from be-
hind it was hard tellin for a minute just
what was happenin then through a
cloud of dust i managed to make out the
cttin hen tearin along nine feet at a step
her clucks cornin easy a hundred and fifty
to the minute she was trailin ten feet of

red rag from her tail right along behind
her galloped edwin summerville kent lit-
erally yellin his head off the hen gave
one flyin leap for the opposite fence the
rag caught on a nail and bang she went
down flat on her back edwin loosed her
and off she streaked it for the open fields

  im never after forgettin the way
edwin put his hand over his heart and
bowed theres nothin like havin a col-
lege education he says all out of breath
the girl went straight to the house and jack
in the opposite direction

  it sure was a caution the way that hen
carried on the next few days every hour
or so youd hear that peevish cackle bearin
down  you and shed go sailin past with
the rag standin straight out behind every
so often shed get tripped up and spin
around in circles for five minutes at a time
then off shed go again there aint a
marathon runner livin would have had
a smell of a chance against that hen ed-
win didnt do a thing but boast from morn-
ing to night jack never ojened his head
about firin him either

  then the fexl hen was missin for a day

  you might have knowed edwin with
all that college education of yours that the
poor critter would get caught to something
in the bosquc and be et up by bobcats says
ben the girl give a gasp for about the
first time edwin didnt have nothin to say
the next minute we heard a rapid-fire
cluckin and along past the window sails
the hen under a full head of steam

  then the hen did sure enough turn up
missin red rag and all it wasnt three-
days either till things got glum as ever
that hen had been the life of the ranch
the girl begun to look like she was due for
a spell of sickness and it was easy to see
jack was feelin mighty uncomfortable

  it must have been a month afterward-
i know we were in the fourth cuttin and
busy as the devil-that the girl asked ger-
many to go over the rio grande and get
doc collins for her jack was in town
when doc come i hung around the house
till he come out and asked him if it was
anything serious doc grinned and said it
wasnt nothin to worry about and begun
dickerin ior a few tons of hay just the
same the boys were all good and worried
and i for one made up my mind jack was
goin to hear what i thought of him if i had
to set on him while i was tellin it to him
the peace dove of the tres santos



  jack was sober for a change when he
come home next day he was lookin good
and miserable too im tellin you bein
sober i guess give his conscience a chance
to get in a little work anyhow you could
see lie was anxious when the girl come down
to dinner that noon lookin like a ghost ex-
cept for two fever spots in her cheeks

  she was that nervous she couldnt eat
jack looked at her all the time but she set
there for three or four minutes without even
liftin her eyes then she got up and went
out on the porch i was facin the window
and couldnt help seem her she wasnt
any more than out the door when she tot-
tered and put her hand up to her head i
was just after runnin out to keep her from
failin when i seen her stop and stare out in
the yard then of a sudden she begun to
shriek and laugh-downright hysterics it
was somethin awful the way she screeched
out like lightnin it come to me that her
mind had give way on her when she be-
gun screamin for jack i was sure of it

  jack went out that door like hed been
jerked with a rope i seen her turn quick as
a flash and bite her lips and step back she
kind of shrunk away like she was ashamed
of herself and all the blood in her body
seemed to be in her face

  i forgot jack she says and i could
see she was tryin to get a hold on herself
look at em jack she says jack was
right beside her and he stopped in his tracks
and looked out into the yard then he let
out a laugh you could have heard half a
mile and hollered boys we all broke
for the orch and there they were with
their arms round each other

   i swear there was something holy in the
look on that little girls face jack called
her all their old pet names and kissed her

hands and hair and mouth and squeezed her
up to him like he was never goin to li t go
of her again we growed fast to the floor
then she put both hands round jacks neck
and hung to him like she was plumb tired
out i couldnt make out what she was say-
in to him and i wasnt tryin to but i
couldnt help prickin up my ears when i
heard doc collinss name jack was
tumblin all right though for he got pale as
a sheet all of a sudden he broke down

  roxie my poor little rox he says
the next minute they were both of em
cryin like a couple of babies the boys
come to and begun edgin into the house

  just al this embarrassin minute ed-
win summerville kent let out one funny
yelp lookithe yells lookit lookit

  then we got our wits back for a minute
there in the yard square in front of us was
that settin hen wed been missin there
wasnt any mistakin her she still had a
good two feet of the red rag trailin from her
tail she wasnt runnin this time though
and her cluckin was slowed down to some-
thin like normal she sure was scratchin
the gravel too for i want to be hog-tied
and hung by the heels hombrcs if that
hen didnt have two fuzzy little chickens
traipsin alongside of her

  riley slowly rolled another cigarette lei-
surely he walked to the barn door and flung
it open still rainin a little boys but the
suns peekin over the bosquc and theres
chores to do he announced in businesslike
tones then as he lifted a heavy mexican
saddle from its peg he chuckled to himself

  i might have mentioned he said that
the next time doc collins come over the
rio to see the missus jack was waitin for
him right here on the tres santos anxiouser
than anybody

my friends the world lies wide before
you north south east west the
strange lands beckon and call
cant you hear them-the hansoms slurring
through london mud the roar of the boule-
vards the chugging of the stern-wheel
river boat the shrill summons of themuezzin
from his minaret the tinkle of anklet and
the boom of temple bells have you no
wish to pack your trunk and go

  means and health permitting it is good
for every man to see some little of this
globe on which we live and the strange folk
who move about it it is good to escape
for a time from the house of bondage-be
it office or shop or bank-and to go abroad
with no more exacting master than personal
inclination and with no more definite plan
of travel than has the horse escaped from
pasture upon the countryside

  have you ever stopjed to think that there
are things more important than the amassing
of money that there is a larger education
than is to be found in class rooms or between
the covers of books that the world which
lies beyond our little horizons can provide
entertainments as amusing and more worth
while than motoring or golf or bridge that

to taste of real adventure or of true romance
-which after all are the seasonings that
relieve the monotony of lifes daily pudding
you must look beyond the dollar-twenty
novel and the orchestra chair each of
us when all is said and done has but one-
life to live so why not make the most of
that life but one earth to spend it upon-
so why not see and enjoy that earth

  to those who would travel and cant 
lift my hat in silent sympathy with the hope
that the years to come may bring them
better fortune but for those who are
abundantly able to travel and wont-for
those who with education at theirjvery
doors refuse to bestir themselves frankly
admitting that they prefer the comforts of
their clubs theircard tablesand theircarsto
the annoyances of foreign travel-for these
i have but scant regard somewhere be-
tween these extremes is the great middle
class- fairly well-to-do folk many of whom
own a horse or a small motor car most of
w hom keep one or more servants and very
few of whom hesitate about going to the
theatre when the spirit moves them or to
the seashore or mountains for their summers
vacation the real reason why these people


dont travel is that their lives have run so
long in the same track that it is almost im-
possible to get them out of the rut they
have made but suggest this to them and
instantly you will be silenced under an
avalanche of protestations

 i dont go abroad because i cant afford
it says one with a pathetic gesture as he
cranks up his two-thousand-dollar motorcar
says another i cant spare the time or
 wouldnt dare to leave my business-

amateur golf championship of the adiron-

dont catch me going to foreign parts im
loo fond of the comforts of home

  wealth i answer is not imperative for
travel last summer a boston gentleman
and his wife went to europe on an exjk-ri-
niental trip of eighty days visiting more
than thirty interesting cities in live great
countries at a total cost of  each or
s apiece per day this included every
actual necessary expense steamer passage

deck two-berth stateroom on one of the
slower boats of a well-known line railwav

fares hoard street cars carriage hire all
tips admission fees lunches fruit laundry
guidebooks practically everything in fact
which could properly be included it was
third-class railway travel and simple pen-
sions of course the gentleman in question
writes but  wish to be perfectly frank in
saying that we lived on the whole just a
trille better and more comfortably averag-
ing the whole trip than we do at home
and at home we d not practice self-denial
to an extent which requires the official at-
tention of the authorities

  your time may be limited but if you can
spare six weeks and sis hundred dollars you
can go round the world if it is business
which hinders you need not be out of touch
with it for a single hour by night or by day
by sea or by land loes not the wireless
hash and splutter from every masthead i 
not the slim cables slip out to sea beneath
the waters of every port may not one step

mens places are worth to keep a guest
waiting even a single second for an elevator
money time business comforts-none of
them is an insuperable obstacle in the path
of him who really wants to go

  nothing is farther from my intention than
to imply that americans do not travel the
fact which  am trying to drive home is that
a very great many more people could and
should travel than do though there are
many millions of us who remain at home for
reasons having to do with babies business
bank books or bread and butter there are
many many thousands for whom there has
come to be a call an irresistible fascina-
tion in the very whistle of a train in the
rumble of wheels upon the track in the
thunder of the waves that go swirling aft
along the rail in the very sense of locomo-
tion of going somewhither somehow a
decade ago it was the english globe-trotters
kit-bag and portmanteau that one saw on
every steamship wharf and railway plat-
form from southampton around to shang-
hai to-day it is the suit case and steamer
trunk of the traveling american though
it may be that with many of us travel means
but an escape from the commonplace i like
to think rather that it is a throwback to
those boone and crockett ancestors of ours
who plodded westward and ever westward
that they might see with their own eyes what
lay beyond the ranges

  once get us out of our grooves and we
are the easiest of all peoples to induce to set
our feet on the long trails which lead from
oshkosh and snohomish and pawtucket
and kalamazoo to miramar barbizon
bellagio granada where you will put a
picture in colors of lake lucerne with
the snow-capped alps looming up in the
distance before the cashier of a bank in the
middle vet tell him he can get there in
ten days for less than a hundred dollars and
the chances arc that within a week he will
begin to ask questions about rates and

 nsioiis and a dozen other things of which
lie had only the vaguest ideas a few days
before a week later he has bought a
baedeker ordered a steamer trunk and
paid twenty-five dollars deposit on his
ticket it is in some such fashion as this
that we the most practical of all peoples
are fast blossoming into a nation of travelers

  i never appreciated myself how many of
us have become infected with the contagion
of travel until one day last spring  stood
on the end of a hoboken pier and waved
ion voyage to some friends who were sailing
for europe on one of the fastest and most
luxurious of the transatlantic liners the
gang plank was drawn in the last cable had
been thrown off and slowly and silently the
big boat slipped out into the channel she
was white with fluttering handkerchiefs
perhaps there were eight hundred cabin
passengers aboard her

  powell remarked a friend who stood
beside me theres a million dollars of
american money aboard that ship thats
lost to this country for good and all figure
it out for yourself say eight hundred people
in the first cabin with drafts or letters of
credit averaging a thousand dollars apiece
-and mighty little of it will they bring back
-to say nothing of second-cabin passengers
and the amount spent in passage-money
why man its appalling

  two piers south another greyhound
with every berth occupied was getting
under way three others had already
sailed that morning and four more would
depart before the day was done in all
five thousand people were due to leave new
york that day and new york though
the largest is by no means the only port
from which passengers sail at regular inter-
vals for europe but just stop and think
what that means to american education and
american culture-five thousand of our
people sailing for europe from one port in a
single day

  the number of americans who visited
europe last year reached the amazing total
of three hundred thousand reckoning
that they left abroad or with the steamship
companies an average of  apiece-
surely a very moderate estimate-it will be
seen that this country parted with the
enormous amount of  the
business of entertaining the traveler-espe-
cially the american traveler-has become a
leading industry in many countries an
pack your trunk and 

american making his way through an im-
poverished section of ireland inquired of a
native what do the people round here
live on pat  pigs in the winther sorr
was the answer and tourists in the sum-
mer now that answer had in it the germ
of much economic truth for if th ould
sod is sustained by summer travelers so
in far greater proportion are switzerland
italy and france do you appreciate my
friends that switzerlands imonte from tour-
ists is greater than that from all her exports
put together did you know that the toll
which italy collects from her visitors is
equal to the value of all her exports from
january to may can you hazard even a
guess as to frances annual income from the
traveler as far back as  it was -
 and it is estimated that in the year
just passed it approximated three quarters
of a billion dollars

  i dont like figures and you probably
dont either but it seems worthy of note
that last year our travelingcountrywomcn
left eight millions of dollars with parisian
dressmakers i beg your pardon modistes
and a million and a half with rue de la paix
and rue st honore milliners not to mention
another two million or so spent in the same
gay city for trilling mementoes alone for
furs and jewelry mr and mrs american
tourist probably left forty million dollars in
europe last year all of which indicates not
only the american love of travel but the
american extravagance

  europeans are astonished to put it
mildly at the senseless prodigality with
which a certain class of traveling americans
spends money this reckless spirit in matters
financial has done more than anything else
indeed to confirm foreigners in their belief
that u s is derivei from  anti does more
than any one thing to make european
travel unnecessarily expensive for amer-
icans of moderate tastes and means

  not onlj is the excessive liberality of
money-burdened mericans in wretched
taste but it has unquestionably lowered the
standard of european commercial morality
and exaggerated the veniality of foreign
shop and inn keepers hut it was not until
i saw a voung scion of american aristocracy
throwing his unused ive-r bills from the
steamer at genoa to the scrambling lighting
rabble on the quay below that i fully under-
stood what incalculable damage such ex-
hibitions of vulgarity do to the self-respect

 i both traveling americans and the eoples
whom they visit onl then did  appreciate
the crying nenssily for  proclamation
which by the orders of the governor-
general has been posted conspicuously in
every train tourist steamer and hotel in
the sudan ii reads as follows

  travelers while in the sudan are par-
ticularly requested to refrain from gain-
ing an easy reputation for generosity by
giving money to children beggars and
other persons who have not earned it
at present the population of the sudan
has not been demoralized by indiscrimin-

tiii -iikiii m muons  nil mi iis lki
iii- minakir
everyolys m agazino

exhibitions of vulgarity and ostentation
must not be taken as criteria of the expendi-
tures which would have to lie made by the
sane and economically-minded american
who wants to travel abroad on the
contrary i am inclined to think the true
reason for the rapidly rising tide of amer-
ican travel europeward is that our people
are beginning to learn that it is cheaper to
t ravel abroad than at home in other words
you can get to europe cheaper than you can
get to equally distant points in our own
country and you can live considerably
cheaper if you are so minded after you get
there berth and meals included it costs
about  to get from new york to the
pacific coast and it takes con-
siderable skirmishing to find in
san francisco los angeles or
santa barbara the kind of hotels
at which the average pleasure
seeker wishes to stop for less than
three dollars a day against this
there are many steamship lines
which will convey one from new
york to any one of a dozen
european ports with first-class
accommodation and meals for
from  to  and in europe
one can be exceedingly comfort-
able at hotels which if not ultra-
fashionable certainly correspond
to our three-dollar-a-day houses
for  to  a day

    here then is the condition which
confronts the american railroad
official and hotel-keeper it costs
less considerably less to get to
and live in england or france or
germany or switzerland or italy
than it does to visit california or
washington or oregon therein
you have the real explanation of
the popularity of europe il costs
less it is not a case of the new
york central competing with the
pennsylvania or the santa fewith
the union pacific but of thc rail-
roads of the united states com-
peting with the transatlantic steam-
ship lines for the patronage of
hundreds of thousands who are
going somewhere until those who
are responsible for the direction of
our railroads and the management
of our hotels are willing to admit
this unpleasant truth and to treat

ate almsgiving but it will not require
much of this to make the demand bak-
shish as importunate and annoying to
travelers as in egypt itself and to cause
a considerable number of natives to for-

  even in the raw new nations of

civilized america of ours in aus-

the government in the chief cities

possible to travel as much as one pleases for

a whole year in switzerland owing to the
increased cost of railway maintenance in a
mountainous country these season tickets

  any one w ho objects to being awakened at
least four times every night had however
much better stay away from russia as the
railway police for reasons best known to
themselves seize on the most ungodly hours
for the examination of passports at one in
lhe morning perhaps the door of your com-
partment w ill be unlocked from the outside
and without so much as by-your-leave a
police official the train conductor the guard
the local station masterand two gendarmes
every one belted booted flat-capped and
with a revolver the size of a small cannon
strapped outside his greatcoat come filing
in startling you awake by flashing their
dark lanterns in your eyes line for line

you arc compared with the de-
scription on your passport you are
asked a number of impertinent and
wholly irrelevant questions in gut-
tural german or indifferent french
your tickets are examined with the
same minute care that a cashier
bestows on a questionable bank
note and with a last suspicious
glance at you and your belongings
your nocturnal visitors file out as
silently as they came in and you
are left to your interrupted sleep
-until the next large station is
reached when the entire perform-
ance is repeated

   but if the russians annoy you
by night they feed you well by
day in fact i know of no country
where you get such good food and
so much of it for your money
russia as you perhaps know is
the home of the chafing-dish and
in every railway restaurant you will
find a long and shining row of them
-twenty thirty even forty per-
haps-set out on a spotless counter
it is not necessary to speak russian
to order a meal for all that you
have to do is to walk down the line
lifting the cover of each chafing-
dish until you come to something
which appeals to your sense of
sight or smell a motion to the
white-capped waiter and a plate
of the chosen dish is set before you
together with the accompanying
vegetables a glass of salted and
altogether delicious tea and a small
bottle of harsh caucasian wine-all
for fifty cents only once have i ex-
perienced any difficulty in ordering a russian
meal and that was when i asked for some
butter in a railway restaurant in astrakhan
in four languages i asked for it and each
time the stolid tartar waiter uncompre-
hendingly shook his head then i seized a
piece of bread and with a knife went through
the motions of spreading instantly ivan
nodded in understanding and disappeared
after ten minutes lie returned bearing in
triumph a platter heaped with sliced bread
each slice spread thick with caviare well
thought i consolingly caviare is doubtless
as cheap in astrakhan as butter is in amer-
ica and i might as well enjoy it but

   prosperity and tin- iianderlust go hand in
hand the tide of travel rises with national
well-being and ebbs again in lean times
he years since igoo have witnessed more
money-making throughout the world than
any others in history this same period has
seen not only the development of tourist
routes that had been merely pioneer paths
but a revolution in thc speed of transoceanic
steamships and of transcontinental trains
for always the cry is for speed speed and
yet more speed many of us marked an
epoch for ourselves when jules verne wrote
around the world in eighty days per-
haps it was not possible then to go
round the world in eighty days the
book would have been less exciting
if it had been but in any event it
was nearly possible and so eighty
days has come to convey to us in
more or less intelligible terms the
size of the world to-day how-
many of you could say offhand to
what those eighty days have been
reduced by making use of the
fastest trains and boats they can
be cut in two as easily as a butcher
halves a piece of meat while by
making close connections with
trains and steamships running
reasonably within their own best
time il is entirely possible to en-
circle the globe in thirty-eight days
and that in comfortable trains
and ships with every luxurious
accompaniment of modern travel
not by the desperate expedients
of phineas fogg

  you are no true american unless
you instantly ask how-and how-
much there are several ocean
greyhounds whose captains will
undert ake to land you at cherbourg
or havre in less than six days and
in ample time to make connections
at paris with the nord express so
that thc evening of the eighth day

  let it lie plain i do not recommend racing
round the world in six weeks yet it is
interesting to know that it can be done and
in the case of a busy man who cannot possi-
bly get away for more than a few weeks

and insists on seeing many coun-
tries even hurriedly there is some-
thing to be said for the rush around
the world to the newspaper
reader distant parts of the earth
can be little more than names and
the chief actors upon those stages
little more than shadows-until he
has seen them but let him once
see them if only for a few hours

lor the rest of his life lie fits the
facts into the frame and paints
them in the right colors

  he has spent only a day or two
in berlin erhaps but when he
reads of the spring review on the
tempelhof field he sees the coming
and going of dazzling officials and
equerries the gleaming breast-
plates and eagle-helmets and black
horses of tile garde du corps even
the stern set face and erect figure
of the war lord himself he may
have stayed only a few hours in
naples but when he reads of an
eruption of vesuvius he again sees
the grim and smoking mountain
rising above the cobalt bay he has
scant difficulty in picturing the
trailing clouds of dust and cinders
and the highways choked with
terror-stricken fugitives and he
realizes as he never did before
what such a catastrophe means to
the prosperity of southern italy
his steamer may have touched

 just for a morning at tangier but

m when he reads at the breakfast
table of the lighting in morocco
lie sees again as on a moving-picture
screen the white-walled flat-roofed houses
and the narrow lilth-strewn street the
haughty tierce-faced tribesmen and the
young french officers of the chasscurs
dafriiuc in their light blue tunics riding
insolently among them

or abroad whether we go to maine or man-
churia for a week-end r for a year whether

synopsis of preceding instalments

     all the vounf fellow  h- - for is to spend money this is thc opinion of kirk an thou v held by thc public and im
own father at thc openini of the story the son of a millionaire railway man young anthony had elected upon his
graduation from sale to remain there as football coach rather than to accept thc career his father offered him

     after great football victor- he start out with his ixxin companions for an all-night celebration in new york
restaurants through the introduction of a stranger one jefferson locke the company is involved in a fracas whiih
ends in the grave injurs- i plain-dothes man disguised as a waiter who had been following locke before dawn
locke has persuaded anthonys clones friend to help him put through as a practical joke a plan for sending kirk fl
penniless on a steamer  - panama-the point of the joke lieing to make anthony work and the point of the plot appar-
ently being to divert pursuit and suspicion from locke a  a result the next day anthony wakes u very sick and br-
wilderc i n a ship where he finds himself known as jefferson locke in the courv- of a day or two kirk meets the
cortlandt who are in thc diplomatic scrvice in panama and a friendship grows up between him and mrs cortlandt
a woman of charm and intellectual power vmr years kirk s senior when they land at colon kirk appeals to weeks
thc american consul who  abtes kirks father and takes care of him for a week but thc elder anthonys message
when it comes pronounce kirk an impostor and weeks furious throws his guest out that evening in a public park
kirk comes upon a young jamaican negro allan allan who is also homeless and the two start out together in search
food on the wav they are involved in thc cicitcl commotion of a tire and kirk impatient at the incompetence of
the firemen lakes a band in an attempt to resist interference he turns a hose on an official who it happens is the
commandant of police thereupon both kirk and allan arc arrested thrown into jail ami brutally treated the english
consul secures allan release but weeks refuses to get kirk out eventually al an reaches the cortlandts at panama
and they hasten to colon rescue kirk and carry him home as their guest shortly after he sets an unsigned letter
 vidently from his father indicating that the police authorities are looking for him and refusing all aid unless kirk can
 make a man tit himself kirk at once tells mrs cortlandt the whole situation and with the promise of her influence
decides to o to work -il the canal in the course of a tnp through thc culebra cut he learns from his guide that mr
cortlandt is a person of great political and diplomatic power in panama and that her husband is a mere figurehead a
few days later she take- kirk on a picnic to an outlying island where they are deserted by their i oat and left with no
me-siis of getting home to make matters worse at a moment of tension kirk impulsively takes mrs cortlandt in his
arms and kisses her he is instantly remorseful and pleads for her pardon as he takes her to the native house where she
is tn spend the night

c hapter xii continued

but as they trudged along together
through the dark kirks chagrin re-
turned in full force mrs cortlandt
maintained a distressing silence and he
could not see her face presently he
began to lead brokenly for forgiveness
stumbling in the effort not to offend her
further and feeling that he was making
matters worse with every word he uttered
for a long time she made no reply but
at last she said

   do you think i ought ever to see you
again after this

   suppose not said kirk miserably

 wont believe she went  that
you took me for the kind of woman who- 
no no he cried in an anguish of self-

reproach i was a fool-

   perhaps i was partly to blame she
said but  didnt think- ought to have
known that no man can really be trusted
i thought our friendship was so beautiful
and now youve spoiled it

  dont say that kirk begged youll
surely forgive me sometime

  but instead of answering him directly
she proceeded in the same strain probing
his wounded self-respect to the quick
tih human ants were work in at their iiiixs ill i- wheels were tlkmw
the jaws ip the iron hots were l lavkim-


evervl hxlys m a ga zi no

making hi offense -ecm blacker every
moment

  although he assured her over and over
lhat he had simply followed the irrespon-
sible unaccountable impulse of a moment
that he had regarded her only as the best
of friends and respected her more than he
could say site showed him no mercy the
melancholy regretful tone she adopted was
ten times worse than anger and by the
time they reached the inn where they had
dined he was sunk in the depths of self-
abasement

   if he had been less preoccupied with his
own remorse he might have reflected that
kdiths attitude especially as she did not
expressly withhold the prospect of ultimate
pardon established a closer bond between
them than ever before but there was no
room in his mind for such a thought

   ill reply to his knock an old woman came
lo the door and sleepily admitted them
edith stood for a moment on the threshold
then said good-night and quietly entering
rinsed the door behind her

  kirk experienced a sudden desire to
isoulie to remain where he was simply
prolonged his humiliation instinctively
he felt that if he could only get away where
he could view the matter in an everyday
light it would cease to trouble him hut
evidently hr could not desert edith he
-at down upon the door-step and gave him-
-elf up to bitter thoughts

  she was such a wonderful woman he
t -ld himselfshe had been such a true friend

lo	him that hr had been worse than crim-
inal to lose her rrspect and cortlandt had
been so decent to him it was significant
that this gave him the most discomfort of
all he had betrayed a mans friendship
and the thought was unbearable no
punishment could be too severe for that

  he was mill sitting there cramped and
stiff when the tlrt faint hush of dawn stole
ovrr the hill crest behind him then he
rose to wander toward the water front
as the harbor assumed definite form he
bvheld a launch stealing in toward the
village and ten minutes later greeted
stephen cortlandt as that gentleman
stepped out of the lender

  wheres kdith eagerly demanded her
husband

   shes asleep i found a place for her-

  not at the sanitarium

  no no one f thc-e houses lord

im glad to six you wed begun to feel
like real castaways  ve been up all night 
what happened ll was plain that
mr cortlandt was deeply agitated

  our boatmen evidently got drunk anil
pulled out  tried to get a sailboat but
there werent any and it was loo rough to
try crossing with a skill

  it took them but a moment to reach the
house and soon the three were back at the
water front

  what a miserable night  mrs cort-
landt complained stifling a yawn i
thought youd never come stephen

  i didnt get back to the tivoli until
midnight and then i had trouble in finding
a boat to bring me over

   suppose they were alarmed at the
hotel

   said nothing about it he returned
quietly at which his wifes face flushed
seizing thr lirsi occasion he exclaimed in a
low voice iod how unfortunate at
this lime were you mad

  she looked at him and her eyes burned
but she said nothing

  the day following their return from
taboga kirk borrowed a shotgun and
went hunting the events of that night
on the island seemed like a dream could
it be that he had really blundered irre-
trievably was it jmissible that he had
offended his best friend past forgiveness
now that he had caught up on his sleep he
wanted to get awav somewhere and collect
hi thoughts lor the present at least
he wished to avoid an interview with mr
cortlandt

  a milr or two beyond the railroad track
to the north and east began what ap-
peared to be an unbroken wilderness and
thither he turned his steps low rolling
hills lay beforr him densely overgrown
and leading upward to a mountain range
which paralleled the coast until the distant
haze swallowed it up these mountains he
reflected with a thrill of interest led on to
south america the land of the incas
hidden in mystery as the forests close at
hand were veiled in faint purple

  the very thought was romantic balboa
had strained his eyes along these self-same
the neer-du-well

placid shores pizarro the swineherd had
followed them in search of dabaiba that
tabled temple of gold leaving behind him a
trail of blood it was only yonder five
miles away that pedrarias with the murder
of a million victims on his soul had founded
the ancient city which later fell to morgans
buccaneers even now a league back from
the ocean the land seemed as wild as then
anthony suspected that there were houses
-perhaps villages-hidden from his view
but vast stretches of enchanted jungle in-
tervened which he determined to explore
letting his feet stray whither they would
if game of which he had heard great
stories fell to his hand so much the better

  heeding a warning not to bear arms
through the streets of panama without a
permit from the alcalde he struck off across
the fields in a bee-line for the woods it
was a vast relief to be out in the open air
with a gun upon his arm once more and he
felt his blood coursing vigorously the
burden upon his spirits insensibly began to
lighten after all he had done nothingfor
which he needed to be ashamed the rest of
his life edith of course was right in being
deeply offended that was to be expected
yet his conduct regrettable as it was had
been only natural under the circumstances
sow that the first tumult of feeling had
subsided he found that his conscience did
not accuse him very severely

  and somehow he was unable to believe
that the breach with edith would prove
irreparable she was a sensible woman of
the world-not a mere schoolgirl per-
haps when the immediate shock of the
occurrence had passed she would consent to
take a different view of it and they might
return to their old friendly footing if not
-he would be his own man soon anyhow
their lives would part and the incident
would be forgotten he was sorry that in
his momentary madness he had behaved
improperly toward a woman to whom he
owed so much yet it was not as if he had
shown meanness or ingratitude

  across the meadows deep in grass he
went skirting little ponds and marshy
spots growing more cheerful with every
step in one place he had the good luck to
raise a flock of waterbirds which he took
for purple gallinules and spur-wing plover
although they were unlike any he had ever
seen in some scattered groves beyond he
bagged a pigeon and missed a quail which

unexpectedly whirred out i thiclet
then he continued past herds of grazing
cattle to another patch of woodland where
he came upon something that looked like
path through rankly growing hunani
patches yam fields and groves of mango
trees he followed it penetrating ever
deeper into the rolling country until at
last he reached the real forest he had
come several miles and realized that he
could not retrace his steps for the trail
had branched many times he had crossed
other pathways and made many detours
he rejoiced in the thought that he had
successfully lost himself

  at midday he paused in an open glade
against a hillside to eat his lunch back of
him the rising ground was heavily tim-
bered beneath him a confusion of thickets
and groves and cleared fields led out to a
green plain as clean as any golf links upon
which were scattered dwellings

  evidently those were the savannas of
which he had heard so much and those
foreign-looking bungalows were the coun-
try homes of the rich panamanians be-
yond the bay stretched in unruffled calm
like a sheet of quicksilver its bosom dotted
with rocky islets while hidden in the haze
to the southward as he knew were the
historic pearl islands where the early
spaniards had enriched themselves

  gazing at this view in lazy enjoyment
kirk found himself thinking how good it
was to be young and free and to be set
down in such a splendidly romantic coun-
try above all it was good to be heart-
whole and unfettered by any womans
spell -men in love were unhappy persons
harassed by a thousand worries and in-
decisions utterly lacking in poise it was
a lamentable condition of hysteria with
which he decided to have nothing to do
he did not care for women anyhow one
could scarcely have any dealings with them
without becoming involved in some affair
that unduly harrowed ones feelings how
much better it was to know the clean spirit
of adventure and the joy of living undis-
turbed by feverish emotions

  as he reclined there busied with these
thoughts two vivid little paroquets alighted
near him to quarrel noisily then make up
and kiss each other like any pair of lovers
it was disgusting a toucan peered at
him with a look of exaggerated curiosity
due to its huge grotesquely proportioned
what do you want here r iried the xeorbss menacingly she had thrust
her i hare behind her and now pierced him with her eyes

beak now and then came the harsh
notes of parrots as they fluttered high
above the tree tops meanwhile the young
mans ears became attuned to the jungle
noises his eye observant of the many kinds
of life about him

  the wood was crowded with plant life
utterly strange to him on the hill above
towered a giant ceiba tree its trunk as
smooth as if polished by hand and bare of
branches except at the very top where in-
stead of tapering it ended abruptly in a
tuft of foliage here and there stood tre-
mendous cotton trees their limbs so bur-
dened with air-plants as to form a series
of aerial gardens their twigs bearing pods
filled with down beside them palm trees
raised their heads heavy with clusters of
nuts resembling dates in size and form but
fit only for wild pigs clumps of bamboo
were scattered about their shoots spring-
ing from a common center like the streams
from a fountain and sweeping through
graceful curves to a spray of shimmering
green he had never seen such varieties
of growth there were thick trees with
bulbous swellings tall trees with but-
tressed roots that ran high up the trunks
slender trees propped up head high above
the earth on tripod-like roots or clusters of
legs trees with bark that shone like a
mirror trees guarded with an impregnable
armor of six-inch bony spikes-kirk did
not know the names of half of them nor
did he care to learn

  vines and creepers abounded from the
tiny honeysuckle that reared itself with
feeble filaments to the giant liana creeping
through the forest like a python throttling
full-grown trees in its embrace on every
side was the never-ceasing battle for light
and the struggle of the weak against the
strong the air was heavy with the breath
of triumphant blooms and the odor of de-
feated decaying life a thousand voiceless
tragedies were being enacted the wood
was peopled by distorted shapes that spoke
of forgotten encounters rich riotous
parasitic growths flourished upon starved
limbs or rotting trunks it was weird and
beautiful and pitiless unlike the peaceful
order of our northern forests here was a
savage riot an unending treacherous war-
fare without light or room or mercy

  tiring of the scene at last kirk con-
tinued his wanderings bearing gradually
toward the right that he might eventually

emerge upon the savannas below where
he knew there was a good paved road lead-
ing to the city but the trails were devious
and seemed to lead nowhere so at last he
struck out through the jungle itself hav-
ing no machete with which to clear a way
his progress was slow but he took his time
keeping a wary outlook for game twsting
back and forth to avoid the densest thick-
ets until he finally came out upon the mar-
gin of a stream through the verdure be-
yond it he saw the open sunlit meadows
and he followed the bank in the hope of
finding a foot log or a bridge upon which to
cross he had gone perhaps a hundred
yards when he stumbled out into a cleared
space where he paused with an exclama-
tion of surprise

  the brook had been dammed and wid-
ened into a deep limpid pool to which
the clean white sand of the bottom lent
a golden hue at the lower end it over-
flowed in a waterfall whose purling music
filled the glade overhead the great trees
were arched together and interlaced their
lower branches set with flowering orchids
like hothouse plants upon a window ledge
the dense foliage allowed only a random
beam of sunlight to pass through and pierce
the pool like a brilliant quivering javelin
long vines depended from the limbs above
falling sheer and straight as plumb-lines a
giant liana the size of a mans body twined
up and up until lost in the tangle over-
head

  although set just w ithin the border of the
untouched forest it was evident that this
spot had been carefully cut away and art-
fully cultivated it could be seen that no
human artist had designed the wondrous
stage effect but mans hand had aided
nature by a few deft touches here and there
and a careful pruning of her lavish riches
to step suddenly out of an uncut wilderness
into such a scene as this was bew ildering and
made the american gasp with delight the
place had an air of strictest privacy a
springboard mirrored in the depths below-
invited one to plunge a pair of iron gym-
nasium rings was swung by chains to a
massive limb a flight of stone steps led up
the bank and into a hut artistically t hatched
and walled with palm leaves to harmonize
with its setting kirk thanked his fortune
that he had not blundered in while the place
w-as in use for it had almost the sacred air
of a ladys boudoir
everybodys magazine

  instead of promptly withdrawing he al-
lowed his admiration full plav and stood
staring for a long time what a delightful
nook in which to dream away thc days it
was dim and cool and still although outside
its walls of green the afternoon sun was
beating down fiercely a stranger might
pass and never guess its presence it had
been cunningly shaped by fairies that was
evident doubtless it was peopled by them
also and his mistake had been in coming
upon it so suddenly if he had approached
with caution he would surely have sur-
prised them at their play for yonder was
the music of their dances-that chuckling
singing waterfall could serve no other pur-
pose perhaps a fairy was hidden under it
now kirk was half tempted to conceal
himself and wait for it to reappear though
he knew that extraordinary cunning is re-
quired to deceive wood sprites once they
have been alarmed but undoubtedly they
were somewhere close by probably watching
him from behind the leaves and if they
were not such timid creatures he might try
to search them out

  as it was he took a lingering farewell
look and turned to retrace his steps-where-
upon the queen fairy laughed at him softly
he paused abruptly then turned around
with care so as not to frighten her but of
course she was invisible then she spoke
again with the sweetest foreign accent
imaginable

   you had better cross upon the waterfall
sir there is no bridge above after an
instant during which he strained his eyes
to find her she laughed again

  here i am in the tree across the pond
oh looking at him over the fork of
a tree trunk perhaps twice the height of
his head above the ground anthony behold
a ravishing face and two very bright eyes
without removing his gaze he leaned his
gun carefully against a bush-firearms
have an abominable effect upon hama-
dryads-and said

  i knew you were here all the time

   indeed  the eyes opened in astonish-
ment you did not see me at all

  of course but i knew you were some-
where close by just the same how did you
get up there

  i climbed up

  why didnt you hide under the waterfall
i did not hide sefior i am trying to
reach my orchid

  a little hand appeared beside thc face
and a finger pointed to one of the big air-
plants above kirk beheld a marvelous
white dove-shaped flower nodding upon a
slender stalk

  i climbed up on the big vine it is just
like a ladder

  then you cant be the queen

  two very large very dark eyes looked at
him qucstioningly

  queens dont pick flowers he explained
they hide in em

  the queen

  some of them live in trees and some
preside over lakes and fountains which
kind are you

  oh i am neither i live in my fathers
house she tossed her head in the direc-
tion of the savannas behind her  do you
wish to cross the stream

  if you please

  wait the face disappeared there
was a sound from bellind the twisted tree
trunk a twig fell then a piece of bark and
thc next instant the girl herself stepped into
view

  i was afraid youd gone for good
acknowledged the young man gravely he
took up his gun and stepped out upon the
crest of the dam

  you must look where you go she ad-
monished or you will fall-splash she
laughed delightedly at the thought and he
saw that her eyes had a way of wrinkling
almost shut in the merriest fashion he bal-
anced upon the slippery surface of the water-
way with the stream up to his ankles

  will you promise not to whisk yourself
away if i look down he asked

  yes

  but even with this assurance he found it
difficult to remove his eyes from her dur-
ing the brief instants necessary for a safe
passage and when at last he stood beside
her he felt an irresistible desire to seize her
gently so that she could not escape

  well she said at length and he found
he had been standing stock-still staring at
her for several seconds

   excuse me i really took you for a wood
nymph im not sure yet-you see the
place is so well suited it-it was a natural
mistake

  she dropped her eyes shyly and turned
away at his look

  it is only our swimming-pool there
have been no fairies here since i was a very
the neer-do-well



little girl but oncc upon a time there were
many-oh a great many it is impossible
to describe the odd sweet sound her tongue
gave to the english words it was not a
dialect hardly an accent just a delicious
hesitating mannerism born of unfamiliarity

  did you ever see them

  n-no  arrived always a little too late
but there are such things

  he nodded everybody knows that
since peter pan

  another shy glance told her that he was
still regarding her with his look of wondering
admiration she pointed to a path saying
this way will bring you to the road sir
if you wish

  but - i dont wish - nut yet he
sought wildly for an excuse to stay and
exclaimed oh the orchid i must get it
for you

  that will be very nice of you sir for
two years i have awaited its blooming if
you had not arrived i would have got it
anyhow

  girls shouldnt climb trees he said
severely tt tears their dresses

  oh one cannot tear a dress like this
she glanced down at her skirt allowing
his eyes to leave her face for a moment
kirk saw that she was clad oddly enough
in a suit of blue denim which was buttoned
snugly clear to her neck it struck him as
most inappropriate yet it was extremely
well made and he could not complain of the
effect

  he broke his gun and removed the shells
then leaving it beside the bath house went
to the tree where he had first seen her with
one hand resting upon the trunk he turned
to say

  promise you wont disappear while im
tip there nor change into a squirrel or a
bird or anything like that

  what a fonny man you are

  do you promise

  yes yes

  do you live around here

  of course

  why do you want this orchid

  to put it in the house

  instead of beginning his climb the young
man lounged idly against the tree

  funny how i found you wasnt it he
remarked i mean its funny i should
have stumbled right on you this wav-
theres only one of you and one of me and
er-this country is so big i might have

gone some other way and then perhaps wed
never have met he contemplated this
contingency for an instant and if you
hadnt spoken id never have seen you
either

  but i had to speak you could not
cross above

  awfully nice of you some people
would have let me go away

  but the orchid scflor do you fear to
climb so high she inquired with the faint-
est gleam of amusement at his obvious effort
to prolong the conversation

  oh no

  he cast about for something further to
talk about but failing to find it began
slowly to clamber upward supporting him-
self upon the natural steps afforded by the
twining vine and the protuberances of the
trunk itself

  when he had reached the first fork he
turned and seated himself comfortably
peering downward through the leaves for a
sight of her  not gone yet  he exclaimed
thats good

  are you out of breath that you stop so
soon

  he nodded i need to rest a minute
say my name is anthony-kirk anthony
then after a pause im an american

  so am i-at least i am almost my
mother was an american

   you dont say the young mans face
lighted up with interest and he started
eagerly down the tree trunk but she checked
him promptly

  the orchid

  ohyes he reseated himself well
well  suppose your mother taught you to
speak english

  i also attended school in baltimore

  anthony dangled his legs from his perch
and brushed aside a troublesome prickly pod
that depended in such a position as to tickle
his neck im from yale ever been to
new haven what are you laughing at

  at you do you know what it is which
you are fighting from your neck

  this kirk succeeded in locating the
nettle that had annoyed him

  yes it is row-eetch wait by and
by you will scratch like everything the
young lady laughed with the most mis-
chievous elf-like enjoyment of this prospect

  all right just for that i will wait

  now that the first surprise of meeting was
over kirk began a really attentive scrutiny
everybodys magazine

of this delightful young person so far lie
had been conscious of little except her eyes
which had exercised a most remarkable
effect upon him from the first he had
never cared for black eyes -they were too
hard and sparkling as a rule but these-
well he had never seen anything quite like
them they were large and soft and vel-
vety like like black pansies that was
precisely what they were- saucy wide-
awake black pansies the most beautiful
llower in all creation and while they were
shadowed by the intangible melancholy of
the tropics they were also capable of twin-
kling in the most roguish manner imagi-
nable as at the present moment her black
hair was soft and line entirely free from the
harsh luster so common to that color and
it grew down upon her temples in a way that
completed the perfect oval of her face his
first glimpse had told him she was ravish-
iigly pretty but it had failed to show how
dainty and small she was he saw now
that she was considerably below the usual
height but so perfectly proportioned that
one utterly lost perspective even her
thick coarse dress could not conceal the ex-
quisite mold in which she was cast hut
h r chief charm lay in a certain winsome
vivacity a willful waywardness an ever-
changing expression which showed her
keenly alive even now pure mischief
looked out of her eyes as she asked

   have you rested enough t attack the
orchid

   	yes he roused himself from hi- trance
and with a strangely leaping heart proceeded
carefully to detach the big air-plant from its
resting place the wonderful flower nod-
ding to his louch was no more perfect than
this dryad whom he had surprised

   dont break it she cautioned as he
came gingerly down the tree it is what
we call e-piritu santo the holy spirit
llower see il is like a white bird

   first one ive seen he said noting how
the purity of the bloom enhanced the olive
of her cheek then he began another fruit-
less search for a topic of conversation fear-
ing that if he allowed the slightest pause she
would send him away hut all his thoughts
were of her it seemed his tongue would
frame nothing but eager questions-all
about herself at last in desperation he
volunteered to get another orchid but the
suggestion met with no approval there
w re no more she told him of that kind

   maybe we can find one he said hope-
fully

  thank you  know them all she
was looking at him now as if wondering why
he did not make a start but wild horses
could not have dragged him away in-
stead of picking up his gun he inquired
may i rest a moment im awfully tired
certainly you may stay so long as
you wish when you are rested the little
path will bring you out

but you mustnt go he exclaimed in
a panic as she turned away oh  say
please you wouldnt do a thing like that
 i cannot speak to you this way sir
the young lady blushed prettily

  why not id like to know

   h  she raised her hand and shook her
head to express the absolute impossibility
of such a thing already i have been
terrible what will stephanie say

  youve been nothing of the sort and
who is stephanie

  she is a big black woman-very fierce
it is because of stephanie that the fairies
have gone away from here

  ii we wait a minute maybe theyll come
out

  xo i have waited many times and i
never saw them

  somehow i feel sure well see em this
time he urged then as she shook her
head doubtfully good heavens dont
you waul to see v  im so tired that i
must sit down

  the corners of her eyes wrinkled as she
said you are not very strong sefior have
you been ill

  yes--no not exactly he led her to
a bamboo bench beside the palm hut  ive
been hunting now wont you please tell
me how you chanced to be here i thought
these country places were unoccupied at
this season

  so they arc but you see i am doing
a penance

  penance you

  oh yes and it is nothing to laugh
about either she chided as he smiled in-
credulously i am a bad girl  am dis-
obedient otherwise i would not allow you
to speak to me alone like this you are the
first gentleman  have ever been so long in
the company with senor antonio
really

   now i will have to do more penance
she sighed sadly but her eyes were dancing
the neer-do-well



 i dont understand this penance affair
 what do you do 

 she lifted a fold of her coarse denim dress
 for six months  must wear these gar-
 ments-no pretty ones  must not go out
 in public also and  have been sent here
 away from the city for a time to cure my
 rebellious spirit

 those dresses must be hot

 oh very uncomfortable but you see
 i was bad

 not very bad

 indeed i disobeyed my father my
 oncle everybody for the first time her
 eyes grew bright with anger  but  did
 not wish to be married

 now i see they wanted you to marry
 some fellow you dont like

 i do like him-

 you did exactly right to refuse by all

 means stand pat and dont-

 stand pat i have not heard that
 word since i was in baltimore

 its awful to marry somebody you dont
 like he declared with such earnest con-
 viction that she inquired quickly

 ah then are you married

 no but everybody says its positively
 criminal to marry without love

 the gentleman is very handsome

 he shuddered  beware of handsome
 men if you have any idea of marriage
 select a large plain-featured man with blue
 eyes and light hair

  do not know such a person

 not yet of course that is not well
 enough to marry him

 it is not nice to speak of such things
 said the young lady primly  anri it is not
 nice also to speak with strange gentlemen
 who come out of the forest when one is
 doing penance but  am a half-american
 you know perhaps that is what makes me
 so bad

 will you catch it for talking to me
 oh yes it is not allowed it is most
 improper

 then i suppose id better leave an-
 thony settled himself more comfortably
 upon the bench  and yet there is nothing
 really wrong about it is there why its
 done every day in my country besides
 whos going to know

 the padre i tell him everything

  you girls down here have a pretty tough
 time of it-you are guarded pretty closely
 arent you

  she gave him a puzzled look

    mean you dont have any liberty you
dont go out alone or let fellows take you to
lunch or to the matinees or anything like
that

  evidently the mere mention of such
things was shocking oh seftor she
tried incredulously such terrible actions
cannot be permitted even in your country
it is awful to think of

  nonsense its done every day
here il would not do at all ones
people know best about such things one
must be careful at all times but you
americans are so wicked

  how does a fellow ever get acquainted
with a girl down here how does he get a
chance to propose

  but this frank questioning on so sacred a
topic was a little more than the young lady
was prepared to meet and for the moment
confusion held her tongue-tied

  ones people attend to that of course
she managed to say at length then changed
the subject quickly

  do you live in panama she asked

   yes i work on the railroad or will in
a few days

  you are so young for such authority
it must be very difficult to manage rail-
roads

  well-i wont have to run thc whole
works-at first im beginning gradually
you know-one train at a time

  that will be easier of course what
did you say is your whole name

  kirk anthony

  keerk it has a fonny sound has it
not

  i never noticed it and yours

  do you speak spanish she regarded
him curiously

  not a word

  my name is chiquita

  he repeated it after her its pretty
what is your last name

that is it if i told you my first name
you could not use it  il would not be proper
it ought to be something like ariel
that means spirit of the air and water 
believe ariel chiquita no they dont
go together what are you laughing at
to see you scratch your neck
anthony became conscious of a growing
sensation where the strange pod had tan-
gled against his skin and realized that hi-
had been rubbing the spot for some time
e very bod ys m agazine

   you did nol know il was the cow-net tie
eh

    you enjoy seeing me suffer he said
patiently

    you do not suffer she retorted mimick-
ing his tone you only eetch you wish
me to sympathize

   see here miss chiquita may i call on
you

  oh she lifted her brows in amaze-
ment such ideas of a certainly not

  why

  you do not understand our young
men do not do those things

  then i it do whatever is customary-
really i will but-i m awfully anxious to see
you again-and-

  i do not know you my father--

   ill look xip mr chiquita and be in-
troduced

   at this the young lady began to rock back
and forth in an abandon of merriment the
idea it seemed was too utterly ridiculous
for words her silvery laughter tilled the
glade

   no no she said finally it is im-
possible besides i am doing penance i
can see no one in the city i cannot even
sit upon the balcony she fetched a pal-
pably counterfeit sigh which ended in a
titter

  never had kirk beheld such a quaintly
mischievous such a madly tantalizing
creature

   say youre not really going to marry
that fellow he exclaimed with consider-
able fervor

   she shrugged her shoulders wearily i
suppose so one cannot forever say no
and there are many reasons-

   oh thats the limit youll go nutty
married to a chap you dont care for

  but  am naughty now

  not naughty-nutty youll be per-
fectly miserable there ought to be a law
against it let me call and talk it over at
least i know all about marriage ive
been around so many married people
promise

    i cannot let you call as you say be-
sides for two weeks yet i must remain here
alone with stephanie she regarded him
mournfully every day i must do my
penance and think of my sins and-perhaps
look for orchids

   he saw the light that flickered in the
depths of her velvet eyes and his heart

pounded violently at the unspoken invi-
tation

  to-morrow he inquired breathlessly
 do you intend to hunt orchids to-morrow
instead of answering she started to her
feet with a little cry and he did likewise
back of them had sounded an exclamation
-it was more like the snort of a wild ani-
mal than a spoken word -and there ten
feet away stood a tall copper-colored
negress her eyes blazing her nostrils di-
lated a look of utmost fury upon her face
she was fully as tall as kirk gaunt hook-
nosed and ferocious about her head was
bound a gaudy barbadian headdress that
increased the wildness of her appearance

  stephanie exclaimed the girl you
frightened me

   the negress strode to her speaking rap-
idly in spanish then turned sharply upon
kirk

  what do you want here she cried
menacingly she had thrust her charge be-
hind her and now pierced him with her eyes

  miss chiquita- he began at which

that young lady broke into another peal of
silvery laughter and chattered to her ser-
vant but her words instead of placating
the black woman only added to her fury
she pointed with quivering hand to the path
along the stream bank and cried

   go go quick you man  then to her
charge  you bad bad go to the house

  miss chiquita hasnt dune anything to
make you huffy i came out of the woods
yonder and she was good enough to direct
me to the road

  but stephanie was not to be appealed
she stamped her flat foot and repeated her
command in so savage a tone that kirk per-
ceived the uselessness of trying to explain
he looked appealingly at the girl but she
merely nodded her head and mot ed him
to be gone

   very well he said regrety  thank
you for your assistance miss chiquita
he bowed to the little figure in hue with
his best manner and fart  tr -
way out no crowd  -
adits seftor anti came   - -
mischievous voice and a h tr je down
the path he carried with him the memory
of a perfect oval face smilir at him past
the tragic figure ot the bajan woman he
went blindly scarcely aware of the sun-
mottled trail his feet were following for his
wits were aflutter and his heart was leaping
the neer-do-well



in some strange intoxication that grew with
every instant

  it threatened to suffuse him choke him
rob him of his senses he wanted to cry out
her name was chiquita he repeated it
over and over in time to his steps was
there ever such a beautiful name was
there ever such a ravishing little wood
sprite and her sweet hesitating accent
that rang in his ears how could human
tongue make such caressing music of the
harshest language on the globe she had
called him sefior antonio and invited
him to come again to-morrow would he
come he doubted his ability to wait so
long knowing that she agreed to the
tryst no power on earth could deter him

  what a day it had been he had started
out in the morning vaguely hoping to divert
his mind with some of those trite little hap-
penings that for lack of a better term we
rail adventures in this humdrum world
and then with the miraculous unbelievable
luck of youth he had stumbled plump into
the middle of the most wondrous adventure
it was possible to conceive and yet this
wasnt adventure after all-il was some-
thing bigger finer more precious with a
suddenness that was blinding he realized
that he was in love yes that was it be-
yond the shadow of a doubt this mischief-
ridden foreign-born little creature was the
one and only woman in the world for whom
the fates had made him

  that evening he sat for a long time alone
 the gallery of his hotel his spirit up-
lifted with the joy of it a thousand whisper-
ing voices in his ears and when at last he
fell asleep it was to dream of an olive oval
face with eyes like black pansies

chapter niy

llll path thai - nowhere

  when sefior antonio awoke the next
morning he lay for an instant striving to
recall what it was that had haunted his
sleeping hours what great event awaited
him then as it rushed through his mind
he leaped out of bed and dashed headlong
into the bath room this was to-morrow
it had been ages in coming-he recalled
luw even his slumbers had dragged -but
it was here at last and he would see miss
chiquita

he sang as he stepped under his shower

and whistled blithely as he dressed him-
self what a glorious country this panama
was anyhow how good it was to b
young and to be in love he never had been
so happy a man must surely be in love
to sing before breakfast hut the after-
noon was still a long way it and he must
be content to dream until the hour came

  he was too early for the cortlandts s
he breakfasted alone when he strolled
out upon the veranda for his smoke he
found allan waiting for him as usual
the jamaican had not missed a morning
so far and it was only by a show of down-
right firmness that kirk had been able
get rid of him at any time during the day
the black boy seemed bent upon devoting
every waking hour to his hero and now
finding himself regarded with friendly eves
he expanded joyously

  got you some games yesterday he
inquired

  yes and im going again to-dav

   plenty games over yonder is but it is
very fatiguing to get them to-day i go
along for showing you the way

  not a bit like it im going alone

last man i hunted with-killed him kiri
stared tragically at his companion but
allan was not to be so easily deterred

  i shall pahss behind you boss

im too careless

hanimals they are sleeping walk they
everybodys magazine

in the hcarly morning for the most part
very quietly

  thats true of some wood creatures
but the kind  hunt dance along the edges
of pools in the afternoon say did you
ever feel like dancing

  no sar

  come around on the back porch and
ill teach you a buck-step i feel too good
to sit still

  but allan refused this proffer firmly
such frivolous conduct was beneath his
dignity i ave himportant things to
disclose he said mysteriously

   indeed

  yes sar lahst night i dreamed
youve got nothing on me so did i
i was walking on the hedge of the
hocean when i hencountered a whale-
a uge dead whale it was very vivid
well what has a vivid dead whale to
do with me

  this allan brought forth a sheet of
paper which he unfolded carefully there
is the number-the tish number sar
he pointed at it triumphantly

  why this is a chinese lottery adver-
tisement

  i got it for the very purpose it would
pay us to hinvest some money on the fish
number 

  nonsense i dont believe in dreams
you say yourself they are false besides
ive got no money

  allan folded the paper disconsolately and
thrust it into his pocket it is fartunate
hindeed said he that you will be work-
ing soon master hauntony and those
p r r was very fartunate also for getting
you to haccept a position very fartunate
hindeed

ing you now for an hengagement as brakes-

negro calmly i should like to see those

  well i can see trouble ahead for one
of us laughed anthony they dont
allow deadheads

  but allan replied with unshaken con-
fidence then you should secure for me a
pahss

  kirk found it extremely difficult to es-
cape from his persistent shadow that after-
noon and he succeeded only after a display
of armed resistance it was the hottest
part of the day when he set out gun on
arm yet he did not think of the discom-
fort after skirting the city he swung into
the fine macadam road that had brought
him home the night before and much
sooner than he expected he arrived at the
little path that led into the forest he
knew that he was trespassing again and
the knowledge added to his delight as
quickly as possible he lost himself in the
grateful shade and followed the stream
bank with beating heart he determined
to make his love known without delay and
establish himself as a regular suitor

  as upon the previous day he broke into
the glade before he suspected its presence
to find the same golden light-bc-ams flicker-
ing in the shadowed depths and to hear
the little waterfall chuckling at his sur-
prise there was the tree from which she
had called to him yonder the bench where
they had sat together

  of course he was too early-he wanted
to be in order not to miss an instant of her
company-so he seated himself and dreamed
about her the minutes dragged the
jungle drowsed an hour passed a
thousand fresh earthy odors breathed
around him and he began to see all sorts
of flowers hidden away in unsuspected
places from the sunlit meadows outside
came a sound of grazing herds the deep
woods faintly echoed the harsh calls of
tropic birds but at the pool itself a sleepy
silence brooded

  once a chattering squirrel came bravely
rustling through the branches to the very
edge of the enchanted bower but he only
sat and stared a moment in seeming ad-
thc neer-do-well

miration then retreated quietly a yel-
low-beaked toucan in a flash of red and
black and gold settled upon a mirrored
limb but it too stilled its raucous tongue
and flitted away on noiseless pinions as if
thc naiads were asleep

  in the moist earth beside the bench
anthony saw the print of a dainty boot no
longer than his palm and he promptly fell
into a rhapsody what tiny hands and
feet she had to be sure and such a sweetly
melancholy face yet she was anything but
grave and gloomy why the sunlight
dancing on that waterfall was no more
mischievous and merry than she the
slight suggestion of sadness she conveyed
was but the shadow of the tropic mystery
or thc afterglow of the tragedy that had
played so large a part in this countrys his-
tory the fact that she was half american
perhaps accounted for her daring yet
whatever the other strain it could not be
ignoble mrs cortlandts figure of the
silver threads in a rotting altar-cloth re-
curred to him with peculiar force

  but why didnt she come a sudden
apprehension overtook him which grew
and grew as the afternoon wore away

  it was a very miserable young man who
wandered out through the fragrant path
as the first evening shadows settled and
bent his dejected steps toward thc city
evidently something had occurred to pre-
vent her keeping the tryst but he deter-
mined to return on the morrow and then
it she did not come to follow the path
that led to the house where he would
risk everything for a word with her he
wondered if she had stayed away purposely
to test him and the thought gave him a
thrill if so she would soon learn that he
was in earnest she would find him waiting
there every afternoon and-after all why
confine himself to the afternoons when she
was just as likely to appear in the morning
he resolved to go hunting earlier here-
after and give the whole day to it mean-
while he would make cautious inquiries

  it was considerably after dark when he
reached the hotel and his friends had
dined but he encountered mr cortlandt
later if ediths husband suspected any-
thing of what had occurred two nights
before his countenance gave no sign of it

i or some reason or other kirk had not
been troubled in the slightest by the
the next instalment of the necr-do

 thought that cortlandt might be told he
 could not imagine ediths making him the
 confidant of her outraged feelings be-
 sides would such a strangely impassive
 person resent any little indiscretion in
 which his wife might choose to indulge
 kirk did not know -the man was a puzzle
 to him cortlandts voice was thoroughly
 noncommital as he inquired where
 have you been keeping yourself

   ive been hunting to kill time
   any luck

   no none at all i started too late 
 guess

   by the way continued the other
 your friend allan has been besieging
 edith imploring her to use her hinfluence
 to get him a position he has set his heart
 upon going to work with you

   he is becoming a positive nuisance i
 cant get rid of him

   i never saw such hero-worship

   oh all niggers are hysterical

   let me give you a bit of advice an-
 thony remember there are no niggers
 and whites in this country-they are
 about equal the president of the republic
 is a black man and a very good one too
  that reminds me i hear he is to be suc-
 ceeded by the father of my friend alfarez
 cortlandt hesitated general alfarez
 is a candidate he is a very strong man
 but it isnt settled by any means thc
 successful candidate will need the support
 of our government

   i suppose the alfarez family is one of
 the first settlers-mayflower stock
 oh worse than that the name runs
 back to balboas time general alfarez
 is very rich and very proud of his ancestry
 that is one thing that makes him so strong
 with the people

   what are some of the other leading
 families kirk artfully inquired

   there arc a number the moras the
 garavels-i couldnt name them all they
 are very fine people too

   do you know thc chiquitas
 cortlandts face relaxed in an involun-
 tary smile there is no such family
 who has been teaching you spanish
 really isnt there

   chiquita means very small little
 one little girl or something like that
 its not a family name its a term of en
 dearmcnt usually

 nhe passing of
 the idle rich

by frederick townsend martin

pjitrtri nntp r arlt t been  thoughtful observer of conditions outside of os
well as within the doss of which he specially writes the prime value of his
material in these articles lies in his revelation of what is going on in the homes and in the dubs
and in the minds of the rich lie tells us that friends of his are reading socialistic books
and magazines sending their children to the public schools discussing the great movements in
social industrial and politieal life the rapid growth of american industry and ameri-
can idleness side by side the one in large measure a direct result of the other is presented from
a point of view that will help to interpret the very rich to all of us

ci i a i t j r  c o n tix u e d

i remember very well the first greit
inarch of the suddenly rich upon the
social capitals of the nation of those
who had gathered from the mines of cali-
fornia from the forges of pittsburg from the
forests of michigan from the metaled moun-
tains of montana wealth beyond i he dreams
of midas they had capitalized the prod-
ucts of their own labor and brought with
them the tangible evidences of wealth in
the shape of stocks and bonds

  very distinctly it comes back to me with
what a shock the fact struck the sons and
daughters of what was pleased to call itself
the aristocracy of america that here inarched
an army better provisioned better armed
with wealth than any other army that had
ever assaulted the citadels of society

  the effect of these migrations from the
fields of labor to the cities of capital i shall
sketch more fully in another chapter 
would now instead touch upon the condi-
tions that they left behind them the con-
ditions that made possible their own retire-
ment from actual labor to the ease and
comfort of luxurious leisure

  it is not loo much to say that they left
behind them a people reduced to industrial
slavery gone forever was the free america
our fathers knew faded into history was
the ideal of washington and jefferson and
lincoln from the year s onward the
progress of the united slates has been the
fearful march of manufacturing industry
in that year the products of industry and
of agriculture were about equal ten years
the passing of the idle rich

later the products of industry were two to
one against the wealth gathered from the
fields

  side by side with this conquest of amer-
ica went the growth of tenant farming as
against the old free-lenure farming that
had marched steadily into the farthest un-
tilled corners of the land so long as land
was free to-day there is no free land
within the borders of the nation save for a
few small tracts hardly worth mentioning
here as in the industries capital did not
hesitate to claim and capture all that it
dared law after law was passed to pre-
vent the centralization of the power of ex-
ploiters over great tracts of the west law
after law was broken evaded or laughed
at once the spirit of exploitation on a
large scale was abroad in the land nothing
could stand against it

  in the days of individual effort exploi-
tation of labor was not possible for men
shied off from the chains of the exploiter
took to the boundless free fields of the
west and declared that they would dwell
in freedom or they would die

  hut in the census of  it is shown
clearly that the average employee in this
country produces aery year   wealth
after full allowance for the cost of the
material he works with and all possible
running expenses that are paid by his em-
ployer out of this amount of wealth he
gets  the remainder  goes into
the hands of other men-the capitalist or the
exploiter of labor

  that money nearly two thirds of the
wealth produced by the men who labor
with their hands and heads goes to pay
interest and dividends on the securities
that represent the increment gathered by
those who sold out in other days or who
capitalized their plants and settled down
to draw their sustenance from the labor ot
other men hence the idle rich

tile handwriting on the wall

  turn back to the industrial history of the
second half of the nineteenth century and
you can trace this development in the very
statistics of industry for the idle rich are
but the outcome of our industrial evolution
and the same mighty forces that gave us a
golden age of american prosperity gave
us also the idle rich and the slaves of
industry

  by the end of that period the handwriting
on t he wall was plainly visible for instance
in s there were in this country  cot-
ton manufacturing plants with a combined
gross output of so worth of goods
each plant made  worth of goods
twenty years later the number of plants
was  and the output was si 
each plant made  worth of goods

the seeds ok revolution

  our fathers saw these figures but it is
not on record that an man at that time
saw their true meaning it was simply to
their minds the working out of the factory
system lo its completion it meant econ-
omy it was part of the same system that
had reduced the cost of making a yard ot
broadcloth from fifty cents in s to fif-
teen cents in 

  they could not naturally see in it aa
we can the seeds of a revolution that was
to make over again the america of that
day to drag the boasted freedom of amer-
ica in the mire of poverty to prostitute
our political system to tear and wreck
and sweep away the sacred barriers of
society

  i have compiled a table from the census
reports dealing with textile industries
alone because that branch of manufac-
turing was the oldest and one of the great-
est as it is to-day and because it illus-
trates perhaps belter than any other the
progress of principles rather than the influ-
ence of special causes particularly through
this twenty-year period of which i am
writing

  in these few figures all the industrial
history of that great period may be found
epitomized the number of plants in-
stead of increasing as the volume of demand
for products increased was contracted
the leadership of the trade and therefore
the making of prices was taken by the
houses of larger capital the average capi-
tal employed in the trade doubled in the
twenty years the output also doubled
for the average factory the number of
employees on the other hand increased
everybodys magazine

but half better machinery more efficient
control over the workers more drastic
mduslriil discipline fiercer industrial com-
petition for individual work did their des-
tiny-appointed task

  here one begins to see on this broad can-
vas but faint in outline the tracing of the
picture of america to-day the chains
began to tighten men who had grown to
comfortable wealth in the long period of
small factories scattered industries and
free-and-easy industrial democracy began
to gather together into industrial groups
little industries were rolled together into
big industries the capital of the factory
expanded doubling on an average in thc
decade at thc same time by more intense
methods of carrying on the trades the
number of employees needed to produce a
given value of products was cut down

  let me turn for a moment to introduce
a slight record of that industry which has
done more perhaps than any other to
bring about the creation of the class of
which  write-the idle rich i have not
dwelt upon it in the beginnings of american
industry for it was scarcely existent i
refer to the iron and steel industry

  in s there were in this country only
 plants manufacturing wrought forged
and rolled iron they used an average of
soco of capital apiece produced prod-
ucts worth  each and employed
an average of  men in s-twenty
years later-there were  iron and steel
plants-including blast furnaces and rolling
mills-with an average capital of 
average products of  and an average
roll of  men here the evolution of an
industry from the small scattered plants
to the concentrated efficient and powerful
combine is unmistakable in this twen-
ty-year period the value of products treb-
led while the average number of workers
more than doubled the wealth-producing
capacity of each worker increased from
 to 

  if the tendency toward monopoly was
striking in the twenty years from  to
 what may one say of the twenty
years that followed in the iron and steel
trade thc  plants of s with an aver-
age production of  each became
 with an average production of -
 in  the average number of em-
ployees per plant rose from  to 
in the cotton mills the average number of

employees in each mill rose during the
same period from s to s

  here is the birthplace of the idle rich
hundreds of men who had owned small
manufacturing plants sold them out at
good profits in the first ten years of this
era and retired to live on the proceeds
the firm gave way to the corporation
industries that had been for generations
family affairs were suddenly capitalized in
the form of stocks and bonds and the own-
ers retired from the active business hiring
skilled men to carry on the work they
themselves sat down in ease and luxury
to live upon interest and dividends on the
securities that represented the plants

  i do not mean to say that even now by
any means all of the dividends and interest
are gat hered by the idle rich such a condi-
tion as that can exist but once in the history
of a nation il came about in rome-and
it led to thc fall it came about in france
-and it led to theterror here in america

il	has gone far to be sure and the tendency
is onward but it has not yet reached a point
where one may say to-morrow the har-
vest is ripe

chapter iv

who are the slaves

  for thirty years since ss we have
been piling up wealth in the hands of men
who do not work in almost every year
there has been pouring from our mills a
steady grist of idlers it has gone so far
that to-day in every city of the union thc
class of the idle rich has reached pro-
portions that to the thoughtful student
of events are alarming

  i do not desire to criticise wealth for 
am not a socialist and i entertain no uto-
pian dreams concerning the equal distribu-
tion of wealth among the people or the pub-
lic control of all sources of wealth i agree
thoroughly with mr carnegie and with
much older economists in the opinion that
any arbitrary distribution of wealth or
any arbitrary assignment of thc sources
of wealth would be but temporary and
would be followed by another period of ad-
justment which would end with the reap-
propriation of wealth and the reassignment
of the sources of wealth into the hands best
qualified by nature to hold them i take
it to be proven by the experience of the
the passing of the idle rich



world that individual exploitation of the
sources of wealth remains as the estab-
lished basis of the industrial commercial
and social development of the world

   vet i confess the terriiic sweep of indus-
trialism across this land throughout the
past half century appalls me as  study it
from records written and unwritten i can-
not go down through the crowded tene-
ment sections of our great cities without
having it borne in upon me that we as a
nation pay a fearful price in human blood
and tears for our industrial triumphs 
cannot sec the poverty even the degrada-
tion of the wives and children of the wage-
working class in many cities and even in
many rural districts without being visited
by the devastating thought that surely if
the principle of the thing be necessary and
right there must be fearful errors some-
where in the application of the principle

  for the grim fact stands out beyond
denial that the men who are the workers of
the nation and the women and the chil-
dren dependent upon them are not to-day
given the opportunities that are their
proper birthright in free america and
that struggle as they will save as they
may lilt their voices in protest as they
dare they cannot obtain from our industrial
hierarchy much more than a mere living
wage and on the other hand it is equally
true that the wage of capital is high that
the class of the idle rich lias grown out of
all proportion and that it has taken upon
itself a power and an arrogance unsur-
passed in the industrial history of the
world

ocr workmen and tillik wages

  somewhere there is something wrong
i speak as a rich man i speak as a repre-
sentative of the class of which i write and
to which in particular i address myself
we can no longer blind ourselves with idle
phrases nor drug our consciences with the
outworn boast that the workingman of
america is to-day the highest paid artisan
in the world we know those lying figures
well many a time i myself in personal
argument have shown that the american
workman receives from one and a half to
three times as much as his english cousin
at the same trade but we know now that
this means nothing we arc learning in-
stead of envying the american workingman

his lot to pity more deeply that english
cousin we are learning too that what
we give our workers in wages we take back
from them in the higher cost of necessities
in food in clothing in medicine in insur-
ance in a hundred devious ways all with
one tendency-to keep the living margin
down

our unenciianed slaves

  many centuries ago two great greek
philosophers aristotle and plato pre-
dicted that the time would come when the
tools of wealth production machinery-
would have reached such an advanced
sta-je of development that it would become
unnecessary to enslave anybody for the
sake of allowing any one class to devote
itself to the pursuit of culture these great
philosophers believed in slavery during
that period of the worlds development in
which they lived on the ground that only
by the exploitation of forced labor could
any class be left free to develop the higher
attributes of mankind vet both looked
forward to the time when in the progress
of humanity toward the ideal the per-
fection of methods would permit the eman-
cipation of all mankind

  aristotle and plato were no visionaries
their dreams so far as the methods are
concerned are to-day realities but alas
how different the result instead of eman-
cipation we have welded about the necks
of the people the chains of industrial slav-
ery it is true that the form of slavery
the direct exploitation of the bodies of men
his been wiped out in every civilized na-
tion hut is it not equally true that we
have merely stepped out of a process of
direct exploitation of a few enchained slaves
into a process far more expansive and em-
bracing far more people namely the indi-
rect exploitation of wage-workers for the
benefit of capital

  the fruit of the genius of the inventors of
the world is plucked not by the hands of
the workers but by the hands of the com-
paratively small and personally insignifi-
cant class who by virtue of the genius of
their fathers or by virtue of mere chance
administer the tremendous power of capital

  the evolution of the ages then has
brought about this strangely ironical condi-
tion humanity is face to face with a god-
given opportunity to acquire and apply


everybodys magazine

knowledge the wealth-producing ma-
chinery of the world has the capacity to
give to all men the opportunity of enjoy-
ing leisure knowledge and culture are
the proper birthright of humanity to-day
even in the face of obstacles knowledge
and culture spread among the people only
one great obstacle remains to block the
fulfillment of the prophecy of the great
philosophers that obstacle is the idle
rich it is the leisure class that to-day
destroys the spirit of our dream

  it cannot be for long we in america
are moving fast toward social revolution
conflicts between labor and capital are
assuming the proxrtions of civil war the
once powerful middle class which is the
safety of every nation is to-day weak and
is every day declining soon politically
it will be a memory and the battlefield will
be cleared for conflict

chapter v

tiie awakening ok society

  i was dining recently in one of the city
hotels music and laughter flooded the
place as sunshine floods the fields out-
wardly the scene had all the appearance
of perfect ease and happiness looking
around i lighted by chance upon a table
where a group of elderly people all well
known to me were dining they were
people who live well and who take a large
part in the social world as well as in the
world of business i watched them as they
talked i noted an air of gravity of seri-
ousness and i wondered what it was all
about a little later as their table as-
sumed the normal aspect i went over and
exchanged greetings with them inciden-
tally i asked them what had made them
so very serious throughout the evening

  one of them an old friend of mine told
me they had been discussing a statement
that had appeared as a news item during
the afternoon it was part of a speech
made in the senate at washington it
was an attack upon the concentration of
wealth in the hands of the few-really a
veiled denunciation of the principle upon
which society is founded these men and
women all part and parcel of the social
world had spent most of their evening
discussing that item of news

  a very few years ago such an episode

as this would have been dismissed with
hardly a single thought by almost any
group of men and women who belonged to
society somebody might have introduced
the subject somebody else would have
called the senator a demagogue or an
agitator or a socialist-and the conversa-
tion would have drifted on to the latest
sporting news or talk of somebodys ball a
month or so away but now the older
men and women of society know better
they have learned in fact to distinguish
real news from mere sensation

  i do not say that it is general this ten-
dency to take seriously the social industrial
and economic questions of the day in
mv own case i do know that until a very
few years ago none of these problems
bothered me much i know that very
rarely did i hear the question raised as to
the permanence of the conditions under
which we lived within our social barriers
nobody in my world considered the prob-
lem of industry his own and every one
drifted onward through the years secure
in the conviction that in the end every-
thing was going to be all right

  to-day how different it is to-day we
are studying the sources of our wealth
finding out for ourselves the real price paid
by humanity to give us the privileges of
the social life which we and our fathers have
enjoyed excited by curiosity we go down
to inspect the mines our fathers left to us
we watch the men at work mere pitiful
animals risking their lives in terrible en-
deavor for a meager wage that we the
heirs of time and of eternity may take our
leisure in the palaces of wealth in the
mills of pittsburg we watch the workers in
iron and steel toiling in the white-hot
blast of the furnaces that we who never
have toiled may draw our dividends and
spend them on the luxuries we love

the wealthy crave the peoples praise

  but a very few years ago we should have
looked upon these workers with eyes of
pity perhaps and we might have talked
more or less glibly of the hardships of labor
yet it would not have been our problem
to-day we recognize the relationship be-
tween the labor that produces our wealth
and the wealth which we enjoy

  many are the causes that have led to
this great change in the attitude of the
thc passing of thc idle rich

wealthy classes toward the world at large
first and foremost in my judgment is the
change in the attitude of the working
classes themselves toward the rich for
more assiduously than anything else in this
world we the wealthy seek the praise and
admiration of the crowd

  and the attitude of the people at large
toward the rich has been changed indeed
 remember even in my own lifetime a
period when the people of this country
looked up with admiration and respect to
their wealthy classes il was in the end of
that long period of which  have spoken in
which the wealth of the nation was well
distributed

  to-day how great the change-how won-
derful the transformation at first a few
weak voices told what a few eves saw in
unheard-of journals of the labor move-
ment in certain revelations of high-finance
corruption of politics dreadful tales were
told - stories long since forgotten in
henry demarest lloyds wealth vs
commonwealth we have a strong voice
describing what keen eyes clearly discerned
soon several profound historical studies
were published which aroused thc more
thoughtful then with drum and trumpet
and black banners flying came the army
of thc muck-rakers and their revelations
made the nation heartsick

tjf mvck-rakkrs onslaught

  never in thc history of the world lias
there been anything analogous to the sharp
campaign of the american muck-rakers
the progressive forces of french society
raged at the monarchy and the church
before the french revolution but their
propaganda took thirty years to gain power
and fifty years to accomplish its purpose
the work of destruction here seemed to be
done in a night the pillars of society
tumbled from official statements of the
president of the united states down to thc
output of tcn-dollar-a-wcek hack-writers
our publications teemed with the products
of the popular trade of exposure great
commercial and industrial institutions were
analyzed national and municipal govern-
ments were dissected universities and
churches did not escape the busy seeker
for sin

  it is but five years since thc white light
of the noonday sun beat down upon the

hitherto deeply buried roots of americas
industrial and social life and eighty-five
millions learned henv the social fruitage of
our age draws its sustenance just what
in this connection has been the effect of
these five years upon american opinion

  when the nineteenth century closed
america worshiped great wealth it sanc-
tified its possessors it deified the hundred-
millionaire in live years time america
has learned to hate great wealth plu-
tocracy is disgorging but public opinion
is relentless

writhing under pi bmc scorn

  to us who through the heyday of our
popularity simply sat in the sunshine and
throve and grew fat in happiness it came
as a terrible shock-this change of the
popular attitude at lirst we laughed at
il then we preached little sermons about
it half jesting half serious then we began
to talk aboul it among ourselves and we
held indignation meetings every time we
met our friends and called down the wrath
of heaven on these sharp-eyed and glib-
tongifcd investigators finally- and here
lies the heart of the matter- we began to
read these outpourings of the popular senti-
ment very seriously indeed they came at
last from sources that we dared not disre-
gard instead of mer  muck-raking expe-
ditions they assumed the proportions of
crusades instead of the frantic mouth-
ings of mere sensation-mongers there con-
fronted us in the columns of the press and
in the more sedate and orderly pages of the
magazines the speeches of a president or
sane sober editorials written by men who
knew both sides and who commanded our
respect as well as the respect and admira-
tion of the crowd we recognized-those
of us who thought and saw and felt-that
instead of beinga passing phase this change
of popular sentiment was the beginning of
a revolution

  i hesitate to say how deep this arrow
struck perhaps i can illustrate it best by
telling a story that came to my ears this
past winter a lady of the old school was
sending her daughter a young girl to one
of the preparatory schools here in thc east
she went herself to look at the college and
to talk with some of the professors in
conversation with the principal she said

 i want estelle right from the beginning
e very bod y  s m agazi ne

of her course to get a full understanding
of where wealth comes from i want her
year by year to learn of the debt and the
responsibility that she personally owes to
the people that work are these things
taught in your courses

  the principal was astounded she pro-
tested that such education was entirely out
of line with the principles and precepts of
that college very delicately and tactfully
she intimated that one of the foundations
if a social education was the constant in-
stillation into the students minds of the
idea that the aristocracy is superior to the
masses to teach estelle that she and
her class are really dependent upon the
grimy men who labor with their hands
would be to turn upside down the curricu-
lum of that college

  the upshot of it was that estelle to-day
is enrolled as a student in a high school in
new york city her mother believes that
the salvation of the wealthy classes in this
country depends upon the coming genera-
tions understanding the true relationship
between capital and labor

our best-hated class

  this is perhaps an extreme case for
only a very few years ago that matron her-
self was absolutely immersed in the whirl-
lools of the most frivolous society which
has a real right to use the term in talking
about itself always she was a woman of
a most active mind of broad sympathies
of excellent benevolent character but her
mind found its full exercise in the pursuit
of social fads her sympathies found outlet
in sporadic raids upon the strongholds of
misery and poverty and her benevolence sat-
isfied itself with much hidden largess to vari-
ous and sundry charities she did not really
understand any of the problems of the day

  the first awakening of this one woman
came about through chance bored to death
at a summer resort half sick ami therefore
restricted in her activities she picked up a
book that a friend who had stopped on the
piazza to extend her sympathies happened
to leave she began half absently to turn
the pages from back to front as one will
a heading caught her eye here it is

otr barbarians from abovt

   she did not understand it  and her habit
of mind led her to investigate she had

lost the page but she searched until she
found it then she read the paragraph

  if our civilization is destroyed as macaulay
predicted it will not be by his barbarians from lie-
low our barbarians come from above our great
money-makers have sprung in one generation into
scats of power kings do not know the forces ami

of new men without restraints of culture experi-
ence the pride or even the inherited caution of
class or rank these men intoxicated think they
are the wave instead of the float to them science

  she read on and on she finished the
book and turned back to its beginning
she had read enough to realize her pro-
found ignorance that night at dinner
she astounded her husband by asking

   who is henry demarest lloyd

  he is a socialist writer was the an-
swer who amuses himself attacking our
class

   wish she said you would get me
all his books

  from that time on her mind found new
occupations new interests new ideas a
world that she did not know existed came
swiftly over her horizon she did not rush
madly into extremes-she has not to this
day-but her life has changed considerably
we who knew her so little time ago as one
of the typical clever brilliant and flashy
purveyors of cheer and social joy find her
to-day no less charming in the matter of
mere entertainment but we expect when
we meet her to find in her mind many
other and more serious things she never
appears in print she is not a suffragist she
has dropped her little fads she is not that
strange abnormality of her sex that neglects
the old pursuits of women to follow the
strange gods of men but she is in every
ense a student of the true conditions that
surround her the mists of golden tradi-
tion have cleared from her eyes

  to-day she has plenty of company in
her own set she did not convert them
she detests the role of propagandist
they simply came of their own accord to
read and learn and when the educated
classes really become interested  think
they study things more deeply than any
other class even the most violent and
anarchistic of the publications that pretend
to portray the facts of the class relation-
the passing of the idle rich

ships have thousands of readers among
the very wealthy

  i remember a case in point mr upton
sinclair was invited to lunch one day
by a mutual acquaintance with a young
man of the most exclusive set in new york
they met in a private dining-room at the
lawyers club in the course of the lunch
mr sinclair referred to an article he had
published in wilshires magazine a so-
cialist sheet of the noisy class

  yes said the other i read it

  you read it exclaimed mr sinclair
in complete surprise

  oh yes-i always read it said the
other in a matter-of-fact way

  there are many like him five years
ago you probably could have counted on
the fingers of two hands the men in the
wealthy classes who read the literature that
comes from below to-day it is a very
common occurrence to hear in the best
clubs of new york wealthy men discussing
with intense earnestness and real economic
sense articles of which they never would
have heard five years ago

  i used to think said a clubman to me
last winter that we were well beloved
but i guess our class is the best hated class
in the land i am only beginning to find
out why

  yet i have failed of my aim if i have
given the impression that society is to-day
wholly roused this is alas not true
to-day perchance the vast majority of the
men of wealth in this and other cities will
call me a visionary and an alarmist i
wish it were true would that i could
bring myself to believe that the things i
see about me are but the passing phases of
a natural adjustment i have tried for
many years to persuade myself that all
is well i have failed

chapter vi

for thirty pieces of slvkk

  i have shown how the seed of our social
system which has reached its fine flower
in the idle rich was planted in the too fer-
tile soil of american industry i have
dwelt briefly upon the simple fact that
we of the older orders have come to find
out something about that planting and the
manner of the growth

  i turn with something like dismay to the

methods of culture of this growth for it
is watered with the bloody sweat of labor
and the salt tears of bitter poverty and
suffering and it is fertilized with the dead
bodies of men and women outworn in the
grim battle of life tended and watched
it is by a foul horde of underlings hired
judges in the law panders in politics time
servers in the pulpit lickspittles in college
chancellories judases in the press black
mailers in business and miserable fawn-
ing parasites clinging like filthy leeches
upon the administrative bodies of the
nation

till bftrayai of thk nation

  to mv mind as i have studied this ques-
tion there has come a sad conviction
this nation is betrayed the planting of
the seed was quite possible without any be-
trayal of the people even its growth for
two decades was possible without delib-
erate betrayal but can any thinking mar
dare to say that the growth of this system
as it has developed since  could have-
been possible without criminal negligence
on the part of those public servants sworn
to guard the true and lawful interests of un-
people of this nation

  for it was perfectly evident years ago
that the industrial evolution of this coun-
try was a process of exploitation it was
the knowledge of this fact that lay behind
the sherman law of  and behind the
interstate commerce act which sought
to restrain to a limited extent at least the
boundless license to plunder which had
been taken unto themselves by the rail-
roads no man of broad and open mind cai
read the facts with regard to the home
stead strike the pullman strike the war
in the cccur dalene or the coal strike ol
very recent years without coming to the
conclusion that no matter who was in the
wrong in the immediate circumstances
leading to those national catastrophes the
real underlying cause was a revolt on the
part of a subjugated people against the
hardships of industrial slavery

  what is it then that makes possible the
continuance of this process of exploitation
in the face of the ever-growing publit
knowledge of its existence

  the answer is our public shame for the
simple reason is that the one power in th
world which could stop it-the will of the


everybodys magazine

american people-has been turned from its
purpose defeated in its honest efforts and
betrayed in its administration through the
power of mobilized wealth restraining the
hands of our political parties to-day in
mcrica the people elect their statesmen
but the cxerciseof the peoples power through
these statesmen is curbed directed and con-
trolled by groups of moneyed interests

  america then is a plutocracy

  always politically the power of a plu-
tocracy depends upon the maintenance of
the status quo it has come into being
through the operation of certain industrial
or commercial conditions it lives by vir-
tue of thc continuance of those conditions
and by virtue of their freedom from attack
by the one power strong enough to destroy
them namely the people

  to maintain this status quo has been the
gigantic task successfully carried out by the
financial interests of the united states it
is not my intention-indeed it is not within
my power-to go into any complete details
of the methods and machinery used for this
end but let me say that it has not all been
accomplished by any means through direct
political corruption though much of it has
been accomplished in that way deeper
than this has been the indirect subornation
of public opinion through a subsidized press
subsidized pulpits and subsidized public
speakers we have heard a great deal of
demagogues and wicked socialistic leaders of
the mob we do not hear much of that
other phenomenon thc oily sycophant who
talks to the people with words of cheer and
paragraphs of exhortation having in his
mind always the one single idea how best he
may serve the moneyed interests that stand
behind him

the solid west

   it is strange to me and it has always been
strange to other men who have studied
these things that the interests of a plutoc-
racy can be so long maintained for a plu-
tocracy of its very nature is thc weakest
possible form of government it lives
either by force or by fraud it lived in
rome before the days of marius by force
alone and the lower orders of rome were
slaves it lived in paris before the terror
by a combination of force and fraud and
the lower orders of france became fiendish
brutes it lives in america by fraud alone

and what may we say of the people of this
nation who permit it to live

  but the people are stirring not yet in
definite organization - but stirring the
line of political cleavage along which the
mighty rift must be made has not yet been
clearly marked out perhaps one may find
the first faint tracing of it in the rise of the
insurgents in the last session of congress
from what  have learned of the sentiment
in the powerful middle west which more
than any other part of the union represents
an average of the people of the united
states i am more than half convinced that
this is true if it be so many things may
happen within the next few years and there
may be very good reason indeed for the
widespread uneasiness in the plutocracy

chapter vii

the tribune ok the people

  sometimes an honest man of my class
reading the news of the day awakes to a
sudden realization of the grim political
truth during the time of the public dis-
cussion over the late tariff readjustment i
remember such an incident we were three
men sitting together in the smoking-room
of an uptown club one of us had brought
in a copy of a sane and honest afternoon
paper containing a quiet dignified careful
but powerful analysis of the actual results
brought about under the tariff reform meas-
ure wc had been struck by the article
we called it to the attention of the third
member of the group

  he read it through while my friend and
i talked about trivial things after quite a
long period of silence he handed the paper
back to thc giver

   what do you think of it he was asked

  his cigar had gone out he lit it lefore
he replied then he said gravely

   america needs a marius a pitt and a
peel before long it must get one or all of
them or it will surely breed a danton and
a robespierre

  it may have been mere epigram but the
two of us who heard it were startled for
the man who said it was a leader of the
world of fashion powerful in the world of
business and descended from four genera-
tions of the purest-blooded aristocracy this
country owns

  think then of the meaning of this senti-
the passing of the idle rich

nu-nt from such a man at such a time
marius a plebeian led the slaves ol rome
to the scats of political power broke down
the age-old barriers of an aristocratic plu-
tocracy and wrote into the history of the
world one of its earliest chapters on the
revolt of a subjugated nation held in chains
lor the benefit of a few pitt lord chat-
ham the great commoner hurled from
office by the combined power of a king a
plutocratic class and a subservient political
machine was forced back into office by the
will of the people unorganized in the face
of all the banded powers against him and in
spite of a condition of political corruption
that made his return seem a miracle peel
gave the people of england free corn against
the banded powers of commercial greed

  and to-day in america an aristocrat and
a member of the plutocratic class silting in
a great city club of fashion reading an
editorial from a paper that is published and
edited to meet the demands of that very
class gives it as his opinion that in this
country we must raise a marius a pitt and
a peel and the alternative-the days of
he terror the bloody bands the brutish
mob the wild-eyed frantic leaders of the
host that stormed the bastille set up the
guillotine-so runs the mind of an aristo-
crat and a plutocrat reading the evening
post in a rich mans club on upper fifth
avenue

face the trl til

  i believe that he was right without re-
ferring specifically to the tariff reform-for
this is no political document that i am
writing-i believe that the catalogue of
enactments by our legislative machine
in the past twenty years reveals beyond
the shadow of a doubt that the will oi the
people is subservient to the will of the plu-
tocracy how can we further blind our-
scives to the truth when such a fact is
known as gospel to the people from maine
t  california published in every section of
the press from the guttersnipe class to the
s liolarlv review how may the best educated
class in the united states go on upon its
careless way ignoring the fact

  the result is perfectly obvious in the
iight of history the plutocracy stripped
of the artificial screens behind which it grew
to power stands exposed to-day in the full
glare of the searchlight of public knowledge

under such circumstances even in slave-
holding nations there has never lacked a
tribune of the people so sprang thi
gracchi from the dust to lead the first great
battle in rome so even in the dawn of
popular liberty came a tyler and a cade
before their hour had struck it is true yet
even so with power to call to their back-
armies of men willing to die and conquera-
ble only by accident or guile so in the
fullness of time came other greater men a
marius a pitt a peel who led the people
against the citadels of plutocracy

  america-a lesson to the nations

  to-day we of the class that rules that
draws unearned profits from the toil of other
men know full well that the time is almost
here when there must be a true accounting
the fortunes that have been made are made
and that is all of it the fortunes that are
in the making through misuse of politic
power through extortionate exploitation of
the people and the peoples heritage through
industrial oppression and industrial deni
of the rights of man-these must be checked
to-morrow in this land the door of oppor-
tunity must be again unsealed

  we cannot go back and create more free
land to take the place of the millions upon
millions of acres thrown away by a lavish
stupid careless traitorous government r-
cannot fill again the plundered mines of
michigan or montana or pennsylvania
we cannot clothe the hills of maine and
michigan again with pine or the broad
bottoms of ohio with walnut we cannot
turn back the hands of the clock nor re-
create the economic factors that have ben
exhausted to make the wealth and the
social world to-day enjoyed by the ex-
ploiters and l heir descendants

  it is not so that evolution works th 
rare civilization of the atec which cortex
crushed can never be restored only echoes
from the tombs of the lucumos after the
lapse of twenty centuries attest the fact that
once in etruria there existed a civilialior
distinctive splendid brilliant only the
ashes in the urn of history remain of ph

wanted-a leader

   vet for all our lost opportunities much
remains that can be done and will be done
it is not my purpose here to sketch the proc-
ess of salvation that is yet possible only
at this point in my writings i would warn
the people of my class those of them who do
not yet think about these things or under-
stand them that the moment has arrived
when the people demand a marius-a trib-
une who shall lead them onward into free-
dom a man who shall stand before the world
untrammeled by the golden chains of wealth
undefiled by the pollution of time-serving
politics filled with the inspiration of the
peoples will courageous to battle to the
very bitter end for the rights that the people
demand

   only the morally and intellectually deaf
cannot hear the sound of the call of the
people it sweeps from the plains of kan-
sas in the breath of the rustling corn it
swells from the hills of montana in the thud
of the drill and the rising and falling of picks
in the mines it whirs from the looms of the
south and the north where child-slavcs
earn the bread of labor it moans from the
lofts of new york in the voice of the
slaves of the sweat-shop it shrieks from
the forges of pittsburg the charnels of
packingtown the terrible mines of the
mountains of coal

   it is a call for a leader to freedom-the
freedom we bought with our blood and
signed away in ignorance i care not where
you turn the voices of the people crying for
their rights rise stronger fuller more threat-
ening year by year day by day they or-
ganize a meeting of farmers at st louis
files a formal protest against the profits
of the middleman and forms a committee to
investigate and report and puts together

turing city of the middle west chooses a

lished to clear the skirls of a ruling party
of ihe charge of being in part responsible

by the people themselves

   a daring and preposterous attempt on the
 part of organized railroad owners to advance

 them down for the  big interests is met by
 a storm of organized protest chambers of
 commerce industrial clubs manufacturers
 guilds consumers leagues spring up all over
 the country expostulating pleading threat-
 ening hurling legal thunderbolts a presi-
 dent yields to the clamor and an attorney
 general launches the thunder of washington
 against a move that ten years ago would
 have met only the scattered sporadic half-
 hearted hopeless invective of the private
 citizen the railroads yield and begin the
 revision of rates at the top by making
 agreements with the big organized shippers
 the trusts

the fight begins

   the time is ripe the fight begins the
 status quo is to be changed in the political
 arena all is confusion already from the
 lips of the old trained leaders who through
 long periods have served the interests of the
 plutocracy while wearing the livery of the
 people come hesitating phrases of fear and
 confusion one announces that he will re-
 tire after his present term another goes
 down to defeat fighting to the last for his
 master a third branded a corruptionist
 sees ruin stalkinjr him amid the shadows
 of the coming day another reading the
 papers dubs them traitors and madly
 curses them before the eyes and in the ears
 of all the people

 man of the people will hear the clear un-
 mistakable call of destiny to its chosen

if hetty had stood on the rim f thc
world looking it over and choosing
her part she would have wanted ex-
actly the part which the morning held for
her thc fluttering of the flag from the
fine arts building tower and the moving
moving of thc crowd made a swift flowing
of life within her as the bay mare trolted

  oh egby hetty said happily i ket
you theyll all run us-dont you

  leave em said egby philosophically
then he looked at her there on the seat
beside him-a look of magnificent posses-
sion thc look which can linger as it likes
and need not turn away golly-olly
he said they dont none of em need to
remind me im married to you

even yet a whole month after the ev ent
the words had a kind of unreserve which

 made hearing them an adventure advcfi-
 tureit was too for hetty to say my hus-
 band never yet before older women
 had she called egby that now she looked
 down at his brown hand on the lines and il
 his sleeve and suddenly she laughed up 
 him

   egby she said whats by vo 
 collar

    he brushed at his collar vaguely not
  understanding

    youve forgot my first mending she
 chided him

    i aint he defended slipping his hand

tractions oh egby wont we have fun
there

  sure said egby well be meetin
everybody

specially lulu miner hetty said
lulu miner egby repeated thats
so lulu miner well how do i know
you aint here lookin for lenny west
oh egby said hetty gracious i
couldnt bear him to speak to me now
well scct you dont said egby
masterfully

   her eye swept the scene her young blood
beating lime to the life of the place

   aint it funny she said all the folks
an the doins an the fun of fair-time an
everything-an yet the biggest part is
just bein us

  she always startled egby somewhat
when she thought things through boy-
like and some man-like he so to say
merely felt his reflections above all he
never said them to tell his notions
gave him the same undressed feeling which
the naming of certain facts gave to hetty

what we goin to do first he de-
manded merely i know he went on
 look at the stuff an then go an set in the
grand stand an he added i aint got
to wonder this year whether lenny west
is goin to set the other side of you
lennys got a automobile this year
remarked hetty hell be here in that
thats so he has said egby gloomily
well now if youd a married him 
eg-by said hetty dont-why
dont

  well  wont- dum him egby said
buy me some peanuts-buy me some
peanuts before we go up in the grand
stand hetty commanded but instantly
her face fell no-i guess not peanuts
she added theyre kind o common
aint they

  common egby repeated hows
that

  well lulu miner use to say theys
common hetty recalled

    for cats sake said egby  lets leave
up on lulu miner

  driving down the grounds from the gate
they passed lumbcr-wagons on whose seats
or in chairs in the boxes were women and
girls dressed in their best-here a red
waist there an all silk there a fabric
negligible under the innocent ostentation
of slarch and fresh ribbon last year it

  was so that hetty had come in her uncles
wagon and she had been longing for a
white dress and new gloves of last year
she remembered especially lulu miners
white dress white with blue ribbons and
her silver chatelaine and her big hat also
egby had taken lulu for ice-cream-hetty
remembered lulus way of lifting her face
so that it seemed to be her mouth that
she lifted lenny west had taken hetty-
she remembered her angry satisfaction that
lenny was so good-looking but she was
hearing every word that egby said and
now-and now here she was and egby
belonged to her and they had come in a
buggy and she was dressed like this and
it was county day and everybody would
be here to see

  as egby helped her to alight before the
fine arts building hetty heard the whis-
per of two or three standing by the door-
the bride-theres the bride and
whereas on their brief wedding journey
there had been for her in the suspicion a
particular delicious agony tinged with de-
light now back here in her home town
and for the first time since their return
about to meet their old friends the delight
was chief but touched too with a certain
delicious and perfectly bearable agony

  yes there was no mistaking even to the
eye of a stranger hetty was the bride
eternal perhaps no one could have told
quite how the fact was plain but there is
no way to tell of countless sweet certainties
hetty was in white new white her ruftled
skirt blossoming into pink at waist and
throat and her hat was white new white
crisping into chiffon to veil rosebuds and
her long silk gloves were white new white
but all these one left for the look of her
eyes which had that exquisite and peculiar
liquidness of certain young life and young
happiness and the look of her cheeks which
were in a kind of rhythm of blushes bloom-
ing and going but always coming back
and there was the witness of egby big
and brown and conscious and in black new
black one knew the bride-and-groom
truth as simply as one recognizes roses
and for hetty the self-consciousness of the
moment was the heart of the delight she
swam into the hot fine arts building as if
she were entering upon some luring future

  the long nave of the building was lined
with exhibits there were the stoves
hideous grotesques like clowns put to
the fair



uses the sewing-machines lined up in
reticent domesticity the rooms furnished
complete till one felt that one ought
not to be looking the school displays shy
with wistful promise or impudent with
aspiration the china painting here a real
dream caught on a cup there a plaque of
roses magnified made as definite as wounds
under a microscope the oils the art
squares-vague reachings-out for beauty
reachings-out which ended in embroidering
eggs and ice-cream and to hetty and
egby it was all as beautiful as it really
was wonderful and potent with life and
with death as wonderful as were the fine
sincere feathery cakes the flaky-crusted
pies so perfect that they might have been
hung on the walls in the place of these walls
more ambitious guests

  would you look where the fruit aint
observed egby six plates of grapes for
the whole lay-out-say but this years
been fierce for the country not an apple-
not an apple biggest apple here is a
turnip say aint that a swell showin
blamed but i guess well go west- we got

to round up some climate somewhere
not a tomato-say lets go an give a
look at the stock they dont need no
climate

  hetty listened not ioiking in the stalls
her eyes on the crowd there was one and
another and another whom she knew the
mayor ami his wife both elderly and unim-
pressed-oh would erijv and she ever be
iike that not paying any attention to each
other-and there was lillie chalmers in a
new cloth dress-she was pretty but sht
had lately been divorced and some said it
was because she couldnt cook a decent
meal of victuals and she kept house so
slipshod nobody could a stood it there
she was with that mis raymer as
stylish as she-but awful loud-lookin
hetty thought and in an excess of young
wifely dignity pretended not to see either
of them

  behind them a piano broke out abruptly
as if it had kept still as long as it could anil
must instantly discharge all its incoherent
pent-up might the crowd in the building
took tip the melody and hummed it as they

eetty heard the whisper oi two ok three standing uy tilt ixmr -
 the bridk-theres the bride


everybodys magazine

listened and a chorus of fresh girlish voices
upbore it above the rest-

   oh the moon shines b-r-r-r-right and p-r-r-rctty
     r-r-r-red wing

  la la la la la-a la la la la la-a

they exaggerated it and ended in a cry
forevermore-here they are heres
hetty an egby we been lookin every-
whercs for you- hello bride well
foreiermore 

  even in that first moment of their wel-
come with hetty one impression dominated
for here was lulu miner but not the lulu
miner of last year whose costume hetty
herself had now half-unconsciously copied
but a lulu miner in a corn-colored coat and
skirt with wide lace set in the seams and a
great hat of lace wreathed with huge gold
beads and with her was a stranger my
friend miss mears in a long gray cloth
cape with white lining who to the  real
pleased im sure of hettys acknowledg-
ment returned an airy delightedindeed
which to hetty was somehow as discon-
certing as a snub but for the little bride
there flooded underneath the moment the
instant warm cherishing consciousness that
egby was hers no matter what lulu wore

  but as she looked at lulu the better to
revel in her own possession hetty saw
something egby was married but that
made no difference in the way lulu was
looking at him she stood before him with
that old way of upturning her face so that
it was her mouth that was upturned and
her eyes were on his in his in the same
merry challenging even possessive way
something caught at hettys heart and
would not let it beat lulu was looking at
egby as if she understood him as if she
were glad after his absence to sink back
in his look moreover it was so that egby
was looking at her -but its her fault its
her fault hetty thought its her thats
doing it of course hes looking-but then
hes just laughing and letting her look
when after the moments gay chatter
the badinage the runnin they all
moved away together and stopped outside
the building my friend miss mears
and the others walked beside hetty and
lulu fell in beside egby

   lets go back down the midway said
lulu  everybody come on i could die
hearin the barkers couldnt you

  they all followed-there was about lulu

a leadership that always left any rival
baffled and defenseless

  my said hetty with a laugh to show
how at ease she was i been wondering
when wed find you girls we said   

  oh gracious weve been everywhere
said lulu-and there was about her that
which when she chose to speak left the
sentences of anybody else unfinished her
sentences her eyes her presence were as
insistent as her hat we been dying for
a man to take us around seen lenny
say his automobile is like parlor furni-
ture-

  all that she said was said to egby
in the crowd the two were walking a little
before hetty and the others lulu always
looking up how nice they looked walking
together hetty thought uneasily she
herself was small of bone and girlishly
slight lulu was large and strong and a
blonde -she looked beautiful in her corn-
color beside egby and how glad they
were to see each other-they seemed so
used to each other   

  the midway symbol of that slow transi-
tion from the days when the county fair
was a thing of stock and produce and races
to a time when it shall be indeed a festival
of thc harvest with drama and folk-
dancing and historic pageantry-the mid-
way was trying its best to release its
scheduled glamour on the canvas facades
painted figures of dancing girls every-
where great colored letterings music boxes
calls of the door-men with a penchant for
latin derivatives all the contortion of
gayety and lure but save to the very
young it was only as good-will conspired
to mask sophistication that folk accepted
it all they liked the midway not for it-
self but because it was nakedly there to
be liked and the time was one of pro-
fessional merry-making they did not
enter into the moment rather they lent
themselves to it-that dreary distinction
between pleasure-seeking and ancient sun-
burnt mirth

  well down the tawdry avenue a tent with
raised sides and hung with pink mosquito
netting bore over its door the device

eating pavilion

il	was lulu who said oh lets get us
some dinner now while we can pick first
and at the demurring of the others about
leaving out lenny west-who oh
the woman put egbys chance ik lulu miners hand and lvifj dropped it in his
purse a coin at a time the others laughing at the womans mistake

lennyll be fed we dont need to wait
for lenny now

  they sat at one of the long tables and
were waited on by anxious tired members
of some ladi-s missionary society in the
town in the intervals when she turned
her attention from the talk of iulu miner
hetty noted the evident head of the dining
committee making solicitous excursionings
to bring fresh hot dishes to her own hus-
band who sat alone hetty watched the
woman and smiled with the others aint
wives the silliest dont you think said
miss mears and hetty admitted it but
chiefly hettys thought was on lulu miner
who as a matter of course had taken a
place at egbys other side

  no sir lulu was saying lightly no
ood askin egby to pay for our dinner
egbys got a family to support now

  come off said egby this dinner is
on us all right aint it iletty

  lulu pouted up at him lifted her brows
-hook her head ignored hetty

  i expect youre that domestic egby
she said

  in reality egby took a delicate sheepish
delight in this impeachment he wanted
to hear more it was to him a kind of
honest and loyal enjoyment to have lulu



call him domestic and to know that it wa
true he prolonged the moment

  oh i donno he said

  aint you said lulu airily i ex-
pect ill see you helpin dishes often ij
im asked over

  hetty an i are goin to hev the crowd
over all the time when we get house-
keeping said egby magnificently aint
we hetty

  sure said hetty bravely but sud-
denly she could see lulu miner at their
house their house looking at egby across
their supper-table laughing flirting under-
standing him    anil she herself obliged
to pretend to notice nothing as she was
having to pretend now

  presently isnt it said egby earn-
estly to something which hetty liad not
heard lulu say what had she said hetty
wondered and wasnt what what   
do you still not take any coffce egby
iulu saifl once i think they said theyd
got some cocoa ill ask she did ask
and the cocoa came hetty watched to see
if egby would drink it it was their first
dinner together at a fair and it was iulu
who was looking out for him hetty
looked across at the head of the dining-
room committee who was just bringing her
 s

everybodys magazine

husband a heaped-up plate of steaming
apple-pudding and hetty had for the
woman a sudden fellow-feeling it was
nice for her to be looking after her husband
like that

  wheres your paper napkin egby
hetty asked desperately in a need somehow
to show that he was hers to take care of

  oh kickin under my feet somewheres
egby said easily napkins for fair-time
is too stylish for me

  me either said lulu miner

  hetty looked miserably down at egbys
sleeve the sleeve and his brown hand
seemed like somebody elses and then
abruptly something sent through her a
sudden little glow and thrill oh lulu
miner could look tip at egby if she liked
but on egbys right shoulder in front
near the collar was the plain blue patch
that hetty had stitched in there yesterday
and that lulu didnt know anything about
in that crowd of their old friends with
lulu miners challenging and miss mearss
posing somehow that little wifely service
which her hands had done for egby became
a symbol of their bond and lulus artful-
ness seemed petty and impotent why
he was hers-hettys it was her place to
do things for him always she could
afford to let lulu have him a minute or
two

   you look at that woman mur-
mured miss mears as the head of the com-
mittee followed apple-pudding with ice-
cream for her husbands nourishment

  well i think its real sweet for her to
be doin like that hetty flung back unex-
pectedly

  but when the eating pavilion treasurer
took from egby the money for the din-
ner the others protesting and pretending
exertions to pay the woman ml egbys
change in lulu miners hand and lulu
dropped it in his purse a coin at a time the
others laughing at the womans mistake

  no wonder she believed lulu was his
wife thought little hetty wretchedly
and all the unhappiness of the hour was
back upon her

  as they stepped out on the midway
again lulu took her place at egbys side
with i bet egby when you get to
housekeeping youll forget all about us
i bet none of us will ever see you then

  aw come said egby nettled  were
only married we aint dead

  hetty fell back a step or two behind the
others only marriedso that was
the way he thought of it so lulu didnt
feel that egbys being married made a
difference and egby didnt feel it either
was that the way it was in the world with
men and women

  on this her misery of the last hour found
climax hetty looked up and down the
midway if only she could get away from
the others before she stopped being able
to pretend lulu and the rest were now
frankly looking for lenny west the
people were pouring into the eating pavil-
ion the avenue was nearly blocked
obeying an impulse which she hardly felt
hetty stepped farther back let the crowd
flow in and close in between her and the
others stepped sidewise behind the first
ticket-box of an attraction tent and
reached up blindly for a ticket in that
tent if she could get in there the others
wouldnt find her she couldnt bear it
just then any more

  when the tired elderly man on the box
had given her a ticket and she had got
within the tent-wings she was confronted
by a tiny boy in khaki rompers who threw
hi arms above his head with-

  im de ticket-taker

  the man looked over his shoulder and
smiled all right he said to hetty his
eyes still on the child

  no one was in the tent which proved to
hold the largest horse in the world nan-
nie the queen of the feminine sect a
woman short-skirted sallow with that air
of the casual common to all whose business
is eternal repetition launched on her sing-
song description of the big horse

  she is eleven feet six inches long -
the tent is twenty-two feet-measure he
with your own eyes she weighs 
pounds she is twenty-four hands high -
she is six years old broke to tandem
double and saddle she was foalded in
lloyd county she went on and on her
eyes taking frank up-and-down account of
hettys dress hetty staring at the hors
hardly heard what the woman said   

  hetty was trying to understand while
egby and she had been engaged there had
been little things that hurt of course of
which she never spoke-like egbys darn-
ing with lulu miner more than twice in an
evening and his sitting beside that girl
from the city on the way to the picnic and
the fair



so on but it had not occurred to hetty
that when they were married these things
would not end magically why they two
would be married was being married like
this lor everybody in the world

  suddenly the ticket-box man put his
head around the canvas  darn you lie-
said frankly to the woman keep the kid
in there with you cant you hes under
the whole midways feet

come ere titus said the woman
casually and then she called to the man
lou aint it time for your medicine
gosh yes the man answered id
forgot it again

  hetty looked at the woman that must
have hurt hetty thought vaguely-to
have had him speak to her-that way
and yet in spile of the ugliness of the inci-
dent something lay warm in the thought
of it and it was that undisturbed question
of the wife about the medicine egby had
never spoken hard before folks well
and of course she just couldnt hear it if
he ever did-before folks but her thought
lingered on the wifes question about the
medicine and a light wave of understand-
ing swept her

  that wasreai kind  nice she thought
and somehow remembered the patch on
egbys shoulder hen with that the hurt
surged back again

  lulu miner got right into his eyes with
that look of hers she remembered too
and egby let her in

  oh she could have stood anything else
but when they were married how could
any one act to either of them as if they
were not married

  why said some one softly why
hetty little hetty beside her bend-
ing over her holding out his hand was
lenny west

   hello lenny she said mechanically

  gloriation lenny said but it seems
good and grand to see you back what
you doin in here i saw you from thc
machine-goin into some tent alone i
couldnt tell which one-ive paid my way
into this-is-the-third my george to catch
you wheres-  he hesitated come
out o this he bade her come on
back where the machine is

  in an instant hettys spirits rose very
well here was lenny glad to see her- and
egby probably hadnt missed her yet

cuw vriox ienny suit but it seems good am oh and t ill vm b vk

e very body s magazine

    got sejvaratid irom my whole crowd
tu said well hunt em up yes lets
 see your new automobile  want to

are lenin west guided her how goxl-
ooking he was she thought again and he
took such splendid care of her setting his
ig shoulders between her and i he crowd

  lie bent his head to her well watch
lit for the rest he said whos with

em your husband--

  yes said hetty an the girls the
rowd lulu an nl is mears an all of
em

  oh said lenny only and fell mo-
mentarily silent

  they were making their way against the
treum going toward the eating pavilion
md their progress was slow lenny guid-
ing her to the trodden turf beside the road
made no attempt  hasten that progress
it was noon now and the grounds were
tilled the last forenoon busses had
rattled in and discharged their loads in
hi- air hung like autumn haze the dust of
he long drought and the hot hush of
september noon lay strangely above the
abel the pavilion the booths where
lunches were served the grand stand
where lunches were eaten became focal
but the beat of the band the drone of the
iierry-go-round the cries of the showmen
persisted the stamp of the horses the
questioning lowing and bleat in from th
-beds the chatter of th- performing mon-
keys on their way to be fed the cry of
he balloon man the high crow of a cock
-houts of children the murmur and laugh
i the crowd besieged and confused lin-
ear as the moving mov ing of the people
md the rout of color mingled to the eye
hsstlving impressions as lightly as moments
tre dissolved

  rut for hetty looking all this set no
-pur to the spirits she was goading her-
df i a satisfaction in this chance of
vents but it was a frightened satisfaction
lenny was taking such excellent gentle
iimost tender care of her if only he
idnt bend his head that way when he
spike to her   

  our old crowd aint the same with you
tie lennv said

   well were back now hettv re-
minded him almost shortly

   it aint the same though lenny

	 the crowds all breakin up i

dont spose he added youll ever let nit-
come to see you-now

  sure we will hetty said and stumbled
on a hummock and drew away from him
and his gentle awkward oop of rescue-
were goin to have the crowd over all the
time when we get housekeeping she re-
peated egby words to lulu

  i didnt say crowd i said me 
lenny suggested

  sure well let you hetty repeated
lightly  well want you

  lenny looked out over the sunny field
his face was of the type that in repose
takes on pensiveness idealizing the simple
good looks definitely belying the good-
natured commonplace which lies behind
darn everything he observed

  with a kind of girlish bravado of revenge
n egby and lulu hetty caught him up
dont you want to come to our house
lenny turned to her stooping ever so
slightly and briefly to win her look you
know i do he said

  hettys face crimsoned her eyes flew
afield there was no mistaking this was
lennys old half makin fun half tender
look of last year at the fair of all the time
before she had been married how could
he do that now-how could he   

  she kept silently beside him trying to
understand what would other women
do would they answer him give him
back his look-let lenny in their eyes as-
h as egby had let in lulu miner huv
this the way it was with men and women in
the world

  there aint nobody like you hetty
lenny said soberly i tell you what
when you go away it just about empties
tit the town for me

  still she said nothing but suddenly
she felt a kind of homesickness as definite
as when in her little girlhood she had been
wont to want her mother and there came
a great sense of unprotection as if some
barrier were gone and a lonesomeness as
if things that belonged to her had been
taken away why she was married-
they were married    how could things
be like this

  there said lenny the machine-
over there you stay right here an ill
bring it round oh hetty this is like
cornin to life again

  still she said nothing nor did she look up
as he went she stood still where he left
way hetty-dear he cried  t bees lookin myself crazy she put her

hand through hi abu

her before the big shallow rest tent her
eyes seeking the throng the moment re-
solving itself into one wish winged and
crying that she could get where egby was

  the crowd was moving    moving   
watching it a sudden sick distaste swept
her what were they all like anyway
had she ever known people as people
they had always been going by and going
by around her but had she ever really
known much about them oh and were
they like this

  looking for egby she was conscious of
those who passed her on the midway
the monkcy-traincr in short red skirt and
huge white satin slippers and a flopping
cloak three of the women from the eating
pavilion recruiting ice-cream from a stall
a family of five sharing one ptp corn bug
two middle-aged men in the special black of
best clothes meeting with a shout block-
ing the midway with their handshake
boys distributing orange handbills a
woman stopping to tie her husbands neck-
tie and he jerking impatiently free of her
hands an old man in a linen coat and gog-
gles with a little pail of something which
he was taking home a carpenter from the
village carrying his little lxy his brown
hand outspread on the childs plaid skirt
grocerymen and merchants from the vil-
lage where the stores were closed on
county day grandma birch wearing
her huge button picture of grandpa birch
who had not spoken to her for five years
before he died hetty knew how on his

deathbed he had in his delirium called
her old secret names but he had died with-
out speaking sanely to her    look
at this great big large enormous fish an t
alive-was bawled above the noise there
went the mayor and his wife elderly unim-
pressed how fine for them to have had
all those years together went unexpectedly
through hettys head

  near hetty within the shelter of the
rest tent a woman was quieting a child
and her husband warm and panting ha-
just joined them

  tired settin he asked

  no i aint the woman said shortly
im sick of everjthing but settin ben-
nies coinin down with somethin awful 
never see him so ugly

  give m to me her husband invited

 i wont do any such a thing you
always jounce him out of his senses said
the wife

 well come on somewhere well
leave bennie home with in a to-morrow
he suggested

  im glad you had sense enough to think
of that his wife said and rose to follow him

  your hats on a little mite crooked
hetty heard him say as they passed her

  it aint either said thewoman-and
then they both laughed as if at some old
household joke of her impatience in like case

  tom-toms sounded from the winnebago
indian pen a little angora goat escaped
ran bleating down an aisle swiftly formed
i-ir him the odor of hot meal pancakes
everybodys magazine

came from the ring-and-cane booth where
pancakes were prizes snatches of talk
reached heltv from two women sitting in
the rest tent behind her

  mv feet hurt so i declare i bet they
kwnc they hurt said one an yet the
minute i get home jerryll expect a warm
meal

  oh dode too said the other men
is men mis bird  expect dodell want
to kill a chicken thats what he always
thinks of when im nearest to dead   

  jerry manages different said mis
bird just as were startin off some-
whcres hes got somethin to bo mended-
hole in his pocket like enough 

  -great big enormous fish and alive

the strident voice went on    nannie
nannie queen of the feminine seel
came faint and far

  suddenly and at first inexplicably a
little warm spot glowed in hettys con-
sciousness like a place to sink her thought

 somethin to be mended- that was
making a little spot of remembrance warm
a swift indeterminate surge of fellowship
fur the two women swept her and for that
other woman gone off with bennie and
for the keeper of nannie and the husband
who forgot his medicine  as abruptly
as if a glory from widely-opened doors
smote across the fairground hetty looked
in on the life of the crowd families hus-
bands wantin warm meals wives with
tired feet and crooked hats men saying
darn you and wives telling on about big
horses jealously serving their husbands
dinners wearing their button pictures laugh-
ing companioning finding somethin to
be mended-why they were all in this
together and they all knew what one an-
other knew and all the lulu miners and
the lenny wests and their eyes and their
voices were as far outside really as was last
years fair and it was true for them all
true for everybody who would have it so
who hung on and hung on to these things
no matter what   

  she turned and looked at the two women
in the tent

  heres an extra box to set on one of
them said to her hospitably

  no thank you hetty said i-my
husbandll be lookin for me

  dodes wife nodded soll mine she
said an he dont like to be kep waitin
much either

  hetty smoothed at her pink belt and
looked at the women shyly us wives
have to toe the mark dont we she
said-and looked like a rose

  when she turned egby spied her ran
to her he was alone and his eyes had
been everywhere seeking her

  why hetty-dear he cried how
did you get lost i been lookin myself
crazy

  she put her hand through his arm lillie
chalmers and that mis raymer passing
at the moment hetty waited in an excess
of sudden compassion that they had some-
how not hung on and she bowed to
them in a kind of wistful graciousness

  egby she said ill tell you after-
ward an i saw lenny west

  him egby said stopping short
ugh yes egby-him an listen to

to you that  want to yell it out loud
egby-its a great thing-isnt it-isnt it
egby will you do somethin

  he looked down at her he was be-
wildered by her tenderness that somehow
beat upon him for a moment t hey stood
still in the dusty open about them the
people moving    moving on the fair-
ground and the wide beyond and away to
the rim of the world

  egby hetty said you turn back your
coat a minute sos i can sec that patch i
put on your shoulder that way-so

               -mr cannon is idling here the story oj a broken covenant-of the vio-
lation of the pledges given by the mormon leaders lo the nation lie has already recounted
his successful mission to president cleveland to plead for clemency to his people he ha
revealed the secrets of the conclave in which the mormon prophets abandoned polygamy by
order of the will of god lie has recited the second solemn pledge given by the mormon
leaders the pledge of non-interference in politics these two promises were preconditions of
obtaining statehood for utah and it is their treasonable violation that ex-sena tar cannon i
to expose in the chapters that follow this instalment tells the story of a tragic return lo polyg-
amyand enlers upon the formation of that partnership with the predatory interests in i fas
ington by which hie treacheries of the mormon hierarchy are now protected

  tho-

         chapter n il-the i irst betrayals

before i reached utah my friends ben
rich and james devine met me on the
train the news of president wood-
ruffs revelation had percolated through
the whole community the gentiles were
alarmed for themselves my friends were
anxious for me all the old enmities that
had so long divided utah were arranging
themselves for a new conflict and rich
and devine had come to urge me to remem-
ber a promise given to my supporters that
i would hold lo my candidacy no matter
who should appear in the lield against me

  of my fathers stand in the crisis rich
could give me only one indication after a
conference in the offices of the presidency
rich had said to president woodruff
then i supjiose i may as well close lip
franks rooms at the templeton-the
hotel in which my friends had opened polit-

ical headquarters for me-and my father
accompanying him to an anteroom had
hinted significantly i think you shoulil
not close franks rooms just yet he ma
need them

  rich brought me word too that tlu
church authorities were expecting lo se
me and as soon as i arrived in salt iak
city i hastened to the little plastered house
in which the presidency had its offices

  president woodruff my father and
joseph f smith were there in the large
room of their official apartments we
withdrew for private conference into the
small retiring room in which i had con
suited with brother joseph mack when
he was on the underground-in -and
had consulted with president woodrufl
about his manifesto in s

  president woodruff sat at the head of a

 s


everybodys magazine

bare walnut table in a chair so large that
it rather dwarfed him and he sank down
in it to an attitude of nervous reluctance
to speak occupied with his hands smith
took his place at the opposite end of the
board with dropped eyes his chair tilted
back silent but as i soon saw unusually
alert and attentive my father assumed
his inevitable composure-firmly and al-
most unmovingly sealed-and looked at
me squarely with a not unkind premonition
of a smile

  president woodruff continued silent
ordinarily anything that came from the
lord was quite convincing to him and
needed no argument in his mind to make
it convincing to others i could not sup-
pose that the look of determination on my
face troubled him it was more likely that
something unusual in the mental attitudes
of his councillors was the cause of his hesi-
tation and with this suspicion to arouse
me i became increasingly aware of two rival
watchfulnesses upon me

  well i said what was it you
wanted of me

  smith looked up at the president and
smith had always hitherto seemed so
unseeing of consequences and therefore
unappreciative of means that his betrayal
of interest was indicative of purpose i
thought  could detect in thc communica-
tion which his manner made the plan of
my fathers ecclesiastical rivals to remove
him from the scene of his supreme influence
over the president and the plan of ambi-
tious church politicians to remove me
from their path by the invocation of gods
word appointing father to the senate

  frank the president announced it
is the will of the lord that your father
should go to the senate from utah

  as he hesitated  said well presi-
dent woodruff

  he added with less decision  and we
want you to tell us how to bring it about

  it was evident that getting the revela-
tion was easy to his spiritualized mind
but that fulfilling it was difficult to his
uuworldlincss

  president woodruff i replied you
have received the revelation on the wrong
point you do not need a voice from
heaven to convince any one that my father
is worthy to go to the senate but you will
need a revelation to tell how he is to get
there

  he seemed to raise himself to the in-
spiration of divine authority thc only
difficulty that we have encountered he
said is the fact that the legislators arc
pledged to you will you not release them
from their promises and tell them to vote
for your father

  no i said and my father would
not permit me to do it even if i could he
knows that i gave my word of honor to my
supporters to stand as a candidate no
matter who might enter against me he
knows that he and i have given our pledges
at washington that political dictation in
utah by the heads of the mormon church
shall cease of all men in utah we cannot
be amenable to such dictation if you can
get my supporters away from me-very well
i shall have no personal regrets but you
cannot get me away from my supporters

  this inclusion of my father in my refusal
evidently disconcerted president woodruff
and as evidently it had its significance to
joseph f smith

   went on before i was elected to the
house of representatives  asked my
father if he intended to be a candidate for
the senate i knew that some prominent
gentiles desiring to curry favor at church
headquarters had solicited his candidacy

 had been told that general clarkson and
others had assured him by letter that his
election would be accepted at washington
and elsewhere i discussed the matter with
him fully he agreed with me that his
election would le a violation of the under-
standing with the country and he declared
that he did not care to become again the
storm-center of strife to his people nor did
he feel that he could honorably break our
covenant to the country with this clear
understanding liotween us i made my
pledges to men who in supporting me cast
aside equally advantageous relations which
they might have established with another
 cant withdraw now without dishonor

  my father said dont let us have any
misunderstanding as president wood-
ruff stated the matter to me i understood
that it would be pleasing to the lord v
the people desired my election to thc senate
and it wouldnt antagonize thc country

  yes yes the president put in thats
what i mean

  smith said rather sourly the people
are always willing to do what the lord de-
sires-if no one gives them bad counsel
under the prophet in lih

  both he and my father emphasized the
fact that the business interests of the east
were making strung representations to the
presidency in support of my fathers elec-
tion and i suspected what  afterward
found to be the case that both joseph 

was a deplorable evidence to me oi the
willingness of some of our former allies to
drag us swiftly t the shame of a broken
covenant if only they could prolit in purse
or politics by our dishonor i would not
be an agent in any such betrayal but i had

i cant withdraw now

witiitlt dishonor

smith and apostle john henry smith were
by this time in close communication with
republican politicians there was a calm
assumption everywhere that the church
had jkjvver to decide the election if it could
be induced to act and this assumption

to refuse without offending my fathers
trust in the divine inspiration of president
woodruffs decision and without aiding the
smiths in their conspiracy

either at this conference or at one of
the later ones two or three apostles lain--
everybodys magazine

into the room and among them was apos-
tle brigham young son of the prophet
brigham who had led the mormons to the
salt lake valley when he understood my
refusal to abandon my candidacy he said
angrily this is a serious filial disresject

i know my father never would have brooked
bitch treatment from me and i retorted
 dont know who invited you into this
conference but i deny your right to in-
struct me in my filial duty it my father
doesnt understand that the senatorsliip
has lost its value for me-that its a cross
now-then my whole lifetime of devotion
to him has been in vain

  my father rose and put his arm around
my shoulders this boy he said is
acting honorably i want him to know-
and you to know- that  respect the posi-
tion he has taken if he is elected he shall
have my blessing

  that was the only understanding  had
with him-hut it was enough i could
know that  was not to lose his trust and
affection by holding to our obligations of
honor and-an assurance almost as pre-
cious-i could know that he would not
consciously permit legislators to be crushed
by the vengeance of the church if they
refused to yield to its pressure

  a few days after my arrival in utahand
while this controversy was at its height
my fathers birthday was celebrated jan-
uary ii isq with all the patriarchal
pomp of a -mormon family gathering in
his big country house outside salt lake
city all his descendants and collateral
relatives were there as well as the members
of the presidency and many friends after
dinner the usual exercises of the occasion
were held in the large reception hall of the
house with president woodruff and my
father and two or three other church lead-
ers seated in semi-state at one end of the
hall and the others of the company defer-
entially withdrawn to face them toward
the end of the program president wood-
ruff rose from his easy-chair and made a
sort of informal address of congratulation
and in the course of it with his hand on
my fathers shoulder he said benignly
abraham was the friend of god he
had only one son on whom all his hopes
were set but the voice of the lord com-
manded him to sacrifice isaac upon an
altar and abraham trusted the lord and
laid his son upon the altar in obedience

to gods commands xow here is another
servant of the most high and a friend of
god i refer to president cannon whose
birthday we are celebrating he has
twenty-one sons and if it shall be the will
of the lord that he must sacrifice one of
them he ought to be as willing as abraham
was for he will have twenty left and the
son should be as willing as isaac we can
all safely trust in the lord he will require
no sacrifice at our hands without purpose

  i remarked to a relative beside me that
the altar was evidently ready for me but
that  feared i should have to get out and
rustle my own ram in the thicket i re-
ceived no reply i heard no word of com-
ment from any one upon the presidents
speech it was accepted devoutly with no
feeling that he had abused the privileges
of a guest every one understood as 
did that president woodruff was the
gentlest of men that he had often pro-
fessed and always shown a kindly affection
for me but that the will of the lord being
now known he thought i should be proud
to be sacrificed to it

  among the legislators pledged to me
were mormon bishops and other ecclesi-
asts who had promised their constituents
to vote for me and who now stood between
a betrayal of their people and a rebellion
against the power of the hierarchy i re-
leased one of them from his pledge because
of his pathetic fear that he would be eter-
nally damned if he did not obey the will
of the lord the others went to the
presidency to admit that if they betrayed
their people they would have to confess
what pressure had been put upon them to
force them to the betrayal i went to
notify my father as i had notified the
representatives of every other candidate
that we were going to call a caucus of the
republican majority of the legislature
and later  was advised that president
woodruff and his councillors had appointed
a committee to investigate and report to
them how many members could be counted
upon to support my fathers candidacy
the committee composed of my uncle
angus my brother abraham and apostle
john henry smith brought back word
that even among the men who had pro-
fessed a willingness to vote for my father
there was great reluctance and apprehen-
sion and that in all probability his elec-
tion could not be carried with president
woodruffs consent my father then an-
nounced that he was not a candidate i
was nominated by acclamation

  when  called upon my father at the
presidents offices after the election he
said to me before his colleagues i wish
to congratulate you on having acted honor-
ably and fearlessly you have my bless-
ing he turned to the president you
see president woodruff he added it
was not the will of the lord after all since
the people did not desire my election

  i have dwelt so largely upon the religious
aspects of this affair because they are as
true of the prophet in mlitics to-day as
they were then at the time the personal
complication of the situation most dis-
tressed me-the fact that i was opposing
my father in order to fulfill the word of
honor that we had given on behalf of the
mormon leaders hut there was another
view of the matter and it is the one that
is most important to the purposes of tliis
narrative

  in the course of the various discussions
and conferences upon the senatorship i
learned that the inspiration oi the whole
attempted betrayal had come from certain
republican politicians and lobbyists like
colonel isaac trumbo who claimed to
represent a political combination of busi-
ness interests in washington joseph f

smith admitted as nun h l me in more than
one conversation  had offended thesj
interests by opposing a monetary and a
tariff bill during my service as delegate i
congress-a matter which i have still to
recount they had chosen my father and
colonel trumbo as utahs two senators
i made it my particular business to see
that trumbos name was not even men-
tioned in the caucus the man selected
as the other senator was arthur brown
prominent gentile lawyer who was known
as a jack-mormon meaning a gentile
adherent to church power although i
then believed and do now that judge
charles c goodwin was the gentile most
entitled to the place

  i was however content with the victory
we had won by resisting the influence of the
business interests that had been willing to
sell our honor for their profit and i set out
for washington with a determination to con-
tinue the resistance i was in a good posi-
tion to continue it the election of two
republican senators from utah had given
the republicans a scant majority of the
members of the upper house and the bills
that i had fought in the lower house
were now before the senate

  in the previous december s these
bills had been introduced in the house of

     llluii ibiw ii liurt trill
everybodys magazine

representatives immediately upon its con-
vening ly the committee on rules be-
fore speaker reed had even appointed
the general committees one was a bill
to authorize the issuance of inteest-bear-
ing securities of the united states at
such times and in such sums as the
executive might determine the other
was a general tariff bill that proposed
increases upon the then existing wilson-
gorman hill the first would put into
the hands of the president a power that
was not enjoyed by any ruler in chris-
tendom the second would add to the un-
fair and discriminatory tariff rates then in
force by making ad valorem increases in
them many new members of congress had
been elected on the two issues thus created
the arbitrary increase of the bonded indebt-
edness by president cleveland to maintain
a gold reserve and the unjust benefits
afforded those industries that were least in
need of aid by duties increased in exact
proportion to the strength of the industrial
combination that was to be protected

  the presentation of the two bills by the
committee on rules-with a coachcr to
each proposing to prevent amendment and
limit discussion had raised a revolt in
the house a caucus of the insurgent
republican members was held at the ebbitt
hotel and  was elected temporary chair-
man we appointed a committee to de-
mand from speaker reed a division of the
questions and time for opposition to be
heard we had seventy-five insurgents
when our committee waited on reed
and most of us were new men elected to
oppose such measures as these bills ad-
vocated he received us with sarcasm put
us off with a promise to consider our de-
mands and then set his lieutenants at
work among us under the threat of the
speakers displeasure if we continued to
insurge and the promise of his favor if we
got into line forty-one i think of our
seventy-five deserted us we were gloriously
beaten in the house on both measures

  some of the older republican members
of the house came to ask me how  had
been misled and they received with
the raised eyebrow and the silent shrug
my explanation that  had been merely
following my convictions and living up to
the promises i had made my constituents
 had supposed that i was upholding an
orthodox republican doctrine in helping

to defend the country from exploitation by
the financial interests in the matter of the
bond issue and from the greed of the
business interests in the attempt to in-
crease horizontally the tariff rates

  i do not need in this day of tariff reform
agitation to argue the injustice of the
latter measure but the bond issue-
looking back upon it now-seems the more
cruelly absurd of the two here we were
in times of peace with ample funds in the
national treasury proposing to permit the
unlimited issuance of interest-bearing gov-
ernment bonds in order to procure gold
for the national treasury out of the hoards
of the banks so that these same banks
might be able to obtain the gold again
from the treasury in return for paper
money the extent to which this sort of
absurdity might be carried would depend
solely upon the desire of the confederation
of finance to have interest-bearing govern-
ment bonds on which they might issue na-
tional bank notes since the executive was
apparently willing to yield interminably
to their greed in the belief that he was
protecting the public credit by encouraging
the financiers to attack that credit with
their raids on the government gold reserve
the whole difficulty had arisen of course
out of the agitation upon the money ques-
tion the banks were drawing upon the
government gold reserve and the govern-
ment was issuing bonds to recover the gold
again from the banks

  i had been for some years interested in
the problem of our monetary system and
had studied and discussed it among our
eastern bankers and abroad the very
fact that i was from a silver state had
put me on my guard lest a local influence
should lead me into economic error i had
grown into the belief that our system was
wrong it seemed to me that some remedy
was imperative  saw in bimetallism a
part of the remedy and i supported bimet-
allism not as a partisan of free coinage but
as an advocate of monetary reform

  the arrival of utahs two representa-
tives in the senate january s gave
the bimetallists a majority and when the
bond-issue bill came before us we made it
into a bill to permit the free coinage of
silver february  a few days later the
finance committee turned the tariff bill
into a free-coinage bill also on both
measures five republican senators voted
against tluir party -henry m idler of
colorado fred t dubois of idaho
thomas h carter of montana lee man-
tle of montana and myself we were
subsequently joined by richard f petti-
grew of south dakota within two weeks
of ray taking the oath in the senate we
were read out of the party by republican
leaders and republican organs

  all this happened so swiftly that there
was no time for any remonstrances to come
to me from salt lake city even if the
church authorities had wished to remon-
strate the fact was that the people of
utah were with us in our insurgency and
when the financial interests subsequently
appealed to the hierarchy they found the
church powerless to aid them in support
of a gold platform hut they obtained
that aid at last in support of a tariff that
was as unjust to the people as it was favor-
able t  the trusts and my continued in-
surgency led me again into a revolt
against church interference

  the thread of connection that ran
through these incidents is clear enough to
me now they were all incidents in the
progress of a partnership lietween the
church and the predatory business inter-
ests that have since so successfully ex-
ploited the country hut at the time i
saw no such connection clearly i tip-

posed that the partnership was merely a
political friendship between the smith
faction in the church and the republican
politicians who wished to use the church
and i had sufficient contempt for the
political abilities of the smiths to regard
their conspiracy rather lightly

  believing still in the good faith of the
mormon people and their real leaders in
authority  introduced a joint resolution
in the senate restoring to the church its
escheated real estate which was still in
the hands of a receiver although its per-
sonal property had been already restored
in conference with senators hoar and
allison-of the committee to which the
resolution was referred- i urged an uncon-
ditional restoration of the property arguing
that to place conditions upon the restora-
tion would be to insult the jieople who had
given so many proofs of their willingness
to obey the law and keep their pledges
the property was restored without condi-
tions by a joint resolution that passed the
senate on march is iq passed the
iiuse a week later and was approved by
the president on march  the church
was now free of the last measure of pro-
scription its people were in the enjoy-
ment of every political liberty of american
citizenship and i joined in the presiden-
tial campaign of s with no thought of
everybodys magazine

any danger threatening us that was not
common to the other communities of the
country

  but before i continue farther with these
political events  must relate a private
incident in the secret betrayal of utah-
an incident that must be related if this
narrative is to remain true to the ideals of
public duty that have thus far assumed to
inspire it an incident of which a false ac-
count was given before a senate committee
in washington during the smoot investiga-
tion of  accompanied by a denial of
responsibility by joseph i smith the man
whose authority alone encouraged and ac-
complished the tragedy-for it was a
tragedy as dark in its import to the mor-
mon community as it was terrible in its im-
mediate consequences to all our family

  by his denial of responsibility and by
secret whisper within the church smith
has placed the disgrace of the betrayal
upon my father who was guiltless of it
and blackened the memory of my dead
brother by a misrepresentation of his mo-
tives i feel that it is incumbent upon me
therefore at whatever pain to myself to
relate the whole unhappy truth of the
affair as much to defend the memory of
the dead as to denounce the betrayal of the
living to exjkjse a public treason against
the community not less than to correct a
private wrong done to the good name of
those whom it is my right to defend

  late in july  when i was in new
york on business for the presidency i
received a telegram announcing the death
of my brother apostle abraham h can-
non we had been companions all our
lives he had been the nearest to me of our
family the dearest of my friends-but even
in the first shock of my grief i realized that
my father would have a greater stroke of
sorrow to bear than i and in hurrying
back to salt lake city i nerved myself
with the hope that i might console him

  i found him and joseph f smith in the
office of the presidency sitting at their
desks my father turned as i entered and
his face was unusually pale in spite of its
composure but the moment he recognized
me his expression changed to a look of
pain that alarmed me lie rose and put
his hand on my shoulder with a tenderness
that it was his habit to conceal i know
how you feel his loss he said hoarsely
but when i think what he would have had

to pass through if he had lived-i cannot
regret his death

  the almost agonized expression of his
face as much as the terrible implication of
his words startled me with i cannot say what
horrible fear about my brother i asked-
why why-what has happened

  with a sweep of his hand toward smith
at his desk-a gesture and a look the most
unkind i ever saw him use-he answered
a few weeks ago abraham took a plural
wife lillian hamlin it became known
he would have had to face a prosecution
in court his death has saved us from a
calamity that would have been dreadful
tor the church-and for thc state
father i cried has this thing
come back again and the ink hardly dry
on the bill that restored your church prop-
erty on the pledge of honor that there would
never be another ease- i had caught the
look on smiths face and it was a look of
sullen defiance how did it happen
my father replied i know-its awful
i would have prevented it if i could i
was asked for my consent and i refused it
president smith obtained the acquiescence
of president woodruff on the plea that it
wasnt an ordinary case of polygamy but
merely a fulfillment of the biblical in-
struction that a man should take his dead
brothers wife lillian was betrothed to
david and had been sealed to him in
eternity after his death  understand that
president woodruff told abraham he
would leave the matter with them if they
wished to take the responsibility-and
president smith performed the ceremony
smith could hear every- word that was
said my father had included him in the
conversation and he was listening he
not only did not deny his guilt he ac-
cepted it in silence with an expression of
sulky disrespect

  he did not deny it later when the whole
community had learned of it he went
with apostle john henry smith to see mr
p h lannan proprietor of the salt lake
tribune to ask him not to attack the
church for this new and shocking violation
of it covenant mr lannan had been
intimately friendly with my brother and
he was distressed between his regard for
his dead friend and his obligation to do his
public duty i do not know all that the
smiths said to him but i know that the
conversation assumed that joseph f smith
had performed the marriage ceremony
 know that neither of the smiths made
any attempt to deny the assumption and
 know that joseph f smith sought to
placate mr lannan by promising it shall
not occur again and this interview was
sought by the smiths palpably because
wherever the marriage of abraham h
cannon and lillian hamlin was talked of
joseph f smith was named as the priest
who had solemnized the offending relation
if it had not been for smiths conscious-
ness of his own guilt and his knowledge
that the whole community was aware of
that guilt he would never have gone to the
tribune office to make such a promise to
mr lannan

  all of which did not prevent joseph f
smith from testifying in the smoot inves-
tigation at washington in  that he
did not marry abraham cannon and lillian
llamlin that he did not have any conversa-
tion with my father about tin- marriage
that he did not know lillian hamlin had
been betrothed to abrahams dead brother
that the first time he heard of the charge
that he had married them was when he saw
it printed in the newspapers

  if this first polygamous marriage had
been the last-if it were an isolated and

 sfc proceeding in-fare srnatf committee r privcjc-s
 and elections ly v-l ipatc 	 etc

peculiar incident as the smiths then
claimed it was and promised it should be-
it might be forgiven as generously now as
mr lannan then forgave it but about
the same time there became public another
case-that of apostle teasdale and as
this narrative shall prove here was the
beginning of a policy of treachery which
the present church leaders under joseph
f smith have since consistently prac-
ticed in defiance of the laws of the state
and the revelation of god with lies and
evasions with perjury and its suborna-
tion in violation of the most solemn
pledges to the country and through the
agency of a political tyranny that makes
serious prosecution impossible and immu-
nity a public boast

  the world understands that jktlygamy is
an enslavement of women the ecclesi-
astical authorities in utah to-day have
discovered that it is more powerful as an
enslaver of men once a man is bound in
a polygamous relation there is no place
for him in the civilized world outside of a
mormon community he must remain
there shielded by the church or suiter
elsewhere social ostracism and the prose-
cution of bigamous relations since isoo
the date of the manifesto and it is to the
period since iso that my criticism solely
applies the polygamist must be abjectly


everybodys magazine

subservient to the prophets who protect
him he must obey their orders and do
their work or endure the punishment which
they can inllict upon him and liis wives and
hischildren inveigled into a plural mar-
riage by the authority of a clandestine
religious dogma encouraged by his elders
seduced by the prospect of their favor and
impelled perhaps by a daring impulse to
take the covenant and bond that shall
swear him into the dangerous fellowship
of the lawlessly faithful-he finds himself
at once a law-breaker who must pay the
church hierarchy for his protection by
yielding to them every political right every
personal independence every freedom of
opinion every liberty of act

   i do not believe that smith fully foresaw
the policy which he has since undoubtedly
pursued i believe now as i did then that
in betraying my brother into polygamy
smith was actuated by his anger against
my father for having inspired the recession
from the doctrine that he desired to im-
pair the success of the recession by having
my brother dignify the recrudescence of
polygamy by the apostolic sanction of his
participation and that this participation
was jealously designed by smith to avenge
himself ujxm the first councillor by hav-
ing the son be one of the first to break the
law and violate the covenant i saw that
my brothers death had thwarted the con-
spiracy smith was so obviously fright-
ened-despite his pretense of defiance-
that i believed he had learned his needed
lesson and  accepted the incident as a
private tragedy on which the final curtain
had now fallen

chapter viii

the church and the interests

  meanwhile i had been taking part in the
presidential campaign of s and i had
been c of the four insurgent repub-
lican senators teller of colorado dubois
of idaho pettigrew of south dakota and
myself who withdrew from the national
republican convention at st louis in
fulfillment of our obligations to our con-
stituents when we found that the conven-
tion was dominated by that confederation
of finance in politics which has since come
to be called the system i was a mem-
ber of the committee on resolutions and

our actions in the committee had indicated
that we would probably withdraw from the
convention if it adopted the single gold
platform as dictated by senator lodge of
massachusetts acting for a group of repub-
lican leaders headed by platt of new york
and aldrich of rhode island

  at the most critical point of our con-
troversy i received a message from church
headquarters warning me that we had
made powerful friends among the leading
men of the nation and that we ought not
to jeopardize their friendship by an incon-
siderate insurgency accordingly in bolt-
ing the convention i was guilty of a new
defiance of ecclesiastical authority and a
new provocation of ecclesiastical vengeance

  president woodruff spoke to me of the
matter after i returned to utah and i ex-
plained to him that i thought the repub-
lican party under the leadership of mark
hanna and the flag of the interests had
forgotten its duty to the people of the na-
tion i argued to the president that of
all people in the world we who had suffered
so much ourselves were most bound to bow
to no unfairness ourselves and to oppose
the imposition of unfairness ujxn others
and i talked in this strain to him not be-
cause  wished his approval of my action
but because i wished to fortify him against
the approach of the emissaries of the new
republicanism who were sure to come to
him to seek the support of the church in
the campaign

  some days later while i was talking with
my father in the offices of the presidency
the secretary ushered in senator redfield
proctor of vermont i withdrew under-
standing that he wished to speak in private
with president woodruff and his council-
lors but i learned subsequently that he
had come to salt lake to persuade the
leaders of the church to use their power in
favor of the republican party throughout
the inter-mountain states

  senator proctor asked me personally
what chance i thought the party had in the
west i pointed out that the republican
platform of  had reproached grover
cleveland for his antagonism to bimetal-
lism-a doctrine favored by the american
people from tradition and interest to
quote the language of that platform-and
the republicans of the inter-mountain
states still held true to the doctrine it
had been repudiated by the st louis plat-
form of june  and the inter-mountain
states would probably refuse their electoral
votes to the republican party because of
the repudiation

   senator proctor thought that the leaders
of the church were powerful enough to
control the votes of their followers and he
argued that gratitude to the republican
party for freeing utah ought to be stronger
than the opinions of the people on a merely
economic question

   reminded him that one of our cove-
nants had been that the church was to
refrain from dictating to its followers in
politics that we had been steadily grow-
ing away from the absolutism of earlier
times and that for the sake of the peace
and progress of utah i hoped that the
leaders would keep their hands off i did
not of course convince him nor was it
necessary i was sure that no power that
the church would dare to use would be
sufficient at this time to influence the
people against their convictions

  joseph f smith soon afterward noti-
fied me that there was to be a meeting of
the church authorities in the temple and
he asked me to attend it since i had
never before been invited to one of these
conferences in the holy of holies i in-
quired the purpose of the conclave lie
replied that they desired to consider the

situation in which our people had been
placed by my action in the st louis con-
vention and to discuss the perceptible
trend of public opinion in the state i
saw then that senator proctors visit had
not been without avail

  on the appointed afternoon  went to
the sacred inner room of the temple where
the members of the presidency and several
of the apostles were waiting i shall not
describe the room nor any of the religious
ceremonies with which the conference was
opened i shall confine myself to the dis-
cussion-which was begun mildly by presi-
dent woodruff and lorenzo snow then
president of the quorum of apostles

  to my great surprise joseph f smith
made a violent republican speech de-
claring that i had humiliated the church
and alienated its political friends by with-
drawing from the st louis convention he
was followed by ileber j grant an apos-
tle who had always posed as a democrat
and he was as republican and denuncia-
tory as smith had been he declaimed
against our alienation of the great business
interests of the country whose friendship
he and other prominent mormons had done
so much to cultivate and from whom we
might now procure such advantageous co-
operation if we stood by them in politics

  president woodruff tried to defend me


everybodys magazine

ly living that in was sure i had acted con-
scientiously but by this time  desired no
intervention of prophetic mercy and no
mitigation of judgment that might come of
such intervention as soon as the presi-
dent announced that they were prepared
tu hear from me i rose and walked to the
farther side of the solemn chamber with-
drawn from the assembled prophets and
confronting them

  having first disavowed any recognition
of their right as an ecclesiastical body to
direct me in my political actions  re-
hearsed the events of the two campaigns in
which i had been elected on pledges that
i had fulfilled by my course in congress
in the senate and finally in the st louis
convention that course had been ap-
proved by the people they hail trusted
me to carry out the policies on which they
had elected me to congress they had
reiterated the trust by electing me to the
senate after  had revolted against the
republican bond and tariff measures in the
lower house i could not and would not
violate their trust now and there was no
authority on earth which i would recognize
as empowered to come between the peoples
will and the peoples elected servants

  the prophets received this defiance in
silence their expressions implied con-
demnation but none was spoken at
least not while i was there president
woodruff indicated that the conference was
at an end so far as i was concerned and
i withdrew some attempts were subse-
quently made to influence the people dur-
ing the campaign but in a half-hearted
way and vainly the democrats carried
utah overwhelmingly only three repub-
lican members of the legislature were
elected out of sixty-three

  it was this conference in the temple
which gave me my first realization that
most of the prophets had not and never
would have any feeling of citizenship in
state or nation that they considered and
would continue to consider every public
isue solely in its possible effect upon the
fortunes of their church my father alone
seemed to have a larger view but he was a
statesman of full worldly knowledge and
his eterience in congress during a part
of the  reconstruction period ami through-
out the tilden-hayes controversy had
taught him how effectively the national
power could assert itself the others

blind to such dangers seemed to feel that
under utahs sovereignty the literal king-
dom of god fas they regard their church
was to exercise an undisputed authority

  unable myself to take their viewpoint
i was conscious of a sense of transgression
against the orthodoxy of their religion i
was aware for the first time that in gain-
ing the fraternity of american citizenship
 had in some way lost the fraternity of the
faith in which i had been reared  ac-
cepted this as a necessary consequence of
our new freedom-a freedom that left us
less close and unyielding in our religious
loyalty by withdrawing the pressure that
had produced our compactness and i
hoped that in time the prophets them-
selves-or at least their successors-would
grow into a more liberal sense of citizen-
ship as their people grew i knew that
our progress must be a process of evolution
i was content to wait upon the slow amend-
ments of time

  my hope carried me through the dis-
heartening incidents of the senatorial cam-
paign for the election of arthur browns
successor-a campaign in which the power
of the hierarchy was used publicly to de-
feat the deposed apostle moses thatcher
in his second candidacy for the united
states senate but the church only
succeeded in defeating him by throwing
its influence to joseph l rawlins whom
the prophets loved as little as they loved
thatcher and i felt that in rawlinss
election the state at least gained a repre-
sentative who was worthy of it

  what was quite as sinister a use of
church influence occurred among the mor-
mons of idaho where  went to help sena-
tor fred t dubois in his campaign and
for the use of this influence joseph f
smith admitted his responsibility when 
protested to the presidency against it

  i left for w ashington soon after with an
unhappy apprehension that there were evil
influences at work in utah which might
prove powerful enough to involve the
whole community in the worst miseries of
reaction i saw those influences embodied
in joseph f smith and because he was
explosive where others were reflective he
had now more influence than previously-
there being no longer any set resistance to
him the reverence of the mormon people
for thc name of smith was as it had always
been his chief asset of popularity he
had a superlative physical impressiveness
and a passion that seemed to take the place
of magnetism in public address but he
never said anything memorable he never
showed any compelling ability of mind
he had a personal cunning without any
large intelligence and he was so many
removes from the first presidency that it
seemed unlikely he would soon attain to
that position of which the power is so great
that it only makes the blundering more
dangerous than the astute

   was going to washington before con-
gress reconvened to confer with senator
redlicld proctor he wished to see me
about the new protective tariff bill that
was proposed by the republican leaders
i wished to ask him not to use his political
influence in idaho against senator fred t
dubois who had been senator proctor s
political protege i knew that senator
proctor had once been given a semi-official
promise that the mormon church leaders
would not interfere in idaho against du-
ijois i wished to tell proctor that this
promise was not being kept and to plead
with him to give dubois fair play al-
though i knew that senator duboiss  in-
surgency had offended senator proctor

  he received me in his home in w ash-
ington with an almost paternal kindliness
that became sometimes more dictatorial

than persuasive-as the manner of an older
senator is so apt to be when he wishes to
correct the independence of a younger
colleague he explained that the house
was republican by a considerable major-
ity a good protective tariff bill would
come from that body and a careful can-
vass of the senate had proved that the bill
would pass there if i would vote for it
we have within one vote of a majority
he said as youre a devoted protection-
ist in your views-as your state is for pro-
tection-as your father and your people
feel grateful to the republican party for
leading you out of the wilderness-i have
felt that it was proper to appeal to you and
learn your views definitely if youll pledge
your support to the bill we shall not look
elsewhere fora vote-but its essential that
we should be secure of a majority

  i replied that i could not promise to vote
for the measure until  should see it it
wa true that i had been a devoted advo-
cate of protection and still believed in the
principle but i had learned something of
the way in which tariff bills were framed
and something of the influences that con-
trolled the party councils in support of
them i could not be sure that the new
measure would be any more just than the
original ihngley bill which i had helped to
defeat in the senate and the way in which
everybodys magazine

that ill had been driven through the house
was a sufficient warning to me not to har-
ness mvself in a pledge that might be
misused in legislation

  senator proctor did me the honor to say
that he did not suppose any improper sug-
gestion of personal advantage could in-
fluence me and he hoped  knew him too
well to suppose that he would use such an
argument but he added anything
that its within the political power of the
party to bestow you may expect im
authorized to sav that we will take care
of you

   as i till refused to bind myself blindly
he said with regret we had great hopes
of you it seems that we must look else-
where i will leave the question open if
you conclude to assure us of your vote for
the bill i shall see that you are restored to a
place in republican councils if i do not
liear anything from you it will be necessary
to address ourselves to one or two other
senators who are probably available

   it is of course a doctrine of present-day
republicanism that the will of the majority
must rule within the party an insurgent
is therefore an apostate the decision of
the caucus is the infallible declaration of
the creed in setting myself up as a judge
of what it was right for me to do as the
sworn representative of the people who had
elected me i was offending against party
orthodoxy as that orthodoxy was then
and is now enforced in washington

  i was given an opportunity to return to
conformity i was sent a written invitation
to attend the caucus of republican senators
after the assembling of congress and with
the other  insurgents  ignored the invita-
tion it was finally decided by the party
leaders to let the tariff bill rest until after
the inauguration of the president-elect
w illiam mckinley with the understanding
that he would call a special session to con-
sider it and in the interval the repub-
lican machine under mark hanna was
set to work to produce a republican major-
ity in the senate

   hanna was elected senator at this lime
to succeed john sherman who had been
removed to the office of secretary of state
in order to make a seat for ilanna the
republican majority was produced sena-
tor dubois had been defeated and when
the special session was called in the spring
of s my vote was no longer so urgently

needed i was invited to a republican
caucus but  was unwilling to return to
political affiliations which  might have to
renounce again for i saw the power of the
business interests in dictating the policy of
the party and i did not propose to bow to
that dictation

  when the tariff bill came before the
senate i could not in conscience support it
the beneficiaries of the bill seemed to he
dictating their own schedules and this was
notably the case with the sugar trust
which had obtained a differential between
raw and refined sugar several times greater
than the entire cost of refining i de-
nounced the injustice of the sugar schedule
particularly a mr oxnard came to re-
monstrate with me on behalf of the beet-
sugar industry of the west you know
he said what a hard time were having with
our sugar companies unless this schedules
adopted i greatly fear for our future

   replied that i was not opjosing any
protection of the struggling industries of the
country or of the sugar growers but i was
set against the extortionate differential that
the sugar trust was demanding everybody
knew that the trust had built its tremendous
industrial power upon such criminally high
protection as this differential afforded and
that its power now affected public councils
obtained improper favors and terrorized
the small competing beet-sugar companies
of the west  argued that it was time to
rally for the protection of the people as well
as of the beet-sugar industry

  he predicted that if the differential was
reduced the protection on beet sugar
would fail i laughed at him you dont
know the temper of the senate i said
 why even some of the democrats are in
favor of protecting the beet-sugar industry
that part of the bill is safe whatever hap-
pens to the rest

  senator cannon he replied with all
the scorn of superior knowledge youre
somewhat new to this matter permit me
to inform you that if we dont do our part
in supporting the sugar schedule including
the differential the friends of the schedule
in the senate will prevent us from obtain-
ing our protection

  that  retorted angrily is equiva-
lent to sav ing that the sugar trust is writ-
ing the sugar schedule i cant listen with
patience to any such insult the senate
of the united states cannot be dictated to
under the prophet in utah	

ir a matter of such importance by the
trust i will not vote fur the differential
i will continue to oppose it to the end ii
youre right-if the trust has such power-
better that our struggling sugar industry
should perish so that wc may arouse thc

people to the iniquitous manipulation that
destroyed it

  i continued to oppose the schedule
soon after  received a message from
the church authorities asking me to go
to new york to attend to some of their

financial affairs i entered live lobby of
the plaza hotel about nine oclock it
night i was met unexpectedly by
homas r cutler manager of the utah
sugar company who vi-  bishop of the
mormon church ami he asked almost

at once how the tariff bill was progressing
at washington

   had known bishop cutler for years i
knew that he had labored with extraor-
dinary zeal and intelligence to establish
the sugar industry in utah  understood

the pontiffs have
become kings of a
civil government
instead of primates
of a religious faith
e very bod v s mugazi ne

thit lie had risked his own property un-
selfishly to save the enterprise when it
was in peril and  had every reason to
expect that he would be as indignant as i
was at the proposal to use the suport of the
beet-sugarstatosin behalf of their old tyrant

   i told him of my conversation with ox-
nard im glad i said that were in-
dependent enough to refuse such an alliance
with the men who are robbing the country

  a peculiar pale smile curled bishop
cutlers thin lips well frank he re-
plied thats just what i want to see you
about we -with the intonation that is
used among prominent mormons when the
we are voicing the conclusions of the
hierarchy-wouldnt like to do anything
to hurt the sugar interests of the country
ive looked into this differential and 
dont see that it is particularly exorbitant
as a matter of fact the american sugar
refining company is doing all it can to
help us get our needed protection and we
have promised to do what we can for it in
return  hope you can see your way clear to
vote for the bill i know that the brethren 

  meaning the church authorities-will
not approve of your opposition to it

   understood what his quiet warning
meant and when we had parted  went to
my room to face the situation already i
had been told by a representative of the
inion pacific railway that the company
intended to make utah the legal home of
the corporation and to enter into a close
affiliation with the prominent men of the
church i had been asked to participate
and i had refused because  did not feel
free as a senator to become interested
in a company whose relations with the gov-
ernment were of such a character but i
had not foreseen what this affiliation meant
bishop cutlers warning opened my eyes
the church was protecting itself in its
commercial undertakings by an alliance
with the strongest and most unscrupulous
of the national enemies

  i saw that this was natural the mor-
mon leaders had been for years struggling
to save their community from poverty
proscribed by the federal laws their home
industries suffering for want of finances
lighting against the allied influences of
business in politics these leaders had been
taught to feel a fearful respect for the
power that had oppressed them they
were now being offered the aid and coun-

tenance of their old opponents our com-
munity was to advance to prosperity along
the easy road of association with the most
influential interests of the country

  i remembered the long hard struggle of
our eople  remembered the days and
nights of anxiety that i myself had known
when we were friendless and proscribed
here was an open door for us now to
power and wealth and all the comfort and
consideration that would come of these
other men better than i in personal char-
acter more experienced in legislation than
i and wiser by natural gift were willing
to vote for the bill and bishop cutler a
man whom i had always esteemed the
representative of the men whom i most
revered had urged me to support the bill
under suggestion of their anger if  refused

   saw why the interests were eager to
have our friendship we could give them
more than any other community of our
size in the whole country in the final
analysis the laws of our state and the ad-
ministration of its government would be
in the hands of the church authorities
moses thatcher might lead a rebellion for
a time but it would be brief brigham 
roberts might avow his independence in
some wonderful burst of campaign oratory
but he would be forced to fast and pray and
see visions until he yielded i might rebel
and be successful for a moment but the
inexorable power of church control would
crush me at last yet if i surrendered in
this matter of the tariff i should be doing
exactly what i had criticised so many of
my colleagues for doing-for more than one
man in the house and the senate had given
me the specious excuse that it was neces-
sary to go against his conscience here in
order to hold his influence and his power
to do good in other instances

  i did not sleep that night on the day
following i transacted the financial affairs
that  had been asked to undertake and
then i returned to washington my wife
met me at the railway station and-if you
will bear with the intimacy of such psychol-
ogy-the moment i saw her i knew how i
would vote i knew that neither the plea
of community ambition nor the equally
invalid argument of an industrial need at
home nor the financial jeopardy of my
friends who had invested in our home in-
dustries nor the fear of church antago-
nism could justify me in what would be for
under the prophet in utah

me an act of perfidy when i had taken
my oath of office  had pledged myself in
the memory of old days of injustice never
to vote as a senator for an act of injustice
the test had come

   when the tariff hill came to its final vote
in the senate i had the unhappy distinc-
tion of being the only republican senator
who voted against it a useless sacrifice
and yet if it had been my one act of public
life i should still be glad of it the in-
terests that forced the passage of that
bill are those that have since exploited the
country so shamefully it is their control
of republican party councils that has
since caused the loss of popular faith in
republicanism and the split in the party
which threatens to disrupt it it is their
control of politics in utah that has de-
stroyed the whole value of the mormon
experiment in communism and made the
mormon church an instrument of political
oppression for commercial gain they arc
the most dangerous domestic enemy that
the nation has known since the close of the
civil war my opposition was as doomed
as such single independence must always
be-but at least it was an opposition
there is a consolation in having been right
though you may have been futile

  my father visiting washington soon
afterward took occasion to criticise my
vote publicly in a newspaper interview
but he was content by that criticism to
clear himself and his colleagues of any
responsibility for my act  you made a
great mistake he told me privately
you are alienating the friends who have
done so much for us

  many reports soon reached me of at-
tacks that were being made uxn me by
the ecclesiastical authorities particularly
by joseph f smith and apostle heber j
grant the formal criticism passed upon
me by my father was magnified to make
my tariff vote appear an inexcusable party
and community defection a vigorous and
determined opposition was raised against me
and in this smith and his followers were
aided by the perfect svstemof churchcontrol
in utah-a system of complete ecclesiastical
tyranny under the guise of democracy

practically every mormon man is in the
priesthood nearly every mormon man
has some concrete authority t exercise in
addition to holding his ordination as an
the ncxt instalment f

elder obedience to his superior i- essen-
tial to his ambition to rise to higher dignity
in the church and obedience to his supe-
riors is necessary in order to attract obe-
dience to himself from his subordinates
there can be no lay jealousy of priestly
interference in politics because there are
no laymen in the proper sense of the word
a mans worldly success in life is largely
involved in his success as a churchman
since thc church commands the opportuni-
ties of enterprise and the leaders of the
church are the states most powerful men
of affairs it is not uncommon in any of
our american communities for men to use
their church membership to support their
business but in utah the mormons prac-
tically must do so and even the gentiles
find it wise to be subservient

  add to this temporal power of the
church the fact that il was establishing a
policy of seeking material success for its
people and you have the explanation of
its eagerness to accept an alliance with the
interests and of its hostility to any one
who opposed that alliance the mormons
dispossessed of their means by the migra-
tion from illinois had been taught the
difficulty of obtaining wealth and the value
of it when once obtained they fancied
themselves set apart in the mountains by
the worlds exclusion they were ambi-
tious to make themselves as financially
powerful in proportion to their numbers as
the jews were and it was a common argu-
ment among them that the worlds respect
had turned to the jews because of the de-
pendence of christian governments upon
the jewish financiers

  the exploitation of this solid mass of in-
dustry and thrift could not long be ob-
scured from the eyes of the east the
honest desire of the mormon leaders to
benefit their people by an alliance with
financial power made them the easy vic-
tims of such an alliance w ith the death
of the older men of the hierarchy the
church administration lost its tradition of
religious leadership for the good of the
community solely and the new leaders be-
came eager for financial aggrandizement
for the sake of power like every other
church that has added a temporal scepter
to its spiritual authority its pontiffs have
become kings of a civil government in-
stead of primates of a religious faith

molly with her hand on the door
knob turned to the two children in
the kitchen her voice was tender
and full uf pain

  wont you be still children children
wont you

  then she softly opened the door and
stepped noiselessly into the twilight room
her husband lay asleep on the bed stretched
flat and fully dressed she leaned over the
breathing living bulk of man and brought
her tender face close to his hot fevered
cheeks and his rough gray hair in the
darkness he seemed so near and so far-so
real and so unsubstantial it was at that
moment of dusk when people draw close to
one another

  molly hesitated she wanted to pray
and had forgotten how she looked about
the room as if she expected to see some
great power and couldnt find it she
could only say awkwardly

  please -lease spare him- and me i
cant lse him i cant i cant

  and then she murmured to herself all
bitterly and brokenly ive lost him al-
ready

  she felt swiftly over his soft warm cotton
shirt for his hand it was as if she were trying
to take hold of him and keep him and then
a tear slid dovn to her chin and fell and
touched the l-t fevered cheek

 the man stirred uncomfortably you
 moll his voice was thick and husky

 richard she cried

 she suddenly pushed her arm behind the
 pillow and drew his head up and kissed him
 passionately

 say you love me she whispered

 there was a deep silence

 richard

 he did not answer

  richard

 and then he suddenly pushed her off
 struggled and sat up she sank back on
 her knees gasping sobbing her mind a little
 wild

 love he muttered youve let me
 oversleep he leaned close menacingly
  itwtr lei me oversleep

 he gripped her arm hard and looked into
 her face

 answer me this

 yes she said in a colorless voice

  its time to go to work aint it so

 she said nothing

 damn you-its time to go to work
 aint it so

 	yes iick she murmured its time to
 go to work hut youre not fit-

 he tumbled out of bed stood up and
 then as lie was very sick and felt dizzy he
 held on t the bedpost but he spoke in
 a blaze of anger

  and you know were piling up a tonnage
record and you know the blooming-mill de-
pends on me and you know i ll be fired if i
dont mark time-his voice put on a cut-
ting edge-and you come babying around
-say i love you-shucks get me my
supper and be quick about it

  lie added something under his breath as
he went reeling into the kitchen the two
children nellie and bob playing in a cor-
ner stopped when they saw him and slid out
the back door into the evening

  you better get out he muttered

  then he sank all in a lump in a kitchen
chair and leaned his head on the oilcloth
covered table his fingers ran through his
rough gray hair and his lean face with
its burning blue eyes and knotty flushed
cheeks and big lips was half shadowy half
starting out in the gaslight above him be-
hind him the shiny black stove was breath-
ing up heat about a sputtering coffeepot and
a pan of potatoes there were chairs and
a cupboard two windows and a door-a
neat compact room

  molly came in quietly her face very pale
she poured off a cup of coffee lightened it
with milk and set it before him then she
hesitatingly pushed some potato slices on
a plate and set it beside the coffee he
roughly pushed the plate aside

  take it away-fool

  she took it away quickly

 get me the sug r

 she suddenly wheeled around i    - him
 and spoke quietly say  

 he looked up at the whil n  m  
 and laughed harshly gelling mil ions
 eh well here goes and he began sip-
 ping the coffee slowly

 she stood silent and llu-n she drew up a
 chair and sat at the table beside him she
 made up her mind then to keep him from
 the mill at any cost she spoke quietly
 youre sick youre not going to work
 to-night

 whos going to stop me

 he gave her a quick glance  you eh 
 she leaned toward him and lowered her
 voice ive been silent years-now im
 going to speak

 he clenched his fists and loosed his quick
 temper again shut up my god you

woman-

then she broke in with a sharp cry
see see li hat an animal youre gelt nig

saw the lire in her clear gray eyes

 yes she whispered tensely youre
 not a man any more

 he began sipping the coffee again in
 the thi k warm silence they heard the chil-
 dren laughing is they ran alter each other

  richard said molly softly youre not
 even a decent father any more

 he sipped again at the coffee

 and you think she went on that a
 woman can stand for anything she cant
 -she wont go any farther -she paused
 and spaced the words-go-any-farther-
 and ill leave you

 he went on sipping coffee and then sud-
 denly he took a deep breath expanding his
 chest and rested his head in his hand

 who does the work eh

  i guess i do as much as you said molly

 well he muttered sullenly who
 brings in the money

  you do

  thirty-live dollars a week

   well he muttered  what more do you
want

  she gave a strange short laugh and
looked down at the floor it might do for
a man she breathed but not for a woman
and you know it

  know what

  oh -nothing

  he began sipping his coffee again and
then her heart seemed to crack open and the
terrible pang shot through her throat and to
her lips and she cried  richard-you dont
love me you dont love me any more
his mouth opened to speak but he said
nothing he looked at her with a tragic
sullenness a bitter defiance

  richard she cried again your works
come between us you-a man of thirty-
live-your hairs gray

  he started to speak again but said
nothing she leaned closer and spoke
her heart out the words lashing
him

  the steel mills killing you its
the twelve-hour day twelve hours a
day fora whole week-and then twelve
hours for seven nights seven nights
you dont sleep with me i never see
you more than an hour at a time and
then youre dead tired she raised her
voice to a quivering cry itd been
better if wed a been found dead in
each others arms the night after we
married when we knew there was a
god in this world our children were
damned not born

  the door opened softly then and a
little thin girl with tossing brown
curls ran in to her mother mugger
mugger

  the mother drew the little one close
and patted a cheek and spoke in a
low dry voice yes nellie
mugger-come out and see what
we got

  i cant now-please nellie run
along

 but mugger-

  run along please please

   the little girl went out slow ly stilling
quick tiny sobs

  molly turned a face infinitely sad
upon her husband and spoke in a
voice tender with pain this isnt a
home for our children its no home
where the man only eats and sleeps

closed her eyes when i think its our chil-

full of things that might ik- turned to good-

   she slopped staring into a terrible future

  its all the twelve-hour day she mut-

-no more thats what you are youre

   he cleared his throat he shuffled his feet
he drew a little nearer and at last his voice-
rose trembling anything else eh

  she looked suddenly straight in his eyes
and kept his gaze then she spoke in a

voice that had lightning in it-that seemed
to stab through him like a long needle

  yes-you and i have lived as if there
werent any god and youve lost your soul
richard youve lost your soul you cant

  his face struggled violently he opened
and closed his mouth then he half closed

  he arose one hand pressed on the table
and then the clock slow ly si ruc k five

  he staggered across the room picked his
hat and coat from a wall-hook and put them
on molly leaped up with a low cry rushed
to the door and stood with an arm across it
her fact as white with agony

  youre not going she murmured
breathlessly

  not

  he advanced toward her

  dick she cried youre not going

  he seized her two arms and pushed her
aside ojiened the door and stepped out
she gave a wild cry that called the children
home as he slammed the door and reeled
down the street

  the evening was chilly making him shiver
and in the smoky air street-lamps burned
dimly about him he turned the corner
and walked down a street on one side
at the end of the street stood the black wall
of the mill grounds on the other the smoke-
blackened mill houses each set in a cinder-
dead soil that never bloomed

  richard felt sick utterly sick he reeled
through the smoky air turned a corner be-
fore the library and crossed a bridge into
the mill grounds many other men were
hurrying with him as they went on
suddenly i heir grim faces were splashed by
far fires and strange lights they began step-
ping over intricate tangles of railway tracks
in the yards and all the time their faces
shone brighter yet not a man of them took
any interest though all about them was
one of the sublime scenes of america

  they did not seem to see the shining
tracks the glistening red and green lanterns
the mills glowing through their windows like
buildings eaten with lire the tongues of
flames through the roofs the vast swirls of
blaze and rerl-shuddering smoke clouds and
the thousand chimney pipes looking through
the changing lights through all this
among the buildings over the rails in the
thick of a roar of machinery a thunder and
thirr and crash of tools a confusion of yard-
engines shrieking up and down with little
flat-cars a hurry of lanterns-through it all
the men moved silently dully lit on every
side their black greasy overalls glistening
as they moved

  richard entered a large square building
where the sloping many-beamed roof was
in huge shadows set in the solid masonry
of the floor were steel trapdoors a man
grasping a lever stood in front of one of
these just as an overhead crane like a
bridge running down the room came whiz-
zing along from the crane hung sus-
pended a huge steel hand  stopped above
the man he at once pulled the lever and
the trapdoor at his feet opened like a huge
mouth revealing the soaking pit this
was a well of fire-white-hot-intolerable to
the eye nor could the flesh come near it
but the huge steel hand never faltered it
reached down into the very hell of fire
and slowly drew out a dazzling sizzling
white-hot ten-ton ingot of stcei this it
bore down the room and shoved on to
steel rollers that ran off into the adjoining
room

  richard entered this next room at his
side the rollersone next to theother in a long
path were turning and the ingot slid over
them and made straight for a huge clothes
wringer that stood in its path suddenly
it hit this steel-wringer with a loud spla
-there was a shower of sparks and it went
through with a wild klong-a-a--like the
howl of a hungry lioness the great wringer
pressed the steel out but no sooner had it
emerged on the other side longer and flatter
than it was shot back and so back and
forth until it was thinned into a long wide
ribbon of steel and was rolled away to the
next room to be cooled and sheared

  laborers hovered about the immense and
intricate wringer and as the blazing ingot
passed their faces and forms came and went
sharp and shadowy two men stood at op-
posite sides on a little platform above the
wringer each with his hand on a lever
one controlled the direction of the rolls the
other the force of the pressure richard
relieved the man at the pressure-lever and
at once his work began

  it was one of the most terrible nights of
his life he was sick he could hardly hold
his head straight and yet he had to have a
clear eye a steady hand and infinite pa-
tience his gaze never left the hurrying
ingot and he had to gauge its thickness and
what it would stand each time it drew
near it shot over him a consuming heat that
burnt and smothered and made the flesh
tingle intolerably ordinarily he would not
have felt this but to-night he was sick the
the cog

glare too hurl his eyes and the slecl lever
got hot under his gloves

  there was no breathing spell ingot fol-
lowed ingot without pause he pulled the
lever and then with the wild klong-a-a-l
a shower oi sparks a smell of powder the
ingot was squeezed the speed was territic
and grew worse or the little foreman had
given out the impression that his men must
pile up a record and beat the output of the
other mills and the responsibility was
what made a man old-for it anything went
wrong if an ingot was spoiled or thc mill
stopped the money loss to the workers as
well as to the mill was very large- for the
men were paid by the ton

  hour followed hour and richard pressed
the lever down or pulled it up his face
twisted with thc torture of the toil every
nerve every muscle strained and alert and
in action his head now and then went
dizzy and his face paled whenever he
winked he saw a red ingot sliding back and
forth and worst of all his heart was in
wild and new revolt he heard the cry of

his wife her word kept beating tin- li

was this for twelve hours and tlu-n a bit

  and then each time an ingot hit the
wringersome phrase went through his head
and made him struggle inwardly bang
whow-ow-ow - went an ingot-and
molly was murmuring that he had no soul
that he did not love her-rang-and she
was speaking of the children-bang- and
she told him how he had stopped his read-

he didnt love molly how could he-bang

now and then tin-
whole room turned
red xow he seemed
to be pushing the
lever down over the
floating face of
molly and her fear-
ful cry rail through
the mill ntow by a
mighty effort he saw
clearly again the
hovering laborers all
sharp and shadowy
the advancing ingot
the gloomy dark
wringer the menac-
ing heights above
him hut molly
kept saying richard you dont love me
any more-you dont love me

  so he gave the lever a good jam there
was a weird unusual crash a splutter and
a dozen men roared together the rolls
stopped and in the queer silence richard
saw clearly again he had jammed an
ingot and broken a coupling sleeve a
sickening horror went through him it
meant the loss of an hours time he had
tied up the whole mill and all the other
workers would lose in their wages too

  all the men of the section came rushing
toward him shouting angrily and then
suddenly the little foreman came dancing up

   the little fellow swung a fist in richards
face and shrieked  i amn you-damn you
just as were piling up a tonnage-record
ill trim you for this-

   then suddenly fifteen years of silent pres-
sure blew off demons raged in richards
heart his brain went hot with his power-
ful hands he gripped the little foreman by
the throat

  you damned little pusher he snapped
go to hell

 the foreman
choked and sput-
tered as he was re-
leased and the ring
of workmen stifled
their smiles then
the foreman backed
awaymuttering i
suppose you know
what this means
 yes said rich-
ard it means good-
night

  he turned and
walked off quietly
he went out into
the yards a brown
dawn was searching
its way through the
swirling smoke and
in the vague light all
the confusion and
stir of the yards
went on hut it
never stopped
neither day nor
night through the
years the sick
man hot from the
flames trembled in
the chilly air of the
morning his head however was acutely
clear he saw all about him it must have
been the blood in him he reasoned he
came of old american stock-men and
women who had given up the comfort and
ease of home and followed their god to
worship him in the west-there in sweat
poverty and hardship finding a freedom for
the soul he too could make the sacrifice
he too could go west the west still
called the freeman the mighty farmlands
needed labor-the northwest needed pio-
neers there too was room for little chil-
dren and sun and wind and a green space
for the soul

  he was astonished to find how calmly he
took it all he felt as if he had left him-
self in the mill and was a different man a
world slid off his shoulders he was free
his lips were loosed in one stroke he had
regained his manhood for years the mills
had muzzled him worked him sweated him
flung him out for a sleep and a bite pulled
him back into the machinery taken from
him his home his friends his books his
church his leisure his citizenship his free

with his powerful hands he gripped tiie
little fkkiav hv tiie throat
the

speech-and wasted the man that might
have been xow he had jerked himself free

  he reached the street the wind was
blowing away and the skies were clear abo e
him he looked up he beheld the fading
stars and suddenly he stood still- and a
wave of glory swept over him something
broke within him -some crust about his
heart-and like a revelation he was charged
with light the glad tears came to his eyes
he felt that he was beginning to live lie-
wanted to open his lips that his open heart
might send its glory into words he heard
the wind singing about him he heard the
night-world laboring the engines puffing
the mills roaring he saw the lights of the
street and human beings beneath them
his heart went out to the great world

  and then as he went on with fresh tides
of life pouring through him his soul went
out to his own he thought of his own
children he thought of his own wife he
marveled at the strange years he had just
been through-he marveled at the miserable
father and husband he had been the
father-passion long numb awoke and struck
his heart his mans love for this woman
made him yearn with tenderness and the
glory bore him along like a boy in love

  he turned up the dim street-the house
was alight he stepped around to the rear
and pushed open the kitchen door and en-
tered very softly molly was building a

 and as he felt her arms about him-tight
 tight-her lips pressed to his her living

 was as if there was a rip in his heart love
 made him tremble and he murmured

mary magdalene
a other plays

by  hartley  davis

few productions in new york have been that his work is not to be lightly treated
more universally or more respectfully con- even by dramatic critics
demned than  alary magdalene in which this biblical play was presented in the
olga ncthersole appeared as the star the new theatre although not under the dis-
position of maurice maeterlinck is such tion of its management in the beauty and

s
the players

splendor of ihe stage setting and costuming
and the careful consideration of artistic de-
tail it was entirely worthy of that temple
of art moreover it was accompanied by
wonderful music based on oriental and
hebraic melodies composed by modest
altschuler and played by tin- russian sym-
phony orchestra under his direction

  to these tilings the critics gave the high
praise that was their due but to me the
play they found so dull was far greater than
these artistic accessories-indeed the most
impressive play i have ever seen perhaps
as the critics maintained there are only two
dramatic moments in the drama if it be
measured by the broadway standard or
even by the rules of pure technique to
me however these seemed but pale shad-
ows of unreal things beside the majestic
power of that greatest most wonderful
most splendid drama in all history

  these two theatric scenes did not give me
the thrill which came with the simple an-
nouncement that the house of simon the
leper where christ stayed in bethany was
just a little way from the mansion of silanus
whose splendors were before ones eyes
and when silanus truly a noble roman and
a philosopher talked of simon and his
family of the coming and going of the
nazarene in simple kindly neighborly
fashion i felt that if  were in the garden of
silanus i too could see the house of simon
the leper and the coming and going of the
nazarene

  this compelling illusion of nearness
brought with it a reverent awe that was al-
most suffocating i fear that to most of
us the story of christ familiar as it is
seems something far off dimmed by the
mist of years and we grasp as in a dream
conventionalized forms of an idea that has
small reality for us for me this play
made the story vivid-real

  so il was that when the love of the sjk-c-
tacular lucius for the gorgeously bedizened
mary magdalene was shown i was thinking
of the house of simon the leper and of him
who lived there thc characters who
played ixvi the publican cleophas the mon
cured of dropsy and all the others meant
nothing more to me than had their names
nor was i impressed when the voice of the
nazarene was heard the voice that drew
mary magdalene into the crowd only to be
attacked and stripped of her finery even
when i heard the voice proclaim let him

who is without sin among you it tlx iri
stone i was unmoved though hi- -un- 
according to constituted authority 
of the two great dramatic muim
me there was no illusion in that voie 
knew it belonged to an actor not t thc
nazarene yet he seemed somewhere mar
and presently he would return to the house
of simon the leper jusl around the corner
and if  were in the garden of silanus i
could see him

  that is the reason why it was of small
concern whether or not the magdalene loved
the ardent lucius he was interesting only
as representing the altitude of his roman
government toward the nazarene and his
followers that the heart of the courtesan
should have been touched by the nazarene
seemed natural enough but i could not be
interested in the blind ignorant human
jealousy of the young roman and it is upon
this from a technical standpoint that the
whole play revolves the background over-
whelms that which takes place before ones
eyes and without this background the play
holds nothing to lift it above the common-
place the vital thing is that in mary
magdalene one is brought almost face to
face with the living breathing saviour of
man

  especially i this true in the second act
and never before had  realized how mar-
velous is the thaumaturgy of the stage the
possibilities of its illusion because  never
had known anything in the theatre so over-
poweringly dramatic silanus and appius
have come to the home of mary magdalene
in a turmoil of emotions that have stirred
their souls beyond belief they have just
looked upon the greatest of all the miracles
-the raising of lazarus from the dead

  they describe what has taken place before
their very eyes  ppius hard-headed prac-
tical man of affairs to whom seeing is be-
lieving accepts what he has seen as a
miracle and can find no words to express
the wonder of it silanus the philosopher
without trying to discredit the evidence of
his senses seeks vainly for some explanation
that will satisfy himself they have stood
face to face with something mightier than
their imaginations they speak with the
simple lofty eloquence of the gospels-
indeed nearly the whole of the eleventh
chapter of john is woven into the dialogue
i had a conviction stronger than any illu-
sion the stage has ever given me that i was


evcrylxxlys magazine

hearing at liisl hand the stories of eye-
witnesses of lazaruss resurrection the
illusion was complete without the appear-
ance of lazarus clad in his white death-
clothes the stamp of the grave on his worn
pallid face straight from his sepulcher he
came and was among us when he sum-
moned mary magdalene in the name of the
master one felt that all the powers of earth
could not stay her least of all the passion
of lucius

  so nil-pervading so profound was the

veloped and it appears to reach a great
climax but on the stage the illusion of the
mighty thing beyond crushes it into noth-
ingness

  so it seems plain that one may not judge
this play by the familiar canons of the
drama any more than by the broadway
standard it is too big too significant

  that olga nethersole played mary mag-
dalene meant little to me this was as true
of her fine moments as of her irritating ones
and it was only with an effort that i was

wixtiiroi- jane oaker hamilton revelle a e matthews may blayxey
florence idxicy vxd albert tavernihr in the importance
or being earnest

tragic splendor of the drama in the back-
ground so keen was the realization of it
that the playing of the last act on the stage
went for nothing the idea of lucius trying
to barter the safety of the xazarene for mag-
dalene seemed so futile so pitifully weak
one cannot conceive of these little humans
staying the magnificent tragedy of calvary

  when one reads the play it is the last
act that seems the most powerful and im-
pressive it is finely constructed and de-

conscious of either she makes one feel
that she was intended to be a really great
actress but that by her own foolish affecta-
tions and the pettiness of her ideas she has
thwarted the career open to her but one
was splendidly conscious of arthur forrest
as silanus for he rose to fine heights he
was worthy of the play he had the im-
pressive dignity of one who was noble by
nature as well as by rank and who was truly
a philosopher his diction was almost

feet mil the spirit of the plnv was in him
and charles hanford too i liked as ap-
piu for there was in his portrayal whether
t was by accident or design is of small mo-
ment  touch of motlernity that heled to
bridge over the chasm of years

  much of tht honor for the presentation of
the play belongs to hugh ford who staged
it and who won a triumph that will long
endure the production of  mary magda-
l ne saved the first part of the theatrical
season in new york from the common-
place there had been a marked lowering
of the standard established in the two pre-
ceding seasons especially in the value of the
themes the number of failures during the
first half of the season was extraordinarily
large and the successes with one or two
exceptions presented nothing significant in
the way of new ideas or the interpretation
of familiar ones

  those who have been lifting their voices
for american drama have derived much
encouragement from the wholesale failure
of foreign plays which means that charles
frohman their chief purveyor has suffered
severely the truth however is that these
plays failed not so much because they were
foreign although that always is a factor as
because they were bad measured by an
american standard for we are gradually
developing an american standard although
it is still nebulous

  the unprofitableness of the early season
cannot be charged to errors of judgment on
the part of the public which has been more
than generous in several instances for while
there has been no failure that was not
justified there have been successes not
wholly deserved not only has an amazing
lumber of piffling plays been presented but

i	can recall no season in which so many
players have been hopelessly miscast

  the new theatre started its regular sea-
son with a failure due to this miscasting
malady never have  seen a more beauti-
ful production than that of the merry
wives of windsor from the viewpoint of
scenery and costuming the last scene of
ii- m windsor park with the misty moon-
light in the trees and the rollicking mas-
queraders in their diaphanous robes was
the most exquisitely lovely thing i have
ever seen on the stage it alone almost
made the whole production worth while

  hut it was badly acted in a subdued low-
pressure key dragging its dull length to that

last beautiful scene surely had ben jonson
seen this production he would not have
written-never yet had a spectator who
did not think it too soon ended the
merry wives of windsor is pure farce and
not all of it is lively and amusing in this day
tradition has it that queen elizabeth
whose reputation for virtue was higher than
for taste-both being exaggerated prob-
ably-was so delighted with sir john fa-
staff that she commanded shakespeare to
write a comedy showing the fat knight in
love and ordered that it be finished in four-
teen days subsequently this farce the
result was rewritten and enlarged

  none of the players who took part in the
presentation gained the slightest prestige
which goes to show that the new theatre
has not yet been able to gather or to train
actors who are perfectly at home in blank
verse

  on the heels of the failure of the shake-
spearean play the new theatre company
gave the thunderbolt sir arthur
wing pineros latest production which be-
cause of its failure in london no american
manager cared to produce and it scored a
triumph the remarkably fine acting being
a compelling factor

  there is no question that pinero is the
foremost living dramatist writing in eng-
lish a master of his craft who deals in ideas
he has profound knowledge of the laws that
govern the play but often like some great
corporation lawyers he makes use of this
knowledge to circumvent the laws

  in all his later plays-that is those w ritten
since the firm establishment of his fame and
fortune-the dominant notion is a flaying of
the english middle class he is so merci-
lessly bitter that one suspects he is seeking
to avenge some injustice suffered in his
struggling days his house in order
was severe enough but it does not compare
with the thunderbolt either as a philip-
pic or as a drama this latest play per-
haps the best constructed that pinero has
written is far from perfect because both
actual truth and dramatic truth are sacri-
ficed to the flagellation of the sordid ugliness
of the characters it failed in london be-
cause national resentment of the convinc-
ing fidelity of the scenes was so strong that
the interest in the really dramatic develop-
ment of the story could not overcome it
in new york the audiences laughed at the
portrayal of concentrated meanness and
olga nethersolk in the title role of maeterlincks
 mary magdalene
	everybody

were renl l receive the real lranta with
unbiased minds

  the story is about an english provincial
family deadly respectable shabby genteel
unspeakably narrow and sordid whose chief
concern is the distribution of the money left
by a dead brother who made a fortune as a
brewer and who would have nothing to do
with his family until he was on his death-
bed while the dead brother lies upstairs
the members of the family mingle hypocrit-
ical grief with wolfish interest  his money
and anxiety about a will for thc dead
man has left in paris an illegitimate daugh-
ter of whom he was very fond and the nat-
ural supposition is that most of his fortune
is left to her but no will can be found
and if there is none the large fortune must
be divided among the brothers and sister

  the thunderbolt descends when by a
manifestation of dramatic power that is
pinero at his best it is shown that there was
a will and that it was destroyed by phyllis
morlimore the wife of one of the brothers
-the only decent one her motive was to
save herself from the cruel operation of a
certain class distinction-a distinction al-
most impossible for americans to grasp
her father was a grocer and her husbands
family in their consciousness of superiority
had inflicted upon her a succession of petty
persecutions

  il	seemed to me that the scene in which
the guilty wife makes confession to her hus-
band failed of the effect it should have had
because thais lawton who played the role
did not rise to its possibilities from this
point on there is powerful moving absorb-
ing drama although a e anson as the
decent thaddeus morlimore played with
little discrimination he could not seriously
detract from the gripping interest in the
scene in which he appeared before his
brothers and the lawyers and took upon his
own shoulders the burden of his wifes crime
only to be trapped because his tale was so
ill prepared in all of pineros many plays
there is nothing so fine as this scene and
the interest carries into the last act when
the lawyers suggest an equitable though
hardly legal solution carefully withdrawing
so that it may be carried out

  then one sees something of the real char-
acter of the moriimores although pinero
is at little pains to develop it and the struc-
tural weakness of the play lies in the fact
that these important revelations are held

 magazine

back until the very end if one thinks a
little it becomes plain that the unspeakable
meanness of the morlimore family is not
wholly of their own choosing like most of
us they are largely the victims of circum-
stance of conditions they had not the
strength lo overcome especially is this
true of james morlimore the head of the
family who dominates all the rest back of
his vulgarity his lust for money is a certain
rugged sense of honesty and fairness that
makes one respect him this seems to be a
concession that pinero the dramatist de-
manded from pinero the man if the real
truth about the morlimores were shown at
the beginning the thunderbolt  would be
a much stronger and much finer play but the
author could not have fed so fat the ancient
grudge he bears the english middle classes

  never have i seen a finer characteriza-
tion than louis calverts james morlimore
never has any player given me a more per-
fect sense of reality it did not seem like
acting at all he lived the character as
perfect in their way were the portrayals of
albert bruning as stephen morlimore and
ferdinand gottschalk as colonel pouting
-indeed this is the best characterization
that mr gottschalk has given in the new
theatre while e m holland and ben john-
son played the lawyers so effectively that
one realizes how greatly real acting in small
parts can add to a performance

  not since she appeared in  naughty an-
thony the first comedy that david belasco
wrote-and the only one i believe-has
blanche bates departed from an emotional
role until this season in nobodys
widow  she has scored the greatest finan-
cial success of her career the comedy
-really it is more a farce-is thc lightest
flimsiest thing with some extremely clever
dialogue its spirit is essentially french
and one feels that the parisian writers who
are infinitely more skillful than any others
in this sort of thing would have made more
of the idea there is no question that
blanche bates delights her audiences she
is too good an actress to fail in anything but
she is not a comedienne and the hyper-
critical at least feel that she is lacking in
a delicate finesse in the exquisite touch of
evanescent humor that is the soul of high
comedy but we have very little high
comedy on the stage nowadays and only
one high comedienne henrietta crosman

  the chief charm of  nobodys widow
which was written by avery llopwood lies
in the fact that it appears to be exceedingly
naughty while as a matter of fact it is
highly moral the heroine having decided
tu separate from her titled british husband
announces the fact that sin- is a widow
then the husband appears and determines
to make her come back to him and this
oilers opportunity for some delicious scenes
especially when the husband persists in
making a midnight visit to her boudoir
bruce mcrae who plays the husband
seems to have a keener notion of the whim-
sical humor of the farce than docs the star
he acts the part brilliantly

  the cub by thompson buchanan in
which douglas fairbanks is the star is an
extraordinarily clever satire on the ken-
tucky feud and it keeps the audiences in
roars of laughter from the rise of the curtain
to the end possibly it would be more suc-
cessful as a play if there were less laughter
in it but the chief weakness is that the
character of the hero an inexperienced cub
reporter sent to investigate a feud is not
defined one laughs at him more than with
him which doesnt make for financial suc-
cess and to the very end one isnt sure
whether he has courage or whether he
merely hasnt sense enough to le afraid
and those familiar with the cocksureness of
mr fairbanks and the bubbling aggressive
youth of him can realize how he accentuates
the fundamental weakness of the play

  after a long absence may irwin returned
to the new york stage to prove again that
 one can quite take her place because of
her homelysimple honest rollicking humor
which is as irresistible as it is spontaneous
booth tarkington and harry leon wilson
have provided her with an elementary ve-
hicle-getting a polish-that displays
her powers to fine advantage-and nothing
more is necessary it is amusing that these
two highly intellectual forceful brilliant
men who have won real literary distinction
should shine as authors of home-cooking
drama but the huge royalty returns must
salve their pride

  apart from may irwin as mrs jim the
comedy doesnt amount to much it is
just a jolly evenings entertainment for
people who want to laugh

  this description is true also of william
collier in  ill be hanged if i do of which
lie and edgar selwyn are the authors

originally a one-act skit two more acts
have been tacked on to ii in rather hap-
hazard fashion and the three hang together
 the slenderest thread but mr collier
has provided himself with innumerable
bright lines which lie reads in his own in-
imitable way with his deadly serious face
for instance when a young woman to whom
he had been engaged says if  had mar-
ried you i should have committed suicide
he retorts you would have fallen on my
dead body really a william collier play
is a monologue that changes from season
to season with actors to give it back-
ground and to allow the star to change his
clothes mr collier is always delightfully
the same

  years ago oscar hammerstein built a
great amusement place which included a big
music hall he called the olympia a theatre
called the criterion and a roof garden
financial stress came upon him and he lost
the building with everything else sturdily
he set to work to make another fortune out
of inventions and again appeared as a factor
in amusements eventually becoming an in-
ternational figure by establishing a grand
opera company that was a rival of the
metropolitan when that institution gave
mr hammerstein some millions to retire
from the grand opera field he had among
his singers a tiny vivacious little italian
with a wonderful soprano voice much bigger
than she-emma trentini he decided to
exploit her in light opera so rida johnson
young was commissioned to write what
proved to be a silly book and victor herbert
to compose some of the finest music he has
given to light opera

  also mr hammerstein had for naughty
marietta a new tenor-a young man from
indiana who is said to have been dis-
covered and brought to the impresarios
attention by gus edwards writer of pop-
ular songs in any case orville harrold
is a very remarkable tenor and is expected
to make a real sensation in grand opera
whither he is bound

  the little trentini with her wonderful
 ivacity her naive whole-souled enthusiasm
and her wonderful voice the herbert music
the new tenor and the fine acting of fd-
ward martindel united to make a wonderful
triumph for mr hammerstein and this
in the olympia renamed the new york
whose doors he had never entered since he
left it as the owner

ohn smith to the
bar

  at these words the
mass that congested
thecourt room stirred
expectantly a mo-
ment before just as
smith entered the great double doors a
voice had shouted something that he didnt
quite catch now the officers scattered
about the room called in offensive tones
stand up hats off-and-here you
over there take off your hat

  from the rear of the room smith could
easily see over the heads of the intimidated
crowd the judges gowned in black
were making their dignified way to the
bench

  john smith to the bar

  with his hat in his hand smith started
one of the officers in the rear of the room
seeing him trying to worm his way forward
called come hurry up and then to the
crowd immediately in front make way
there

  to save the contents of his bulging over-
coat pockets smith put on his hat and
pushed and pulled his way into the crowd
his elbow caught a stout person in the spare
rib the fat one turned with a look of
sudden resentment to behold a smooth-
shaven rosy-cheeked broad-shouldered boy
with hair slightly sprinkled with gray the
expression on the fat mans face changed
fat or thin men whom smith jostled glared

s

first then saw his face and-stopped glaring
they always did

  as he neared the officer where the crowd
was not so great smith removed his hat
just as that functionary again shouted
take off your hat

  he turned and smiled a full-moon smile
right in the officers face and said i beat
you to it i had it off first some one
laughed-the officer frownedgrowled  hur-
ry up and pointed to the little gate that
separated the trial end of the room from the
free and equal who never missed a trial

  the clerk of the court having been kept
waiting fifteen seconds -called crossly
come on

  the officer who stood guard at the little
gate which opened and closed like a laugh
at the free and equal joke in the declara-
tion of independence gave him a shove as
he passed through and said hurry up

  as he entered the enclosure willing hands
guided smith with turn and push frown and
nod until he found himself at the foot of the
platform facing the impatient clerk

   you are charged with exceeding the
speed limit with your automobile-wot-
yougottosay have you counsel it
sounded so like a german sentence that
smiths face lit up with that full-moon
smile and he said

  whats that

  the impatient clerk frowned are you
guilty or not guilty

   i dont know i should like to hear
the childrens specialist

what the cop says ahnut it  have tht
privilege have i not and i dont need a
lawyer youll treat me all right

  the big boyish voice clear and steady
tilled the room the prisoners round smil-
ing face was looking up at the thin and
peevish face of the clerk their eyes met
slowly the frown melted from i hr clerks
face until he was giving back in the wa f
a smile the best he could do jt was not
smiths smile alone but the whole face

  certainly said the clerk and turning
to the judges he added the case goes on
for trial

  there was some shuffling of papers and 
whisper or two between the judges the
clerk called some names from the long lii
he held in his hand ending in a singsong
voice

  all other cases on the calendar will re-
turn to-morrow at ten oclock without fur
tlur notice

  hang-thc gavel came down with a
crash

  silence roared the clerk

  are they all deaf smith asked the
clerk pleasantly noth-
ing but his smile saved
him

still the impatient clerk
speaking smith now
stepped down from the
platform and stood among
the legal talent rejvirters
and thc free and equal
who had the look of ex-
pecting some invisible
power to descend upon
them the moon-faced
nd-cheeked smile had
been contemplating the
t luce dignified judges i le
now turned and saw hi

ii the witness chair twirl

his blond head tipped to
one side in becoming
humility

  a clean-cut young  llow from thedistric t
attorneys office next stepped i -rward with a
bundle of legal document-

  officer  he wa- looking over the
papers in his hand then he said ahem
quite importantly

  a lump suddenly appealed in the cheek of
the officer in the witness chair the clerk
saw it take il out take it out he
growled the officers hand went to his
mouth and the lump disappeared in his
pocket

  officer the assistant district attorney
had found the paper lu was looking for

violation of the speed ordinance all eyes
were now turned  one john smith
alsoevery face that looked upon one john
smith wa smiling thing were sticking
out of the pockets of his overcoat a pair
of white cloth leg round and piump poked
from his right-hand pocket while from the
left a yellow frowsy head with one eye
pushed in rested its rosy cheek luxuriously
against his warm well-titling overcoat the
inside pocket also bulged

 the assistant district attorney contin-
 ued-officer just tell the court about it in
 is few words as possible

 well sir the policeman shifted his
 position evidently the task wasnt pan-
 ning out as he had expected

 you see  was riding in the park on me
 bicycle when an automobile whizzed by me
 going like-er-very fast he stopped to
 wipe his mouth with the back of his hand
 it had been a narrow escape he went on
  took me stop-watch from me pocket and
 timed him for two blocks and found he was
 going twenty-two and a half miles an hour
 so  put him under arrest

 one minute officer the assistant dis-
 trict attorney interrupted did he say
 anything to you

  yes sir he said he was a doctor and had
 a lot of sick people to see

 is that all officer

 thats all he said

 ah he said well what did he do

 oh just laughed-with his face like
 that the officer pointed at smith and
 smiled like the rest the smile had spread
 with alarming rapidity

 is that all officer

 yes sir

 turning to the big benign face with the
 smile the attorney asked do you want
 to ask any questions doctor

 no sir i just wanted to hear the case
 same as the judges here he waved his

the chair wasnt large enough for both the
doctor and the bulging pockets so can
fully lifting his coat he allowed the sides tv
hang over the arms now the frowsy-
headed doll was looking furiously into the
faces of the judges while on the free and
equal side of the room a pair of shapely
legs pointed ceilingward as was proper for
that side of the house

  the judge on the end seat had a kindly
face he turned in his swivel chair and ad-
dressed the prisoner you are a physi-
cian it was hardly a question

   yes sir

  childrens specialist the judge was
trying not to laugh-his eyes rested on the
frowsy head that poked from the doctors
pocket

  ha ha it was a warm and hearty
chuckle it came from the prisoner who
went on i know how you got that he
reached to his jxxket and pulled out the
dilapidated doll one of my patients
judge he began to look it over his
smile was serious

   pretty disreputable character-one eye
gone teeth all knocked out one arm off and
a smashed foot-ha-i dont suppose even
you get them as disreputable as this be-
longs to a little patient of mine over on the
east side a little cripple been in bed a
year wants me to make this well same as 
am going to make him well thats what
in says he shook his head closing his lips

hand to take them in a twitter
rippled through the court room

  take the witness chair doctor
and we will endeavor to enlighten
you said the assistant district
attorney very politely he laid
down his papers and was rubbing his hands
together his expression said -i wont do
a thing to you oh no

the doctor rose and went over to the wit-
ness chair on the platform beside the judges

 its funny about dolls and kids ive
picked up an old stocking from the
floor tied  knot in it for a head
ni pi t it in their arms

                     tight in thought finally
his face opened out in a
broad smile from which
an amused chuckle just
oozed it was a remarkable face-it held
one almost anticipating what he might say

  its name is  da-looks it doesnt it
he was turning it around inspecting it
closely both began well the name and
the childrens specialist	i

the doll but kind of petered out  suppose
his big body overflowed the chair and the
bulge from the inside poekct troubled him
reaching in he pulled out a quart bottle
it bore no label he held it up vhile da
rested in his lap

   medicine judge then his face opened
into a new kind of
-mile with a little
embarrassment in it

 looks as if  might
be a veterinary with
a drench for a horse

  the judge inter-
rupted-almost apolo-
getically -with a smile

this is hardly rele-
vant doctor  ou are
charged with exceed-
ing the speed limit

   relevant judge

  his face was wide
open astonished why the soup was
getting cold judge- he placed the bottle to
his cheek then shifted it to the other cheek
t make sure it is cold his face sud-
denly changed all the astonishment left it
for a troubled look his eyes lifted to the
judges its the best medicine in the
world for a little weazened lace in pain if its
hot judge turning he held it out to the
assistant district attorney and said

  just hand it to that cop behind you and
tell him to put it on the radiator by the
gate ill get it when i go out they
pamed it quickly down the line like a ball at
a football game seeing da in his lap
the doctor picked it up and looked it over
speed of coursc  speeded he needed
the medicine and besides he was waiting
for    he looked up to find the judges
watching him so he went on

   its funny judge about dolls and kids
lie was now smiling confidentially into the
judges face  have been studying them
lor a long time why judge ive seen a
lit tie kid a year or two old suffering such
pain a you and i-thank god have never
known a doll why judge ive picked
up an old stocking from the floor tied i
knot in it fora head and put it in their arms
they stop crying nestle up to it and some-
times tell it not to cry his eyes were
half-closed his face soft and tender he was
almost whispering now

  why judge it seems to remind them ol
something theyre so full of love that -

well judge they never learn of love in the
corner of an attic where the roof leak- and
the windows are stuffed with old new spapers
and it either stilling hot or beast i  cold

  he paused a moment as though he saw it
all again

  some one on the  free and equal  side of
the room was smothering a laugh it was a
woman with her head on the bench before
her her shoulders were heaving it was an
unpleasant strident laugh

  no sir they dont learn it there they
bring it with them judge from where they
come a fearless smile overspread his face
and im never sorry to see their little visit
here made short im never sorry to see
them in their little boat bound for the
place from whence they came and even
old da here isnt too bad to keep them
company and  always try no matter
how disreputable to tuck these das in
their little skiffs before they are carried
out he looked at the kind-faced judge
earnestly

   y ou dont see this side judge you only
see the side that makes you angry i see it
too and it makes me mad madder than hell
sometimes but then i throw that off for
im only a childrens specialist  

  he was again smiling and so was every-
body else in the room but theirs was a
nervous smile almost apprehensive he
glanced at the clock that faced him on the
opposite wall

  my lord look at the time quarter
past twelve and  said i would be back with
da all fixed at half past ive got to
hustle he chuckled to himself as he
stuffed da in his pocket but im al-
everybodys magazine

ways i hi way-get talking about kids and
never know when to stop

  as he rose from his seat the chair stuck
to hint-he pushed it down and chuckled
again im so used to sitting on boxes
that  hardly know how to conduct myself
in a parlor he stepped down from the
little platform of the witness chair like an
elephant in a circus

  from the radiator as he passed he took-
the bottle of chicken soup and stuffed it
back into his pocket as he went through
the little gate one of the legs in his pocket
kicked defiantly at the judges while the
other kept waving a day-day all the way
down the aisle to the free and equal who
still were smiling as if hypnotized

  his hand was on the knob of the door
when he stopped abruptly then turned
back he was not smiling but blushing

  judge he said with chagrined aston-
ishment we forgot the trial he re-
minded the free and equal of their boy
when caught in the act the judges said
nothing they stared at the childrens spe-
cialist but what they saw was much farther
away

  well judge whats it going to be for
da and me he had pulled da out
of his pocket and put it back very carefully
were sorry especially da-if thats
going to do any good it was a serious
smile that now played about his very un-
usual face-a mixture of sunshine and
shadow

  one oi the judges was wiping his glasses

very slowly as if he expected to be busy at
it for an hour another was picking up
some papers from the floor behind the bench
and having trouble with the last sheet the
kindly-faced one looked very severe seeing
his colleagues were silent he spoke sternly
justice must be done at any cost

  the audience to a man frowned  put
the officer back on the stand went on
the judge i want to ask him some ques-
tions

  the impatient clerk suddenly appeared
from behind his desk looking angry and
hissed donnelly and as donnelly
passed him he coughed and said from force
of habit take it out

  but donnelly only shook his head and
looked bewildered

  officer-it was the judge in the middle
who spoke his elbows on the desk did
you measure the distance

  no maam

  dont call me maam it shot out
like a blast the cop shrank back

  stand up straight dont slouch that
way now what have you got to say
nothing maam-sir

   discharged for want of evidence the
other two judges nodded their assent and
see here doctor you and da keep out of
this court

  turning to the bicycle cops who filled the
room from their sunday drag-net his
honor said the first officer that leads that
man here again ill fine for contempt of
court
straight talk

  once more-woman s sphere 

my dkar mk hard

   permit me to say that your articles upon
the woman of rhe future to my mind arc
the most illuminating and suggestive that have
yet appeared anywhere i have read them with
great interest the more so perhaps because
my own views upon the general subject are
not opmsed to yours that would put it too
strongly but they are-dijferail i am a
doctor an old doctor nigh on to seventy and
that probably is the reason why i look upon the
subject from the view-point of womans physio-
logical relation to the race

   w oman is the autocrat of society she makes
it in the last analysis she creates the social
atmosphere that impalpable foggy feather-
bed- force which any one may oppose but
which in the end overcome all resistance ami
compels acquiescence the home discipline
that the individual parent may employ is rig-
orously limited bv mrs grundy and mrs
grundy is the composite mother of the com
inunity whose edicts have banished effective
discipline from the american home

    you will see at once that this thought carried
 out to it logical results makes the composite
 mother of the land rcnsible finally for rear-
 ing a generation of spoiled children of whom
 your marie is one type another type is repre-
 sented by the abler more aggressive and tal-
 ented ones among whom are the malefactors
 of great wealth the leading spirits in law-
 defying big business the fellows higher
 up

   the social atmosphere that tolerates them
with social recognition is of womans creation
the sloughs of corruption that have been un-
covered could never have existed at all in the
face of womans stern disapproval of the known
guilty ones l or they have been known well

enough it required no court of law to exjtosc
them they hail been known for years before the
lcxow committee made its report bribery
and fraud in xlitical life were  common as to
be taken for granted but their mention only
excited a smile of complacence and the same
conditions existed in successful business it
wasa matter of common knowledge ami  irt v
coudoncd il even upphntdol it on the condition
only that it escaped the smirch of i he prison in
my view this particular taint in the social atmos-
phere is one of several by-prodm is-at cidental
so to speak of the movement for womans
emancipation or economic indcftcitdcncc

  i may be wrong but your article in the de-
cember issue left the impression upon my mind
that you looked upon the college of domestic
science and its congeners in womans higher
education as the solution of the problem -f
marriage in the future it is entirely possible
that it may be such or an important factor in
ii but even if that bo so il will be long years
before these institutions can become available
for woman in the mass and long long before
that can come to pass a herculean labor will
have to be done to create a social atmosphere of
approval and appreciation for a sphere exclu-
sively womans

  from my view point woman can never come
into her own till she realizes two fundamental
facts first thatshe is a woman for the
single purpose of bearing children and that
every detail in her life depends upon and is
secondary to that function and second-that
she is solely responsible for the bent of her
childs and hence of the rices fundamental
moral character when the truth of all this
dawns upon her mind and with it some appre-
ciation of the grandeur of the career opened out
before her in the facl of her sex her rushlight of
ambition to enter the brutish arena of mascu
line achievement to comjute for its bedraggled

honors will in- extinguished in the splendors
i aspiration fur adequate preparation for a
sphere that all nature declares to be hers ex-
clusively

  the woman who shirks her function as mother

  a degenerate as truly as the inmates of the
brothels and it is a godsend to society that she
docs not reproduce her kind

  your marie was the product of what her
father and her husband  had done for her but
under present social conditions her mother was
a larger factor from maries girlhood her
mother had taught her to dread the pains of
childbirth and it was her mother that carried
out systematic indulgence oi every whim from
babyhood to marriage then there is another
factor in the family doctor he was a popular
society doctor whose bread and butter it
was to entourage every imagined illness and by
suggestion to magnify them to the limit of her
own or her mothers credulity do you know
deprived of that sort of practice half the city
profession would be out of business and the
other half would barely live

  a navy surgeon on snake-bitfs

  i have just read samuel hopkins adamss
the poison bugaboo in your october maga-
zine the purpose of this letter is to take
square issue with the statement that only eighty
persons have ever died of snake-bite in the
united states within thc last five years i
myself at my own expense have collected evi-
dences of twenty cases none older than fifteen
years which are so  am assured by com-
petent authority as well established as is re-
quired by current rules of court practice 
recognize the fallacies that beset any one who
investigates so difficult a subject still i am con-
vinced that the majority of the errors in con-
nection with snake-bitesarises through inexact-
ness in determining the species of the snake

  for instance i have been unable to find the
report of more than one fatal case of rattlesnake
bite in mississippi although i have records of
numerous cases where the persons bitten re-
covered i ascribe this to the fact that the
only rattlesnake that is at all generally known
there is thc crohilus horridus this species at-
tains perhaps its maximum development in this
state wherefore i concludeand  have so always
maintained that thc crotalus horridus is not
essentially deadly by which  mean that under
ordinary circumstances it is not apt to kill a
grown-up human being in mountainous re-
gions however this species is occasionally more
deadly than the loregoing statement would
indicate

  it is as the french say quite another pair
of sleeves as regards the crotalus odomantcus

the diamond-backed rattlesnake of thc south-
eastern united states i agree fully with thc
statement in professor ditmarss reptile
book  which classes this serpent as the peer of
any venomous snake whatsoever

  i n conclusion i beg leave to suggest that more
judicious investigation of records easily avail-
able w ill amplify greatly the estimates to w hich
i have referred through careful consideration
of data arailable to me i estimate and i do not
hesitate to predict that the next census will
show that deaths from snake bites are about as
common in thc southeastern states as arc those
from lightning and inasmuch as antitoxin
treatment of snakc-bites is easily available it
follows that deaths from snakc-bites should he
classed as preventable

madness of john harned written by jack

tioned guayaquil quito maria valenzuela i
was instantly interested in the story being my-
self an ecuadorian

  you may imagine how this article hasaffccted
me being as it is a ridicule of a whole republic
this article gives an entirely erroneous idea of
w hat ecuador and its people arc presenting us
as uncivilized people of the media-val age

  i cannot understand how everybody s

to further pleasant relations between the two

the railroads troubles-and ours

  just now the railways are clamoring for a
vast increase in rates of freight as being neces-
sary to their continued existence and putting
up the plea that it is impossible to effect further
economies it would therefore seem to be a
not unfitting time to inquire somewhat into the
facts in the case and to learn why it is that so
many predatory corporations are permitted to
prey upon them and divert into other hands the
revenues which should accrue to them

  of course the express companies come first
n the list these vampires preying alike upon
the railways and the public are merely a set of
impudent interlopers third parties thrust in
between the carrier and the public with no ex-
cuse for existence except to wring from the peo-
ple extortionate profits at the partial expense
of the railways the express companies get
anything they want from the carrying corpora-
tions-space in their stations yards advertise-
ments time of their employees car and train
accommodations etc apparently without let
or hindrance and all to conduct a business
which should rightfully be carried on by the
carriers themselves it is just as easy to handle
an express as a freight business

  next in order might lie mentioned the pull-
man company the enormous profits of this
parasite should accrue to the railways what
reason is there to prevent them from caring for
and forwarding the sleeping passenger as a
matter of fact the lli o r r co did at one
time handle its own sleeping cars but was
handicapped because it could not forward them
beyond its own lines cooperation by the
railways would enable them to transport the
passenger across the continent in a parlor or
palace car as easily as in a day coach can it
lie that the interests of railway officials prevent

  again there arc the fast freight lines and
the car trusts ami the different bridgesowned
by outsiders which exact a heavy toll from the
railways there is a bridge used by the p ft
w  c r r at pittsburg which  am in-
formed is owned by a separate corporation
that collects toll for every ton of freight and
every passenger coach that passes over its
bridge why should not the railway own it

  again there are the numerous and costly
private cars used by officials how many of
these arc necessary in how many cases would
the public be better served if these persons

traveled as do those who pov instead of placing
those who are paid in  different < Ias> in how
many cases would the official know  lie needs
of the road and the public better it he traveled
as does the ordinary passenger the truth is
the railway officials have set themselves
apart as a separate and superior order of beings
and wrapped themselves in an insufferable and
abounding conceit when the truth as shown by
investigation has proved them guilty of every
kind of commercial and business iniquity by
which they have fostered the trusts broken
down legitimate competition briled legislators
and councils and loaded their roads with ficti-
tious capital and bond issues

  while  am writing permit me to say that 
believe credit to be due the magazines for the
recent and the coming political revolutions
the crimes of the republican party have leen
many but the newspapers would never have
exposed them we can learn the truth through
the non-partisan magazines only d w h

 preaching a magazine article

  permit me to congratulate you on the superb
discussion on the subject of mirat les contributed
to your january number by william hanna
thomson doctor thomsons argument gripped
me so that i gave it to my people on the first
sunday in january and related the circum-
stance of how my attention was called to it in
the columns of your magazine and how his
argument gripped me and warmed me up and
filled me up until it was a sheer impossibility
for nie to do otherwise than to give it red-hot
to my sunday morning congregation it has in-
vigorated my faith and through my sunday
morning message the faith of my people in the
supernatural elements of the christian faith

  i do not hesitate to pronounce it the most
lucid cogent convincing argument for miracles
that i have ever heard or read and i have more
than a hundred volumes of sermons on my
library shelves	j l

stand as a trenchant statement of what is really
a totally negligible truth for it is never in the
challenge of an existent riddle but always in
the lure ol a non-existent answer that eternal
stimulus resides thc rule holds good even ii
mathematics the circle and the square had

ing the v iri ic would ion since have taken each
other for granted li the eternal feminine
were really guarding an actual conundrum
some prying scientific johnnie would stumble
n the answet some day and then presto but
dont let us even think of such a catastrophe
thc point at issue i- that there is not the slight
cst danger of the new womans spoiling skri
iy economii self-obtrusion or by literary self
aalysis she will only add to the game the
delightful fillip of an altered emphasis

  lmily james putnams charming studies of
significant phases in the historical development
of sheltered furojican womanhood the

lady sturgis and walton besides being
examples of a genuinely constructive scholar

sonality illustrate the titillating possibilities ol
the new approach to the old mystery the
author comes gracefully and graciously for-
ward offering to call a truce in the age-long
conflict oi deception and ready to meet us
vizor down and only the sharp poniard of
i tempered irony b way of side-arms on
thc middle ground of unbiased inquiry she
proudly foregoes all sex-allowances and tacitly
disclaims all benefits  hivalrous make-believe

she is impersonal un-sellvonscious frank per-
spicacious sincere she delicately yet un-
flinchingly draws aside veil after veil analyz

-b

ing the successive protective devices of fem-
ininity with deft feminine self-knowledge but
when with a little bow and a mocking smile
she leaves us at last-while she leaves us vastly
edified and no little instructed we findourselvt
no whit disillusioned and no jot less mystified

  there is a blunt vet tactful justice a delicate
recognition of humble but genuine scrvicc in
the french idiom that speaks of the interested
and sympathetic lookers-on at a function as
assisting at the event i should like for
a moment to borrow the expression for the
publication of the japanese letters of lafca-
dio ilearn houghton mitbin edited by
elizabeth ii-land offers us the none too fre-
quent privilege of assisting in this sense at the
induction of a neophyte into the body of lnj
lish literature many an honest eyebrow will
perhaps raise itself in doubting challenge of this
statement because in the first place it has
i icon insisted upon to the point of triteness that
the art of letter writing has been lost to us
moderns and in the next place because we
hac come by the hard and fast habit of our
aesthetic outlook feel that an intention of
crmancnce is of the essence of art  that art 
in letter writing leads to artificiality and hence
that letters and literature are incompatible
terms here however as has happened just
often enough before to prove the relative elas-
ticity of the rule a retiring sensitive yet vital
personality has found its most adequate self-
expression in the exercise of an untrammclcd
and exquisite spontaneity in correspondence

hearns most tangible service to mankind has
been his offering of himself as a neutral ground
a row of books

for the meeting of the occidental and oriental
consciousnesses but he possessed to so extraor-
dinary a degree the artists ability to put him-
self intellectually and emotionally in others
places that he spent his life looking at the
world through alien eyes and never for all bis
hoks and strivings reached the self-assertion of
creative art indeed his mind instead of being
the sculptors studio of his artistic labors was in
reality the statue upon which he worked and
it is only in his letters that wc find its beauties
of contour and quality preserved and revealed

   it is well however to remember that letters
 iteing fragmentary glimpses not parts of a com-
 pleted whole a volume of them is a book to
 browse in not to consume seriatim or at a sit
 ting yc are so accustomed to table dhite
 literature that we have lost the habit of reading

ii	la earle nevertheless the present volume
the third of hearns collected correspondence
is for the most part made up of letters to basil
hall chamberlain written between s and
 ami the community of understanding and
sympathy in their respective altitudes toward
japanese life and tradition which is the under-
lying factor in the inspiration oi the letters
adds to the unity and homogeneity of the series



   mr james lane allen is reported to have
said that he feared he had delivered too soon the
message that bis bride of the mistletoe was
intended to convey mr allen being more
completely acquainted with the message than
his readers is better qualified to judge yet the
second story oi the projected trilogy of com-
munication the doctors christmas eve
macmillan sufficiently amplifies the infer-
ences of the first tale to suggest the possibility
that the message comes too late rather than too
early-that it is a message which the conscious-
ness of the day has already accepted the disap-
pointments of which it has already discounted
and the hopeful possibilities of which it is
already busily though blunderingly trying to
work out

   the bride of the mistletoe pictured for us
the sudden collapse in a kentucky household
of the desperately maintained fiction that ro-
mantic love is self-endowed with unchanging
youth and in the pompous scholasticism of
professor ousleys didactic essayoffered usover
mrs ousleys shoulder some post-darwinian
proofs of the inevitability of the catastrophe
the new story pictures for us the breakdown of
an equally desperately maintained fiction-the
notion that faithfulness to an unconsummated
romance condones the sin of its own selfishness
and illusions mr allens earnestness and con-
viction in the writing of these tales are unmis-
takable and almost sacerdotal and the accusa-
tions oi  bewildered pessimism  that have been

   brought against him are quite naturally incom-
prehensible to him except on the supposition
that his proclamation has been premature in
reality however ins solemn announcement of
the hopeless breakdown of  discredited sexual
idealism cannot but appear bewildered and
pessimistically futile to an age that is already
sorting out the foundation stonesol a new and
as it fondly hopes a more practical ideal



  did you ever talk to a man who was a born
collector and who through long indulgence in
the habit had become a confirmed and hopeless
incurable are not these people for the most
part and to put it bluntly the limit and
yet is there not an oddly irritating fascination in
the perversions and inversions that their vocab-
ularies and their sense of values have undergone
mr e v lucas the indefatigable anthologist
is one of the rare instances of a congenital col-
lector who while indulging his master passion
has remained human and articulate that is to
say while he does not invariably retain any
sense of needed relationship between his treas-
ured specimens and life he has never lost his

  mr arnold bennetts how to live on
j hours a day doran is one of the most
intrinsically amusing events of the moment
for it is admirably although innocently calcu-
lated simultaneously to confound the extrem-
ists of both parties to the bennett controversy
those who have hailed this young englishman
as impeccable and those who have declared him
to ite impossible mr bennetts really remark-
able grasp of the subjective mentality of his
characters joined to the complete detachment
and the aloofness from sentiment of his attitude
as an author has induced the intellectuals and
the emotionais to regard him respectively as
superhuman and as inhuman the intense per-
smial ca mot nes oi i iii didactic little essay in
which lie tills us how to hccome capitalists of
imc by saving half hours and intellectual
sandows by doing mental calisthenics may
conceivably induce the emotionalists to hail
him as a daniel come to judgment and the intel-
lectuals i declare that he has become a bro
mide as a matter of facl it merely proves that
like other and less gifted mortals mr bennett
is lovably and humanly capable of being pas-
sionately banal out of business hours

this mark is not meant like baedekers cele-
brated star to indicate that if you are travel-
ing first class through current literature with
a courier and fourteen trunks you must by all
means put up at this book of entertainment
it is intended to serve as a reminder like a
knot in ones watch chain or a ring changed to
an unaccustomed linger that you do not want
lo forget il this is not only because there are
moments when it will come in handy liut be-
cause there are moods that it will minister to
legitimate moods that it will supply with that
if which they stand in need and which in these
days is difficult to come upon-namely a whole-
hearted and unforced restatement of the worth
of naive enthusiasms and of the validity oi
youthful ideals an ideal is a faith clothed in
illusion and we are so busy just now getting
rid of worn-out illusions preparatory to being
measured for new ones that our faith in the
simple joys of life occasionally finds itself un-
clothed and shivering in the cold mr mur-
riss stories with the unassumed sparkle and
unadulterated zest that enliven and inspire his
work remind us that there is still warmth and
wear left in some of the garments that we have
incontinently relegated to the rag heap



   x ightshade  brentanos by paul gwynne
is one of the fictional first-fruits of the scientific
worlds new attitude of open-minded inquiry
toward the so-called uncanny this attitude
is in itself one of the most interesting and
significant developments of our day since
it indicates modern sciences emergence from
adolescence into maturity in its infancy sci-
ence like other infants believed everything
that was told il -that ducks wintered under
water and that oysters grew on trees later
it instinctively realized that there is an age in
life when we must dare to lie unjust when we
must make a dean sweep of all admiration and
respect got at second hand and deny every-

thing-truth and untruth everything which
we have not ourselves known for truth the
resulting scientific materialism dogmatic ami
militant was a youths declaration of intellect-
ual independence this turning of its own
accord to the quiet consideration of that which
it has long denied is the proof of its conscious
freedom and achieved manhood incidentally
this new altitude as mr gwynnes weird novel
shows bids fair for the first time in a generation
or so once more to allow grown-up children
legitimately to satisfy the wholesome and nat-
ural cravings of their imaginations with the
delicious pseudo-terrors of grown-up ghost
stories

  the central theme of mr gwynnes story is
the lower of supernormal vision given to the
eyes of a blind musician by a lamp emitting
ultra-violet rays of adjustable wave lengths
invented by a mcphistophclian old scientist oi
doubtful antecedents and questionable aims
the violinist himself the parisian gamin who
attends him and the two sisters whom he
blindly thinks are one woman make a back-
ground of human interest for the hinted horrors
of scientific disclosure nightshade in that
it finally calls in the dead imaginings of the old
superstition to explain its eventual denoue-
ment is a hybrid and transitional type but it
is so genuinely suggestive in the partial realiza-
tion of its eerie conception and so successfully
revives an emotion long absent from current
fiction thal it would be ungrateful to empha-
size its shortcomings at the expense of its
attainments

   the completest information we can get would indicate that mormon
leaders continue to practice polygamy continue to encourage the prac-
tice among the younger men continue to disregard their agreement with
the government of the united states continue to flout the nations
laws continue to scour the world for women victims of tlu ir sublimated
white slavery

   when we arranged with ex-senator cannon for his under the
prophet  series our chief object was to give to our readers an accurate
inside account of the growth and present status of mormonism an
account as accurate as history should be divested of all high coloring
imaginary plots and subterranean mysteries we believed we should
be doing the mormons a good turn to report their history thus honestly
and accurately

   we did not hate the mormons we did not fear the mormons
we did not believe the stories of their present polygamous practices
we thought there might be two or three exceptions at most

   as the truth has been forced upon us that some of the leaders of the
church are openly living in polygamy brazenly defying the laws
secretly encouraging the young men in polygamous practices there has
gradually grown up in us a great wrath at the attitude of these leaders
a great disgust at polygamy and a great shame that americans should
permit it

   when our art director with rare genius placed the illustrations in
this months instalment he visualized polygamy if they impress you
as they did us each page showing another residence of prophet smith
for another wife when you get to the last illustration your heart will
scarcely contain your horror and your disgust and your anger

   and it you have imagination -it you sec these houses with children
playing in the yards and their enslaved mothers looking on from the
doorways-it you see a bewhiskered brute going in and out of these
houses best in li zing the sweet home sentiments built up through years
of self-restraint why its horrible thats what it is no sane man can
fail to feel the horror and it ought to be stopped-throttled-utterly
destroyed immediately forever

   true people should be left free to worship god in their own way-
unless that way interferes with the laws society has provided for its
own safety society might permit a harmless lunatic to be at large
but if society found him poisoning all the springs society certainly
would have some right to interfere

   other religions that run to the sensual are promptly suppressed
why has the sensual feature of mormonism been permitted to con-
tinue

  for votes

   xicc comment isnt it on thc great republican party and the great
democratic party if youll give us your votes well let you live

   once before utah was a state the united states government said
you must stop polygamy and the prophet straightway got in
touch with the almighty and secured a new revelation to cover the
trying situation in which thc chosen people found themselves

and the leaders stopped polygamy until they had obtained statehood
-but really carried the doctrine on as a cardinal principle of their faith
and now they return to the practice of it and political parties for the
sake of votes wink at the breaking of the laws and the disregard of
pledges

   do the mormons actually believe in their religion do the women
actually believe they are serving god almighty when they lend them-
selves to this ghastly practice

   it passes belief and yet it must be so however attractive divinely
legalized license may be to the men and however much the women
may be influenced to choose half a home or one-fifth of a home to no
home the fact remains that mormons are devout

   we cannot but admire many mormon traits-courage frugality
tenacity but their persistence in polygamy is an insult and a menace to
the rest of the country and a crime against society

    it has got to stop

   if the government of utah will not stop it if the men will not stop
it-then in mercys name let the women take hold and stop it they
can do it  hey ought to do it the real crime is against woman-
hood

   why dont they stop it

   utah is a womans suffrage state why dont the suffrage leaders
ol the nation show by cleaning up utah what women can do with
the ballot

sometimes you see a pros-

wonder why he does not take
out his own watch to compare

    it is not that he has no watch-

lie is carrying he has no confidence
that it is anywhere near correct and
he tries to save his dignity by not
making a comparison

tarvia in cambridge

cambridge mass widely
known as the scat of harvard
college is a progressive modern
city of  inhabitants

  for some years the superintendent of
streets has been experimenting with
tarvia as a macadam road binder and
dust layer

  to-day tarviated macadam has been
adopted as a standard method of con-
struction

  harvard street leading to the college
and one of the principal automobile
routes from boston was in bad condition
in iryos

  a section of the harvard square end
was laid with tarvia x and an adjacent
section was built without tarvia

  the experience during the succeeding
winter convinced the superintendent that
tarvia was necessary to make a macadam
road endnre modern fast-moving traffic

  the next season sections of columbia

street also an automobile route berk-
shire and york streets were built  follow-
ing the methods used on harvard st

  at the same time massachusetts
ave one of the heavy travelled streets
leading from boston to the suburbs on
the northwest was rebuilt in a thoroughly
substantial manner with tan ia x

  in addition to the construction work
tarvia b has been spread on automobile
thoroughfares like magazine street
kirkland street and the charles river
parkway

  on these streets the automobile traffic
is extremely heavy as cambridge is
not only the way out from boston
to the north and west but is also
crossed by all traffic from the southern
to the northern suburbs

  tarvia b was chosen after actual road
trials of different types of dust layers and
road preservatives

 guarantee bond

   of course we are not going to
lose we arc offering a sure thing

we know congo will last more
than  years

   if it would not do so it would be absurd for
us to jeopardize our business by making so many
binding guarantees and the national surety co
would not stand behind us

fac-aimile of  year bond

   one thing the guarantee forces upon us it
makes us extrenuiy careful in manufacturing

   we make doubly sure that every roll is pcrfcct

   we use the best material that money can buy
we take elaborate pains in wrapping to prevent
damage in transit

   another little detail is the nail-
ing sonic manufacturers supply
broad-headed nails but these fre-
quently cut the roofing other
manufacturers supply tin discs
which rust quickly and cause leaks

to avoid any trouble from this
ource we provide free of charge
galvanized iron caps which are
rust proof and will last as long as
the roofing

   in every way we protect our-
selves agains the possibility of a
complaint

   send for a copy of our guaran-
tee bond and a sample of congo roofing the
copy of the guarantee will show you what a real
legal roofing guarantee looks like the sample
and the little booklet which we enclose with it
will tell you more about congo roofing

congoleum for flooring and wainscoting

     w e should like to send every reader ol this paper a sample of congoleum it is fitted for
use in homes stores offices around billiard tables and in busy passageways it is a perfect imita-
tion ol light and golden oak its surface has a high polish it is unusually durable the price is

year furniture which because of its design and
workmanship and materialwill be worthy and beauti-
ful long hence

rapids you would see the patient methodical care and skill of the
men who are devoting their best time and thought to making the best
furniture to be made no concealing of defects no slurring over hidden
joints no hasty finishing - but the same meditative almost loving treat-
ment of wood which in the olden days put together the priceless period
furniture

his book we have published is 
uncommercial publication and an
expensive one-to us it tells the story
of period furniture in a most interesting way

otjr local representative will be glad
to show you his display of our furni-
ture on his floors is a goodly show-
ing and in his magnificent portfolio of
photogravures is a lifelike presentment of
our  pieces inspcctthe furniture study

piece is one that will stay in your family for
years and years

about character in furniture we will be
glad to send it to you it is not a catalogue

a rk you one of the thousands of manufacturers who

 how they ian reduce the co-l of finishing

 department

 how they can make their products more at-

 these are ime of ihe profit making opr-

 it is not simpb  matter of i-iok-and care-
 ful purchasing

  it involves your manufacturing ami fini-hing
processes

  if affect- both your profits anil your factory
output

  it is sr important that a large manufacturer
who recently died stipulated in his will that
berry brothers varnishes ik continued in use
as long as the business lived he was one of
those wise executives ol large corporations
who make big money out ol what lhers mn-
sider  little things

  no matter how far you may i- removed

two-thirds of their coal bills each year by the use of

   this saving of from  to c is assured
like in modest home or largest building pea or

  all asphalt roofing is not trinidad
lake asphalt roofing-theres a great
bir difference look out for that when
you buy your roofing

   ordinary so-called asphalt roofings arc made of artificial pro-
ducts masquerading as real asphalt they are nothing more
than the residue from petroleum oil or native bitumens made into
a black pitch which is easily affected by changes in weather

  genasco

the trinidad-lake-asphalt roofing

is made of genuine natural asphalt-perfectly stable ami uniform in quality

    trinidad lake asphalt is endowed by nature with natural oils and
they stay in it this gives  icnasco its wonderful resistance to rain snow
sun wind heat and cold-anti keens it lastingly waterproof

    the artificial asphalts have oils tnixiil with them but they havent the
quality of the oils in the natural product and they soon evaporate and
leave the roofing dead-and it cracks breaks ami leaks although at the
first it may look like genasco the real trinidad-lake-asphalt roofing

    natural asphalt in roofing is the greatest weather-resister known to
make sure of roofing that will permanently protect ask your dealer for
tienasco the trinidad-lake-asphalt roofing with either mineral or
smooth surface fully guaranteed

    the kant-leak kleet waterpr- -is the son ms if genasco roofing without cement
does away with najl-leaks and gives the roof an attractive finish ask your dealer
for genasco with kant-lcak klccts packed in the roll

remember is that paint materials are not nearly so expensive

or  a gallon makes the painting of the average house
cost only  or  more than it used to cost not enough

                                         j-m asbestos roofing is absolutely fire-proof because
   its base consists of several layers of pure asbestos felt
   and asbestos you know is the fire-proof practically indestructible mineral used in gas
   grates stove mats theatre curtains etc

       these lavers of asbestos stone felt are firmly cemented together with genuine trini-
dad lake asphalt-that wonderful mineral cement which in asphalt pavements stands the
 giinding of wheels and pounding tf hoofs for thirty to forty years

rot-proof and acid-proof and like all stone
it never needs painting or coating

the easiest riding car in the world

why it wins

   the marmon is not built for racing purposes

  the fact that it won more of the important racing
events of  is gratifying of course and the fact
that it established more new racing records than any
other car is pleasing

   but these things are incidental

   our primary purpose is to build the best motor cat
         in the world for family purposes

          our purpose in racing has been to
        discover and correct weaknesses in the
        car that no other test could search out

           the marmon has won the lions share
         of the big races and captured the lions
         share of the records simply because its
         design and construction are such as to
         successfully withstand the terrific strains
         of high speed for hundreds of miles

only  everitts this year from a factory of
double that capacity-read and learn the reason why

  for the last ten years-since the beginning
of automobiles-a certain three detroit man-
ufacturers have been building motor-cars

  they worked on the first car built in
detroit experimented through all the
years of development manufactured by the
tens of thousands during the great demand
for usable cheap cars their names are
famous wherever cars are known

  two years ago a demand for better qual-
ity appeared it began to be apparent that
cheap machine-made cars hastily assem-
bled could not be permanently satisfactory
buyers began asking for the quality found
in costly cars

  the great manufacturing interests owned
by these men were quickly sold a new
factory was purchased a million dollars
and a years time spent in its equipment
then came the sifting and final adoption
of designs parts and equipment-a process
of infinite care

built for a new demand

  for it was determined to build a genuine
quality car-to set a standard for years
to eliminate every useless part profit by
the matchless experience available manu-
facture every detail and give to those
operations which make for excellence a de-
gree of painstaking care known only to the
costliest the result was the everitt v

  this was the car built to meet the new
demand as it appeared on the road a year
ago it attracted instant attention engi-
neers who examined it pronounced it a
marvel of scientific and simplified mechan-
ism buyers who drove it found it gave a
satisfaction and remarkable performance
hitherto unknown to medium-priced cars
the new model was an instant success

  then the production began slowly for
quality was the object-not quantity it
was from the start impossible to supply the
demand for a car like this but altogether
in that year  everitts were placed in
owners hands

  from these first cars have come astonish-
ing stories of service owner after owner
has written to the factory in remarkable
words there has not been a single come-
back not a single dissatisfied owner
every one of the  has made good

limited quality-every car right

  it was determined at the start to limit
factory production-realized as the ono
means of maintaining quality

  this for the reason that the processes
which mean most to a high-grade car are
necessarily slow and tedious it is impos-
sible to hurry the skilled handwork of
adjusting assembling inspecting and test-
ing without sacrificing quality this in
addition to the mechanical operations com-
mon to all modern factories good cars are
always built slowly

  and this is why there will be only 
everitts this year from a factory of double
that capacity it means that many would-bo
buyers will be disappointed but it also
means that every man who gets an everitt
will get a car he knows is right the price
--is an incident it is the quality
that counts

  we want you to see this car-to test it
for yourself over the worst conditions you
can find only in this way can it really be
appreciated

 broc

e l e c t ft i c

time was when a man looked upon an electric as a
womans car -but thats no longer true in many respects
the luxurious broc is the best town or suburban car a
man can drive--either in the roadster or coupe type

     it is safer cleanerhandier more easily controlled than a gasoline car

     it has ample power and speed for town or suburban use and costs far less to operate three
t seven dollars a month will furnish all necessary current to run a four-passenger broc-as
often as fast and as far as the average person desires

it requires no chauffeur any member of the family can operate it it is less likely to get
out of order- more dependable the year round and it has all the style one could wish for

     if you are interested to know the details of broc design and construction write for the

tire bills cut in two

ordinary clinchcr tire

 goodyear no-rim-cut - goodyear
oversize tires-under average conditions
cut tire bills in two

 and that saving is clear these pat-
ented tires now cost nothing extra our
multiplied output- last year
-has cut the cost of production

no rim-cutting

  half of the saving comes in avoidance of rim-
cutting the two pictures above show you how
this is done both tires are shown fitted in the
same rim-the standard rim used for quick-de-
tachable tires also for demountable rims

  the left picture shows how the removable tim
flanges are set to curve outward with no-rim-cut
tires the tire comes against a rounded edge
and rim-cutting is made impossible

  we have sold half a million no-rim-cut tires
we have run them flat in a hundred tests-as far
as  miles in all this experience there has never
been an instance of rim-cutting

  the picture at right shows how ordinary tires-
clincher tires-are fitted to this same standard
rim the movable rim
flanges must be set to curve
inward-to grasp hold of the
hook in the tire that ishow
the tires are held on

  note how the hook of the
flange then digs into the
tire that is what causes
rim-cutting a punctured

tire may be ruined beyond repair by running a
single block

  hooks arc not needed with goodyear no-rim-
cut tires not even tire bolts are needed ttie
tire stays on because  braided wires are vulcan-
ized into the base they make the tire base un-
stretch able so nothing can ever force it over the

the valveless elmore has the only motor whose
cylinders work with one united impulse

the elmore valveless high duty motor is one
  power unit having four related cylinders

every other gasoline motor consists of indi-
  vidual cylinders which are separate power
  units

the ordinary motor must have valves
  those valves must have small parts rods
  cams levers springs screws etc to operate
  them averaging twenty to
  the cylinder

just as a chains strength is
  defined by its weakest link
  so is the efficiency of a valved
  cylinder measured by its most
  insignificant small part

ii	a valve is not adjusted to the

  - of a second its cylinder loses one-fifth
  or more of its power

the four cylinders of the valveless elmore are
  always delivering their full normal power

a valved motor can only deliver at each revo-
  lution of its crank shaft one-halt as many
  power strokes as it has cylinders

the valveless elmore has a full power stroke
  from each cylinder at every revolution of its
  crank shaft

having twice the jwwer strokes of a valved
  motor of the same number of cylinders the
  valveless elmore has no equal for-continuity
  of power and sustained torque

the four elmore cylinders furnish as many
  power strokes jer revolution
  -or per mile-as could be
  delivered by an eight-cylinder
  valved motor

an eight-cylinder valved motor
  does not and is not likely to
  exist perfect adjustment of
  the enormous number of
  small outer parts required would be vir-
  tually impossible

the valveless elmore having the same num-
  ber of power strokes that an eight-cylinder
  valved motor would give remains the sim-
  plest and most efficient power maker ever
  placed in an automobile

valueless -cycle

            there is only one conclusion you must judge every oilier car and its
            motor by the efficiency of the elmore write for our ign literature today

conservation for policyholders
decisively exemplified in the
postal life-insurance company

insurance in force more than 

full legal reserve and surplus for the protection of all policyholders

when you come to
think it over-

  it isnt necessary or advisable

lo	deal with an agent when you
want to arrange life-insurance

  from first to last the agency
nay costs you extra money



 when you want to find out
about a policy for any purpose-
to protect the family educate
the young folks for endowment
or business use - the rational
way is to deal direct with the
postal life

  you thus escape commissions
ranch-office expense collection
fees etc and get full official infor-
mation which is in black and while
ind binding on the company



 the postal iife-insur-
xck company is the only
non-agency company in america
-the only company that wholly
eliminates agency - expense the
result is genuine conservation in
life-insurance

 the saving is decisive and
permanent making the net cost
f your insurance in the pos-
tal life lower than ill any
other company



  it is always good business to
cut out the middleman when you
can but you cant always do it

 in arranging a postal pol-
icy you fan cul bim out and save

money for yourself just as hun-
dreds have done and are doing in
constantly increasing numbers
w

 the postal life is even
now a large company with in-
surance in force as stated it has
policyholders in every state of
the union and in canada includ-
ing americans residing in foreign
countries

  and these policyholders arc
its friends they are satisfied
and always speak good words
for the company when occa-
sion serves

why not write to the
postal

   it has ample capital and re-
sources to meet every demand
now and in the future it issues all
the standard forms of legal-reserve
insurance and all its policies are
approved by the critical new york
state insurance department



   here are four features and there
arc others that strongly commend
the postal life to those who
have carefully looked into it

	guaranteed dividends
   paid to policyholder
  annually from saving be-
  cauie of the elimination of
  agency-expense

	contingent dividends
  made up and paid annually
  from other source thee
  dividend being in addition
  to the guaranteed dividend
  and larger than other com-
  panies pay

	liberal options and val-
  ues enabling you among
  other things to add to the
  face-value of your policy 
  larger amount of paid-up
  insurance than is posaible in
  any other company

	optional premium privi-
  lege you may deposit pre-
  miums monthly quarterly
  semi-annually or annually a
  desired and without consult-
  ing the company

to think
fire insurance is to
think hartford

because the hartford is today the
best known fire insurance com-
pany in america it is not only
the most widely known of all in-
surance companies but its reputation for
fair dealing is as high as its fame is wide
its popularity is but the result of its hun-
dred years of splendid service to the insured

  no loss has ever been too great for the
hartfords strength none too small to
receive prompt attention

  when you need fire insurance tell your
agent or broker to get you a policy in the
hartford

  sometimes you will be asked to accept a
policy in a company which the agent says
is just as good as the hartford but
not knowing about this substitute what
you know about the hartford why not get
what you ask for 

insist on the hartford

   do you mean to tell me that
 these shackamaxon fabrics
 are equal to imported goods

    i mean to tell you that stacka-
 maxous are better than most imported
 goods only the very expensive im-
 ported goods can equal them

    i tell you that-dollar for dollar
 -there is nothing better produced
 anywhere than these perfect all-wool
 fabrics made in the shackamaxon
 mills in philadelphia

   that identical pattern you are
 looking at-the same in every respect
 -would cost you twenty to thirty per
 cent more money if it was imported

    any tailor who handles shackamaxon
 fabrics will tell yon the same thing and
 he tells the exact truth

never again for a water-cooled car franklin air cooling is besi

- hiram percy maxim

here is an engineer of world wide fame the inventor f the maxim
gun silencer for years lie designer of a prominent water-cooled car

         he gives up water cooling and adopts the franklin because it gives
      service that no water-cooled car can give he says

          i tried out a franklin for a year put it through all sorts of stunts
      and was firmly convinced that air cooling was best

          during one of the hottest days in summer i drove it  miles if it
      was ever going to get hot it was right then far from it if performed
      as steady as a top and took one of the worst hills in the country on high
      gear

      the franklin air-cooled motor is quick in response to the throttle
      the greatest efficiency is attained because the motor is uniformly warm

         another thing-with the air-cooled automobile there is a reduction
      in the weight of the car light weight means a saving on tires this is
      one of the strong points of air-cooled machines

         ah makers will some day come to the air-cooled way of thinking
      there are the best of reasons for the change

         designers of water-cooled cars admit that water circulating systems
      give trouble radiators no matter how well designed are delicate things
      with an air-cooled automobile the radiator water pump and piping are
      eliminated

         two sixes and two fours make up the franklin line prices range
      from  for the luxurious six-cylinder seven-passenger forty-eight-
      horse-power model ii to  for the ever popular four-cylinder model
      g the most favorably known small car bniit

             write for he booklet hiram percy maxim air-cooled convert it
             is an intensely interesting interview with mr maxim given out in his
             home city and reprinted from hartford daily times december  lmo

exchanging a habit
for a habitation

by

franklin o king

  the most independent man in the world to-dav
is the farmer-the producer upon his land he
grows everything necessary for himself ami his
family-at the lowest cost of production

  ask the automobile manufacturer who bought
the majority of his cars during  anil he w ill
tell you-the farmer ask the piano maker
where he is shipping his instruments by the car-
load and he will tell you-the country towns

  the remedy for the evils existing in our over-
crowded cities to-day is the movement-back
to the soil the city
toiler-the workingman-

the clerk-the office man
-all must look to the soi l
for the opportunity to
break clear from the eight
oclock bell the tyranny
of the boss and the dimin-
ishing chance

  this is a subject that in-
terests you personally and
i want to ask you a personal 

question how much better
off are you than last year
or the year before that

perhaps your wages are a
little higher but havent
your expenses more than
kept pace with that in-
crease arent you paying
a little more for your
clothes and your meals
and dont you smoke more
expensive cigars ami more
t tlnm than formerly if
it isnt cigars it may be
something else-some more
expensive habit

  a man begins to go down hill at forty and
the time may come when a younger man per-
haps a cheaper man will till your job the
man-who-looks ahead will prepare himself for
that time by getting a home my advice to you
therefore is to get a home while you are alih
in i so-and begin now

  i would further advise you to get a home in
the gulf coast country of texas where you can
j-row three big crops a year on the samp soil

m  

ilease send me your book independence on
ten acres

 march ivtuc kverylxklys vuuiuc

get a home where nearly everything produced
in temperate and sub-tropical climates is grown
in the greatest profusion and where irrigation
and fertilization do not eat up the profits your
hands create come where health prosperity
and happiness await you and where you can soon
look the whole world in the face and siy i
owe no man a dollar

  i believe you could save twenty-live cents a
day if you tried  know you would tk if
you could realize one-half the opportunities
offered by the virgin soil and delightful all-
the-year-around climate of the texas gulf
coast

  li you knew that men are realizing ooo per
acre growing oranges in our country or that
our growers of strawberries and early vege-
tables clear a net profit of  to  per acre

i	feel sure you would make the effort remem-
ber  hir early vegetables
get to northern markets in
mid-winter and early
spring when they com-
mand top prices

  there are three essential
elements to be taken into
account in the purchase of
land-namely soil
climate and trans-
portation i sincerely
believe that nowhere else on
earth do these three ele-
ments so combine them-
selves to the growers ad-
vantage as in this texas
gulf coast country we
have three big railroad sys-
tems-the santa fe-the
frisco-and the southern
pacific tappingour holdings
the santa fe passes right
directly through our tract
and the others are close in 
the soil is indescribably
fertile and the climate is
superior to that of either
california or florida  in-
ter and summer owing to theconslant  lull breeze

  ours is the fairest and most liberal proposi-
tion ever offered by a reputable laud company
ur contract embodies life insurance and acii-
ilent insurance and should you die or become
totally disabled your family would get the farm
without the payment oi another penny we
will also refund your money at  interest ii
you should be dissatisfied according to the terms
of  iir guarantee

  write for the book fill out the coupon in
the first column with your name and address
plainly written and mail it to the texas guli
fruit land company  royal insurance build-
ing chicago illinois the book will cost you
nothing read it carefully and then use voi r
own good judgment

  in the old days when wc were selling
the trade one of our shrewdest cus-
tomers made this experiment
he purchased a quantity of one of our
brands and put the cigars up in two differ-
ent packages

   one package he put up in tinfoil in a box of line
appearance and labelled them two for a quarter
the balance of this same brand lie put up in a
lain box in crude fashion and tagged them at
c each

   the two for a quarter cigars were big sellers
   the live cent ones stayed in the case

the smoker was stung-is stung
when we originated the direct
from factory to you plan in the
cigar business we secured the custom

           ot thousands of wise smokers who
           were glad to know that they bought
           upon a basis ot mutual good faith

               our direct from factory to you 
             plan is a simple common sense prop-
             osition because when you buy from
             us you dont have to pay the one two
             or three and-sometimes-four mid-
             dlemen their profits commissions
             and expenses

               that s just why we can and do sell
             the same values at half the price that
             you now pay at retail

               the best proof of this is that we
            have for years been doing exactly
            this thing for tens of thousands of the
            most critical smokers who buy from
            us year in and vear out

            our safe investment either
          in a -inch panetela or a  j-incli
          londres at  per hundred is a
          fair sample of our line it has an
          havana iiller and a sumatra wrapper
          -not a full ten-cent value although
          you have paid ten cents for cigars not
          so good-but a cigar that gives a
          s-cent smoker a double value at 
          cents and cuts the -cent smokers
          cigar expenses in two try it at our
          risk

                    not we will refund your full purchase
                    price in cash or exchange cigars with
                    you charging nothing for those you

armours extract of
beef many ways to
great advantage but
will cite only one a
little added to a glass
of milk gives a flavor
that is a pleasant
change both for baby
and his grand-
motber

  order a jar of armours extract of beef
from your grocer nolice its richness and
appetizing aroma

  then make your soup according to the
cook book rule-all hut the stock when
your recipe says add stock get out your
armours extract f beef and allow a tea-
spoonful to every quart f liquid

  you will have the most satisfactory soup
you have ever served with a delightful
flavor that ordinary soups cannot boast

  for armours extract of beef is the
richest most concentrated soup stock any
cook could wish

  one jar costs little more than the materi-
als necessary for a small supply of old-fash-
ioned soup stock and it goes twice as far

  it saves fuel time and trouble-no more
stewing over the kitchen stove

  mrs w k hurley
texas - i tind that
armours extract of
licef saves me lime
worry and expense i
have long depended
upon it to help me out
in my cooking and
ioiild hardly keep
house without it i

housekeeper to send
for that valuable little
cook book  popular
recipes and learn
how il helps them

 cold air falls from the ice chamber and as it gives up its frigidity
 sweeps upward through the food compartment until over the ice
 again where as it becomes cooled and condensed it falls and re-
 peats the process the ice being melted in this one-sided fashion
 gives graphic proof of this air current

the economical paint

   gallon cost is now in favor of pure carter
white lead paint

   important but this should not alone govern
the selection of paint for your buildings the
area a gallon will cover the cost of spreading
the beautiful appearance the years of service
and freedom from cracking ancl scaling should
also be considered

   by any and every standard there is no better
and no more economical paint than that made
fresh at the time of the painting with

carter

strictly pure

white lead

the lead with the spread

ind pure linseed oil if you are thinking of using any
other paint ascertain what your local paint dealer will
have to charge for it now then got prices on carter
white lead and pure linseed oil a painter can tell you
just what proportions are best for your particular work
but for comparison take  pounds of lead to  gallons
of oil with some tinting color ami drier which will
make  gallons of the best paint in the world

    you will find that carter white lead paint will cost
less by the gallon-so there is not even an apparent
saving in first cost to induce you to use any substitute
for carter white lead and while adulterated linseed
oil costs less than the pure you cant afford to take
the risk for the three or four dollars you might save on
the cost of painting your house

   how to know good paint and how to have good
paint at reasonable cost is told in our free book ptiro
paint send for it before you decide about any paint-
ing we will send with it the best set of color plates
ever issued as a help in selecting colors for exterior
painting

here is my new cigar

  ihe shivers club special cigar is only a
few months old vet my customers have
taken a quarter of a million-two hundred
and liftv thousand of these cigars -without
any advertising beyond one very simple
announcement they would not have done
this unless they felt sure that
there was not a lietter cigar in
america at anything like the
price

  the club special is  inches
long and is fatter than my
panatela the larger burning sur-
face thus giving it a somewhat
fuller richer flavor

  the entire tiller of the club
special cigar is real havana
grown in the best section of
cuba the wrapper is imported
from the island of sumatra
it is hand-rolled by expert men
dgarmakers in my model fac-
tory at philadelphia and sold
direct-thereby saving the profits
that two middlemen would add
to its price

  my offer is -i will upon
request send fifty shivers club
special cigars to a reader of
everybodys magazine express
prepaid he may smoke ten of
these cigars and return the re-
maining forty at my expense if
he is not pleased with them
if he is pleased with them and
keeps them he agrees to remit
the price  within ten days

 so much money is spent in erecting modern
 buildings that it is almost inconceivablc to
 think that thc final absolute fireproof sanitary
 artistic permanent construction feature should
 be ignored

         i briefly stated this means the failure
         to replace with steel all inflammable in-
         terior materials-of which doors
         arc but a part

  our business is the manufacture of these
 features and to influence owners and build-
 ers to insist upon and make sure of their
 installation-dahlstrom metallic doors and
 trim to you then we point out the hun-
 dreds of buildings representing thc utmost

 the vast possibilities in making interiors as
 fireproof and as lasting as exteriors

  to show you a few of these-to explain
 by word and picturc thc results already
 attained in some of thc worlds most promi-
 nent most artistic structures we have

union increases use

  when two groups of telephone
subscribers are joined together the
usefulness of each telephone is
increased

  take the simplest case - two
groupseach with three subscribers
as separate groups there are pos-
sible only six combinations-only
six lines of communication unite
these same two groups and instead
of only six there will be fifteen
lines of communication

  no matter how the groups are
located or how they are connected
by exchanges combination in-

creases the usefulness of each tele-
phone it multiplies traffic it
expands trade

  the increase is in accordance
with the mathematical rule if two
groups of a thousand each are
united there will be a million more
lines of communication

  no one subscriber can use all of
these increased possibilities but
each subscriber uses some of them

  many groups of telephone sub-

if you didnt shave with a
star this morning its
our fault-not the razors

meets every requirement of thc man who shaves

cup hinged back for easy cleaning

but we pride ourselves most upon the blades each
is made from thc finest steel-taken from the heart of
the tempered metal each is forged tempered hard-
ened ground honed and stropped individually
and by hand

our men who do this work have lived with the
star thc better part of their lives they are
trained experienced blade makers their in-
terest in thc high quality of thc star is as
great as our own they give you a blade that
takes a marvelous cutting edge-and keeps it

                           from now on we shall advertise thc product of thc
                           labor of these men we shall tell men who shave
                           about the star safety razor if you are not using
                           a star its because you dont know about it-be-
