the telephone emergency

the stoutest telephone line cannot
stand against such a storm as that
which swept the middle atlantic coast
early in the year poles were broken
off like wooden toothpicks and wires
were left useless in a tangled skein

  it cost the telephone company over
a million dollars to repair that
damage an item to be remembered
when we talk about how cheaply
telephone service may be given

  more than balf of the wire mileage
of the bell system is underground out
of the way of storms the expense of
underground conduits and cables is
warranted for the important trunk
lines with numerous wires and for
the lines in the congested districts
which serve a large number of people

  but for the suburban and rural
lines reaching a scattered population
and doing a small business in a large
area it is impracticable to dig trenches
build conduits and lay cables in order
that each individual wire may be
underground

  more important is the problem of
service overhead wires are neces-
sary for talking a very long distance
it is impossible to talk more than a
limited distance underground al-
though bell engineers are making a
worlds record for underground com-
munication

  parallel to the underground there
must also be overhead wires for the
long haul in order that the bell system
may give service universally between
distant parts of the country

author of the cradle of the deep etc

        chapter i
        the challenge

hallam brushed the clinging
snow from his knickerbockers
as they reached the top of the
toboggan slide

   will you go down again sophia
or shall we go back and have tea 
his tone was so politely bored that
miss burton looked at him and
laughed

   you are so very enthusiastic
ransford that i am almost tempted
to make you slide until you drop i
should like to see you really physically
tired for once

  hallam kicked off his heavy leather
toeguard and together they climbed
to the broad terrace beneath which
the snow-covered roofs of the city
glistened in the sun of a march
afternoon

  well he inquired straightening
his big shoulders and uncovering to the
breeze a head of rough damp tawny
hair  why shouldnt i be bored  ill
be honest and confess it but you are
just as bored as i you hate tobog-

     i	a-s c

ganing you only do it because you
couldnt come to quebec and not do
what is considered the smart thing

   how well you know me ranse
to hear you one would almost think
we were-

 sophia exclaimed hallam
sharply  dont joke how many
times have i asked you to marry me 
i ask you again i-

   that makes the fourth time in two
days smiled miss burton  the
novelty is wearing off i quite liked
it-yesterday

   thats just it hallam com-
plained  you dont even respect me
youve gotten too used to it why
wont you marry me cant you see
im sick just for the want of you
thats it i am sick thats the way
it affects people sometimes and it must
be the trouble with me - why im
bored to death with everything

   and in time you would include
me said miss burton  no rans-
ford i wont joke for a moment ill
give it to you straight i like you
i like you better than any other man i
know but youve just hit it i dont


all-story cavalier weekly

respect you if i needed you on ac-
count of your money i might marry
you just as you are but i do not need
you for your money i have plenty of
money of my own and to be honest
ranse i dont need you for anything

  if you were a different sort of
man one who possessed the qualities
that i am without a man with ideals
and ambitions and the will to carry
them to success you would have no
trouble i am sure in convincing me
that i need you if you were the sort
of man i mean i could not help my-
self i should have to marry you be-
cause it would be your will

  hallam stopped short staring at her
in amazement

  miss burton looked at him quietly
under the veil of her dark lashes

   you dont quite know what to
make of it do you ransford

   no said hallam briefly  i
dont

   then perhaps id better explain
went on miss burton calmly  you
see ranse you and i are altogether
too much alike we move from place
to place or are moved without much
thought of why we do it and we carry
on the little petty businesses of life
in much the same way that scores of
other people we know carry them on
our days and nights are planned for
us in the general scheme of the set in
which we exist we have no particu-
lar individuality of our own nor does
it seem very desirable that we should
have i have no more ambition than
you

   if i should marry you we would
become like so many of our friends
contented for a short time then rest-
less then unhappy then-well i wont
finish the picture ranse you can draw
it as well as i

   do you mean to say that i would
tire of you 

   no my dear ransford she
smiled  i left it to you to say you
have finished the picture

   and what particular line of ideals
and ambitions would you choose for

me   he asked a bitter note coming
into his voice  shall it be finance
science or perhaps philanthropy  

  at the hint of mockery she sud-
denly wheeled on him her eyes
brilliant her cheeks flushed

   oh you dont understand she
cried  you cant understand i want
a man ransford hallam a man-one
who has done something to prove it
one who no matter where or how he
finds himself has the courage and the
will to take the world by the throat
and make it do his bidding until he
gets what he wants from it i want
a man who compels who masters men
conditions me-everything it doesnt
make any difference what a man does
it is how he does it-whether he gets
what he goes after

  what have you ever gone after
what have you ever done to prove
yourself you went to college and
tutored your way through because you
were lazy and had money you played
a little football on your class team
you rowed on your class crew why
didnt you make the varsity why
didnt you stand at the top of some-
thing you didnt because it was
easier to drift-easier to let the other
fellow do the work while you looked
on with a foolish cynicism on your
tongue for his success

   and after college what did you
do you pottered with business-just
enough to learn how to clip your
coupons and collect your rents you
tried polo and yachting and you even
flew twice around an aerodrome but
you didnt go far enough with any one
of these things to make a mark even
in sport

   you quit ransford theres no
other word for it you quit

  hallam moving slowly by her side
said nothing but if she had looked
at him she would have noticed that
his chin was jutting a little farther
forward than was its wont and that
his eyes were burning under the brows
that had beetled down over them until
they were narrowed to mere slits
the quitter



and if she had laid a friendly hand on
his shoulder underneath the white
blanket coat he wore she would have
felt the muscles stiff as steel

  but she did not look at him nor
lay a hand on his shoulder instead
she kept her eyes straight ahead and
s they walked slowly toward the hotel
she continued to speak seemingly as
much to herself as to him

   perhaps i am not very clear
have you ever been in a situation
where your money could not help you
and your friends and your influence
could not help you-where it became
necessary for you to rely solely upon
yourself your own strength of body
and mind and character to pull you
through i-have often wondered what
you would do in such a case-whether
you would be equal to the lone fight
or whether you would allow circum-
stances and the men behind them to
put you under

  miss burton paused and stole a lit-
tle glance at the man by her side and
she caught at last the stiffening of the
jaw-muscles and the frowning of the
brows

  as they walked on she had an un-
pleasant feeling that perhaps she had
said too much she cast about for
something to lighten the too-evident
tension and looking up she found it

   see  she cried turning to hal-
lam suddenly  theres that woman
again-the one who wears ttfc beauti-
ful coat look at her shes coming
across the terrace 

  the woman was tall and of splendid
figure she wore a coat of fur which
the day before had aroused miss bur-
tons admiration and her envy

  it was a short fur of a peculiar sil-
very-brown color incredibly fine and
soft and the nap seemed to lie passive-
ly whichever way it was stroked so
that the entire coat was a blending of
light and shade beautifully rich in its
self-toned coloring

   isnt it the most exquisite thing
you ever saw   she exclaimed as the
woman passed  i would give almost

anything just to stroke it once and
anything to have one like it i never
saw such fur i must find out what
it is

   i have found out hallam said
shortly

   when  how  what is it  

   it is the fur of the baby musk-
ox-the unborn calf i inquired of a
furrier in the town this morning

   then i can get it here oh rans-i
ford  she cried  i could almost love
you for that 

   no he went on  you cannot get
it here you cant get it anywhere it
is not for sale sometimes-not every
year-a very few skins filter through
from the north the killing of the
musk-oxen for their young is forbidi
den and the authorities see to it that
if the skins are obtained as they some-
times are by the indian hunters they
do not find their way into the market
the furrier told me that this woman
we saw just now is a rather notorious
person and that the trading-post fac-
tor who sent her the skins lost his place
on account of it

   where pray do they keep these
musk-oxen that they cannot be hunted
and killed 

   the musk-oxen explained hal-
lam  live in the country beyond the
timber line just under the arctic circle
and inside it as far as the coast of the
arctic ocean there is a tremendous
waste of barren ground up there
where nothing grows but short grasses
and moss on which the animals feed
but they have been hunted so hard that
like the buffalo there are only a few
of them left and the indians have to
go farther and farther each year for
their quarry the skins that do come
out are disposed of generally in secret
through the factors who have confisca-
ted them from the hunters they are
the priceless furs of the world

  as they reached the hotel miss
burton started to lead the way toward
the tea-room but when she saw that
hallam was not following she stopped
and turned inquiringly
 

all-story cavalier weekly

   he was standing very still looking
at her she noticed there was some-
thing different about him-something
that caused her almost to pause and
collect herself it was as if the man
had suddenly grown in stature

   he stood there without moving and
slowly as if something were drawing
her she moved toward him

   he looked at her without speaking

    what is it ransford  she asked
her voice low and a little uncertain
 cant you forgive me for the things
i said

   theres nothing to forgive he
said slowly  they were all true

   but youre angry or-or some-
thing arent you or you wouldnt
stand there looking so grim and not
coming to tea

   im going to say good-by said
hallam quietly

   good-by   she questioned puz-
zled

   yes you want a baby musk-ox
fcoat im going to get it for you

chapter ii

the man on the bed

three days later ransford hal-
lam stepped off the train at the
end of the track

  the town marked the spot where
civilization had made her latest pin-
prick in the uncharted canadian wil-
derness

  from this place led the trail be-
yond the ultimate point to which the
south wind could faintly carry the
toot of a locomotive whistle were the
silences of the hyperborean wastes
and there lay hallams road

  it was a land of snow bright sun-
light and blue sky that greeted him as
he stepped across the little platform
he asked the conductor who could put
him up and the man pointed to a
building a hundred yards across the
square that looked as if it might have
been nailed together in a day

   as he started for it a sled drawn by

a team of dogs rounded the corner of
the station building the driver was
a half-breed by the look of him

   as the team came to a stop the two
leading dogs fought violently and the
half-breeds whip curled in between
them with savage strokes

   got any baggage  this manll
take it over for you said the con-
ductor  hey joe heres a passen-
ger

  the half-breed grinned hallam
passed him his checks and waited to
see his trunk and two heavy boxes
safely loaded the whip cracked the
dog-team straightened out and with
joe running at one side shot off across
the snow

   as hallam followed he wondered at
the stillness of the place from the
low rough shacks grouped about the
square the smoke of fires rose lazily
but of life there was nothing to be seen
it was like a deserted village

   even the dog-team had disappeared
around the back of the structure that
passed for a hotel

  hallam stamped the snow from his
overshoes and pulled open the door
after the blinding glare of the sun
the interior was hard to discern

  he blinked for a moment and then
dimly made out three or four men sit-
ting about a stove in the center of the
room the air was thick and rank
with the smoke of plug tobacco

   the low-toned conversation that had
been going on as he entered suddenly
ceased hallam took a step forward
throwing back the lapels of his great
fur-lined coat

    is the landlord about   he asked

  no one answered after a moment
there was a sound of a scraping moc-
casin on the rough floor as a welcome
it was discouraging hallam tried
again

    where is the proprietor   he de-
manded a trifle sharply

  one of the men seemed to repress
a snicker then a reedy voice came
from behind the stove

    hes in that room there i guess
the quitter



   can i see him   inquired hallam
turning to the door indicated

   sure yuh can see him if yuh go
in said the reedy voice

  hallam did not like the way the
words were spoken but stepping to the
door he opened it

  at first he saw no one there was
a bed in one corner a wash-stand and
two chairs there was some one on
the bed

   asleep thought hallam  ill
have to wake him

  he crossed the room and stopped
with a start the man on the bed was
a dead man on the forehead between
the eyes was a blue mark where a
bullet had entered

  startled shocked at finding himself
suddenly face to face with violent
death hallam stood gazing down on
the sharply cut features of the corpse

  as his thoughts slowly collected
themselves it occurred to him that he
had been victimized by those men in
the other room why they should have
played such a trick upon him an utter
and unoffending stranger he could not
understand

  he stood very still by the bed think-
ing then there crept into his mind
the suspicion that this was a test a
challenge these men wished to know
what manner of man it was who had
walked in among them

  the idea came to hallam that he
must meet it in kind-that here and
now he must show the stuff of which
he was made or forever forfeit his
right to the respect of the northland

  with an impulse that he hardly
recognized as coming from within him-
self he turned abruptly and walked
back into the outer room without
glancing at the group about the stove
he slipped out of his fur-lined coat
and dropped it on a chair with still
the feeling that it was not he himself
but another was directing his actions
he faced the silent men

   which one of you he asked in
a quiet voice  is the ill-mannered pup
that directed me in there  

  as he spoke he advanced slowly to-
ward the center of the room

  there was silence about the stove
not a man moved

  you there called hallam sud-
denly pointing his finger at the man
farthest back in the shadow  i think
you were the one suppose you step
out and let me look at you

  the man pointed at shuffled his feet
uneasily and rubbed the back of his
hand across his mouth

   will you come out by yourself or
shall i help you  

  one of the men dropped the fore-
legs of his chair sharply to the floor

   youre called whitey he said
with a short laugh  hes onto yuh
go to it were needin somethin to
cheer us up

   hold on there mister spoke up
the man with the reedy voice hastily
shoving back his chair before the ap-
proaching hallam  theres no call
for yuh to git mad i didnt mean
nuthin i see i made a mistake i
was takin yuh for one o them drum-
mers thats due to come a pesterin
around here about this time

  if it was a joke returned
hallam turning to the others  my
sense of humor doesnt take it in
who is the dead man  

   thats the landlord said the man
who had first spoken  or it was the
landlord till a yaller knife injin got
him last night across his own bar
the speaker rose

   ef yuh want to git put up i reckon
i can fix it for yuh with the widder
ill jest speak to her

  he went to a rear door and called
while the others including whitey
divorced themselves from their chairs
and filed out the first man returned

   the widder says she can take care
o yuh all right he said  yuh can
have that room there pointing to
the one in which the dead man lay
 were goin to bury him this after-
noon

   and what asked hallam  be-
came of the murderer  


all-story cavalier weekly

   oh there vvarnt no trouble about
him yuh see they drawed together
we buried mister injin this mornin

  hallam glanced about the room its
utter rawness and lack of comfort the
bare board floor the walls and ceiling
black and greasy from wood smoke
the few wooden chairs in disorder
about the stove the unwashed glass of
the windows the odor of stale tobacco
mixed with that of damp and dirty
clothing hung to dry against the wall
and the smell of backwoods cookery
from the kitchen all combined to give
him a feeling that he was out of place
a rank outsider a misfit

  a sense of loneliness and friendless-
ness suddenly rose up and possessed
him he saw in his impulsive start-
ing upon this adventure the ill-advise-
ment of youth

  he half acknowledged to himself a
wish that he had not come

  through the open door came the
sound of a locomotive chugging its
way to its shed down the track and it
occurred to him that he was not yet
altogether lost the way out still re-
mained open if he chose he could
take it

  but as the thought came shame
came with it shame for his faint heart
for his lack of courage for the small-
ness of his manhood

  he noticed the man at his side look-
ing at him curiously and he imagined
the contempt that would come into his
eyes could they read the thoughts that
were passing in his mind

  his memory leaped back to sophia
burton and her half-amused half-in-
credulous smile as he had said good-
by there could be no turning back for
ransford hallam

chapter iii

the start

 friend said the man at hal-
lams side  it aint polite in
these parts to be askin a strangers
business an i aint goin to over-step

the line none but my names jackson
thomas jackson im pretty well
known and if i can do anything-

   my names hallam mr jackson
-ransford hallam of new york
youre right about my being a
stranger-and a tenderfoot too
jackson smiled

   id be glad of a little advice and
a little help im ready to pay well for
it

  before the words were out in-
stinctively hallam felt that he had
struck the wrong note

  jackson looked at him steadily for
a moment his gray eyes narrowing

   i beg your pardon said hallam
 all right stranger returned
jackson  i just wasnt thinkin of
it that way

   youre very kind mr jackson i
begin to suspect that new york ways
and athabasca ways are as far apart
as the two places on the map

  involuntarily hallam glanced
through the open door of the inner
room where the dead man lay in full
view the cold sharp profile showing
white against the dark background of
the wall jackson followed the glance
and stepping to the door closed it

   mcavey there wont be interested
in our conversation he said

  mcavey hallam questioned

   angus mcavey

  hallam had a distinct feeling of
having heard the name recently

   mcavey he repeated  angus
mcavey

   he was one of the fur companys
factors till last summer volunteered
jackson  he had a small post way
to the north beyond the big lake

  a light broke on hallam angus
mcavey was the name of the factor
who had lost his post for selling musk-
ox furs against the companys rules

  it was on the end of his tongue to
speak of it but something warned him
that the subject of musk-ox fur was
a dangerous one to broach

   how did he get shot   he asked
instead
the quitter



   why we dont none of us know
exactly said jackson pulling up a
chair  we was out here in this room
half a dozen of us when along about
dusk an injin drove up to the door
with a sledge and a team o dogs he
come in an looked around an asked
for mcavey somebody pointed to
the bar an he went in we warnt
payin no attention when there come
two shots dost together we run in
an there they was one on one side o
the bar and one on th other both
drilled clean through the head its the
first killin we had this year

   where did the indian come
from asked hallam interested

   he was a yaller knife-half-
breed i should say from somewhere
up north no one ever seen him here
before

  why did he kill mcavey
  jackson shrugged

   dunno maybe the old man
wouldnt sell him a drink its agin
the law to sell injins then agin
maybe he had an old grudge but the
old woman mcaveys wife or widder
that is wont let on she ever seen him
before so we buried him an here
comes the boys to bury mcavey
looking out hallam saw four men
bearing a rough board coffin across the
square jackson rose and opened the
door and the box was brought in and
placed on two chairs

  other men arrived until the small
room was nearly filled the body was
brought out and laid in its last hard
bed clothed as it had been when the
man was killed

  there was a movement in the back
of the room and the men made way for
some one to pass hallam curiously
watching from a corner saw that it
was mcaveys widow a huge woman
of slightly more than middle age with
a hard expressionless face

  she walked to the side of the coffin
and stood looking down at her hus-
band as emotionless as a statue then
she sat down in a chair that jackson
brought

   ready mr sanders said jack-
son and hallam saw a young man in
the cloth of the church step to the
head of the coffin it was dark in the
room and some one held a lamp while
he read the service

  as he finished the men who had
brought the box placed the cover upon
it and raising it on their shoulders
carried it to a sled drawn by a pair of
horses that was waiting outside the
widow followed and the little pro-
cession moved out of sight

  hallam stayed where he was the
room lately occupied by the dead man
was now his but he did not go into it
the thought of sleeping there on the
bed that had held the corpse made
him shiver a little the entire atmos-
phere of the place was depressing
and he felt a wild desire to see the last
of it

  he decided to push his arrange-
ments and to leave for the north at
the earliest possible moment

  in less than half an hour jackson
and the others of the funeral party
returned and filed solemnly into the
bar jackson beckoned to hallam

   the widder he announced  asks
me to thank everybody for their serv-
ices on this here sad occasion and in-
vites those present to have a drink

  he stepped behind the bar and set
out glasses and a bottle

   well heres hopin mcaveys in
a better place than what he left said
jackson

  the toast was drunk in neat whisky
and the men filed out hallam seized
his opportunity

  without informing jackson in much
detail of his plans or giving him a
hint of the object of his journey he
told him that he wished to make his
way to great slave lake and to con-
tinue on to the northward while the
country was still frozen

  jackson asked no questions and
readily undertook to procure two dog
teams and drivers

   joe the half - breed that brought
yer boxes from the station is a first-


all-story cavalier weekly

class driver and vhis team is a good
one said jackson  the only other
good team here now is the one left
by the injin that killed mcavey im
takin charge o that an ill let yuh
have it if we can get a driver

  jackson kept a general supply store
where hallam found he could get the
provisions he needed and so it came
about that most of the arrangements
were left to his new friend by night
the lists were made out and the pack-
ing was well under way

  as hallam returned to the hotel he
found himself in much lighter spirits
things were going better than he
had hoped and with luck in securing
a second driver there would be noth-
ing to prevent his making a start at
once

  but the thought of the dead mans
bed acted as a damper upon his en-
thusiasm

  with a lamp he inspected the room
it seemed fairly clean but a splotch
of blood on the pillow where the head
of mcavey had rested sent a qualm
through him he thought of asking
the widow for another room but
from the talk of the men who came
filing in he learned that the house was
full and that two of them were even
doubling up to give him a place by
himself

  for an hour he sat in the one
straight-backed chair and read for a
second time the magazine he had
brought on the train

  but the oil in the lamp was low
the wick began to sputter and he
saw that in a few minutes he would
be left in darkness

  fighting back the squeamishness
that seemed bound to possess him he
turned the pillow to hide the blood-
spot and wrapping himself in his
fur-lined coat lay down in the mur-
dered mans place to wait for the
morning

  for hours it seemed to him he lay
there broad awake his mind intense-
ly active leaping from one thought to
another until at last he fell into a

restless broken sleep which toward
morning however became quite pro-
found

  but the new day banished the dis-
comforts of the night jackson came
to tell him that he had found a dog-
rib indian named wolf bone who
was willing to drive the dead yellow
knifes dogs

  with jacksons aid hallam settled
the advance to be paid and deposited
with the storekeeper the balance to
be turned over only on a proper
voucher

   dont never pay an injin what he
asks advised jackson if yuh do
yuhll likely wake up some mornin
and find yuhre shell-roaded with in-
jins dogs camp-kit and all among
the missin

  half the population turned out to
see them off and escorted the two
sledges to the edge of the clearing
joe the half-breed and wolf-bone
the dog rib ran beside their teams
while hallam rode on the second
sledge

  the air was crisp the sun bright
the sky blue and the dogs in the best
of condition it seemed a propitious
beginning

  but as they left the clearing and the
last house dropped out of sight and
the last man waved his hand in fare-
well hallam realized for the first
time that there ahead on the long
white trail lay the unknown

  up to the present the business of
preparation had occupied him so fully
that he had little time to turn his
thoughts onto actualities of the jour-
ney to  jackson and the other men
it was commonplace-one of the inci-
dents that went to make up their
rough lives any one of them would
have undertaken it without a second
thought

  but to hallam now that he was at
last headed out the problem of carry-
ing his venture to success bulked large

  city-bred used to the most luxuri-
ous living that civilization could de-
vise with almost unlimited money to
the quitter



smooth the path he had chosen to
loose himself from the world he knew
from the friends whose aid and sup-
port he could command from the in-
fluence that his wealth could bring
and to make his way alone to near the
top of the continent-and for what

  to bring back a rare and priceless
fur with which to drape the form of
a girl who had called him a quitter

chapter iv

in the north

en minutes after leaving the town
hallam was in the wilderness
had it not been for the blazes on the
scattering cottonwood - trunks that
marked the windings of the trail he
might have believed himself in a land
that the foot of man had never trod

  it was a late cold spring the
march sun scarcely warmed the air
above the freezing point and the snow
was in prime condition for travel
the loads were not extreme and the
pace was good

  they had not been on the trail
above half an hour when a low excla-
mation from wolf-bone in the lead
brought them to a halt joe and hal-
lam ran forward to find the dog rib
staring at the remains of a recent
camp-fire

  the two drivers examined the spot
speaking together in low tones but it
was hallam who found the clue to the
late camper

  in kicking over the dead embers he
saw a bit of rawhide and picked it
up he called wolf-bone who drove
the dead indians dogs and to his sur-
prise the man at once fitted the scrap
to the torn end of a trace in his teams
harness

  it was the slayer of mcavey who
had rested here within two miles of
the settlement why 

  as they left the spot hallam pon-
dered a man who has driven many
miles to reach civilization whether he
be red or white does not sit down

within hailing distance of the goal
and wait without a purpose he be-
gan to see something in the killing of
mcavey besides a sudden quarrel
over a drink of whisky

  at night hallam had his first ex-
perience of a sleeping-bag with the
frozen snow for a mattress he slept
warm and wondered at the comfort
of it for his thermometer at daylight
showed a drop to fifteen degrees below
zero

  they went on sleeping the next
night at a little settlement on the
bank of the river they were thence
to follow

  this was the last connection with
the world outside to the north there
was nothing of white mens work but
the far-scattered trading-posts of the
great fur companies

  now that they were following the
river the traveling became easier for
mile after mile the dogs pulled un-
weariedly

  hallam by degrees ceased to ride
and at the end of a few days was able
to keep the pace running by the
sledges

  sometimes at night they stopped
early to cut a water-hole through
three feet of blue ice for wood began
to grow scarce and often hallams
primus stove burning alcohol was
called into service

  at length they came to a long
stretch of frozen rapids where the ice
was treacherous once the leading
team broke through and there were
moments of wildest anxiety until the
dogs i were hauled dripping to the
firm ice on certain days they
hunted and hallam shot his first
caribou

  that night they had fried liver and
the dogs bolted a feast of fresh meat

  hallam gloried in it all after the
first acute tortures of muscle lame-
ness had disappeared he began to feel
himself growing strong it became a
delight to run beside the dogs to
help push the sledges over the rough
places to turn in at night by the light

of the cold stars to dream of the girl
to whom he was to prove himself

  at two fur-trading posts called by
courtesy  forts they were welcome
guests and rested one day at each
hallam giving the news of the outside
world in exchange for bed and board

  at these places he was careful not
to disclose the real object of his jour-
ney but let it be understood that he
was a mining man on his way to the
north in search of copper he did
not fear that the indians would tell
for the balance due them on their re-
turn together with a liberal bonus
promised in event of success would
effectually close their mouths

  the days were growing longer and
the sun warmer for april was in
sight and the soft condition of the
snow in the middle of the day warned
hallam that he had no time to lose

  thanks to their rifles and the cari-
bou which were now on their spring
migration to the north there had
been no lack of fresh meat for both
dogs and men and the inroads on the
regular stock of provisions had been
smaller than hallam had expected

  to save delay he determined not to
stop at the trading-post on the great
lake but to continue on to the east
and cross the lake there where the
width was not more than twenty
miles	

  when he announced this plan to joe
and wolf bone both men strongly
demurred the sledges were getting
weak they said they needed repair-
ing and the dogs needed a rest to
prevent spring sickness

  it was the last day on the river
by night they would reach the point
where the trail left the stream and
cut across country to the fort

  the men showed signs of discon-
tent and held frequent consultations
hallam had examined the sledges and
could find no serious trouble-nothing
that could not be repaired perfectly
well en route the dogs too seemed
in the pink of condition and he de-
cided that the mens excuses were

trumped up to earn for themselves a
few days lay-off

  nothing was said that night and
the tent was pitched as usual they
were awake at daylight the tent
was struck the sledges packed and
the dogs linked in the traces joe in
the lead pointed down the blazed
road to the fort

   we go this way he said

  wolf bone nodded a vigorous
assent

  but hallam was beginning to un-
derstand indian nature he stood in
his tracks and pointed to the white
sheet of frozen river

    that is our road he said

  the indians immediately took out
their pipes and seating themselves on
their snowshoes prepared to argue the
matter

   joe wolf bone said hallam
 it is necessary that i go on to the
north while the snow is yet good
you are pledged to go with me you
have been paid for half the journey
if you insist on going to the fort we
will go but if we do i shall consider
that you have fulfilled only half your
contract and that your services to me
are at an end you have been paid
half you will get no more

  the indians showed surprise and
disappointment and held a rapid con-
versation in their own tongue hal-
lam sat a little apart quietly smoking
seemingly indifferent to their decision

  at last joe came over to him and
rather shamefacedly announced that
they were ready to go on and that
there would be no more grumbling

   good said hallam  mush on
then

  the dogs broke into their steady
long-distance lope and the remaining
miles slipped under the sledge runners
swiftly at noon the lake itself was
in sight no n

  they halted on the shore of the
great white wind - swept waste-
three hundred miles from end to end
fifty miles across in the western
reaches the northern shore twenty

miles away looked like a pencil-
mark on the horizon

  while the men were gathering
wood to boil the kettle hallam sat
looking out over the vast expanse
hitherto the journey had been one of
no great difficulty any man might
have made it-almost without dis-
comfort

  here was the dividing line across
that plain of snow and ice lay the
great barren ground of the north
stretching away beyond the arctic
circle no man lived there

  here at the lake as it were the
world of human things was left be-
hind the trading-post to the west
was the last frail link between hallam
and his world-between him and the
woman he loved the woman to whom
he was about to attempt to show that
he was a man

  here indeed was he to depend
upon his own courage and his own
resources not only in the winning of
the prize he had come already so far
to seek but for the preservation of
his very life

  henceforward it was his manhood
alone that was to count

  as hallam had brought no canoe
on his sledges it was necessary that
he should cross the lake on his return
journey before the ice left it it was
his intention then to procure a canoe
from the factor at the post and make
his way back to civilization in the
quickest possible time

  so far according to the indians
and the people at the two forts at
which they had stopped it had been
an exceptionally late season so that
there was little cause for doubt that
mid-may would not find the lake still
closed

  for his choice of hunting-ground
hallam had trusted to the best advice
of jackson in whom he had finally
confided andnwho had made several
journeys to the barrens in various
seasons of the year the indians
too had backed this advice with ex-
periences of their own and while it

was agreed that year by year the
musk-oxen were retreating farther
and farther back toward the north
he felt reasonably sure of success in
the region he had chosen

  the crossing of the lake was made
in quick time and as they neared the
northern shore hallam saw that in
contrast to the low country they had
left the lake was bordered by a
high rocky ridge crowned in many
places with sizable clumps of stunted
spruce a succession of rocky islands
stretched to the northeast through the
long axis of the lake and the course
lay behind these where the party
would be sheltered from the sweep
of the wind

  monotonously they traveled on the
ice for three days but the snow was
hard the pace rapid and the head of
the lake was reached sooner than was
expected

  as they left it and turned full north
again the sparse timber was left behind
and hallam at last found himself in
the promised land the great barren
ground of the sub-arctic

chapter v

the lady of the lake

they traveled more slowly now
keeping a sharp lookout for musk-
ox signs the caribou seemed to have
deserted the country for a week none
had been seen

  the food for the dogs was going at
an alarming rate and it was plain that
unless fresh meat was soon procured
the ration would soon have to be cut
in half

  on the third day after leaving the
lake the weather which had been mild
turned suddenly cold and a blizzard
out of the northeast swept down with
a blast that bit to the bone

  huddled in the tent the men waited
for the storm to pass no wood was
procurable and they were forced to fall
back on the primus stove

  after two shivering wretched days


all-story cavalier weekly

the weather at length cleared and the
sun came out warmer than before
the new snow under its influence
crumbled into sandy crystals making
traveling at anything but a snails pace
impossible

  the indians commenced to show
signs of discouragement and new dis-
content they began to say that the
musk-oxen had gone north and that
this was a sign of warm weather they
voiced the fear that the ice would leave
the lake sooner than they had thought
and at last they openly expressed the
wish to turn back

   hallam with discouragement gnaw-
 ing at his heart laughed at their doubts
 and ordered them to  mush on but
 each day the dogs traveled slower and
 each day the indian and the half-breed
 became more sullen

   when they camped at night hallam
 was almost afraid to close his eyes in
 the fear that the drivers would steal
 away and leave him

   he longed for the sight of a herd of
 caribou to give them the fresh meat
 both men and beasts so greatly needed
 but from daylight to dark there were
 no caribou the country seemed de-
 serted by all forms of life

   for miles in every direction it was a
 blank sunlit waste of glaring white
 not a tree nor a bush above the snow
 to break the monotony of its dreari-
 ness

   in spite of his smoked glass spec-
 tacles hallam was beginning to suffer
 from incipient snow-blindness the
 pain at times was great but he bore it
 with a fortitude that was born of a
 desperate effort to preserve the morale
 of the trio for any exhibition of weak-
 ness on his part would have at once
 fomented the breeding rebellion in the
 drivers

   the weather grew decidedly wann-
 er so that thick clothing became a bur-
 den the snow was scarcely fit for
 traveling in the middle of the day and
 still signs of musk-oxen were naught

   more than once hallam felt his
 vcourage failing but the thought of

 going back beaten his prize unwon to
 hear sophia burtons mocking laughter
 and her  i thought so was a goad
 that caused his jaw to stiffen and his
 face to turn again resolutely north

  on the seventh morning since leav-
ing the lake joe announced that his best
dog the leader of his team was sick

  hallam scoffing at first examined
the animal and found it true it was
the spring sickness joe declared and
was likely to spread to the other dogs

  also there was no cure the dog
might recover he might die

   then shoot him commanded
hallam

  joe demurred it was his best dog
he said he might get better they
could wait a few days and see the
team would not work well without its
leader

  but delay for hallam would be fatal
the only chance of finding musk-oxen
was to push on to make a dash to the
north find a single herd shoot as many
as possible and then head back for the
lake traveling light

  three days might mean the differ-
ence between success and failure it
was clear that hesitation on his part
would mean the end

  he rose slowly and walked to where
the sick dog lay stretched out in the
snow its eyes half shut its breath
coming heavily from slavering jaws 

  the animal was easily the finest in
either team he had worked nobly
never shirking always the leader and
the master of the rest there was
affection in him too and from the first
he had seemed to recognize in hallam
a friend-one who spoke kindly who
rewarded effort and who did not abuse
the lash-

  as hallam stood over him the dog
lifted his head and feebly wagged his
tail hallam swallowed something in
his throat and stooping stroked the
rough coat  t

   poor old fellow poor old boy
he said

  then he straightened up and jerked
his heavy automatic pistol from its
the quitter



scabbard there was a sharp crack
the leader of the team twitched once
and lay still

  a low exclamation from the half-
breed echoed the shot and hallam
turned joe his face dark with anger
caught at his rifle and sprang up

   drop it warned hallam sharply
the automatic swinging into line with
the mans heart

   the rifle fell

   now well go on pack you loaf-
ers before the snow gets soft he com-
manded

  the drivers obeyed and the sledges
were loaded in sullen silence on they
went hallam snow - shoeing behind
his pistol loose in its scabbard ready
to his hand the weakened team
worked slower for the dogs were
hungry and they lacked the valiant
leader who had kept them to their pace
in two hours they had scarcely made
four miles

  on climbing a steep ridge hallam
suddenly found himself looking down
upon the white surface of a lake on
the easterly side was a fringe of good-
sized spruce timber the sight of those
friendly trees after the deadly dreari-
ness of the barrens was like a glimpse
of home

   go on boys  he called  well
sit in front of a wood fire to-night 

  as they stood for a moment on the
summit of the ridge taking the bear-
ings of the lake hallam noticed a
strange uneasiness in the dogs of wolf
bones team they were twisting and
whining in the traces and sniffing the
air with little yelps of excitement

  suddenly the leader dropped on his
haunches and lifting his nose gave
forth a prolonged howl immediately
the others of the team joined in and
the weird chorus went up in a long
tremulous wail unearthly in its mel-
ancholy

  hallam puzzled turned to speak to
wolf bone but as he did so the dogs
started gathering speed with every
leap they took the rough slope at a
dead run the loaded sledge its helm

guideless swaying and sluing in their
wake

   theyre running away  yelled
hallam after them wolf bone
and the two men sprang together
down the hill

  as they reached the ice wolf bone
stopped sniffing the air hallam too
stopped there was a distinct smell
of wood-smoke coming straight from
the spruce growth up the shore to-
ward which the runaway team was
making top speed

   come on  called hallam and
dropping his snow-shoes on the ice he
sped after the dogs as he reached
the point of a small headland he ut-
tered an exclamation and signaling the
two men to follow struck in toward
the shore

  what he had seen was a log-built
house not a hundred yards distant
among the trees smoke was rising
from the chimney an open water-
hole lay at the end of a well-trodden
path to the camp door

  the dogs in making a short turn
toward the shore had slued the
sledge which striking a rock that
projected above the ice had over-
turned and tangled in their traces the
animals were mixed in a hopeless snarl
all fighting tooth and nail

  but hallam did not stop he
climbed the bank with a beating heart
for this meant food shelter and above
all a human welcome

  as he approached he saw that the
door stood half open no sound came
from within and without knocking he
stepped across the low threshold

  for a second time since he had come
to the north country he entered a
strange room and saw lying upon a
bunk the form of a man and for
a second time it was a dead man

   but here with shoulders bowed until
her face touched the covers of the bed
knelt another form

   hallam stood still his eyes staring
the figure was motionless could it
be that this also was a frozen corpse

  as the door swung back it creaked

and struck against the log wall in a
flash the kneeling figure sprang into
motion and a woman faced him

       chapter vi
       norma leonard

the instant she turned hallam saw
that she was young-a girl of not
more than twenty never while he
lived did he forget that first flashing
impression of her as she stood there
a hundred questions looking from her
startled eyes with one hand pressed
against her breast the other extended
toward the bunk as if to protect the
dead

  from head to foot she was clothed
in fur and as the light streamed in
upon her from the open door hallam
saw with amazement that it was the
same priceless fur he had come to seek
-the skin of the unborn musk-ox calf
silvery gray-brown and softer than any
velvet

  the girls upper garment was cut
in a short blouse or jumper which end-
ed just below her waist her legs were
incased in closely fitting trousers tied
with thongs below the knees and met
by long boots of a different kind of
fur

 the hood of her jumper was
pushed back and hallam saw that
her hair was dark and smooth deeply
waving and also that it was gathered
in two great braids whose shining
lengths fell in front of her shoulders
down over her breast and half-way to
her knees

  her eyes were dark and he became
aware that they were gazing at him
steadily from under fine  straight
brows which now were drawn to-
gether in a slight scowl of surprise and
perplexity

  she was the first to speak

   who are you  

  her voice was low and rich and the
tone was level but there was a certain
huskiness and that bare tremor that
comes from grief

  after her simple question she stood
silent waiting for a reply there was
such quiet dignity in her bearing and
in her sorrow that hallam felt almost
as if he had suddenly broken in upon
a sanctuary

   you are in great trouble he said
gently and gravely

  he looked past her to the form on
the bed and he saw it was that of an
old man

   is it-your father 

  the girl bowed her head

   and you are alone here  

   yes she said

  hallam swept the cap from his head
and took a step toward her

   my name is hallam he said
 i am from the states and traveling
to the north i hope you will let me
help you

  the girl stood without moving her
eyes searching his face with their
steady gaze hallam returned their
look his face full of sympathy and
friendliness

   how did you happen to find this
place   she asked abruptly her brows
knitting closer

   it was chance he replied  the
first we knew was the smell of smoke
and the queer actions of one of the
dog-teams neither i nor my two
drivers had any idea there was a
human being within a hundred miles
the girls eyes slowly left hallams
face and for the first time since she
had risen she moved turning toward
the quiet figure in the bunk

  hallam from where he stood could
see the stern austere face of a man of
seventy cold impassive in its marble
whiteness the brow was high and
the features were well cut the
frame though wasted had belonged
once to a man of noble physique but
the hands were not those of one who
had labored in yojth

   when did he die  hallam asked
 just this morning as the light
came she said  he had been ill for
many weeks

  something suddenly darkened the
the quitter

is

doorway and both turned to see the
forms of joe and wolf bone blocking
the entrance their eyes wide with cu-
riosity and apprehension as hallam
started forward to motion them out-
side his movement disclosed the dead
man on the bunk

  each indian looked at the other with
a startled exchange of glances and in
an instant the doorway was empty

  in surprise hallam sprang forward
to see both drivers running down the
path to the ice he called to them
to stop but they kept on and he
leaped in pursuit the sledge that had
been capsized by wolf bones runaway
team had been righted and stood with
the dogs still in the traces at the bottom
of the bank as the indians reached it
the animals began to bark wildly and
dragging the load they bounded
straight up toward the house

  past hallam they plunged lustily
giving tongue looking back he saw
that the object of their sudden dash
was the girl she stood in the door-
way and as the dogs reached her they
sprang upon her leaping at her face

  hallam was by her side in an in-
stant seizing a heavy stick he beat
the leader off and was attacking the
others when a cry from her stopped
him

  with amazement he saw her stoop
and caress the dog that had received
the blow the animal responded with
whines of pleasure while the rest of
the team leaped about her with every
evidence of delight

  suddenly she stood up and bade the
dogs be still instantly every animal
dropped to its haunches and sat gazing
at her with rapturous eyes tongues
lolling

  she turned swiftly on hallam

   why did you lie to me   she de-
manded

   lie to you   questioned hallam
in amazement  lie about what  

  the girls scowl deepened and her
eyes grew darker and seemed to blaze
at him from under her close-drawn
brows

   about coming here she accused
 you knew where is sandy 

   sandy   echoed hallam still
mystified

  the girl made a gesture of impa-
tience

   where did you get these dogs  
she asked

  the light began to break

   i got them in the town at the end
of the railroad he said  the night
before i reached there from the states
an indian a yellow knife they told
me had been shot to death in a quar-
rel with the hotel-keeper a man
named jackson had the team in charge
he let me have it and found a dog-
rib indian named wolf bone to
drive

  the girl was hardly listening as he
finished she had fallen back against
the logs of the house wall and leaned
there staring at him

   sandy - dead who was the
man who shot him  

   his name was mcavey - angus
mcavey and he is dead too the in-
dian shot him they drew together
it was said

  mcavey cried the girl you
say angus mcavey is dead  shot by
sandy  and sandy dead

  she seemed overwhelmed and stood
motionless her face pale her eyes
staring past him at nothing

  astonishing as the whole thing was
hallam found himself piecing to-
gether the steps that had gone before
the double tragedy at railhead the
indian sandy had evidently been a
servant or a retainer of some sort to
this old man and his daughter mc-
avey had been factor of a fur post
somewhere in the vicinity

  the indian had followed him out
of the north and had killed him behind
his own bar

  so much was clear but hallam
could reason no further the motive
if there had been a motive was still in
the dark

  the girls dismay puzzled him
what could she know about it had


all-story cavalier weekly

she or the old man sent the yellow
knife eight hundred miles over the
snow to kill or had the indian him-
self brooding on some wrong done to
him by the factor set out upon an er-
rand of revenge

  as hallam watched these things
flashing through his mind he could
see that the girl was thinking hard at
last she looked slowly up

   did the indian say anything after
he was shot   she asked

   i think not hallam answered
gravely  both men were lying dead
when those in the outer room rushed
in

  the girl nodded her head abstract-
edly

   father dead sandy dead mc-
avey dead she straightened and
looked keenly at hallam

   and you she said  who are
you and what do you want are you
one of the mounted police i have
heard of them are you trying to find
out why the yellow khife killed mc-
avey and why mcavey killed him
is that why you came here  

   im not one of the mounted
hallam said  my name is ransford
hallam of new york city i have

 	j

never heard of you or your father i
do not even know your name i came
into the north to hunt to kill musk-
oxen and for nothing else i hope
you will believe this because if so you
will make it easier

   why easier   she flashed

  hallam was taken a little aback

   what are you to do alone here  
he asked  how were you planning
to live or to reach civilization i
should like to help you if you will let
me

  the girl smiled in a slow almost
scornful way

   i have lived here a long time she
said  i am at home here

   but now you are alone insisted
hallam  you cannot stay here alone
a girl like you you will have to go
back to your relatives your people
you will have to go back with me

  she smiled again the same scorn-
ful smile

   but you are not going back she
said  you are going to hunt musk-
oxen you have come a long way
besides where should i go i have
no people my father and i were
alone in the world we have been in
the north ever since i was a child i
have no place even if i wished to go
as she spoke the tone of her voice
which had been hard at first grew
gentler and from the doorway in
which she stood she glanced inside at
the form of the dead man

  hallam suddenly held out his hand
shall we be friends he said
will you tell me your name

  she gazed into his face steadily for
a moment without moving then she
slowly laid a hand in his it was a
large hand well shaped and strong
and it filled hallams palm warmly

  as he held it her grip tightened a
little and his own clasp grew firmer to
meet it still looking at him she said
 i think you are telling me the
truth i believe you my father was
norman leonard he called me nor-
ma

  norma leonard it had a simple
euphony about it that fitted her he
thought this tall strong girl with her
low rich voice and her calm almost
stately dignity

   miss leonard began hallam
but on seeing the puzzled look in her
eyes he stopped divining its cause
she probably had never been called
 miss  in her life

  shall i call you norma he
asked

   why yes of course what else  
 i wanted to ask if you had
thought about what you wish to do
with your fathers body if there is a
grave to be prepared would it not be
well for you to choose a spot it may
take some time to thaw the ground
 there is nothing to be done she
said evenly  before the sun sets we
shall be ready will you come then
there are some things i have to do

now and i think he would not like
strange people about

  hallam bowed silently and stood
watching as she entered the house and
closed the door

chapter vii

    the grave among the spruces

moticing the dogs of the runaway
team still lying in their traces
hallam loosened them and one by one
as they were freed they disappeared
around a corner of the house

  he followed and saw them clustered
about the entrance to a small hut of
logs evidently built for a kennel a
shout from the lake turned his atten-
tion to the indians who with the other
team were standing well out on the ice
waving to him

  he smiled at their panic fear of a
dead man but when he reached them
he perceived that it was something
more than that

  joe and wolf bone greeted him with
the most extreme gravity of demeanor
and sitting down upon the ice invited
him to a conference

  pipes were lighted before either
spoke then joe asked

 when you move on hallam  

   i dont know joe hallam re-
plied  the old man this girls fa-
ther died this morning he is to be
buried before sundown the girl cant
stay here alone she will have to go
on with us

   no said joe

  wolf bone grunted vigorously sha-
king his head

   what is the matter   hallam de-
manded

  both men were silent

   what are you afraid of   he went
on  an old man who is dead you
act like a pair of children what made
you run away  

   this place bad no good  we go
to-night said joe firmly

 but why insisted hallam
 are you afraid because of the way

    	a-s c

the dogs behaved  i can tell you about
that the dogs came from here the
yellow knife that killed mcavey
lived here with the old man and his
daughter they were glad to get home
that wasall

  the indian and the half-breed ex-
changel glances

   theres nothing to be afraid of
hallam went on  i myself will bury
the dead man and when that is done
we will take counsel and in the morn-
ing we will make a plan

  joe addressed wolf bone rapidly in
his own language and the dog - rib
nodded assent several times replying
shortly in his own deep gutturals joe
turned to hallam

   we stay to-night he said  but
we not go near house and dogs must
not go near we camp in trees on that
point and at sunup we go we do not
like this place

  hallam disturbed and angry could
make nothing of it to reason was
useless and to make threats was equal-
ly of no avail the men would not
move an inch from the stand they had
taken neither would they explain the
cause of their aversion to this lonely
dwelling by the ice-bound lake

  finally leaving them to make their
camp among the spruces on the point
hallam took his way back to the
house

  as he approached the door swung
open and norma appeared she did
not notice him at first but stood in the
long shaft of sunlight that fell through
a break in the trees the strange grace
of her figure clothed in shining velvet
fur straight-limbed lithe strong yet
lightly poised the calm beauty of her
face framed in the dark hair that fell
on either cheek made hallam pause an
instant to gaze

  but it was only for an instant she
saw him and spoke

   where are the dogs   she asked
 i loosed them and they made at
once for their kennel

  she stepped to the corner of the log
house and gave a low whistle in-


all-story cavalier weekly

stantly the five dogs came bounding to
her

   will you unload the sledge   she
asked  we shall need it

  hallam set about undoing the lash-
ings and placed the packs in a pile
against the house while she harnessed
the dogs he wondered at their do-
cility under her hands for while ruled
by the long lash of wolf bone the team
had been a snarling pack of rebels from
the start

  when the sledge was ready norma
turned toward the house hallam was
about to follow but she stopped him
with a gesture

  in a moment she reappeared bear-
ing in her arms a long dark shape
wrapped and corded with thongs of
rawhide in the shaggy robe of a musk-
ox she stooped with her burden and
laid it gently on the sledge while he
marveled at her strength and lack of
effort

  rising she faced him

   now i am ready she said
 will you go with me  

  she carried no whip but guided the
dogs by voice alone and as they filed
behind the sledge winding in and out
between the spruces along a trail that
some one had recently traversed hal-
lam saw for the first time a tear make
its way down her cheek and lie for a
second upon her breast sparkling in
the sun like a single diamond

  they had followed the high land
along the edge of the lake for perhaps
half a mile when there rose before
them a sharp ascent up which the dogs
trotted at a smarter gait norma ran
behind and guided the sledge by its
 gee pole

  hallam following found himself on
a fiat-topped hillock ringed about with
trees and overlooking the length of the
lake in the center of the ring hallam
saw an open grave

  norma brought the dogs to a halt
and turned

   you will wonder at this she said
 my father was prepared you see
he chose this place long ago and made

it ready this morning i came here
and dug away the ice and snow over
there are stones to lay in until it is
filled

  looking down into the pit hallam
saw at the bottom a rude structure of
hewn logs made like a box to receive
the body there was also a cover to
be lowered over it

  the girl stooped over the bundle on
the sledge and untied the strips of raw-
hide that lashed it in place

   now she said and together they
carried the dead man in his wrappings
of fur to the edge of the grave si-
lently by the long thongs they lowered
the body to the bottom

   norma hallam said using her
name unconsciously for the first time
 would you like to be alone here for
a little while  

  she shook her head

   would you like me to repeat what
i can of the service for the dead  

   no she said

  so together they brought the
stones small and large from a pile
where a fire had been burning to melt
the snow and together they filled the
grave

  at last when it was done they
turned away and following the dogs
as before drove the empty sledge back
through the spruces in the twilight
so silent so stoical did the girl seem
that hallam forebore to speak

  when they reached the house and
the dogs had been freed of their har-
ness she asked him to enter

   it will be lonely she said  i
do not wish to be alone

   i will go and see to my camp and
then come back

   for the night she said  i do
not wish to be alone to-night

  in the gathering darkness hallam
could not see her face but the words
were so simply spoken that the utter
unconventionality of the request did
not even occur to him his only feel-
ing was one of sympathy for her lone-
liness it seemed quite natural that she
should want some one with her
the quitter



  crossing- the cove he found the in-
dians with a tent pitched and a fire
burning when he told them that he
had decided to sleep in the house they
glanced quickly at each other but they
did not try to dissuade him

   in the morning hallam told
them  we will arrange what is to be
done and swinging a light pack of
personal belongings over his shoulder
he started back across the ice

  as he neared the house he saw that
a light streamed from the window

  norma called  come in in answer
to his knock

       chapter viii
       a singular hostess

hallam pushed open the door of
the cabin he was struck with the
warmth and cheeriness of the interior

  in the center of the single long room
there was a stone chimney with a fire-
place in which there was burning not
logs of wood but lumps of what he
recognized to be cannel-coal the bright
flames from which flooded the space
in front with flickering light on a
chain suspended from the roof hung
a large oil-lamp and at the other end
of the room back of the chimney he
could see two others

  for furniture there were chairs
heavily constructed of hewn timber
but luxuriously upholstered with cari-
bou hides

  a heavy square table stood under
the lamp its rough top covered with a
beautifully tanned skin caribou
horns decorated the chimneypiece
and across them rested a shotgun and
two repeating rifles at either side of
the room was a bunk furnished with
robes of fur

  norma was not to be seen and hal-
lam had time to note the few details
the interior offered after a moment
he heard a light step and the girl ap-
peared from behind the chimney

  she was no longer clothed in the
suit of musk-ox fur in which he had

first seen her but wdre a long robe
evidently made of a gray wool blan-
ket which fell nearly to her feet she
had tried to give the garment a femi-
nine touch for it was furred about the
throat and sleeves as well as girdled
with the softest of sable

  as before her two great braids of
dark hair fell before her shoulders and
well down below her waist the ends
unbound and tasseling out in thick
shining masses

  for a moment she stood looking at
him

  you will stay

  hallam nodded

   that is good she said nodding
her head  you can have my bunk i
will take this one pointing to that
on which her fathers body had lain
 have you eaten  

   not since morning

   sit here she said pointing to a
chair at the table  i know what a
hungry man is and how to treat one
she swiftly disappeared behind the
great chimney and returned bearing a
large pot which she hung on a crane
in the fireplace

  as she lifted the lid the appetizing
odor of garlic faintly arose from the
steaming contents which she ladled
out upon two tin plates she swept
the tanned skin from the table and laid
one of these before hallam on the
bare boards the other she placed op-
posite and disappeared at the rear of
the room

  when she came again she bore
forks knives and spoons and two tin
cups of tea

   eat she said seating herself in
her place  theres plenty

  to hallam it seemed as if no food
he had ever tasted was the equal of
that savory stew that no tea he had
ever drunk before was of half the fra-
grance of that steaming infusion in
the tin cup between mouthfuls and
cups he watched the girl surprised to
see that she ate with all the delicacy
that he was accustomed to find in
women

  she said little until the plates were
empty and the meal ended

   there should be bread she re-
marked as she finished the last of her
mug of tea  but i have had no time
these last few days

  she rose and cleared the table and
hallam left alone heard her rattling
the plates in a dish-pan

  full to repletion comfortable warm
and dry for the first time in weeks he
turned his chair to face the fire won-
dering whether he should offer to help
her but before he made up his mind
the work was done

  do you mind my smoking he
asked as she came to the fire drying
her hands on a coarse cloth

 she looked down at him in surprise

  no she said  all men smoke

  hallam smiled and filled his pipe
he was frankly puzzled

  with women as a rule he got on
well women liked him he was
never at a loss with them

  but here was a woman who was
different he could not make her out
she was neither friendly nor unfriend-
ly neither interested nor indifferent
she had apparently accepted his com-
ing and the slight aid she had permit-
ted him to render her as a matter of
course

  that she seemed to trust him after
her early doubts had been disposed of
even to the point of admitting him to
the house was distinctly strange

  at first he had thought nothing of
the invitation now that he had seen
the single room with its two unscreened
bunks hallam wondered she must
be either very innocent he thought
or else entirely confident of her ability
to protect herself

  as he lighted his pipe he cast about
for some opening for while he wished
mightily to learn her history her ret-
icence so far had made him cautious
of her displeasure the sight of the
coal in the fireplace quickened a
thought in the back of his mind

  you burn coal he commented

  where do you find it  

   on the shore of the lake the girl
answered  there are tons of it ly-
ing about on the ground i will show
you our storehouses

  she took a lamp from a side-bracket
and led the way to a door at the rear
in passing the chimney hallam saw
that there was a cooking-range of
small size that glowed warmly in the
dimness of the space

  swinging back the heavy-timbered
door the girl held her lamp high dis-
closing a low shedlike place heaped
to the roof with glistening black
masses tons of fuel were stored
there in one corner stood three
casks

   oil she said briefly  father
found a way to distill it from the coal
it is such a comfort-the oil the
winter nights are very long here

  while hallam still marveled she
closed the door and threw open an-
other a rush of cold air nearly blew
out the lamp and she quickly shielded
it with her hand to prevent its being
utterly extinguished

  in this freezing space hung the car-
casses of nearly a dozen fat caribou
and on one side there were great bags
made of hides filled to bursting one
stood open and hallam reached over
and plunged in his hand it was
wheat

  he turned to norma inquiringly

   wheat she answered to his un-
worded question  and barley we
raise them both in the valley of the
inlet there were some small vegeta-
bles too but they did not do well this
year and the last have been eaten i
am sorry

  as they turned back into the warm
room hallam thought of the man
whose body he had helped to bury that
afternoon

  what sort had he been  where
had he come from why had he
chosen to live in this subarctic wilder-
ness wresting from the earth and
from the wild animal life a living for
himself and his daughter what was
his purpose  what secret had he
the quitter



hidden with him in his grave within
the ring of spruces

  a man who could raise wheat and
barley in the heart of the barren
ground who could distil oil from
cannel-coal who could live in com-
fort and die in peace in this great un-
tenanted land who could rear a daugh-
ter to womanhood in the midst of
such desolation could have been no
common trapper or prospector

   how long have you lived here  
hallam suddenly asked as they reached
the fire

   not long she replied looking at
him steadily  four winters ago we
came here

  and before that

   we lived in many places hardly
ever for more than one winter and
summer they were not as good as
this and we had no coal or good oil
- grain

  hallam pulled on his pipe and
looked at the fire the girl dropped
easily into a chair and stretched her
moccasined feet toward the hearth

   norma he said  wont you tell
me about yourself  

  the girl looked up at him frowning
slightly as she had when they first
faced each other hours before

 why do you wish to know  
would i be human if i didnt
 i dont know she said  i have
never known but two human beings
since i was so small that i can hardly
remember

   only two human beings  gasped
hallam your father and - who
else your mother

   no my father and sandy-the
half - breed that angus mcavey shot
to death she replied her voice grow-
ing hard and her frown deeper

  hallams thoughts went back witl
a rush to the little frontier town and
the story of the duel across the hotel
bar it seemed months ago he re-
called normas half-stunned surprise
at the news he brought and the hope-
less look that had come into her eyes
why wont you tell me plead-

ed hallam you have shown your
trust by asking me to stay here sure-
ly it is not strange that i should wish
to know

  the girl looked at him as was her
habit straight between the eyes

   not to - night she said shortly
 perhaps to-morrow i shall tell you
something it is getting time to go
to bed

  she rose and going to the door
dropped a heavy bar into place across
it the two small windows she shut-
tered and barred also

  hallam wondered at her calmness
and poise his presence apparently
did not concern her in the least

  she went about the room putting
things to rights with the sure touch of
the practised housekeeper the lights
in the rear of the room had already
been extinguished and only the lamp
in the center now remained

   the light from the fire will be
enough she said and mounting to
the seat of a chair she fanned the
lamp out with a wave of her sleeve

  at once she walked to her bunk and
throwing back the coverings of fur
lay down

   good night  she said

  hallam still sitting by the fire had
watched her curiously her bed-go-
ing was as simple as was everything
about her there was no embarrass-
ment no false modesty

  he was suddenly left to his own de-
vices and knocking the ashes from
his pipe he unlaced his moccasins
stripped off his coat and without fur-
ther ado rolled himself in the great
robe of mink skins he found on his
bunk

  good night norma he said

  there was no answer

chapter ix

the wailing in the night

jt was a long time before hallam

  slept but soon as he lay watching
the flickering shadows of the fire on


all-story cavalier weekly

the front wall the regular placid
breathing of the girl in the bunk
across the room told him that his
presence had not interfered with her
habit of slumber

  now that he was left alone with his
thoughts the strangeness and uncon-
ventiality of his presence in the cabin
impressed itself upon him

  he went over the events of the day
one by one the strange behavior of
the dog-team the finding of the cabin
in the spruces the dead man norma
the apparent fear of his half-wild
guides the burial on the knoll by the
lake the return to the house and at
last the girl herself reticent singular-
ly unafraid a trifle brusk utterly un-
concerned

  what manner of girl was this he
asked himself-brought up in the wil-
derness by the man he had seen lying
dead a stern old man by the look
of him once a gentleman perhaps
an adventurer with the impulses and
the love of a free life passed on to
him by some pioneer ancestor per-
haps a man with a great sorrow a
recluse hiding himself from mankind
and selfishly requiring the same sacri-
fice of his child a criminal secluded
from the world

  normas beauty her intelligence
her courage her physical strength
the evident natural refinement of
speech and manner that must have
come from her father all stamped her
as unusual unique a young woman
certainly to be studied and drawn out
with patient tact

  hallam decided that to press her
for her story would be useless if he
would know it he must first gain her
respect and confidence she was at
home here independent and undis-
mayed doubtless her resources were
vastly greater than his a mere tyro in
the craft of the northland he felt
that she was quite able to take care of
herself whether she chose to live here
alone or to make her way to civiliza-
tion

  civilization he wondered how

much she had been told about the
world--his world she had not seen
it since she had been a child he won-
dered if she had read of or had been
taught to picture the places that teem
with humanity and whether she had
dreamed of some day leaving the
great open spaces and herself becom-
ing a part of the life he knew

  it suddenly occurred to hallam that
he had not seen a book or any printed
thing about the cabin was it possi-
ble that she had never been taught to
read

  he remembered her conditional
promise to tell him of-herself to-mor-
row what would that telling reveal

  gradually from norma and the
mystery of the lonely house of logs
his mind drifted back-back through
what now seemed to him ages of toil
and many happenings to that other
girl whose challenge half curious
half contemptuous had sent him forth
upon this adventure

  he fancied her incredulity when he
should tell her of this part of it-his
meeting with this young goddess of
the barren ground and how he had
become on her invitation the sharer
of her sleeping chamber where she
even now lay screened from him only
by the white impenetrable curtain of
her own unconscious chastity

  finally he grew drowsy he was
warm comfortable

  the hazy thought of how comfort-
able he was was slowly drifting through
his fading consciousness when he be-
came unpleasantly aware of a sound

  it was a low unceasing murmur
now increasing now diminishing with
uncertain timbre now rising now fall-
ing in pitch like the grief-wail of a
woman

  hallam became broad awake and
listened intently the wind was com-
ing up he could hear it whistling
in the low - hung eaves and sighing
through the tops of the spruces out-
side

  but the noise that had aroused him
was not the wind
the quitter



  he gave his attention sharply to-
ward the bunk in which the girl lay
the sound did not come from her it
seemed to come from nowhere yet
from everywhere the wind began to
blow harder and with it rose the sound

  now it seemed like a chord a har-
mony of tones now it fell again to a
voiceless murmur

  once puzzled disturbed strung to
a tension of which he was ashamed
hallam almost spoke to wake the girl
and ask the meaning he raised him-
self on his elbow his ears straining at
the mystery but he fell back with the
call unvoiced a feeling of chagrin con-
quering

  all at once he heard her stir she
raised herself and laid back the robe
that covered her she was getting up

  hallam lay still and watched covert-
ly slipping out of her bunk she
found her moccasins and approached
the fire she glanced at hallams bunk
and satisfied that he was asleep she
noiselessly lifted a great piece of cannel-
coal and laid it on the dying embers

  the flame shot up yellow and
strong throwing her stooping figure
into high relief against the shadows of
the room silently she crouched be-
fore the blaze spreading out her hands
to its warmth

  the wind blew fitfully and the
sound that hallam could not explain
wavered with the gusts the girl paid
no attention but knelt by the fire star-
ing into the heart of it her eyes fixed
in the emptiness of reverie

  lying far back in the shadow hal-
lam could see beneath the soft fur that
edged her gray robe the rise and fall
of her young breast he saw her clasp
her hands and carry them to her heart
then to her face covering her eyes

  her figure collapsed a little within
itself and above the whine of the wind
and that other sound he heard a sob

  suddenly his heart went out to her
in a great wave of warmth as he
watched his own eyes grew moist and
his throat tightened he forgot the
sound he forgot everything except that

she was a young girl alone grieving
for the father who was gone from her
forever

  his impulse was to go to her and lay
his hand upon her and offer her what
comfort the presence of another human
being might bring he stirred

  she heard and the spell was broken
instantly he saw her face change and
her figure straighten

  she rose and without looking at his
bunk went swiftly back to her own

  it had been but a glimpse but hal-
lam was glad he had seen he was
not conscious of having intruded upon
her

  it had been given to him rather to
know that for all her calmness her
poise and her repression this young
girl was like other girls a very human
soul grievously hurt by the hand of
death-and sorrowing

  as he lay thinking he felt that the
sympathy which had silently leaped
from him to her might have somehow
reached her and that henceforth there
might be a better understanding be-
tween them

  the wind still rose and fell but
more faintly the sound still mur-
mured but more softly the tension
was gone and hallam watching the
dancing shadows on the wall fell
asleep

  when he again awoke the day had
come and the light from the clear east
was flooding a yellow path across the
room

  his first glance was toward normas
bunk she was not there the fire
was burning briskly on the hearth and
listening he heard the barking of the
dogs in their kennel outside

  a light step sounded at the rear of
the room behind the chimney and he
caught the sound of water splashing in
a basin

  he wondered whether rising would
cause him to intrude he lay back to
wait for her to appear or to give some
sign

  the splashing ceased and in another
moment the girl stepped within his

range of vision she was clothed
again in the full suit of musk-ox fur

  she walked quickly to the door at
the front of the cabin threw it open
standing in its path of white light and
gazing out across the frozen lake a
straight slim boyish figure the
breath of cold air that came past her
was sweet and fresh

  hallam raised himself and threw
back his furs at the movement she
turned and closed the door

   good morning hallam said

   yes a fine day she answered
 we will have something to eat direct-
ly you will find a basin back here

  hallam swung out of his bunk and
accepted the invitation splashing his
face and neck with ice-cold water while
she stood waiting with a piece of coarse
linen for him to use as a towel

  he thanked her and used it grate-
fully a luxury he had not known for
weeks a mirror showed him the un-
becomingness of a stubby growth upon
his cheeks and chin kept from undue
length by a pair of clippers and he
vowed he would use his razor at the
first opportunity

  his comb being deep in his pack he
smoothed his rough hair with his
hands as best he could and turning
away found norma still looking at
him she had loosened her two great
braids and her hair fell about her like
a dark cloak of smooth silk

  she smiled slightly at hallams at-
tempts to subdue his tawny locks and
held out to him the comb she herself
was using

  half embarrassed by the offer he
took it used it and handed it back
whereupon she went on straightening
the tangles of her own tresses most un-
concernedly

   your hair is wonderful norma
hallam said watching her

   is it   she returned  i like it
too its so soft and it keeps me warm
when the long nights come ah im
glad theyre gone they are the worst
part of this country

  she braided her hair quickly into its
thick plaits and became busy about the
stove

   i think perhaps id better see to
my men hallam said  can i help
you now  i will be back shortly

  hallam found his fur cap and outer
coat and started down the path to the
lake when he reached the shore he
looked toward the point a thin col-
umn of smoke rose from among the
trees and he struck across the cove

  in five minutes he reached the other
side and called to joe there was no
answer

 he bounded up the bank the
smoldering remains of a camp-fire
greeted him but that was all

chapter ix

a lesson in manners

ten days later an interminably
long transport-train puffed out
of the cincinnati station its
three engines were gay in polished
brass and red smoke-stacks all three
were decked with sooty american
flags

  at the station a brass band was
braying and a brazen - lunged crowd
was still cheering for this was the
first of the several troop-trains bear-
ing drafts of recruits from cincin-
nati to the training-camps outside of
washington

  the day was stiflingly hot the
wooden cars were packed to overflow-
ing when the windows were closed
the air promptly became unbreathable
when they were open a whirlwind of
soft-coal embers and soot from the
gaudy locomotive gushed in

  the recruits however were as jubi-
lant as though they were starting on
a picnic

  singly there were choking mem-
ories of dear ones left behind and
there was perhaps dread of what
might lie before but collectively all
was noisy even boisterous gaiety

  one car whose occupants were
largely recruited from cincinnati
water-front and similar purlieus was
deafeningly rackety songs cheers
catcalls horseplay and the more or
less surreptitious circulation of flat
brown flasks were the chief compo-
nents of the fun

  the officers in charge acting on a
hint from headquarters not to press
too heavily the lever of discipline until
the recruits should reach the training-
camps did little to suppress the jolly
riot in this particular car

  yet as the racket swelled they ex-
changed many uneasy looks

  they themselves were for the most
part civilians still new to martial
ways and to the handling of men
wherefore they had gathered in the
officers compartment at the forward
end of the troop-car where there was

thi story began in the all-story cavalier weekly for july 


all-story cavalier weekly

at least breathing room and left the
men pretty much to themselves

  a new-made militia major went
through the car glaring sternly from
side to side at a loss for the exact
words wherewith to restore quiet as
he passed there was but slight lessen-
ing of the din and as he entered the
officers compartment the horseplay
broke out afresh

  a drillmaster ranking as first lieu-
tenant and veteran of the mexican
war looked up as the major entered

   a few of those fellows need a
taste of the cells or the log and chain
hazarded the lieutenant  and theyll
get plenty of both if they keep up this
sort of thing after we reach the
camps it seems a pity we were or-
dered to go easy with them on the
trips

   its mostly that big bargemaster
who enlisted last week said the ma-
jor you remember the fellow
you told me about - the one who
smuggled a flask of whisky onto the
parade - grounds and tried to drink
during drill hes cast himself for
the role of village cut-up he starts
the noise every time his latest feat
is to pelt one of the older men with
peanut - shells he picked out the
meekest-looking oldest man in sight
i suppose to make the sport safer
every shot brings a laugh and every
hit a chorus of yells

  the lieutenant glanced out of the
compartment and down the length of
the thronged car

   its a dirty shame he reported
as he drew back from investigating
 hes chosen as his butt one of the
finest old fellows in all the draft of
recruits a man ive had my eye on
since the day he joined a man with
a mystery behind him i should say
who asked the major waking
to mild interest at the magic word
 mystery  the old codger the
bargee is pelting seems a harmless
unromantic sort of fellow

   he joined a little over a week
ago replied the lieutenant  i wasi

cranky that day and i hated to see a
gray-haired man among the rookies i
was drilling for the old ones are awk-
wardest and take twice as long to
learn the simplest tactics as the young
chaps but hed passed the physical
exam and had been sworn in so i
tried to make the best of it but as
it turned out i didnt have to

   why not 

   i put him in an  awkward squad 
and started in to teach the squad how
to stand and how to step out well
the instant this old man  fell in  i
saw he was a soldier i yanked him
out of that awkward squad in five
seconds and put him in a company i
kept on watching him he had the
tactics down to his finger-ends ive
used him two or three times at a pinch
to help me drill awkward squads

   nothing very mysterious about
that is there yawned the major
 ive read several more thrilling mys-
tery stories by poe and gaboriau

   the mystery is this said the
lieutenant ignoring the elephantine
sarcasm  i cant get him to admit
hes ever served before he just shut
up like a clam when i asked him his
name is dadd-james dadd i took
the bother to look up the name on the
old army rolls theres never been
such a name in the united states
army he isnt a foreigner either

   may be serving under another
name suggested the major whom
the story did not at all interest

  is it probable nowadays men
are only too anxious to be known as
enlisting for the flag and there are
big chances for promotion for men
who have served before he wouldnt
be likely to miss those chances by
changing his name and refusing to
admit he was a veteran no its a
bit mysterious and-

  a redoubled chorus of yells from
the car brought the several officers
in the compartment instinctively to
their feet crowding to the door
they peered out over each others
shoulders into the traveling bedlam
 dad



  the humorist had just put a cap-
stone on his achievement of wit by
creeping slyly up behind the old man
whom he had been bombarding with
peanut-shells and emptying the entire
residue of the paper-bags contents
down the back of his patient victims
neck

  the exploit brought forth tumultu-
ous applause from the uncouth crowd
of onlookers near by

  dad who had smiled amusedly as
each peanut of the earlier volleys had
chanced to hit him now laughed aloud
in tolerant mirth he had seen new-
comers far more mercilessly hazed in
his earlier army days to him the
rude fun was the mere animal spirit
of a gathering of children bent on
larking it while out for a holiday

  and while he did not greatly enjoy
the task of scraping harsh peanut-shells
from between his collar and his neck
it struck him as decidedly amusing
that a full-grown man like this partly
drunk bargee should find joy in such
foolishness and that others should
deem it funny enough to send them
into recurrent and boisterous guffaws

  he was glad though that they
could laugh it would shift their
thoughts from the grief of leave-
taking he was quite willing to be
the butt of their laughter so long as
it served so good a purpose

  the bargee however was far from
pleased at his victims tolerant atti-
tude he would have preferred to see
the old man stamp and swear in im-
potent rage or mumble piteously futile
threats at his tormentor

  to achieve some such end he came
around in front of dad and hands on
hips leered down at the pleasantly
smiling target of his clownish activi-
ties

   well granpa said he  aint
you goin to thank me for them gen-
erous gifts i been lavishin so free-
handed and kind on you 

   certainly agreed dad  much
obliged my friend only you mis-
took the location of my mouth its

in front here not at the back of my
neck as you seem to have made the
mistake of thinking

  some one tittered at this very mild
pleasantry

  the titter nettled the bargee he
desired a monopoly of laughs and
through vexation his merrymaking at
once assumed a more caustic tone

  kind of a smart abe aint ye
he queried  guess that kind o talk
passes for funny back in the old
mens home dont it or did they
dig you up out of somebodys famly
vault 

  aw drop it cy expostulated a
softer-hearted recruit across the aisle

    thats right assented the bargee
 he may be somebodys great-great-
granddaddy granma starved him
and larruped him with a broom-
handle back home so he run away to
get a square feed at uncle sammys
expense aint that the way of it
granpa  

    sonny replied dad still smiling
and in perfect good nature  i ran
away because somebody stole my
comic almanac and i couldnt get on
without it i missed it a lot - till i
met you

  the titter rose again this time
swelled by several voices the bargee
reddened as he sought to digest the du-
bious repartee

  nevertheless he essayed to answer
the none too subtle gibe in like vein

   its bad enough he grumbled
 to stand up and get shot at for thir-
teen dollars a month but when weve
got to stomach an old goat like you
along with the job by gollies it adds
new horrors to war you talk like
youre the same breed as old monkey-
faced abe down there in washington
the smile was wiped clean off dads
face now his eyes were cold and his
mouth was set in a very straight thin
line

   my friend he said with slow
gravity  you dont realize what you
are saying so i will explain to you
if you will let me president abraham


all-story cavalier weekly

lincoln is commander-in-chief of the
army to which you have sworn alle-
giance in speaking of your com-
mander-in-chief as you have just done
you do not insult him-he is too high
for insults to reach him-but you in-
sult your army and likewise your own
self-respect you didnt stop to think
of that when you spoke did you  im
sure you didnt but you will another
time

  the bargees head shot forward
from between his suddenly hunched
shoulders there was a menacing
scowl on his low receding brow be-
low which his eyes had narrowed to pin-
points that gleamed redly

   i dont want no lectures he
snarled  from any fat-headed old
blowhard angry the bargee never-
theless rejoiced in secret that at last
he had roused his foe from his former
kindly calm  and ive got a right to
speak my opinions as i choose to this
is a free country or it was till they
stuck up a lantern-jawed back-woods
booby in the presidents chair thats
some more of my opinions how dye
like that 

  somebody hissed the hiss was
taken up from various parts of the car

  but at the next moment every man
was on his feet and on the instant
hush that had fallen a hundred necks
were craned

  with almost incalculable swiftness
dad had sprung up and faced the
bargee the latter reading the white-
fire message in the lately kind blue eyes
hesitated not the fraction of a second
but struck out instinctively

  the hamlike fist swished porten-
tously through the air

  but the air was all it encountered
dad ducking the blow ran in be-
fore the bargee could grapple he was
lifted bodily on high

  down he came not to the floor
but to a bended knee that caught him
lengthwise athwart the middle of the
body the bargee doubled face
downward across dads knee-like a
jack-knife

  one iron hand on the back of his
fat neck pinioned his head to the floor
with the other hand dad smote-
smote again and yet again and again

  wide-handed he struck and with
open palm on the portion of the
bargees anatomy which in that posi-
tion presented the largest and in all
respects the most convenient striking
surface

  the blows of the spanking resound-
ed like prolonged theater applause
the bargee struggled and writhed and
kicked but all in vain the hand and
arm that held him fast were as strong
as they were deft

  with no shadow of annoyance on his
handsome face dad continued to
spank while the car shook with howls
of delight from a hundred throats-
howls that quite drowned the bargees
lurid vocabulary

  at length dad paused palm sig-
nificantly upraised he asked gently

   president lincoln is a great man
isnt he

   y-yes groaned the bargee after
a moment of hesitation

   youll never forget that again 
  tfo

   im glad get up now and lets
be friends wont you share my seat
or-perhaps under the circumstances
youll feel more comfortable to stand
up for a while

        chapter x
        sergeant dadd

jx sea of pale-green sward bathed
in a drift of pink-whjte apple-
blossoms above the softest of blue
spring skies

  in the middle distance the hazy
mountains brave in their spring pan-
oply and between mountains and
apple-orchard a line of trampled grain-
fields sown now with hundreds of
sprawling dead men in dark blue and
in light gray

  back of the glowing white orchard
a dingy white city that had sprung to
 dad



life overnight a city of many long
streets each lined with battered canvas
tents

  over one of these tents - a tent
large and less dingy than its humbler
fellows - floated an american flag
topped by a gilded eagle the veriest
three-month recruit would have known
the tent by its insignia as the tempo-
rary abode of the general commanding

  through the opening made by the
pinned-back flap the interior was vis-
ible at the back was a cot beside it
a shabby campaign trunk

  in the tents center was a collapsible
table at which on a campaign stool
sat a bearded man in a gold-laced blue
coat which bore the rank mark of a
general officer of the union army

  at attention in front of the general
stood a tall wiry man bronzed of face
his grizzled hair close clipped his eye
the eye of a boy sergeants stripes
adorned the arm of his fatigue jacket

  few of the old eagle hotel coterie
back in ideala would have recognized
at a glance in the trim alert figure
their old crony the portly and sham-
bling dad

  the loose flesh that had accumulated
during fourteen years of bibulous in-
dulgence had vanished to be replaced
by hard muscle the alcohol had been
utterly banished from his system by
nine months of hard working and clean
outdoor living

  at ideala he would have passed for
sixty here for little more than forty

   sergeant dadd said the general
looking up from some papers and maps
on the table as the non-commissioned
officers shadow fell athwart his vision
 i have sent for you to act as courier
in getting copies of some important
plans through to general hooker
your success in carrying a message
across thirty miles of country infested
by the enemys skirmishing parties last
month has been reported to me  that
is why i have sent for you now

  dads face did not relax its look of
military blankness but a faint flush
of pleasure tinged the tan of his cheeks

  the general as he spoke was sorting
from the heap before him several pa-
pers whereon were written pages col-
umns of figures and rough - drawn
plans these he thrust into an envel-
ope which he triple-sealed with wax
heated in a tallow dip that sputtered
for that purpose on one corner of the
table

  then addressing the envelope he
sanded it and passed it across the table
into the outstretched hand of dad

  to general hooker himself and
no other he said succinctly

  dad saluted thrusting the envelope
into the bosom of his flannel shirt
vaguely he wondered why he an in-
fantry sergeant should be chosen for
this task in a camp that bristled with
aids and couriers

  his former feat of the sort had been
performed in a moment of dire emer-
gency for which volunteers had been
requested he had volunteered had
accomplished the ticklish task and had
thereby won promotion from a second
to a first sergeancy in his company

  but as the general spread out a pocket
map on the table and pointed to the
present position of general hookers
headquarters dad began to under-
stand why a specially equipped man in-
stead of an ordinary courier had been
selected for this particular purpose

  dad was familiar with the sur-
rounding region his corps of the
army of the potomac had marched
and fought and countermarched and
bivouacked and advanced and retreat-
ed across nearly every square foot of
it for the past two months

  he saw from a glance at the map
the location general hooker had
chosen for his new headquarters it
was nearly forty miles away and be-
tween it and the camp behind the ap-
ple orchard lay a section of country
that the confederate victory of the
preceding day would set aswarm with
graycoats

  this battle-whose grim harvest
still lay ungathered along the moun-
tain foot ten miles distant - had


all-story cavalier weekly

driven back a portion of the union
line that was seeking to wriggle its
way along the virginia peninsula to-
ward richmond

  the several corps were widely scat-
tered

  and in the interstices-notably be-
tween this spot and general hook-
ers headquarters - were masses of
confederate guerrilla - bands confed-
erate skirmish companies confederate
scout-parties and even swift-march-
ing confederate regiments and bri-
gades

  to cross the intervening space un-
molested was an exploit easier for a
high-flying crow to accomplish than
for a human being-particularly when
that human being chanced to be a
blue-uniformed yankee soldier

  the general raising his eyes from
the map on which with a pencil-butt
he was tracing the route from start
to destination read in dads eyes the
knowledge of what the journey must
mean

  m it is an expedition for a full bri-
gade said the general  or-for one
resourceful man i do not underesti-
mate the peril of capture nor do i
formally command you to go i
merely give you a chance to volunteer
for the mission if you wish to assume
its responsibilities

  dad saluted again

   i beg to volunteer sir said he
with decisive military brevity

   i was certain you would nodded
the general  i made the request as
a technicality i warn you sergeant
that the chances of capture are at
least ten to one against you that is
why i wish you to go in uniform it
may lessen your prospects of success
but in the event of capture you will
be a prisoner of war and not hanged

  dad looked more keenly at the
speaker this general of his had not
the reputation of nursing carefully
his mens lives nor of placing those
lives ahead of successful achievement

  dad wondered a little at the mans
unusual consideration but quickly

he dismissed the problem as not only
too deep for him but as immaterial

  he was eager to be off upon this
hazardous venture he knew the
country he knew his route and he
was anxious to pit his brains and his
luck against whatever foes might in-
fest the intervening districts

  you ride asked the general

   yes sir

   you will gain time that way
the risk is greater but so is the speed
go to your quarters and get ready i
will order a fast horse sent there to
you in five minutes start at once
when it arrives well he went on
impatiently as dad hesitated  what
is it

   pardon me sir ventured dad
 a man who is captured may some-
times get away but the papers he has
are seized as soon as he is caught if
i am taken and if i get away again
without my papers is there any verbal
message that i may take to general
hooker any outline of the nature
of those plans i am to carry  

 no

  the general spoke sharply and in a
tone of stark finality turning his back
on the volunteer courier and resuming
his work at the table his manner
toward him had all at once changed
from the unwontedly familiar to the
customarily dictatorial

  again wondering a little dad left
the tent and made his way hurriedly
down the camp street to his own com-
panys quarters

  there it was the work of two min-
utes to make his soldierly prepara-
tions for the trip

  then with nothing to do but to
await the arrival of the expected
horse he filled and lighted a pipe sat
down on a roll of blankets in the tent
doorway and with a stick fell to tra-
cing in the dirt a line of his proposed
route that each step of the way might
thereafter be fresh in his mind as he
started on his errand

  this act of concentration was by
no means easy for a half score of
 dad



lounging infantrymen were lying on
the grass near by smoking and talk-
ing over the events of the preceding
days battle

  realizing that a soldier in the ranks
knows far less about the actual ac-
tions and effects of a battle in which
he has just been engaged than does
the non-combatant stay-at-home who
reads a telegraphed account of it next
day in his morning newspaper dad
gave no particular heed to their
frankly voiced conjectures and boasts

  presently as they were discussing
a certain disastrous attempt to rally a
retreating regiment he heard a newly
joined member of his company-who
formerly had fought in the army of
the west - break loudly in upon the
groups debating

   talk of rallying we ought to
have had battle jimmie along hed
have drummed that whole skedaddling
regiment to a halt in less than no
time and then hed have led em back
to the firing-line blackguarding them
for a rabble of cowards every step of
the way

  whats battle jimmie drawled
a lank new englander  thats a
new name to me what is it-a dog
or a bird or a patent medicine  

   dont know who battle jimmie
is   cried the westerner in scornful
incredulity  next youll be askin
whos little mac or father abraham
or fightin joe

   maybe i will at that answered
the new englander  but who the
dickens is-

   battle jimmie there aint a man
in the army of the west whod ask
that question and yet  i dunno
who he is nobody does first time
we ever saw him was back in the late
fall we were chargin a line of bat-
teries on a hill and as fast as wed
get half-way up the hill wed break
and scuttle back to cover which sure
wasnt none too healthy on that hill-
side

   the fourth time we tackled the
hill we hadnt any too much love for

the job and we begin to waver and
get unenthoosiastic before weve gone
a quarter of the distance then all
of a sudden skallyhootin out of no-
where comes battle jimmie

   hes in a cast-off uniform miles
too big for him and hes got hold of
a drum somehow or other and say
boys the noise he could tease out of
that old drum was sure a caution to
snakes

   right in front of our first rank
he runs hammerin away at that bless-
ed drum chargin up the hill ahead
of us in a whole beehive of bullets
and grape yellin  come along you
lazy coots shake a leg there dont
keep me waitin when i get to the top
i dont want the bother of havin to
clean out them johnnie reb batteries
all by myself 

   there was one great big laugh
went up that was more like a cheer
it came roarin out from the whole
line we forget to be discouraged
any more and up the hill we kited
after that fool boy and his drum

   we didnt stop till we was over
the breastworks and right in among
the guns and the con feds was scram-
blin out the opposite side to get away
after that battle jimmie could have
his pick of anythin the army of the
west had in their whole camp-

  the arrival of a roan cavalry
charger led by an orderly ended the
narrative of battle jimmie so far as
dad was concerned his mind full
of his mission he had given little at-
tention to it

  now swinging into the saddle he
set off at an easy canter

  ahead of him lay an errand whose
chances of success the general himself
had estimated as one in ten the
prospect of such fearful odds sent a
glad thrill of combat tingling warmly
through the veteran

   jockeys have won races against
bigger odds than that he mused joy-
ously  with only a purse as reward
itll go hard if i cant do as well with
the countrys fortunes maybe as my

stake ill win out or-i wont be
alive to know im a failure

  for twenty miles v dad rode in
safety

  that did not mean he covered
twenty straight - away miles of his
journey on the contrary he lessened
the distance between himself and
hookers headquarters by less than
twelve miles

  avoiding main roads as far as pos-
sible reconnoitering and then making
detours when danger seemed to
threaten or when fresh hoof - marks
denoted the recent passing of cavalry-
men going out of his way to take ad-
vantage of hillock-and-forest shelter-
he had almost doubled the distance
that would have been needful had he
followed the direct route

  thus far he had met with no mishap
once he had plunged into a thicket
halted abruptly there and dismounted
as a troop of gray-coated patrols jin-
gled past on the road barely twenty
yards distant cautiously reaching
downward he had snatched a handful
of sweet fern and with it had rubbed
his horses nostrils lest the beast
catching the scent of the patrols
horses should whinny

  again he had turned quickly into a
high-banked and twisting lane at sight
of a dust-cloud far ahead and thus
avoided a battalion of jacksons cav-
alry

  a third time he had spurred his
horse into a gully of red clay on sound
of hoof-beats just before a band of
guerrillas or bushwhackers had can-
tered by

  his senses super-tense calling on
himself for every scouting trick that
old-time experience could devise dad
wound his tortuous way safely through
a score of pitfalls that would have en-
trapped a lesser man

  the farther he rode the more fully
he realized the truth of his generals
forecast that the chances against his
winning through to hooker were ten
to one

  in fact the prospect of any ones
making the whole trip in safety was
negligible

  the whole countryside was alive
with confederates dad could see
traces of their passage everywhere
more than once he was tempted to dis-
mount and trust to the greater safety
if lesser speed of a foot journey

  halting as usual before rounding
the bend of a by-road he strained his
ears to catch any sound of riders ahead
there was only the drowsy spring si-
lence

  he trotted around the wooded curve
-and passed four men who sprawled
half asleep on the wayside grass their
grazing horses hobbled behind them

  a glance told dad the occupation
and character of the resting quartet

  they were guerrillas such as in-
fected both northern and southern
armies irregular troops in demi-
uniform who pursued a system of free-
lance fighting and often of free-lance
plundering as well

  he had ridden too far into their line
of vision to retreat his uniform was
an instant introduction the fine
horse that he rode was alone worth a
chase from these horse-loving confed-
erate marauders

  at sight of the rider one of the som-
nolent guerrillas opened an eye the
spectacle of a blue uniform set both
eyes wide open

  he called loudly to his fellows all
four sat up with the grotesque sudden-
ness of jumping-jacks

  then they scrambled to their feet
and flung themselves at the horseman

  dad had already dug spurs into his
mount now he flashed out the pistol
he had brought along but finger on
trigger he hesitated and forbore to
fire lest the report bring to the scene
every possible confederate within a
half-mile

  the foremost guerrilla reached his
bridle and jumped for it as the horse
darted nervously forward under the
sudden double impact of the spurs

  dad threw his own body far for-
 dad



ward and with his pistol-butt caught
the guerrillas outflung wrist a numb-
ing blow that deflected the grasp from
the bridle leather

  a second guerrilla clutched at the
leg of the rider himself missed it by a
scant inch and rolled in the dirt from
a glancing contact with the roans flank

  dad was clear of the men and was
still riding at top speed a glance over
his shoulder gave him a momentary
picture of the four turning back and
running for their hobbled horses ap-
parently it was to be a chase

  dad settled himself low in the sad-
dle returned his pistol to its holster
and nursed his eager horse along at
every atom of speed the mettled brute
possessed

  the horse was not fresh but was
strong and swift dad despite his five
feet eleven inches of muscular height
was slender and no galling weight in
the saddle

  also there was every probability
that his pursuers mounts were little
fresher than his own

  yet he was riding straight into the
enemys country with no further
chance of subterfuge or skulking at
any point he might be headed off or
speedier horses might be added to the
chase

  he must trust to blind luck and to
no other mortal agency that he might
possibly be able to gain sufficient lead
to give the four guerrillas the slip be-
fore they could drive him into some
body of confederates coming from an
opposite direction or rouse the whole
region against him

  and so he rode as never before he
had ridden

  once and again he looked back
the guerrillas were mounted now and
in full pursuit strung out in a long line
of three vari-sized gaps as he looked
the second time the foremost gave
voice to the virginian fox - hunters
 view-halloo 

  it was an insult that stung the fugi-
tive to hot rage

  snake - fences copses and fields

     	a-s c

swept past on either hand the roan
was well in his mile-eating stride and
thus far showed no sign of distress at
the fearful strain put upon him yard
by yard he was pulling away from the
four laboring steeds that thundered
along in his dusty wake

  the by-road at an acute angle met
and merged with the highway

  here was added danger of meeting
foes but there was no other course
to take

  and into the ellow highway dad
guided the fleeing roan as he did so
he rose in his stirrups and peered for-
ward the sharp old eyes scanning the
broad ribbon of road for a full three
miles ahead

  the next moment he had brought
his horse to a mercilessly quick and
sliding standstill that well-nigh threw
the gallant beast off balance directly
in front hung a dust-cloud no longer
than a mans hand

       chapter xi
       devil and deep sea

he campaigner instinct told dad
what raised so odd a cloud on the
dry dust of the road from its position
and formation he knew it hung above
a cavalry column of considerable size

  a glance at the road at his feet
showed him that no such large body
of horsemen had passed during the past
two hours the column then was
coming toward him

  and between him and it lay no cross-
road

  there was but one possible move for
him for already the hoof-thuds of the
four guerrillas horses were growing
louder

  dad wheeled his horse and rode back
at a dead gallop along the main road he
had just entered

  past the byways mouth he sped and
straight on the guerrillas still on the
byway noted the maneuver and with
a quadruple yell struck out across the
intervening field to cut him off


all-story cavalier weekly

  and for a brief space their action
favored the refugee

  for the field they entered was newly
and deeply plowed moreover through
its center in a depression was a bit of
boggy ground almost worthy the name
of quagmire

  the horses lumbered heavily over the
plowed ground and sank almost to their
knees when they came to the strip of
mire the roan meantime tore along
the hard yellow highway with un-
diminished speed

  one of the guerrillas whipped out a
pistol and fired thrice in quick succes-
sion

  a bullet whined querulously past
dads head a second caught him fair-
ly in the bridle arm

  the shot was fired at longest pistol-
range and its force was almost spent
before it reached its mark yet it bit
its way through the uniform coat and
the shirt - sleeve and inflicted a light
flesh-wound in the forearm

  the shock of the blow knocked the
rein from dads left hand numbed his
left arm to the shoulder at the jerk
on the bit the great roan swerved sharp-
ly in surprise

  dad caught the loose-flung rein in
his right hand and guided the terrified
horse back into the roads center

  as he did so a chinkapin and live-
oak forest shut him off from the view
of the floundering guerrillas

   they never knew i was hit he
growled  thats one comfort

  he glanced down at his left arm
already an inordinately large patch of
blood was discoloring the blue uniform
on either side of the bullet hole

   must have tapped a big vein or
maybe an artery he conjectured as he
saw the blood trickle fast from the
edge of his cuff  at this rate ill
be too weak in a few minutes to sit in
the saddle ill have to stop some-
where to stanch it

  he looked back no sign yet of the
guerrillas he had been too far away
from the larger cavalry column he
knew for any of its riders to dis-

tinguish himself or his uniform the
thick woods still closed in the road on
either side

  dad looked for a likely spot to pene-
trate the forest

  but on both sides of the road a high
snake-fence arose a fence too high
for any horse to jump

  there would be no time to dis-
mount tear down a panel of the fence
lead his horse through and repair the
gap so that the guerrillas sharp eyes
would not detect the recent break

  so on he galloped hoping for a gate
or a lane farther ahead

  with a deal of wriggling dad got
his right arm out of his jacket and
managed to wind the jacket itself
roughly around his left arm that a
trail of blood-spots on the roads dust
might not mark his path to his pur-
suers

  around another bend swept the gal-
loping roan and now both forest
and snake-fence stopped abruptly to
continue a furlong farther on the
intervening space was filled by a soft
green lawn dotted with trees and cut
off from the road by a four-foot stone
wall

  far back on the lawn and bowered
by oaks stood a rambling house of
colonial style

  on its pillared front porch sat the
littlest and daintiest woman imagina-
ble she was in black and wore a
little frilled white apron her gray-
ish hair formed a mass of soft curls
around her forehead on her lap was
a basket of knitting

  all these details dads eyes saw
without fairly grasping them as he
galloped into view and his heart
sank

  he had heard of southern womens
splendid loyalty to  the cause this
woman would assuredly tell his pur-
suers that she had seen a man in yan-
kee uniform ride past she would add
that he was very palpably wounded

  thus would die his last hope that
they might give him extra time by
pausing to beat up the woods for him
 dad



  dad was turning away from his
fleeting glance to scan the road ahead
for a lane or other opening when sud-
denly he shifted his gaze in astonish-
ment back toward the white-columned
portico

  the little woman had sprung to her
feet with the agility of a child and was
waving her knitting to him in frantic
summons

  he had traversed fully half the
length of the cleared lawns space as
he saw the signal acting on light-
ning instinct he reined in his mount
wheeled him to one side and put him
at the wall

  the roan with a mighty effort
cleared the obstacle came down heav-
ily on all fours on the springy turf of
the lawn and bounded toward the
house

  the little lady had run down the
steps and was jumping up and down
in wild excitement in the driveway

  tumble off quick she ordered
 get into the hall there and shut the
door behind you ill tie your horse
in that magnolia copse over yonder
its so thick-grown i guess theyd hunt
a week before suspicioning a critter
was hid there

  dad rolled out of the saddle in
dazed obedience staggered weakly up
the steps and into a broad hall that
bisected the house from front to rear
the dim coolness struck him like a
blow he groped for a horsehair
sofa that he could just distinguish in
the half-light sank down on it and
slid helplessly from its slippery seat to
the polished floor-in a dead faint

  within a minute he opened his eyes
and broke into a fit of strangled
coughing a most horrible odor had
gripped his sense of smell

  above him knelt the little woman
in one hand she held a bunch of
feathers torn from a duster in the
other a still lighted match a fume
of smoke from the feathers spoke elo-
quently of the odors origin

   nothing like burning a bunch of
feathers under a bodys nose to bring

them out of a fainting fit she wag
saying cheerily  dont look so wild
man youre safe enough or you
will be presently can you stand upi
try

  dad called on all his failing
strength and helped by the little lady
and a hand on the sofa-arm reeled t
his feet

  so she approved now yoii
just lean on me and on the banisters
weve got some climbing to do your
horse is safe hid and the men thaij
were chasing you have ridden past
but theyll be back

        chapter xii
        the little lady

jritting his teeth to keep his will-
power up to the task dad began
mounting the spiral stairs that led
from the big hallway to the upper
regions of the house he leaned
heavily on the mahogany banisters on
one side and as lightly as possible on
the little ladys black bombazine shoul-
der upon the other

  once or twice dizziness again over-
came him but he forced it back

  they reached the upper hall dad
would have stopped but his inexora-
ble guide urged him on

  down the hall they went and at the
farther end came to a door that she
unlocked and opened before them
rose a shorter narrower steeper flight
of steps

  a herculean struggle brought dad
to the summit of these around him
were dim spaces vaguely redolent of
old lavender somewhere near bees
were sleepily booming and crooning

  his eyes growing used to the dim
light he saw that he was in a huge
garret-a garret wherein were strewn
quaint bits of bygone furniture horse-
hide trunks ghostly garments in white
muslin wrappings and broken-down
household goods of every description

   sit there  ordered the little lady
thrusting him gently into the depths of


all-story cavalier weekly

a soft old armchair whose upholstery
was shamelessly moth-eaten

    now as he gratefully followed
her command  just stay there till i
come back

 she vanished

   dad stared after her in dull wonder
 his mind was still hazy he knew
 he had fainted momentarily through
 loss of blood but he wondered that
 he had since then felt no weaker as
 the minutes had gone on gingerly
 he unwound the coat from his injured
 arm and rolled up the sleeve of his
 shirt

   then he understood

   the vein that had been tapped-it
was assuredly no artery nor even one
of the very largest veins-had bled in
crass profusion for a space then the
caking of the blood had checked fur-
ther flow

   dad was surgeon enough to realize
that that meant there could be little
if any more flow of blood from so
petty a wound

   he was looking from side to side
in search of something better than a
uniform jacket wherewith to bind the
hurt when again the little lady stood
before him

   tucked under one arm was a black
case under the other were rolls of
white bandages in both hands she
bore a basin of hot water in which a
soft sponge bobbed like a floating
island

   there  she said soothingly
 just you lean back and rest ill
tend to the wound

   with deft fingers she bathed the
arm then sponged the bullet-graze
clean of blood from the black case
she drew a bottle filled with some
pungent liquid with this liquid she
washed out the wound then proceed-
ed to bind it skilfully with a roll of the
bandages

   so slight was the hurt that but for
the accident of its touching the wrong
vein it might well have caused so
healthy a man no more annoyance
than would the process of vaccination

  yet for once in his life dad felt no
inclination to belittle a physical mis-
hap

  he discovered - and wondered
vaguely at the discovery-that it was
marvelously pleasant to lie back like
this and let his strange little hostess
minister to his hurt her touch too
held for him a strange and soothing
magnetism all its own not for
twenty years had a gentlewoman laid
her hand upon him

  the novelty of it was delightful
yet in his heart dad felt the novelty
was by no means all

  as she worked the little ladys
tongue went as nimbly as her fingers

   isnt this what ehud used to call
rank good luck   she was saying
 this afternoon of all afternoons
too why three days out of four im
as busy as tunket all afternoon and
here just to-day i said to myself  i
guess ill sit on the stoop a spell and
play lady and do some knitting and
i hadnt been there three minutes
hardly when past you came prancing

   theres another piece of luck too
only this noon i let all three of the
house servants run over to the win-
stons plantation to a wedding in the
servants quarters over there and i
sent tom-hes my gardener the only
man slave ive got left here-over to
see they didnt stay too late any
other day theyd be screeching like a
pack of wildcats at sight of a yan-
kee

   but madam expostulated dad
finding his voice at last  surely you
run a risk harboring a fugitive union
soldier it was selfish in me not to-

  risks she caught him up
gaily  sakes i run risks every
day of my blessed life these times
when the confederates arent steal-
ing my chickens the yankees are steal-
ing my pigs or both of them in
turns are stealing my cows its a
mercy my teeth are my own or those
would have gone too long ago

   still there must surely be a risk
in hiding me here you said those

men would come back and if they
do-

have to ask the recording angel to blot
out some of the fibs ill tell them
risk theres no risk they arent
likely to search the house not up-
stairs anyhow the servants wont
know anything and i dont believe
any one will search the magnolia
thicket to see if theres a horse teth-
ered there

   just you rest easy theres no
risk either for you or for me

   i cant thank you he faltered
 i havent words to but i think you
know how grateful i am

   grateful for what for not let-
ting you ride on until you ran into
some picket-party down the road
nonsense theres nothing to be
grateful about

   when i saw you streaking past
my house wounded on that fine big
horse of yours i knew well enough
no yankee soldier would be choosing
these parts to take a pleasure ride in
i knew by the way you rode there
must be some one after you so what
was there to do but ask you in  

   i-i thought you southern ladies
hated all yankees like poisfrn i hard-
ly expected-

   southern ladies  me dear man
southern massachusetts is the farthest
south i was born born and bred
there in south wilbram ten miles
out of springfield do i talk
southern  

   no i-that is why i wondered-
we came south here to virginia
ten years ago my husband-he was
captain ehud sessions-captain in the
mexican war you know-his health
failed him and dr ballard said hed
best go south to live so we sold out
in wilbram and came down here we
and our daughter shes married now
and living out in new york city

   a couple of years later ehud died
it didnt seem to do him any good
down here and all the time he kept
peaking for the wilbram mountains

after he died i kept on running the
place here because it was less lonely
here than it would have been back
home without ehud

   ive been doing it now for eight
years all alone except the servants
but a body thats busy hasnt much
time for pining so- have i fast-
ened that bandage too tight 

   no it is perfect you are a
wonderful nurse	v

   ehud always said so she an-
swered highly gratified at the praise
he knew a lot about doctoring and
nursing picked it up in the mexican
war and he taught it to me ive
thought sometimes if this war keeps
up maybe ill close the place here and
run up to washington and volunteer
as a nurse they say theyre needed
badly sometimes after battle and
there arent any too many of them
you would put a premium on reck-
lessness every man would be trying
to get sick or step in the way of a
bullet

   now isnt that a real pretty
speech  she cried flushing delicately
 and a woman fifty years old her
last birthday too

   madam said dad right gallant-
ly  i beg you wont tax my credulity
by saying you are a day over thirty
 listen to the man  she laughed
happily  yes sir im fifty years
old last may according to the record
in my family bible

   never before in my life returned
dad have i been tempted to doubt
the truth of one word that is written
in the book of books but-
wait she said as though re-
minded of some neglected duty and
again she vanished

  this time she was gone for fully
ten minutes leaving the fugitive to
dream strange sweet vague dreams in
the shadows of the quaint garret

  at last she came back bearing this
time a tray whereon rested a most de-
lectable little supper

  dad had eaten nothing since dawn
at her behest he fell to with a will


all-story cavalier weekly

and as he ate his strength came slow-
ly back to him rest and food were
steadily repairing whatever damage
the temporary loss of blood might
have wrought upon his seasoned con-
stitution

    i took a good look for those guer-
rillas of yours she said as he finished
eating  but theres no sign of them
yet this road in the direction you
were going winds and twists like a
sick adder they might ride on for
ten miles before they could be sure
you werent riding just ahead of them
and theyd have to search all along
the way back before they get here

    i must go he said starting up
 ive lost too much time already

   if youre aiming to lose time
said she  go by all means but if
you want to get safely to wherever
you were riding youll stand a better
chance after nightfall and especially
after thosa fellows pass here on their
way back otherwise you might run
into them at the gate theres much
jess traveling at night on these roads
only the patrols and they generally
sing to keep from falling asleep in
their saddles so youll probably hear
them in time to get out of their way
oh and i sneaked out and fed and
watered your horse

   inclination for once sided with com-
mon-sense and dad sank back again
in the big chair the thought that
this utterly charming little woman
might be annoyed by a search of her
house on his account sent his hand in-
voluntarily to his pistol holster

   it was empty

   with a thrill of dismay the man re-
alized that he must make the rest of
his perilous journey weaponless

  he remembered thrusting back the
revolver into its holster after his brush
with the guerrillas on the by-road he
had thrust it back carelessly and
hard riding had evidently caused it to
slip out of its resting place and tumble
unnoted by him to the ground

   his start of surprise drew the lit-
tle ladys attention

    what ails you   she asked solicit-
ously  does the wound hurt 

   i wish it did he replied in the
ponderous gallantry which suddenly
had seemed to come so easy to him

 so that i might get you to bind it
for me again but it is something
more important than a petty scratch
on the forearm that bothers me just
now ive somehow lost my pistol i
have no weapon to protect you in case
those ruffians should try to come in
and no weapon to protect myself for
the balance of my ride

   oh thats too bad  she sym-
pathized  it beats all how careless
a man is about losing weapons ehud
was just like that with his razors

   dont you worry about protecting
me i wont need any protecting but
if you want something to fight with in
case you should be held up on the
road-why ive got just the very
thing for you take good care of it
though wont you  

   she darted across the attic floor and
in among the shadows returning pres-
ently with a straight-bladed infantry
sword of a somewhat antique make

  handling it almost with reverence
she offered it hilt foremost to dad

   it wras ehuds she said gently
 he set a lot of store by it he car-
ried it all through the mexican war
i think i told you he was a captain
there it cost thirty-two dollars and
seventy-five cents including the letter-
ing is the light too dim for you to
see the lettering its on the blade

 it says  draw me not without
cause sheathe me not without honor
 i-i kind of think youre the kind
of man who can keep that command-
ment take the sword

chapter xiii
the alarm

qad received the weapon from her
hands as reverently as she had
tendered it his fingers closed about
the fretted ivory hilt and he read in
 dad



the fading light the inscription on its
blue-steel blade

  then he handed it back

   a beautiful sword he said a
catch in his voice  and one that any
soldier might rejoice to wear at his
side the sword of a brave man i
am sure such a man as would to-
day be striking gallantly for our dear
country if he were still living i am
honored past words at your gift
but-i cannot accept it

  what she asked her eyes big
with wondering disappointment
 why not  i dont grudge it to you
a mite nor ehud wouldnt either

   you dont understand he ex-
plained feeling as though he had
brutally rejected the love-offering of a
child  i cannot wear this splendid
sword because i am not entitled to
such a weapon is worn by none but
commissioned officers i am only a
sergeant and a sergeant is not per-
mitted to carry a sword of this kind
any more than he is allowed to wear
epaulets

   but-

   i should treasure this gift above
any other i have ever had he went
on  if the laws of warfare would let
me take it i shall never forget that
you offered it to me-an utter stranger
-out of the generous bounty of your
heart please dont think i dont ap-
preciate it

  reluctantly she restored the sword
to its hook on the raftered ceiling

   pm sorry she said if ehuds
sword could go on fighting id feel
happier

  if i could carry it to victory
madam id feel prouder than i can
tell you

   well maybe youll be able to wear
a sword at your side some of these
days if youre a sergeant now and
if you had the pluck to ride alone into
this nest of hornets- by the way did
you come alone or were you separated
from your regiment

   i came alone i am carrying des-
patches to general hooker

   fighting joe eh thats a man
after my own heart where is he
dad told her

   sakes alive she ejaculated
thats the best part of twenty miles
from here and all the district just 
abuzzing with confeds you must be
brave 

  no one in our war is brave he
corrected  some are cowardly some
are foolhardy but the bulk of us on
both sides of the quarrel just plod
along and do our duty as ive tried
to do mine to-day it isnt bravery
its duty

   ive an idea she suggested  that
bravery and duty add up to pretty
much the same thing whether its in
storming a fort or selling a yard of
calico anyhow mister-mister-

   dadd he answered glibly

 james dadd

   anyhow sergeant dadd she
continued smiling ever so faintly at
the odd name  i know men pretty
well and i believe youd do your
duty squarely and honestly whether
it was in war or in a shop

   madam said dad miserably  i
didnt do my duty in either and as
for honesty i have been even more re-
miss why i have just told a lie that
shames me to the soul i have told
it to the ministering angel who saved
me from death or capture and who has
since played good samaritan to me
the only woman in years who has
shown me her sexs divine pity

   i have lied to you about my name

it is not james dadd it is james
brinton

  he dared not look at her but spoke
rapidly his eyes downcast his fingers
foolishly busy with the torn fringe of
the chair in which he sat

  i-i call myself james dadd he
blundered on  and i suppose i have
a right to for it doesnt harm any
one and it gives me a chance to be in
the army they wouldnt take me
under my own name but oh i love
the old name and it makes me ashamed
every time i have to use the other one


all-story cavalier weekly

still ive always figured-till now--
that its nobodys business but-
somehow i cant lie to a woman thats
got eyes like yours

   unless im very wrong she said
after a little breathless silence  you
arent given to telling lies to any one
at all man or woman mr-brinton
as for going to the war under another
name i cant see anything very terri-
ble in that i take it you didnt enlist
with the idea of cheating folks out of
anything 

  no he declared almost fiercely
 no 

  and again silence fell there in the
dusty lavender-scented garret

  dusk was pushing the shadows for-
ward from the mysterious corners and
shoving them farther and farther into
the little window-lit space where sat
the man and woman

  at last mrs sessions said

 i spose all women are inquisitive
 they must have one drawback to
keep them mortal he countered with
a brave attempt at his earlier tone of
gallantry

   but she went on impersonally
 why a fine upstanding man like you
should go to war under a silly name
like dadd when hes got such a fine
name as brinton certainly does make
me curious not she added in
polite haste  not that its any of my
business-as maybe you were going to
say

   i was going to say he contra-
dicted  that any of my affairs are
also your affairs as far as you honor
me maam by making them so

   you say pretty things she
laughed in pleased embarrassment  i
wonder if a woman ever gets too old
to love to hear them pretty speeches
wasnt ehuds way but he always
liked to hear other men - folk make
them to me it flattered his judgment
he used to say

   i fancy his judgment used to get
flattered tolerably often ventured
dad

  but she did not hear her brows

were puckered and she was murmur-
ing his name in perplexity

   brinton she mused  brinton
its queer how natural that name seems
to me because it isnt such a com-
mon name either wait a second and
i can tell you where i heard it my
brains all full of little scraps of things
ive heard and tucked away there im
rummaging there now like fury
presently ill find it oh i know 
then she stopped ashamed

   you remember  he asked miser-
ably

  no she denied that is i
cant remember but one man of that
name ehud told me about him long
ago and it made an impression on
me at the time

   tell me about him urged dad

   oh tisnt a nice story besides
theres just a bare chance that maybe
he was some kin of yours-the name
being so uncommon-and id hate to
hurt your feelings

   go ahead  he begged in the
same perverse spirit that had prompted
him since this turn of the conversa-
tion to pursue it toward the bitter end
 there are many brintons i-i be-
lieve a man named brinton was down
in mexico during the war there per-
haps thats where captain sessions
heard the name  

   that was the place and that was
the man she said  ehud was in
general scotts army you know a
captain of infantry his regiment
was on duty one day at a celebration
-for some victory or other-and up
rides this brinton man disgustingly
drunk and spoils the whole celebration

   he insulted general scott some-
thing terrible ehud said then he
fell off his horse asleep and they
lugged him to the guard-house and
thats the last ehud was ever able to
find out about him they never court-
martialed the man or anything ehud
said he guessed brinton escaped in the
night the wicked old sot whats
the matter sir is the wound hurt-
ing you so bad 
 dad



   yes  panted dad  but not the
silly scratch on my ann it is a
thousand times deeper

   and you never told me  she cried
in genuine alarm  here ive been
chatting so selfishly with you and
never doing a thing to help you wait
till i fetch you some brandy

   i-i dont need it thank you he
replied  and i never touch it any
more ive sworn i never will the
wound i spoke of is on my soul  not
my body i-

   i thought all army men drank
once in a while shall i get-

   no thank you im all right
again i dont know that the majority
of army men drink though a drink
is a consoler after a long days march
and it helps drown the memory of the
comrade who was shot to pieces at
ones side but it is a consolation
thats not for me it consoled me too
often-till nothing else worth while
would trouble to console me

   mrs sessions you have been very
good to- me i havent the words to
tell you how good and-

   and because of that as well as
because no man could lie to eyes like
yours i wanted to tell you something
something that may make you sorry
youve done so much for a worthless
old derelict something that will sure-
ly make you ashamed that you honored
him with the offer of your husbands
sword i-i am the james brinton
whose story captain sessions told
you

  lands sake you never are

   and the reason he heard no more
of me was because i was dismissed
from the service i had degraded and
was secretly kicked out of the army
and because i was forever kicked out
of it i had to sneak back into the
service under a false name

   is that all  she asked quietly

   that is all-except to say good-by
and get out of the house where ive
let myself be entertained under false
pretenses

  he rose as he spoke sick at heart

and all at once feeling very very old
and wretched

  he realized with a queer pang that
the last hour had somehow been the
happiest he had ever known and by
contrast the future seemed to stretch
away before him dreary and barren as
a rainy sea

  dad took an uncertain step toward
the head of the attic stairs a small
and determined figure barred his way

   go back  came the imperious
command  go right back where you
were and sit down there you may
have said all youve got to say but 
havent by a long shot

  dully he obeyed her his flesh
shrank from the thought of listening
to the merited tongue-lashing that he
felt was his due yet like a scared
schoolboy he recognized and meekly
obeyed the note of authority in his
hostesss voice

   now then  she said planting
herself squarely in front of him
 arent you ashamed sergeant james
brinton arent you ashamedf toll-
ing me on like that to say scandlous
things about a poor man whose story
i only half-knew oh im cruel
shrewish old woman to go on like i
did about brinton-about you

   who am i to sit in judgment on
a poor weak man whose love for drink
overcomes him sometimes why
im just every mite as bad myself
without my morning cup of tea im
no good at all i lean on it as men
lean on whisky

   but madam- he stammered

   i want to tell you how sorry i am
for talking like that she rushed on
unheeding  and to tell you that no
man who looks and talks the way you
do was ever a sot or a scoundrel
weak maybe yes we all are but
never bad

  would-would you let me tell
you he faltered gripped by a sud-
den overwhelming impulse to make
this wonderful little woman his mother
confessor-to tell her what he had
never clearly told himself


all-story cavalier weekly

  she nodded eager kindly assent

  in a voice at first incoherent almost
broken but that soon steadied into
narrative force dad told the whole
pitiful tale

  he did not strive for effect he
spared no needful detail he spoke as
though of a third person calmly im-
partially

  when the story of his mexican
disgrace was done he went on to tell
her of his homecoming his futile life
for the past fourteen years his con-
tinued degradation the sordid sur-
roundings the unworthy hopelessness
of it all

  only when he spoke of jimmie did
an unconscious softness and a thrill of
pride come into the deep voice

  he told of his sons departure for
the front the bedside talk with jimmie
in the moonlight the escape from
ideala the kneeling vigil on the hill-
top where he had forever shaken off
his dead self of his later army
achievements he said little

  it was twilight now all over the
battle world the long twilight of
early summer and in the attic dark-
ness left the faces of the man and
woman visible only as dim white rifts
in the gloom

  presently dads deep voice ceased
there was a hush through which the
far-off throb of a complaining whip-
poorwill from far down in the bottom-
lands by the river came to their ears

  mrs sessions had drawn insensibly
closer to the speaker as the story
progressed but she had not once in-
terrupted nor now that the tale was
done did she speak

   now you know it all he said
breaking the long silence  and i
suppose youre as disgusted with me
as i am with myself as general
scott was when i-

  he caught his breath with a gasp
something in falling had touched the
back of his outflung hand something
tiny and stingingly hot-a tear

   mrs sessions  he exclaimed in
wonder

   i-im not given to blubbering
she answered choking back her sobs
 i didnt know i was doing it oh
you poor poor dear 

   you dont despise me after all
ive told you about-

  despise you she echoed almost
shrilly  despise you  listen to me
sergeant any man can strut around
pompous like on the top of the moun-
tain if he was born up there or boosted
up there but the man who can climb
there-as youve done-who can climb
there out of the mire and muck that
hes been shoved down into that mans
a-a man and the mud on his gar-
ments comes pretty close to looking
like royal ermine

   im talking like a schoolgirl that
reads novels but its all true ser-
geant brinton id like to shake you
by the hand please i wish ehud was
here to do it too 

  dad even as he groped for and
found the warm and slender little
hand in the darkness could not bring
himself to give mental indorsement to
the last half of her wish he was
quite satisfied that the late captain
ehud should remain in paradise in-
stead of invading his earthly homes
attic just then

  the two hands met in a clasp that
each sought to make frank and hearty
but hands are less docile than faces
in masking their hearts mandates
and the fingers that met so formally
forgot somehow to unclasp dad
found the little womans hand nestling
quite comfortably and contentedly in
the big grip of his own and if she
struggled to withdraw it the struggle
was so very faint as to escape the
notice of either of them

  dad had risen to his feet through
the gloom he was looking down at the
half-seen figure whose hand he held
and something long long dead was
stirring strangely in his heart and his
soul

  very reverently he lifted the little
hand and laid it against his lips hold-
ing it there a moment while the tender
 dad



sweetness of the contact mounted like
music to his brain reluctantly he un-
clasped his fingers from about their
precious burden and for a space he
and his hostess stood staring wide-
eyed into each others half-invisible
faces

 then-

  if my daughter could see me
now said mrs sessions a little break
in the laugh she forced to her lips
 shed say i was an old fool

   if my son could see me now an-
swered dad  hed say i was not only
an old fool but an old scoundrel as
well but jimmie wouldnt jimmie
would understand jimmie always
understands oh you must meet
jimmie 

   id love to id love to be just
like a mother to the boy whos done
so much for-

  if you dont mind ventured dad
bashfully  id a lot rather youd be
just like a-a grandmother to him
then in the dark there-very simply
like two little children they kissed

  and on the instant the quaint old-
world stillness of the attic was split
by the noise of many pounding hoof-
beats

chapter xiv

dad the paladin

jhe ground-shell of the driveway
below resounded thickly to the
thudding of hard-ridden horses then
with a multifold shuffle the hoofs
came to a standstill

  there were heavy steps on the
porch a hammering broke out as
of gun-butt or sword hilt against the
front door panels and a voice shout-
ed  let us in 

   sakes  whispered mrs sessions
 id clean forgot there must be a
hundred of em from the sound

   no corrected dad his practised
ear having enumerated the hoof-beats
 not more than four or five i should
say probably the men who chased

me this morning theyve come back
as you said and-

  she was gone slipping down the
stairs in swift noiselessness closing
the attic stairway door behind her

  pausing only long enough to light
a sconce of candles on the table in the
wide hallway mrs sessions sped to
the front door whence the clamor had
risen to a deafening pitch

  unbarring the door she flung it
open and stood on the threshold a
tiny spirit of wrath

   what do you folks mean   she
demanded hotly  what do you folks
mean by banging all the varnish off
my door panels like that couldnt
you use the brass knocker what do
you want anyway disturbing an old
woman like this  

  four guerrillas gave back for an in-
stant-if only for a bare instant-be-
fore her indignant outburst then one
of them laughed

  the spell was broken pushing past
her the quartet trooped into the hall

  at a glance mrs sessions could see
they were tired cross and-apparent-
ly-more or less drunk they had
evidently moistened more than once
the dry tedium of their afternoons
search

   youre old yankee sessionss wid-
der i reckon said one of the four

   yes she snapped  i am but
ive lived hereabouts for ten years
without ever before hearing rude
language from any southern man no
regular confederate soldier would
speak to a woman that way either or
burst into her house without a  by-
your-leave its you guerrillas that
are the pest of both armies but you
arent going to be the pest of my
house out you go all of you 
you spitfire hiccoughed the
camp follower  i wish there was
still a ducking-stool for scolds keep
a civil tongue in your head or well
find a way to revive the ducking

   what do you want here  

   were looking for a runaway
yank seen him go past


all-story cavalier weekly

   why didnt you say so first in-
stead of cluttering up my clean hall
with mud and kicking the polish off
my door yes she added with per-
fect truth  i saw a yankee he was
riding lickety-split along the road
there

  how long ago

   i dont know quite a while back
he seemed to be wounded

  the four moved excitedly toward
the door

   i said so  cried one of the men
 just what i told you he sneaked
into the woods somewhere and we
rode past him then he doubled
back

  wounded hey said another
 my shots dont miss i knew i
winged him if we can get another
mile or two of speed out of those nags
we may overhaul him yet

  three of the men were at the door
the fourth following paused to light
a cheroot by one of the candles on the
table

  as he was starting on after the
others he came to a sudden stop his
exclamation brought the three bush-
whackers back into the hall the man
pointed melodramatically at a little
pool of drying blood on the polished
hardwood floor in the full glare of the
candlelight beside the pool lay a
federal infantry cap

  there was no need for words the
story told itself the four men with
one accord turned on mrs sessions

  she had as though by sheer chance
taken up a position at the stair foot
and there she stood magnificently
futile and as futilely magnificent as a
sparrow that bars a prowling tomcats
way to her nest

  well she demanded shrilly
 what are you going to do about it 
 do  laughed the drunkest of the
four  root him out of course and
youre libje to keep your hair tidier
if youll take us straight off to where
youve hid him

   ive told you twice to get out of
here she replied not a faintest trace

of fear in her authoritative voice

 and now i tell-

   yes growled the man suddenly
turning savage at her words  and
your husband old yankee sessions
told me to get out of his house once
a few years back i was just out of
pen and i was hungry i stopped here
and told his black butler to rustle me
some grub and a little spending-money
or id cave his woolly head in thats
the way to speak to niggers and
he-

   thats the way nobody but  poor
white trash  ever speaks to them down
here contradicted mrs sessions  i
remember the time ehud was sick
abed with quinzy and-

   and just as id got that nigger so
scared that hed do anything i told
him snarled the bushwhacker drink
and a sour memory combining to en-
rage him  down them stairs rushes
old yankee sessions half dressed and
wavin a sword in his hand and he
kicked me-yes kicked me-out of his
house the dirty yank i reckon heres
where i square accounts with his long-
tongued widder

  he lurched to the stair-foot and
caught mrs sessions roughly by the
shoulder 

   show us where youve hid the
blue-backed cur  he ordered  or
well-

  he got no further

  at his brutal touch mrs sessions
had involuntarily cried out a cry of
stark indignation not of terror

  and in the midst of the guerrillas
surly threat she saw the unshaven
mouth grow speechless and slack the
drink-bleared eyes widen in crass
horror

  the unwashed paw fell inert from
her shoulder the man reeled back a
step as though struck across the face
he was staring stupidly at the stair-
way and his fellows had followed the
direction of his gaze

  all this in the fraction of a second
even as mrs sessions turned to note
the cause of the strange panic
 dad



  out of the darkness of the upper
landing had sprung a terrible figure
for an instant as it gathered itself to
bound down the broad and shallow
flight of stairs it was vaguely and
weirdly outlined by the uncertain
candlelight below

  a man towering fierce coatless and
without waistcoat his face was white
and distorted with wrath his eyes
blazed in the half-light like living coals
his gray hair was abristle

  above his head flashed a sword-
blade

  yankee sessions croaked the
drunken guerrilla in babbling fear
 yankee sessionss ghost just as he
came at me that day when-

  the man at the stair-head cleared
the intervening steps in three bounds
with a berserk yell he was among the
guerrillas his swirling sword giving
forth a million sparks of reflection
from the candle-glow

  there was a moment of wild tur-
moil of clashing of yells of madly
stamping feet

  mrs sessions leaning weakly
against the newel-post of the banisters
saw an indistinguishable mass of
figures whirling jostling screaming
while once and again above the ruck
flashed the sword-blade like a tongue
of silver flame

  a cleverly aimed sweep of the blade
as the knot of men swayed bodily to-
ward the table and both candle
sconces were knocked violently to the
floor

  the sudden darkness was too much
for the guerrillas drink-shaken nerves
still in strong doubt as to whether the
hero who had attacked them were
ghost or human they had made shift
momentarily to hold their ground

  but to cope in the dark with a pos-
sible wraith - a homicidal wraith at
that - was more than they had bar-
gained for

  panic - mad and unreasoning -
possessed them behind an oblong of
lesser gloom through the blackness
showed the location of the door

  and through the door they surged
pell-mell

  down the steps they rushed and
flung themselves upon their waiting
horses out of the grounds they gal-
loped and down the road

  a hundred yards farther on they
drew rein as by common consent
but before they could bring their
mounts to a halt the clatter of hoofs
behind them sent their scared gaze
backward

  by the pale starlight they could
just distinguish their half-clad foe-
enormous and ghostly in the dim light
- astride a monster horse bearing
down on them at the speed of an ex-
press-train the sword still gleamed
above his head

  there was no pause there was no
consultation there was no impulse to
investigate

  swayed by a single purpose the
four guerrillas urged their tired
horses to a run down the road they
streamed their ghostly foe in close
pursuit

  presently - or as it seemed to
them after a thousand years of ter-
ror-flight - the foremost of them
reached the by-road and with the
instinct of a burrow-seeking rabbit
he wheeled his horse into it his three
comrades followed his example

  they had ridden for perhaps a mile
when the rearmost of them paused to
make certain of what he had begun
to hope that their terrible ghost-foe
had ceased his pursuit

  one by one the guerrillas drew in
their exhausted horses no hoof-
beats or any other sound came to
them on the summer nights still air

  shamefacedly the men looked at
one another then without a word
they set off at a walk for their camp
five miles away

  dawn was breaking as dad rode
into a tent - street and up its long
straight course at his side was a
union cavalry captain whom he had
encountered when the first sentry and


all-story cavalier weekly

corporal of the guard at hookers
outposts had halted him

  on a little rise of ground from
which the streets of tents fell away on
every side was a farmhouse com-
mandeered by major-general hooker
as temporary headquarters and into
a front room five minutes after his ar-
rival dad was conducted

  general hooker was picturesquely
clad in a mere fraction of his uniform
and was gulping down large mouth-
fuls of very black and very hot coffee
from a tin dipper in his other hand
was a slice of unbuttered bread

   sergeant james dadd of the
blankth ohio infantry announced
dad saluting  with despatches from

brigadier-general--

  he paused in consternation midway
in his formal announcement

  to his amaze general hooker set
down his portable breakfast on a win-
dow-sill gaped in wonder for an in-
stant at the courier then burst into a
fit of unextinguishable laughter

   the despatches sir volunteered
dad  are of the utmost importance

so i was told by general-

   importance  gasped hooker
weak with laughter  oh man im-
portance  do you mean to say he
didnt tell you didnt you even
guess 

chapter xv

fighting joe

 uess   echoed dad returning
the generals amused gaze with
an expression upon his own face of
gross perplexity  i-i dont under-
stand sir

  general hooker seemed to realize
that his habitual easy informality to-
ward his subordinates - for which
they adored him and whereon none
had been known to presume - had
gone well-nigh beyond bounds

  for he checked his laughter and
with a touch of authority in his big
voice said

   make your report

  briefly dad outlined the orders
given him by his brigade commander
the adventures he had undergone on
the previous day and the clever
scout work and hard riding which had
marked the night stage of his journey

  hooker listened with real interest
his eyes under half-closed lids nar-
rowly reading the speakers features
yet when the short recital was finished
the mirth sprang back unbidden into
the generals tanned face

   sergeant dadd he asked whim-
sically  do you ever think  

  the odd question tenfold more
strange coming from a general officer
to an enlisted man deepened dads
bewilderment

   think   he repeated

  yes or do you prefer to be the
supposedly model soldier who works
like a machine and who leaves to his
superior officers the task of think-
ing 

   when thinking can help an-
swered dad  i suppose i do my
share of it but i dont let it inter-
fere with the orders given me

   did you happen to think when
you were told to ride across nearly
forty miles of hostile country with
these despatches for me   insisted
the general the same quizzical look in
his half-shut eyes

   frankly sir returned dad  i
did i remember that i thought-
well urged hooker impatient-
ly out with it man if it wasnt
complimentary to any one in particu-
lar dont be afraid to say so

   i thought sir answered dad
 that if those documents werent all-
important it was strange that a mans
life or freedom should be risked in
delivering them and i thought if
they rvere all-important there must be
some safer and surer way of getting
them to you than by sending that
same man through a region where
there was barely one chance in a dozen
-in a score-of his being successful
in reaching you
 dad



  hooker nodded approval

   good  he vouchsafed  and
wondering that you still did all in
your power to win through safely 

   i had orders sir

   and you set out to obey them 
well sergeant you did not obey
them

   the envelope- began dad

   is here with its contents undis-
turbed but it doesnt belong here
by this time it ought to be in jack-
sons hands perhaps even in lees
you still do not understand 

  dad essayed to speak then hesi-
tated

   you set down your general for
a fool insisted hooker  dont
deny it man well he isnt one he
hit on a wise scheme the scheme he
proposed to me last week and which
had my endorsement these papers
were carefully made out-lists maps
directions and all for the exclusive
benefit of-jackson and lee

   do some more thinking for a mo-
ment and then see if you cant guess
the riddle

  dad had forestalled the command
already his brain was hot on a trail
of conjecture he recalled what his
general had said of the chances
against the missions success and of
the unaccustomed care that same gen-
eral had taken in warning him to lose
liberty rather than life should danger
threaten

  he fell to rehearsing what general
hooker had first said and bit by
bit the truth came to him

  you begin to understand asked
general hooker reading his every ex-
pression

   i hope sir returned dad stiffly
his color rising  that i am mistaken
in supposing that my commanding
officer sent me into the enemys coun-
try expecting me to be captured he
said the chances against my reaching
you were ten to one and even worse
but-

   ten to one   mocked hooker
 a hundred to one-thats how much

worse-a thousand to one humanly
speaking there was no chance that a
federal courier-least of all a mount-
ed courier-could get through for
forty miles the whole country is alive
with confederates a trained spy
might have hoped to do it yes in
disguise and on foot and with three
days to make the trip but a mounted
man in uniform with instructions to
hurry-there was no chance such a
man could not possibly have avoided
capture yet you did

    the despatches then that i have
just now handed you-

   the despatches you just handed
me are no longer worth the paper
theyre scrawled on yet in the con-
federates hands they would have
been worth their weight in gold-no
diamonds-to us

   then-

   they were very carefully pre-
pared - for the enemy they are
crammed with vital and categorical
misinformation of the most interest-
ing kind as to our movements our
numbers our disposition it is an old
trick but the papers were so care-
fully prepared that carried by a pal-
pably honest man-

    i see sir broke in dad a wave
of honest hot wrath driving all
thought of discipline momentarily
from his brain  and i was the dupe
the honest fool who would make a
blundering effort to get through to
you and would honestly and vehe-
mently resist capture so that on my
dead or captured body the false in-
formation would be found i catch
the idea

    a soldiers duty began hooker
 is to-

   is to obey orders and in a war
like this most soldiers enlisted pre-
pared to throw away their lives
blithely for their endangered country

   i am no exception if my com-
manding officer had told me what i
was expected to do those documents
would be in general jacksons camp
now and i would be on my way to the


all-story cavalier weekly

hell of a southern war-prison i am
not indignant at being used in this
way for the good of my country nor
even at being used as a catspaw but
i am indignant at failing to serve the
cause through my very effort to suc-
ceed in doing it

   if i have spoken too freely i ask
your pardon sir but if i may sug-
gest it it would be better another time
to tell me frankly what i am supposed
to do or else to choose some less
zealous man as dupe

  hooker no whit offended by his
subordinates unusual language lis-
tened patiently to the close of the
angered outburst

  what is that for he asked as
dad paused for breath

  and as he asked he pointed toward
the couriers jeft hip dad glanced
down following the directions of the
inquiring gesture

  thrust through his elt was the
naked sword mrs sessions had given
him vaguely he remembered placing
it there for safe keeping and to have
it out of his way as he had ridden on
after the four fleeing guerrillas who
had galloped up the byway in the
nights perils and need for eternal
watchfulness he had forgotten it

  now blushing like a schoolboy-
his keen soldier-sense horrified by so
glaring an error in his equipment-
more chagrined at the unpardonable
lapse than had he been caught going
barefoot to a presidential review-
shame swallowed his former resent-
ment

   i-i apologize sir he said con-
tritely  for appearing in your pres-
ence wearing a commissioned officers
sword

   where did you happen on it 

   i lost my revolver the sword
was-was given me for self-defense
at a house where i hid when guerrillas
were after me i used it in getting
away again then stuck it in my belt
in case i should be attacked in close
quarters at some time during the
night

   you need not apologize to me or
to any one said hooker slowly
 from this time on for wearing a
commissioned officers sword your
commission as first lieutenant of in-
fantry will be signed by president
lincoln as soon as my next courier
goes to him in the mean time you
are an acting-lieutenant

   keep the sword i wish all newly
commissioned officers had as good a
right to one as you have just shown
yourself to possess

  dads head swam he tried to
stammer out halting phrases of grati-
tude hooker cut him short with an-
other brusk laugh

  if we played a trick and you were
chosen as the catspaw said he
 youll at least bear witness that i
know how to reward a catspaw whose
claws are as alert as yours go across
to the staff mess and get some break-
fast then take a few hours of sleep
jyou look as if you could make use
of it

  dad saluted with the sword he had
drawn and turned to go hooker
recalled him as he reached the thresh-
old of the tent door

   lieutenant dadd he said in-
quisitively  do you chance to have
been at the point  

  no sir i am not a west point
man

   were you ever an officer in the
army  

   you will not find the name
james dadd on any army list i
am afraid sir answered the new-
made lieutenant shaking inwardly
with fear of exposure

   hm  mused hooker  proba-
bly not probably not its no affair
of mine or of any ones but dont
deny it too strenuously to other people
who may ask you-or rather if you
dont want them to ask you dont
draw a sword and salute with it as if
you had handled such weapons for
years

   infantry privates do not carry
swords and when they are first pro-
 pad



moted they dont handle them as you
do that is all good-by lieutenant

      the chickahominy

jx boggy tree-strewn stretch o
lowlands where whitish mists
hung thick at dawn and whence mi-
asma vapors rose under the broiling
sun of midday

  a delightful place for duck and
quail shooting in midwinter in sum-
mer a rank plague spot-and incident-
ally on this particular summer of
 the camping ground of the army
of the potomac the malarial region
whose name even to-day sends a
shudder along the bent spine of many
an oldster

  chickahominy swamp

  for months major-general mcclel-
lan commander of the army of the
potomac had pursued his fated penin-
sula campaign along the peninsula
in early spring he had marched his
mighty army to the speedy capture of
richmond

  battles were lost battles were won
chances were lost chances were blind-
ly thrown away

  more than once the spires of rich-
mond were in plain view to the grim
tired men of the ranks on one occa-
sion had they been allowed to press
their advantage they could have
charged into the confederate capitals
streets at the heels of a lesser body of
foes who were in headlong flight

  but that one golden chance had
been lost through official hesitation
and it could never come again

  for lee and jackson by massing
their scattered forces rendered the city
impregnable whenever fresh danger
seemed to threaten richmond lee
made a demonstration toward wash-
ington which caused a rushing of
federal regiments to repel the sup-
posed danger and rendered a mass at-
tack on richmond out of the question

    	a-g c

  so through a terrible summer of
non-achievement the once redoubtable
army of the potomac lay for the most
part in chickahominy swamp lay
there and rotted

  pestilence did not  stalk  through
the camps it swept through them like
the lightning breath of the death-angel

  to one man who died in battle four
died of disease a locality that even
the heat-hardened virginians were
wont to shun in summer chickahominy
swamp exacted horrible toll of lives
from the northern invaders

  thus rested wearily inactive the
army that was the hope and pride of
the union and at every turn lee and
jackson outgeneraled its leaders the
confederate force opposing to the ill-
led northerners greater bulk a speed
and deftness that paralyzed its bulkier
foe

  so that at last the north which had
so excitedly shouted  on to rich-
mond  beheld in growing amaze the
reverses of its bravest sons and clam-
ored vainly for a change from wash-
ington too came first protests then
rebukes then an imperative command
that the peninsula campaign be brought
to an end and the army of the potomac
remove from the chickahominy pest-
hole

  back from the swamp and to less
fatal ground farther away from the
lost goal of its ambition the huge army
was withdrawn the confederates
working havoc upon their retreating
foes

  it was in one of these flank attacks-
a mere flea-bite for the main body of
the army but as vital as gettysburg it-
self to the army corps directly con-
cerned in it-that lieutenant james
dadd won his captaincy for gallant
conduct in the face of the enemy

  a week later the demi-corps to which
his regiment was attached chanced to
be far to the left of the massed army
on special detail and was returning to
headquarters

the regiments marching in close
formation were ascending the long


all-story cavalier weekly

gradual slope of an almost inter-
minable hill when their videttes ap-
peared over the summit riding back
like mad while at almost the same mo-
ment from a wood to their left and
slightly to their rear broke out an ir-
regular line of white smoke

  a masked battery in the forest sup-
ported by several regiments of confed-
erate riflemen had opened fire on them

  before the nearest federal ranks
could wheel to repel the attack the fly-
ing videttes from in front reported a
large body of confederates who had
somehow gotten between the detach-
ment and the main army and were ap-
proaching at the  double  from the
far side of the hill up which the line of
march led

  even the federal corps commander
-a political appointee with three
months actual military experience-
saw the gravity of the position cut
off from in front and attacked on the
left flank they might well be captured
as had been more than one equally
large body of federals during the ca-
lamitous year

  and on realizing that fact the newly
appointed corps commander who was
still weak in nerve and body from a
touch of swamp-fever proceeded to
lose his head

  regardless of the presumably great-
er danger that was approaching from
behind the far-off hilltop to the front
he noted only the more palpable peril
in that booming cannonade and rifle-
fire from the woods to the left being
only a temporary fool and not a cow-
ard he stuttered to his aids a series of
orders that sent fully half his atten-
uated corps swinging leftward in close-
formation attack on the forest

  fully twelve hundred yards of open
country lay between the wood-edge and
the federal line

  to charge a seen foe is one thing
to attack an invisible enemy who is en-
sconced in unknown numbers behind a
screen of leaves is quite another xnd
this the advancing line promptly real-
ized

  the order to charge was given
across the field of fresh-cut rye-stubble
started the federals

  a charge in a picture-book is an
inspiring sight in real life it consists
of various blocks and lines and other
formations of uniformed pawns mov-
ing awkwardly and with exasperating
slowness all in one direction athwart
the vast checker-board a retreat is
far more picturesque and less geomet-
rical

  advancing by order in close aline-
ment the blue-clad men offered a mark
not to be missed a near-sighted child
in the thick wood-fringe could scarce
have failed to wreak vengeance in their
ranks

  the whole edge of the forest was
white now with belching smoke from
which spat jets of yellow and red fire
solid shot grape and rifle-fire tore
grotesque gaps in the oncoming ranks

  with no opportunity to avenge their
losses or even to see their slayers the
federals plunged onward

  first at the double they moved their
officers trotting sword in hand at the
side of the companies barking sharp
commands and closing as well as might
be each new and ugly rent in the lines
then the orderly rhythmic run grew
shambling

  one man in a regiments front rank
wheeled and tried to bolt back-any-
where out of reach of the whizzing
crashing viewless death that was stri-
king down his companions at every
step

  a lieutenant struck the coward
across the face with the flat of his
sword and howled curses at him stri-
ving to beat him back to his duty

  but by this time another man and
yet other men had followed the panic
example here and there from the
chokingly tight front rank men had
begun to drop out or to plunge back
into the line just behind them throw-
ing out of gear the exactness of com-
pany formations infecting hundreds
with their terror

  it was no longer possible for officers
 pad



to check individual cases of fear
their whole attention was taken up in
keeping the bulk of their men in line
and in keeping them advancing

  the dead strewed the stubble ground
in windrows the fire-streaked smoke
rolled out in a blinding acrid wave from
the nearing fringe of trees

  and at every yard of distance gained
the confederate volleys waxed more
and more accurate the piles of dead
higher and thicker

  unscathed the woods defenders
were killing by wholesale and a corps
commanders folly was paid for in the
lives of hundreds of better wiser
braver men than himself

  a riderless horse his back broken
by a grapeshot crawled along the space
between the federals and the woods
dragging his hind legs behind him and
screaming hideously above the near-by
din

  a major sword in hand running ten
yards in advance of his regiment and
hallooing to them to come on stopped
abruptly his brown face turning sud-
denly to a mask of blood and fell
where he stood

  he was major in dads regiment

  and dad himself as the men wa-
vered on seeing their loved officer fall
leaped forward sword aloft to take
the dead mans place ahead of the line

  his lean body tense his mild eyes
aflame the sword of old ehud sessions
whirling in wild encouragement above
his bared head captain james dadd
charged onward yelling to his men to
follow and not only his own com-
pany but the whole regiment obeyed
that call

  for another fifty yards the federal
line-now irregular as a snake-fence-
plunged forward dads regiment the
blankth ohio infantry forming its
foremost point

  but flesh and blood could not stand
the increasingly galling fire from the
forest mortal nerves were not proof
against the horrible strain of advancing
to be struck down by the invisible with
no chance to strike a single return blow

  to have halted if only once and to
have fired a chance volley even in-
effective or its effect unseen into the
trees and underbrush whence poured
that hail of death would have been in-
finite relief

  but the officers had had their orders
from the chattering corps commander
and those orders were to advance at
the double and to continue to advance
until the federal line should come to
grips with the foe

  despite the frenzied exertions of
their officers the men began to lag
the trot slacked to a walk the walk
to an almost general and very waver-
ing halt

  dad hoarse and exhausted knew
that the next move would be a cave-in
of the demoralized line then a retreat
that would change to panic flight and
a universal hurling away of rifles and
knapsacks moreover that soldiers
who once allowed themselves to flee in
that fashion would never again be the
same men

  their usefulness in war would be im-
paired by full fifty per cent even as a
horse that once has run away is no
longer to be trusted

  the old man redoubled his furious
efforts to rally his regiment and to
force it onward to the charge the
whole crooked line had halted

  it was wavering like the tail of a
kite presently it must snap

  then - from nowhere in particular
-from the skies some vowed after-
ward-came a diversion

  down the field in a line parallel to
the woods and a dozen rods in front
jof the wavering federal line galloped
a gun-carriage horse its harness flap-
ping and flying about its flashing
hoofs

  astride the barebacked horse was a
small and marvelous figure the figure
of a short and stocky boy fiery red of
hair his powder-blacked face freckled
his little eyes glaring he was clad in
the obviously chopped-down uniform
of an artilleryman

  on his back suspended by a strap

that was fastened around his neck
bounced and rattled an enormous
drum in the boys trouser waistband
were stuck two drumsticks

  the lad was kicking vehemently
with his heels at his horses stomach
but as he came midway adown the
federal line he jerked his mount to a
halt slid to earth and in the same ges-
ture unslung his drum

  he had halted not twenty feet from
dad

   now then shrilled the boy his

 loafers waiting for hey charge

   he faced the woods his drum

 in the ranks

of-your very remarkable story

  mr wallis bowed stiffly he was
evidently a little disconcerted at find-
ing so large an assembly and glanced
at me in particular with undisguised
disfavor while i my oiled hair de-
formed eyebrows and false beard not-
withstanding perspired with anxiety
lest he should recognize me

been watching him anxiously gave

him no chance of raising objections
but proceeded to open the matter
forthwith

   i have not brought any digest or
precis of the case said he  because
i know you prefer to hear the facts
from the actual parties but i had
better give you a brief outline of the
matter of our inquiry the case is
concerned with a mr john anson
who has been closely associated with
mr wallis for very many years past
and who has now without notice or
explanation disappeared from his or-
dinary places of resort ceased from
communication with his friends and
adopted a mode of life quite alien
from and inconsistent with his previ-
ous habits those are the main facts
stated in general terms

   and the inquiry to which you re-
ferred   said thorndyke

   concerns itself with three ques-
tions replied marchmont and he
proceeded to check them off on his
fingers  first is john anson alive
or dead second if he is alive where
is he third having regard to the
singular change in his habits is his
conduct such as might render it possi-
ble to place him under restraint or to
prove him unfit to control his own af-
fairs  

  to certify him as insane if i may
put it bluntly said thorndyke
 that question could be decided only
on a full knowledge of the nature of
the changes in this persons habits
with which no doubt you are pre-
pared to furnish us

   but what instantly strikes me in
your epitome of the proposed inquiry
is this you raise the question whether
mr anson is alive or dead and then
you refer to certain changes in his
habits but since a man must be alive
to have any habits at all the two ques-
tions seem to be mutually irreconci-
lable in relation to the same group of
facts

  mr wallis nodded approvingly

   that said he  is just our diffi-
culty certain things seem to me to

point to a probability that my friend
anson is dead certain other things
make me feel almost certain that he is
alive it is a complete puzzle

   perhaps said thorndyke  the
best plan would be for mr wallis to
give us a detailed account of his rela-
tions with mr anson and of the latter
gentlemans habits as they are known
to him after which we could discuss
any questions that suggest themselves
and clear up any points that seem to
be obscure what do you say march-
mont 

   it will be a long story march-
mont replied doubtfully

   so much the better rejoined
thorndyke  it will give us the more
matter for consideration i would
suggest that mr wallis tell us the
story in his own way and that mr
howard take down the statement
then we shall have the principal data
and can pursue any issue that seems
to invite further investigation

  to this proposal marchmont agreed
a little reluctantly fortifying himself
for the ordeal by lighting a cigar and
mr wallis having cast a somewhat
disparaging glance at me began his
account of his missing friend which
i took down verbatim and which i
now reproduce

   my acquaintance with john an-
son began more than forty years ago
when we were both rated as midship-
men apprentices on board the black
ball liner carthage when anson
joined the ship with a cousin of his
named robert vyne i had already
served one year of my time i need
not trouble you however with the de-
tails of our life at sea but i must men-
tion one or two apparently trivial cir-
cumstances because though trivial
they developed important conse-
quences

   i will begin with one that seems
very trivial indeed while i was at
home from my first voyage i had
given to me a little gold locket i
wont say who gave it to me-that is
of no consequence it is more than
a silent witness



forty years ago but i may mention
that it contained in one-half a tiny
charm compass and in the other the
portrait of a young woman

   when i went to sea again i natu-
rally took the locket with me and part-
ly to keep it out of sight of my ship-
mates and partly for sentimental rea-
sons i wore it suspended from my
neck under my clothing but the con-
ditions of life in the midshipmens
berth frustrated my efforts to keep the
little trinket hidden and then to es-
cape the incessant chaff of my fellow-
apprentices i set up the pretense that
the locket was some sort of charm
and that i carried it about with me to
insure good luck

   it sounds now a sufficiently fool-
ish statement but in those days the
rank superstitions of the fcle found
their way pretty freely into the offi-
cers quarters my ridiculous expla-
nation was accepted quite simply and
the little locket which got to be known
as  walliss luck acquired quite a
reputation

   it is curious gentlemen to see
how easily people deceive themselves
i am not more fortunate than other
people but through the medium of
this supposed amulet i gained a repu-
tation for extraordinary luck when-
ever i came off winner in any game of
chance the fact was eagerly noted
while the occasions on which i failed
to win were passed over and forgot-
ten and always of course any good
fortune was attributed to the precious
locket

   i have said that these supersti-
tious beliefs were not confined to the
common seamen but made their way
into the midshipmens berth and even
into the cabin and among the mid-
shipmen there was none so completely
saturated with the superstitions of the
sea asmy friend john anson

  so intense was his absurd devotion
to walliss luck that but for obvious
sentimental reasons i would have
given way to his oft-repeated entrea-
ties to be allowed to buy it of me i

could give you a hundred instances of
ansons extraordinary superstition
but i will mention only two and those
because they are relevant to our pres-
ent inquiry

  it was in the year  when we
were homeward bound and had just
sighted the lizard the ship was
bound in the first place for havre but
we had a passenger for penzance who
was anxious to be put ashore without
delay as the lizard was actually in
sight and the weather was fair the
captain put over a quarter boat of
which i being then third mate was
directed to take charge and convey the
passenger to penzance for which pur-
pose i was provided with a crew of
two seamen and one midshipman
john anson besides the passenger

   we put off and hoisted the sail
and for an hour made fair progress
while the ship set a course to the
southeast and soon disappeared

   the land was still some miles dis-
tant and only just visible from the boat
when it suddenly fell dead calm and
then a dense bank of fog came creeping
down from the north and soon hid
not only the land but the sea and even
the sky

   our position was one of great
danger on the strong current we
might easily drift right out to sea and
since we had neglected to bring a boat
compass and consequently had no
means of judging direction it would
be worse than useless to ply the oars
we were all very much alarmed a
few more hours of fog might see us
right out in the atlantic and as good
as lost 

   but here ansons superstition came
to our assistance in the midst of
our despair he suddenly brightened
up exclaiming cheerfully  itll be
all right mates we cant come to
any harm weve got tom walliss
 luck  aboard

   it was an opportune reminder for
though i scouted the idea of luck i
remembered the little compass in the
locket it was only the merest toy


all-story cavalier weekly

but still it would show us which was
north within a point or two and that
was all we wanted to know i got
the compass out and to make a long
story short it enabled us to steer the
boat toward the land and to bring her
at last safely into penzance

   the second instance occurred three
years later when the war broke out
between prance and germany anson
and i joined the german transport
service as volunteers but we werent
long with the army for less than a
month after saarbritck our little force
met a french division and had to re-
treat leaving a number of men and
guns in the hands of the enemy both
of us were among the prisoners and
john was one of the wounded for
just as the retreat began a french
bullet struck him in the right hip we
were both taken to paris with the rest
of the prisoners and there in the hos-
pital i was allowed to visit him

   his wound was a severe one the
bullet had entered deeply and lodged
behind the bone of the hip so that
the repeated efforts of the surgeons
to extract it not only failed but caused
great pain and made the wound worse
from day to day poor anson grew
thinner and more yellow and we could
see plainly that if no change occurred
the end must come quite soon so
the doctors said and so anson himself
felt

   then it was that his superstitious
mind turned once more to walliss
luck and at his earnest request and
with the permission of the surgeons
i attached the little locket to the out-
side of the dressing this foolish
proceeding seemed to give poor anson
great comfort and he went to sleep
that night full of confidence that
walliss luck would draw out the
offending bullet

   and did it   asked marchmont as
mr wallis paused for a somewhat
necessary rest

   well no replied the latter with
an indulgent smile  but all the same
anson was convinced that the locket

saved his life for oddly enough on the
very next morning when the dressings
were changed a small shred of cloth
came out of the wound it seems that
that and not the bullet was the cause
of the trouble for from that moment
the fever abated and the wound began
to heal in quite a short time it was
completely closed and has never given
him a moments trouble since

   now i need hardly say that if
anson believed in the virtues of the
locket before he was now absolutely
rabid on the subject and as the senti-
mental reasons at which i have hinted
no longer existed i made him a present
of the little bauble he accepted it
joyfully and by way of commemora-
ting the services it had rendered him
he caused an engraver to inscribe on
one face of it the representation of a
lizard with his initials and the date

	 and on the other  paris 
he also cut the head out of a portrait
of his mother and inserted it in the
locket but so fearful was he of dis-
turbing the luck that he left the other
portrait in its place underneath where
it no doubt remains to this day

   after this i lost sight of anson
for some years i learned that
wearying of the deep water traffic he
had qualified as a trinity house pilot
but apparently he did not practise his
profession very long for by the death
of an uncle he came into a very con-
siderable fortune and naturally re-
tired

   it was at this time that i met him
again i had then also retired from
the sea and held a post as secretary to
a childrens hospital and it was in
connection to this that our new rela-
tions began anson who was still a
bachelor and from his solitary habits
likely to remain one had conceived a
desire to found a home for the orphan
daughters of fishermen of all nation-
alities

   he proposed to start this insti-
tution on a small scale near boulogne
and proposed to me that i should help
him and undertake the management
a silent witness



i need not trouble you with details
we started the home and for a time
it was maintained entirely at ansons
expense

   but later it occurred to me to place
the home partially under the control
of a community of nursing sisters and
as soon as we did this we began to get
pecuniary help from other quarters

   this is all extremely interesting
said marchmont  but-excuse my
asking-has it any bearing on your
friends disappearance

   yes it has replied mr wallis-
 a very important bearing as you will
see and as mr marchmont bowed
and closed his eyes with a resigned air
he continued

   when the home was fairly started
anson took up his residence in the
building where he had a small set of
apartments taking his meals at the
refectory table with the orphans and
generally maintaining a position as the
father of our little community

   but not always from time to
time he has taken little holidays to
travel about and mix with the outer
world sometimes he would come to
england to visit his relatives and
sometimes he would spend a few weeks
in one of the great cities of the con-
tinent looking over the museums and
picture galleries he was greatly in-
terested in art and liked to frequent
the society of painters and sculptors
of whom he knew several and one in
particular-an english painter named
burton whose acquaintance he made
quite recently-he seemed very much
attached to for he stayed with him
at bruges for more than a month

   when he came back from bruges
he told me that he purposed going to
england to see his relatives and to
make certain arrangements with his
lawyers for securing a part of his
property to our institution i had
often urged him to do this but hith-
erto he had retained complete control
of his property and only paid the
the expenses of the home as they oc-
curred

   he was most generous but of
course this was a bad arrangement
because in the event of his death we
should have been left without the
support that he had promised it
seemed that while he was at bruges
he had discussed this matter with
mr burton and that the englishman
also advised him to make a permanent
provision for the home it seemed
that he had decided to divide his
property between our community and
a cousin of his who lives in england
a project of which i strongly ap-
proved after staying with us for a
month or two he left for england
with the purpose of making this ar-
rangement that was in the middle
of last september and i have not seen
him since

    did he complete the arrangements
that he had mentioned   thorndyke
asked

   no he did not he made certain
arrangements as to his property but
they were very different ones from
those he had proposed but we shall
come to that presently let me finish
my story

   a few days after anson left us
one of our orphans was taken very
seriously ill i wrote to anson who
was deeply attached to this child-a
french girl named julie chanot-tell-
ing him of this and as i did not know
where he was staying i sent the letter
to his cousins house at hampstead

   he replied on the th of sep-
tember that he should return imme-
diately he said that he was then
booking his luggage and paying his
hotel bill that he had to seevhis cousin
again but that he would try to come
by the night train or if he missed that
he would sleep at the station hotel and
start as early as possible on the fol-
lowing day the th

   that was the last i ever heard
from him he never came and has
never communicated with me since

  you have made inquiries of
course   said thorndyke

 yes when he did not come i


all-story cavalier weekly

wrote to his lawyer mr wyndhurst
whom i knew slightly but mr
wyndhurst was dead and my letter
was answered by mr marchmont
from him i learned that anson had
called on him on the morning of the
th and made certain arrangements
of which he perhaps will tell you mr
marchmont ascertained that on the
same day ansons luggage was taken
from the cloak-room in time to catch
the boat-train i have made inquiries
and find that he arrived at calais and
have succeeded in tracing him to paris
but there i have lost him where he
is now i am unable to discover

   and now before i finish my story
you had better hear what mr march-
mont has to tell he has been very
close with me but you are a lawyer
and perhaps know better how to deal
with lawyers

  thorndyke glanced inquiringly at
the solicitor who in his turn looked
dubiously at the end of his waning
cigar

   the fact is said he  i am in a
rather difficult position mr anson
has employed me as his solicitor and
i dont quite see my way to discussing
his private affairs without his author-
ity

   that is a perfectly correct atti-
tude said thorndyke  and yet i am
going to urge you to tell us what
passed at your interview with your
client i cant go into particulars at
present but i will ask you to take it
from me that there are sound reasons
why you should and i will undertake
to hold you immune from any blame
for having done so

  marchmont looked sharply and with
evidently awakened interest at thorn-
dyke

   i think i know what that means
he said  and i will take you at your
word having learned by experience
what your word is worth but before
describing the interview i had better
let you know how anson had pre-
viously disposed of his property

  about twelve years ago he got

wyndhurst to draft a will for him by
which a life interest in the entire
property was vested in his cousin a
miss augusta vyne with reversion
to her niece sylvia vyne the only
child of his cousin robert this will
was duly executed in our office

   after that our firm had until
quite recently no special business to
transact for mr anson beyond the
management of his investments the
whole of his property-which was all
personal-was in our hands to invest
and our relations with him were con-
fined to the transfer of sums of money
to his bank when we received instruct
tions from him to effect such transfer
he never called at the office and lat-i
terly there has been no one there whcj
knew him excepting wyndhurst him-
self and the clerk bell

   the next development occurred
last september on the th i re-
ceived a letter from him written at
miss vynes house at hampstead say-
ing that he had been discussing his
affairs with her and that he should
like to call on me and make some
slight alterations in the disposal of
the property i replied on the th
addressing my letter to him at miss
vynes house making an appointment
for eleven oclock on the morning of
the th he kept the appointment
punctually and we had a short inter-
view at which he explained the new
arrangements which he wished to
make

   he began by saying that he had
found it somewhat inconvenient liv-
ing as he did on the continent to
have his account at an english bank
he proposed therefore to transfer it
to a private bank at paris conducted
by a certain m desire or rather to
open an account there for he did not
suggest closing his account at his
english bank

   do you know anything about this
m desire asked thorndyke

   i did not but i have since ascer-
tained that he is a person of credit--
quite a substantial man in fact-and
a silent witness



that his business is chiefly that of pri-
vate banker and agent to the officers
of the army

   well mr anson went on to say
that he had become rather tired of the
monotonous life which he had been
leading and wished for a little free-
dom and change accordingly he in-
tended to travel for a time-which
was his reason for employing m de-
sire-and did not propose necessarily
to keep any one informed of his
whereabouts he was a rich man and
he had decided to get some advantage
from his wealth which really did not
seem to me at all an unreasonable
decision

   he added that he had no inten-
tion of withdrawing his support from
the orphanage he merely intended to
dissociate himself personally from it
and he suggested that any occasions
that might arise for pecuniary assist-
ance should be addressed to him under
cover of m desire

   finally he desired me to transfer
one thousand pounds in stock to his
new agent seven days from the date
of our interview and gave me an au-
thority in writing to that effect in
which he instructed me to accept m
desires receipt as a valid discharge
and you did so asked thorn-
dyke

   certainly i did and i hold m
desires receipt for the amount

    did you think it necessary to raise
the question of your clients identity
seeing that no one in the office knew
him personally  

  no i did not the question did
not arise there could not possibly
be any doubt on the subject he was
an old client of the firm and our cor-
respondence had been carried on un-
der cover of his cousin miss vyne
who had known him all his life you
remember that i wrote to him at miss
vynes address making the appoint-
ment for the interview

   and what happened next  

   the next development was a letter
from mr wallis asking if i could

give him mr ansons address of
course i could not but i wrote to m
desire asking him if he could give it
to me desire replied that he did not
at the moment know where mr an-
son was but would if desired take
charge of any communications and
forward them at the first opportunity
this statement may or may not have
been true but i dont think we shall
get any more information out of de-
sire he is ansons agent and will
act on his instructions if anson has
told him not to give any one his ad-
dress naturally he wont give it so
there the matter ends so far as i am
concerned

   did john anson make no sugges-
tion as to altering his will wallis
inquired

   none whatever nothing was
said about the will but mr march-
ment added after a cogitative pause
 we must remember that he has an-
other man of business now there is
no saying what he may have done
through m desire

  mr wallis nodded gloomily and
thorndyke addressing the solicitor
asked

   and that is all you have to tell
us

   yes and im not sure that it is
not a good deal more than i ought to
have told you it is mr walliss turn
now

  mr wallis acknowledged the invi-
tation to resume his narrative by a stiff
bow and then proceeded

   you can now see sir that what i
said is perfectly correct the conduct
of my friend anson shows a sudden
and unaccountable change it is quite
inconsistent with his habits and his
way of thinking and the change is
as i say so sudden one day he is
coming with the greatest haste to the
bedside of his sick protegee julie
chanot the next he is making ar-
rangements for a life of selfish pleas-
ure utterly indifferent as to whether
that protegee is alive or dead as a
matter of fact the poor child passed


all-story cavalier weekly

away to her reward the day after an-
son should have arrived without even
a message from his old friend but
now let me return to my story

   when anson failed to appear
and i could get no news of him i be-
came very anxious and as it hap-
pened that the business of our institu-
tion called me to england i determined
to inquire into the matter circum-
stances compelled me to travel by way
of boulogne and cross to folkestone

   i say  circumstances but i should
rather say that i was guided that way
by the hand of providence for in the
train that brought me from folke-
stone to london i had a most aston-
ishing experience in the carriage
alone with me there traveled a young
man-a tall powerful fellow not nat-
urally ill-looking but disfigured with
the most unmistakable traces of vice
and debauchery and he was ob-
viously suffering even then from the
effects of quite recent excesses

   his excellent clothing was disor-
dered and crumpled and stained with
mud as if in his orgies he had actual-
ly rolled in the gutter and i noticed
that he was wearing a brand-new col-
lar evidently fresh from the shop

   he seemed in fact to have been
tinting the village pink said lewis
with a gratified smile and a leer in my
direction

  pink exclaimed wallis ver-
milion my dear sir with green stripes
no ordinary debauch would have got
his clothes in such a state and if
further evidence were needed soon
after we had started lie began to turn
out his pockets as if to see whether
he had lost anything during his
drunken bout and then it was that
i saw a most astonishing thing
among the objects that this man took
from his pockets and laid on the seat
was the very locket or compass that
i had given so many years ago to john
anson

   i could not mistake it once it
had been mine and  had been accus-
tomed to see it almost daily since

moreover this fellow actually allowed
me to examine it so that i was able
to identify it detail by detail

   when i asked him where he had
obtained it he told me that he had
picked it up at hampstead but his
answers were very evasive and i did
not believe him

   nevertheless said mr march-
mont  there was nothing improbable
in his statement mr anson had been
at hampstead and might have dropped
it

   possibly but he would have
taken measures to recover it he
would not have left england until he
had found it he was a rich man
and he would have offered a large re-
ward for this his most prized posses-
sion

   you say said thorndyke  that
he habitually carried this locket on his
person can you tell us how he car-
ried or wore it  

   he wore it replied mr wallis
 attached to a ring on his watch-
guard and attached in a very charac-
teristic way namely by means of a
silk eye - glass cord which was made
fast to the ring of the locket with a
fishermans bend and to the ring of
the watch - guard with two clove-
hitches connected by a reef-knot

   and while i am on this subject i
may as well mention another orna-
ment that he wore though it was not
exposed to view this was a small
enameled gold beetle or scarab given
him i think by his aunt which he
wore suspended from his neck next tq
his skin

   but now to return to this young
man when i had heard his explana-
tion and decided that he was telling
me lies i made a simple pretext to
discover his name and place of abode
quite readily he gave me his card
which i have here and which you
will see is stained with mud owing
no doubt to those wallowings in the
mire of which i have spoken

  he drew the card from his pocket-
book and handed it to thorndyke who
a silent witness



read it gravely and pushing it across
the table to me said without moving
a muscle of his face

   you had better copy it into your
notes mr howard so that we may
have the record complete

  i accordingly copied out my own
name and address with due solemnity
and a growing enjoyment of the situa-
tion and then returned the card to
mr wallis who pocketed it carefully
and resumed

   having the name and address of
this young man i telegraphed imme-
diately to a private-detective bureau
in paris asking to have sent to me if
possible a certain m foucault who
makes a specialty of following and
watching suspected persons this
foucault is a man of extraordinary
talent his power of disguising him-
self is beyond belief and his patience
is inexhaustible

   fortunately he was disengaged
and came to me without delay and
when i had given him the name and
address of this young man jardine
and described him from my recollec-
tion of him he set a watch on the
house and found that the man was
really living there as he had said and
that he made a daily journey to the
hospital of st margarets where he
seemed to have some business as he
usually stayed there until evening
st margarets exclaimed mr
marchmont  why that is your
hospital thorndyke do you happen
to know this man jardine

   there is or was a student of
that name who qualified some little
time ago and who is probably the man
mr wallis is referring to a tall
man-quite as tall i should say as
my friend here mr howard

   i should say said mr wallis
 that the man jardine is taller-de-
cidedly taller i watched him as i
walked behind him up the platform at
charing cross and m foucault has
shown him to me since but that does
not matter have you seen the man
jardine lately at the hospital

   not very lately thorndyke re-
plied  i saw him there nearly a
fortnight ago but that i think was
the last time

  ah exclaimed wallis ex-
actly but i had better continue my
story for some time m foucault
kept a close watch on his man but dis-
covered nothing fresh he went to
the hospital daily he came home and
he stayed indoors the whole evening
but at last there came a new dis-
covery

   one morning m foucault saw the
man jardine come out of his house
dressed more carefully than usual
from his house foucault followed
him to a picture-gallery in leicester
square and went in after him and
there he saw him meet a female evi-
dently by a previous assignation
and mr wallis continued slapping
the table to emphasize the climax of
his story  from-the-neck-of-
that-female-was-hanging - john
ansons-scarab 

  having made this thrilling commu-
nication our client leaned back to
watch its effect on his audience

  i am afraid he must have been a
little disappointed for thorndyke was
habitually impassive in his exterior
and as for jervis and me we were
fully occupied in maintaining a decent
and befitting gravity

  but marchmont-the only person
present who was not already ac-
quainted with the incident-saved the
situation by exclaiming

  very remarkable very remark-
able indeed

   it is more than remarkable said
wallis  it is very highly suspicious
the locket might as you suggest have
dropped from its fastening and been
picked up but to suppose that the
scarab could have broken away and
dropped at the same moment and been
picked up by the same person is be-
yond all reason yet here are these
two objects in the possession of one
individual i dont know what you
infer from this to me one inference


all-story cavalier weekly

only seems possible that john anson
has been robbed if not murdered and
by this man jardine

   but let me finish my story there
is not much more to tell

   it seems that the man jardine
suspected foucault of watching him
for presently he left the gallery in
company with the female and after
being followed for some distance he
managed to escape

   as soon as foucault found that
he had lost him he went to jardines
house and waited about the neighbor-
hood and an hour or two later he
had the good fortune to see him com-
ing from hampstead toward high-
gate in company with another female
he followed them until they entered
a narrow passage or lane that leads
up the hill and when they had gone
up this some distance he followed but
could not get near enough to hear
what they were saying

   and now he had a most strange
and terrible experience for some
time past he had felt a suspicion that
some person-some accomplice of
jardines perhaps-was following and
watching him and now he had proof
of it at the top of the lane jardine
stopped to talk to the female and
foucault crept on tiptoe toward him
and while he was doing so he heard
some one approaching stealthily up
the lane behind him

   suddenly jardine began to return
down the lane as it was not con-
venient for foucault to meet him
there he also turned and walked back
and then he heard a sound as if some
one were climbing the high wooden
fence that enclosed the lane

   then jardine began to run and
foucault was compelled also to run
but he would have been overtaken if
it had not happened that jardine fell
down

   now just as he heard jardine fall
he came to a broken place in the
fence and it occurred to him to creep
through the hole and hide while jar-
dine passed he accordingly began toi

do so but no sooner had he thrust his
head through the hole than some un-
seen ruffian dealt him a violent blow
which rendered him instantly insen-
sible when he recovered his senses
he found himself lying in a church-
yard which adjoins the lane but jar-
dine and the other ruffian were of
course nowhere to be seen

   and now i come to the last inci-
dent that i have to relate the as-
sault took place on a saturday on
the sunday m foucault was some-
what indisposed and unable to go out
but early on monday he resumed his
watch on jardines house it was
nearly noon when jardine came out
dressed as if for traveling and carry-
ing a valise

   he went first to a house near pic-
cadilly and from thence to the hos-
pital in a cab foucault followed in
another cab and saw him go into the
hospital and waited for him to come
out

   but he never came foucault
waited until midnight but he did not
come out he had vanished

   he had probably come out by a
back exit and gone home said
marchmont

   not so replied wallis  the
next day foucault watched jardines
house but he did not come there
then he made inquiries but jardine is
not there and the landlady does not
know where he is also the porter at
the hospital knows nothing and is not
at all polite the man jardine has
disappeared as if he had never been

   that really is rather queer said
marchmont  it is a pity that you
did not give me all these particulars at
first however that cant be helped
now is this all that you have to tell
us

   it is all unless there is anything
that you wish to ask me

   i think said thorndyke  that
it would be well for us to have a de-i
scription of mr anson and as we
have to trace him if possible a photo-
graph would be exceedingly useful
a silent witness



    i have not a photograph with me
 said mr wallis  but i will obtain one
 and send it to you meanwhile i will
 tell you what my friend anson is like
 he is sixty-two years of age spare
 upright rather tall - his height is
 roughly five feet nine his hair is
 nearly white he is clean shaven with
  the exception of a small fringe of
 whitish beard under his chin he has
 gray eyes a straight nose not very
 prominent and remarkably good teeth
 for his age which he shows somewhat
 when he talks

     i think he is a little vain about his
 teeth and he well may be for there
 are not many men of sixty-two who
 have not a single false tooth nor even
 one that has been stopped by the den-
 tist as to his clothes he continues to
 wear the dress which was customary
 among the trinity house pilots be-
 fore the present uniform was intro-
 duced namely a frock coat tall hat
 white waistcoat and a shawl over it
 when out of doors he also wears
 gloves habitually even when in-
 doors

    is there any reason for his wear-
 ing gloves   thorndyke asked

   not now the habit began when
 he had some affection of the skin
 which made it necessary for him to
 keep his hands covered with gloves
 which contained some ointment or
 dressing and afterward for a time to
 conceal the disagreeable appearance of
 the skin the habit having been once
 formed he continued it saying that
 his hands were more comfortable cov-
 ered up than when exposed to the air
  was he dressed in this fashion
 when he called at your office march-
 mont   asked thorndyke

    yes even to the shawl and the
 gloves i noticed with some surprise
 that he did not take the latter off even
 when he wrote and signed the note of
 which i told you

    was he then wearing the locket as
 mr wallis has described on the front
 of his waistcoat

    he may have been but i didnt

 notice it as i fancy i should have done
 if it had been there

   and you have nothing more to
tell us mr wallis as to your friends
personal appearance  

   no i will send you the photo-
graph and write to you if i think of
anything that i have forgotten and
now perhaps you can tell me if you
think that you will be able to answer
those questions that mr marchmont
put to you

    i cannot of course answer them
now replied thorndyke  the
facts that you have given us will have
to be considered and compared and
certain inquiries will have to be made
are you staying long in england  

    i shall be here for at least a month
and i may as well leave you my
address although mr marchmont
has it

    in the course of a month thorn-
dyke said as he took the proffered
card  i think i may promise you that
we shall have settled definitely whether
your friend is alive or dead and if we
find that he is alive we shall no doubt
be able to ascertain his whereabouts
 that is very satisfactory said
mr wallis  i hope you will be able
to make good your promise

  with this he rose and having
shaken hands stiffly with thorndyke
bestowed on jervis and me a cere-
monious bow and moved toward the
door

  i thought that marchmont looked a
little wistful as if he would have liked
to stay and have a few words with us
alone indeed he lingered for a mo-
ment or two after the door was open
but then apparently altering his mind
he wished us  good night  and fol-
lowed his client

chapter xvii
the palimpsest

jt was getting late when our friends
left us but nevertheless as soon as
they were gone we all drew our chairs


all-story cavalier weekly

up to the fire with the obvious inten-
tion of discussing the situation and
began with one accord to fill our
pipes

  jervis was the first to get his tobac-
co alight and having emitted a volu-
minous preliminary puff he proceeded
to open the debate

   that man jardine seems to be a
pretty desperate character just think
of his actually wallowing in the mire
-not merely rolling mind you but
wallowing-and of his repulsive habit
of consorting with females one after
the other too in rapid succession its
a shocking instance of depravity

   our friend said thorndyke
 reaches his conclusions by a rather
short route-in some cases at least
in others his methods seem a little in-
direct and roundabout

   yes agreed jervis hes a devil
at guessing but he didnt get much
food for the imagination out of the
man thorndyke why were you so
extraordinarily secretive with what
he told you and what you knew be-
fore you could surely have suggested
a line of inquiry why didnt you

   principally because of the mans
personality i could not have an-
swered his questions i could only
have suggested one or two highly prob-
able solutions of the problem that he
offered and partial solutions at that
but i am not much addicted to giving
partial solutions to handing over the
raw material of a promising inquiry
certainly not to a man like this who
seems incapable of a straightforward
action

   the worthy and pious wallis-
said jervis  does certainly seem to
be a rather unnecessarily downy bird
and he doesnt seem to have got much
by his excessive artfulness after all

  no agreed thorndyke noth-
ing whatever quite the contrary in
fact look at his ridiculous conduct
in respect of  the man jardine i
dont complain of his having taken the
precaution to obtain that malefactors
address but when he had got it if he

had not been so tortuous so eager to
be cunning if in short he had be-
haved dike an ordinary sensible man
he would have got at once all the in-
formation that jardine had to give

   he could have called on jardine
written to him employed a lawyer or
applied to the police either of these
simple and obvious plans would have
been successful instead of which he
must needs go to the trouble and ex-
pense of engaging this absurd spy

   who found a mares nest and got
his head thumped remarked jervis

   then continued thorndyke
 look at his behavior to marchmont
evidently he put the case into march-
monts hands but equally evident
he withheld material facts and secret-
ly tinkered at the case himself no
jervis i give no information to mr
wallis until i have this case complete
to the last rivet

   but all the same i am greatly
obliged to him and especially to
marchmont for bringing him here he
has given us a connected story to col-
late with our rather loose collection of
facts and what is perhaps more im-
portant he has put our investigation
on a business footing that is a great
advantage if i should want to invoke
the aid of the powers that be i can do
so now with a definite locus standi as
the legal representative of interested
parties

   i cant imagine said i  in what
direction you are going to push your
inquiries mr wallis has given us as
you say a connected story but it is a
very unexpected one to me at least
and does not fall into line at all with
what we know that is if you are as-
suming as i have been that the man
whom i saw lying in millfield lane
was john anson

   it is difficult replied thorndyke
 to avoid that assumption though we
must be on our guard against coinci-
dences but the man whom you saw
agreed with the description that has
been given to us we know that anson
was in the neighborhood on that day
a silent witness



and you found the locket on the follow-
ing morning in the immediate vicinity
we seem to be committed to the
hypothesis that the man was anson un-
less we can prove that he was some one
else or that anson was in some other
place at the time which at present we
cannot

   then said i  in that case the
policeman must have been right after
all the man couldnt have been dead
seeing that he called on marchmont
the following day and was afterward
traced to paris but i must say that
he looked as dead as queen anne it
just shows how careful one ought to
be in giving opinions

   some authority has said re-
marked jervis  that the only conclu-
sive proof of death is decomposition
i believe it was old taylor who said
so and i am inclined to think that he
wasnt far wrong

   but said thorndyke  assuming
that the man whom you saw was an-
son and that he was not dead how do
you explain the other circumstances
was he insensible from the effects of
injury or drugs or was he deliberate-
ly shamming insensibility was it he
who passed over the fence and if so
did he climb over unassisted or was
he helped over

   and what answers do you suggest
to the questions that marchmont pro-
pounded you answer his first ques-
tion  is anson alive   in the affirma-
tive what about the others 

   as to where he is i replied  i
can only say the lord knows prob-
ably skulking somewhere on the con-
tinent as to his state of mind the
facts seem to suggest that in vulgar
parlance he has gone off his onion he
must be as mad as a hatter to have be-
haved in the way that he has for
even assuming that he wanted to get
clear of wallis and the orphanage with-
out explicitly saying so he adopted a
fools plan there is no sense in mas-
querading as a corpse one day and
turning up smiling at your lawyers
office the next if he meant to be dead

    	a-s c

he should have stuck to it and re-
mained dead

   the objection to that said jervis
 is that marchmont would have pro-
ceeded to get permission to presume
death and administer the will

   i see then i can only suppose
that he had got infected by wallis and
resolved to be artful at all costs and
hang the consequences

   then said thorndyke  i under-
stand your view to be that anson is at
present hiding somewhere on the con-
tinent and that his mind is more or less
affected  

   yes though as to his being unfit
to control his own affairs i am not so
clear i fancy there was more evi-
dence in that direction when he was
forking out the bulk of his income to
maintain a sort of international reposi-
tory for female orphans but the truth
is i havent any opinions on the case
at all i am in a complete fog about
the whole affair

   and no wonder said jervis
 one set of facts seems to suggest
most strongly that anson must certain-
ly be dead another set of facts seems
to prove beyond doubt that he was alive
-at least after that affair in millfield
lane he may be perpetrating an ele-
phantine practical joke on wallis and
the orphans but that doesnt seem to
be particularly probable the whole
case is a tangle of contradictions which
one might regard as beyond unravel-
ment if it were not for a single clear
and intelligible fact

   what is that  i asked

  that my revered senior has under-t
taken to furiiish a solution in the course
of a month from which i gather that
my revered senior has something up
his sleeve

   there is nothing up my sleeve
said thorndyke  that might not
equally well be up yours i have made
no separate investigations the actual
data which i possess were acquired in
the presence of one or both of you
and are now the common property of
us all i am referring of course to


all-story cavalier weekly

the original data not to fresh matter
obtained by inference from or further
examination of those data

  jervis smiled sardonically

   it is the old story said he  the
magician offers you his hat to inspect

 you observe ladies and gentlemen
that there is no deception you may
look inside it and examine the lining
and you can also inspect the top of my
head i now put on my hat i now
take it off again and you notice that
there is a guinea-pig sitting in it
there was no deception ladies and
gentlemen you had all the data 
thorndyke laughed and shook his
head

   thats all nonsense jervis he
said  it is a false analogy i have
done nothing to divert your attention
the guinea-pig has been staring you in
the face all the time

   very rude of him murmured
jervis

   i have even drawn your attention
to him once or twice but seriously
i dont think that this case is so very
obscure  though mind you it is a mere
hypothesis so far as i am concerned
and may break down completely when
i come to apply the tests that i have in
view but what i mean is that the
facts known to us suggested a very
obvious hypothesis and that the sug-
gestion was offered equally to us all
the verification may fail but that is
another matter

   are you going to work at the case
immediately i asked

   no thorndyke replied  jervis
and i have to attend at the maidstone
assizes for the next few days we
are retained on a case which involves
some very important issues in relation
to life assurance and that will take up
most of our time so this other affair
will have to wait

   and meanwhile said jervis
 you will stay at home like a good boy
and mind the shop and i suppose we
shall have to find you something to do
to keep you out of mischief what
do you say to making a long-hand

transcript of friend walliss state-
ment  

   yes you had better do that said
thorndyke  and attach it to the orig-
inal short-hand copy and now we
must really turn in or we shall never
be ready for our start in the morning

  the transcription of mr walliss
statement gave me abundant occupa-
tion for the whole of the following
morning but when that was finished
i was without any definite employment
and though i was not in the least dull-
for i was accustomed to a solitary life
-i suppose i was in that state of sus-
ceptibility to mischief that is pro-
verbially associated with unemploy-
ment

  and in these untoward circum-
stances i was suddenly exposed to a
great temptation and after some
feeble efforts at resistance succumbed
ignominiously

  i shall offer no excuses for my con-
duct nor seek in any way to mitigate
the judgment that all discreet persons
will pass upon my folly i make no
claims to discretion or to the caution
and foresight of a man like thorn-
dyke

  at this time i was an impulsive and
rather heedless young man and my
actions were pretty much those which
might have been expected from a per-
son of such temperament

  the voice of the tempter issued in
the first place from our letter-box and
assumed the sound of the falling of
letters thereinto i hastened to extract
the catch and sorting out the en-
velopes selected one the superscription
of which was in sylvias now familiar
handwriting

  it was actually addressed to dr
thorndyke but a privafe mark on
which we had agreed exposed that
naively pious fraud and gave me the
right to open it which i did and
seated myself in the armchair to enjoy
its perusal at my ease

  it was a delightful letter bright
gossipy and full of frank and intimate
friendliness as i read it the trim
a silent witness



graceful figure and pretty face of the
writer rose before me and made me
wonder a little discontentedly how long
it would be before i should look on her
and hear her voice again

  it was now getting into the third
week since i had last seen her and as
the time passed i was feeling more and
more how great a blank in my life the
separation from her had caused

  our friendship had grown up in a
quiet and unsensational fashion and i
suppose i had not realized all that it
meant but i was realizing it now as
i conned over her letter with its little
personal notes and familiar turns of
expression i began to be consumed
with a desire to see her to hear her
speak to tell her that she was not as
other women to me and to claim a like
special place in her thoughts

  it was toward the end of the letter
that the tempter spoke out in clear and
unmistakable language and these were
the words that he used through the
medium of the innocent and uncon-
scious sylvia

  you remember those sketches that you
stole for me- pinched i think was your
own expression well i have cleaned off
the daubs of paint with which they had
been disfigured and put them in rough
frames in my studio

  all but one and i began on that yester-
day with a scraper and a rag dipped in
chloroform but i took off not only the
defacing marks but part of the surface as
well and then i got such a surprise i
shant tell you what the surprise was be-
cause youll see when you come out of the
house of bondage

  i am going to work on it again to-mor-
row and perhaps i shall get the transfor-
mation finished how i wish you could
come and see it done it takes away more
than half the joy of exploration not to be
able to share the discovery with you in
fact i have a good mind to leave it un-
finished so that we can complete the trans-
formation together

  now i need not say that as to the
precious sketches i cared not a fig what
was under the top coat of paint what
i did care for was that this dear maid
was missing me as i missed her was
wanting my sympathy with her little

interests and pleasures and was tell-
ing me half unconsciously perhaps
that my absence had created a blank
in her life as her absence had in mine

  and forthwith i began to ask my-
self whether there was really any good
reason why i should not just for this
once break out of my prison and
snatch a few brief hours of sunshine

  the spy had been exploded he was
not likely to pick up my tracks after
all this time and now that my appear-
ance was so altered and i did not care
much if he did seeing that he had
been shown to be perfectly harmless

  the only circumstances that tended
to restrain me from this folly was the
one that mitigated its rashness - the
change in my appearance and even
that now that i was used to it and
knew that my aspect was neither gro-
tesque nor ridiculous had little weight
for sylvia would be prepared for the
change and we could enjoy the joke
together

  i was aware even at the time that
i was not being quite candid with
myself for if i had been i should ob-
viously have consulted thorndyke

  instead of which i answered the let-i
ter by return announcing my inten-
tion of coming to tea on the following
day and having sent polton out to
post it spent the remainder of the
afternoon in gleeful anticipation of my
little holiday tempered by some nerv-
ousness as to what thorndyke would
have to say on the matter and as to
what  my pretty friend as mrs sam-
way had very appropriately called her
would think of my having begun my
letter with the words  my dear
sylvia

  nothing happened to interfere with
my nefarious plans

  on the following morning thorn-
dyke and jervis went off after an early
breakfast leaving me in possession of
the premises and master of my actions

  i elected to anticipate the usual
luncheon time by half an hour and
when this meal was disposed of i
crept to my room and thoroughly


all-story cavalier weekly

cleansed my hair of the grease which
polton still persisted in applying to it
for since my hat would conceal it
while i was out of doors the added
disfigurement was unnecessary

  i was even tempted to tamper slight-
ly with my eyebrows but this impulse
i nobly resisted and having dried my
hair and combed it in its normal fash-
ion i descended on tiptoe to the sit-
ting-room and wrote a short explana-
tory note to polton which i left
conspicuously on the table

  then i switched the door-bell on to
the laboratory and letting myself out
like a retreating burglar closed the
door silently and sneaked away down
the dark staircase

  once fairly outside i went off like a
lamplighter and shooting out through
the tudor street gate made my way
eastward to broad street station
where i was fortunate enough to catch
a train that was just on the point of
starting

  at hampstead heath station i got
out and snuffing the air joyfully set
forth at my best pace up the slope that
leads to the summit in little over
twenty minutes i found myself at the
gate of  the hawthorns

  there was no need to knock or ring
my approach had been observed from
the window and as i strode up the
garden path the door opened and syl-
via ran out to meet me

   it was nice of you to come  she
exclaimed as i took her hand and held
it in mine  i dont believe youi ought
to have ventured out but i am most
delighted all the same dont make a
noise mopsy is having a little doze in
the drawing-room come into the
morning-room and let me have a good
look at you

  i followed her meekly into the front
room where in the large bay window
she inspected me critically her cheeks
dimpling with a mischievous smile

   theres something radically
wrong about your eyebrows she said
 but really you are not in the least
the fright that you made out as to

the beard and mustache i am not sure
that i dont rather like them

   i hope you dont i replied  be-
cause off they come at the first oppor-
tunity-unless of course you forbid
it

   does my opinion of your appear-
ance matter so much then  

   it matters entirely i dont care
what i look like to any one else

   oh what a fib  exclaimed
sylvia  dont i remember how very
neatly turned out you always were
when you used to pass me in the lane
before we knew one another 

   exactly i retorted we didnt
know one another then that makes
all the difference in the world-to me
at any rate

    does it   she said coloring a lit-
tle and looking at me thoughtfully
 its very-very flattering of you to
say so dr jardine

   i  hope you dont mean that as a
snub i said rather uneasy at the
form of her reply and thinking of my
letter

  a snub  she exclaimed  no i
certainly dont what did i say

   you called me dr jardine i ad-
dressed you in my letter as  sylvia -

	my dear sylvia

   and what ought i to have said  
she asked blushing warmly and cast-
ing down her eyes

  well sylvia if you liked me as
well as i like you i dont see why you
shouldnt call me humphrey we are
quite old friends now

   so we are she agreed  and
perhaps it would be less formal so
humphrey it shall be in future since
that is your royal command but tell
me how did you prevail on dr thorn-
dyke to let you come here is there
any change in the situation  

   theres a change in my situation
and a mighty agreeable change too
im here

   now dont be silly how did you
persuade dr thorndyke to let you
come  

   ha - that my dear sylvia is a
a silent witness



rather embarrassing question shall
we change the subject 

   no we wont

  she looked at me suspiciously for a
moment and then exclaimed in low
tragical tones

  humphrey you dont mean to
tell me that you came away without
his knowledge  

   im afraid that is what it amounts
to i saw a loophole and i popped
through it and here i am as i re-
marked before

   but how dreadful of you per-
fectly shocking and whatever will
he say to you when you go back  

   that is a question that i am not
proposing to present vividly to my
consciousness until i arrive on the
doorstep ive broken out of chokee
and im going to have a good time-
to go on having a good time i should
say

   then you consider that you are
having a good time now 

   i dont consider i am sure of it
am i not at this very moment looking
at you  and what more could a man
desire  

  she tried to look severe though the
attempt was not strikingly successful
and retorted in an admonishing tone
 you neednt try to wheedle me
with compliments you are a very
wicked person and most indiscreet but
it seems to me that some sort of change
has come over you since you retired
from the world am i not right
 youre perfectly right ive im-
proved thats what it is matured
and mellowed you know like a bottle
of claret that has been left in a cellar
and forgotten say you think ive im-
proved sylvia

   i wont she replied and then
changing her mind she added  yes
i will ill say that you are more in-
sinuating than ever if that will do
and now as you are clearly quite in-
corrigible i wont scold you any more
especially as you  broke out of cho-
kee  to come and see me you shall
tell me all about your adventures

  i didnt come here to talk about
myself sylvia i came to tell you
something-well about myself per-
haps but-er-not my adventures you
know or-or that sort of thing-but
i have been thinking a good deal since
i have been alone so much-about you
i mean sylvia-and-er- oh the
deuce 

  the latter exclamation was evoked
by the warning voice of the gong evi-
dently announcing tea and the subse-
quent appearance of the housemaid
she was certainly not such a goose as
she was supposed to be for she tapped
discreetly at the door and waited three
full seconds before entering and even
then she appeared demurely uncon-
scious of my existence

  if you please miss sylvia miss
vyne has woke up and ive taken in
the tea

  such was the paltry interruption
that arrested the flow of my eloquence
and scattered my flowers of rhetoric
to the winds

  i murmured inwardly  blow the
tea for the opportunity was gone
but i comforted myself with the re-
flection that it didnt matter very much
since sylvia and i seemed to have ar-
rived at a pretty clear understanding
which understanding was further
clarified by a momentary contact of
our hands as we followed the maid to
the drawing-room

  miss vyne on this occasion as on
the last was seated in the exact center
of the room and with the same monu-
mental effect so that my thoughts
were borne irresistibly to the ethno-
graphical section of the british mu-
seum and especially to that part of it
wherein the deities of polynesia look
out from their cases in perennial sur-
prise at the degenerate european
visitors

  if she had been asleep previously
she was wide enough awake now but
the glittering eyes were not directed
at me from the moment of our en-
tering the room they focused them-
selves on sylvias face and there re

mained riveted whereby the heighten-
ing of that young ladys complexion
which our interview had produced be-
came markedly accentuated

  it was to no purpose that i placed
myself before the rigid figure and of-
fered my hand a paw was lifted
automatically to mine but the eyes
remained fixed on sylvia

   what did you say this gentlemans
name was   the waxwork asked
frigidly

   this is dr jardine was the
reply

   oh indeed and who was the
gentleman who called some three
weeks ago

  why that was dr jardine you
know it was

   so i thought but my memory is
not very reliable and this is a dr
jardine too very interesting a
medical family apparently but not
much alike

  i was beginning to explain my iden-
tity and the cause of my altered ap-
pearance when sylvia approached
with a cup of tea and a carefully dis-
sected muffin which latter she thrust
under the nose of the elder lady who
regarded it attentively and with a
slight squint owing to its nearness

   its of no use you know said
sylvia  for you to pretend that you
dont know him because ive told you
all about the transformation-that is
all i know myself dont you think
its rather a clever make-up  

   if said miss vyne  by  make-
up  you mean a disguise i think it is
highly successful the beard is a
most admirable imitation

   oh the beard is his own-at
least i think it is

  i confirmed this statement ignoring
poltons slight additions

   indeed said miss vyne  then
the wig-it is a wig i suppose  

   no of course it isnt sylvia
replied

  then said miss vyne majestic-
ally  perhaps you will explain to me
what the disguise consists of

   well said sylvia  there are the
eyebrows you can see that they have
been completely altered in shape

   if i had committed the former
shape of the eyebrows to memory as
you appear to have done said miss
vyne  i should no doubt observe
the change but i did not it seems
to me that the disguise which you told
me about with such a flourish of
trumpets just amounts to this that
dr jardine has allowed his beard to
grow i find the reality quite disap-
pointing

  do you said sylvia but at
any rate you didnt recognize him
so your disappointment doesnt count
for much

  the old lady being thus hoist with
her own petard relapsed into majestic
silence and sylvia then renewed her
demand for an account of my adven-
tures

   we want to hear all about that
objectionable person who has been
shadowing you and how you finally
got rid of him your letters were
rather sketchy and wanting in detail
so you have got to make up the defi-
ciency now

  thus commanded i plunged into an
exhaustive account of those events
which i have already chronicled at
length and which i need not refer to
again nor need i record the cross-
examination to which i was subjected
since it elicited nothing that is not set
forth in the preceding pages

  when i had finished my recital
however miss vyne who had listened
to it in silence hitherto put a question
which i had some doubts about an-
swering

   have you or dr thorndyke been
able to discover who this inquisitive
person is and what is his object in
following you about  

  i hesitated as to my own experi-
ences i had no secrets from these
friends of mine excepting those that
related to the subjects of thorndykes
investigations but i must not come
here and babble about what took place
a silent witness



in the sacred precincts of my princi-
pals chambers

   i think i may tell you said i
 that dr thorndyke has discovered
the identity of this man and that he is
not the person whom we suspected
him to be but i mustnt say any
more as the information came through
professional channels and consequent-
ly is not mine to give

   of course you mustnt said
sylvia  though i dont mind admit-
ting that you have put me on tenter-
hooks of curiosity but i dare say
you will be able to tell us everything
later

  i agreed that i probably should
and the talk then turned into fresh
channels

  the short winter day was running
out apace the daylight had long
since gone and i began with infinite
reluctance to think of returning to my
cage indeed when i looked at my
watch i was horrified to see how the
time had fled

   my word  i exclaimed s i
must be off or thorndyke will be
putting the sleuth-hounds of the law
on my track and i dont know what
you will think of me for having
stayed such an unconscionable time

   it isnt a ceremonial visit said
sylvia as i rose and made my adieus
to her aunt  we should have liked
you to stay much longer

  here she paused suddenly and
clasping her hands gazed at me with
an expression of dismay

   good heavens humphrey 
she exclaimed

   eh  said miss vyne

   i was addressing dr jardine
sylvia explained in some confusion

   i didnt suppose you were address-
ing me was the withering reply

   do you know said sylvia
 that i havent shown you those
sketches after all you must see
them they were the special object
of your visit 

  this was perfectly untrue and she
knew it but i did not think it worth

while to contest the statement in miss
vynes presence

  accordingly i expressed the utmost
eagerness to see the trumpery sketches
and the more so since i had under-
stood that they were on view in the
studio which turned out to be the
case

   it wont take a minute for you to
see them said sylvia  ill just run
up and light the gas and you are not
to come in until i tell you

  she preceded me up the stairs to the
little room on the first floor in which
she worked and when i had waited a
few moments on the landing she sum-
moned me to enter

   these are the sketches said she
 that i have finished you see they
are quite presentable now i cleaned
off the rough daubs of paint with a
scraper and finished up with a soft
rag dipped in chloroform

  i ran my eye over the framed
sketches which now that the canvases
were strained on stretchers and the
disfiguring brush - strokes removed
were as she had said quite present-
able though too rough and unfinished
to be attractive

   i dare say they are very interest-
ing said i  but they are only bare
beginnings i shouldnt have thought
them worth framing

   not as pictures she agreed
 but as examples of a very curious
technique i find them most instructive
hpwever you havent seen the real
gem of the collection this is it on
the easel sit down on the chair and
say when you are ready im going
to give you a surprise

  i seated myself on the chair oppo-
site the easel on which was a canvas
with its back toward me

   now said sylvia  are you
ready one two three 

  she picked up the canvas and turn-
ing it round quickly presented its
face to me

  i dont know what i had expected
but certainly i was not in the least pre-
pared for what i saw




all-story cavalier weekly

  the sketch had originally repre-
sented very roughly a dark mass of
trees which occupied nearly the whole
of the canvas but of this the middle
had been cleaned away exposing an
under painting

  and this it was that filled me with
such amazement that after a first
startled exclamation i could do noth-
ing but stare open-mouthed at the
canvas

  for from the opening in the dark
mass of foliage there looked out at
me distinct and unmistakable the
face of mrs samway

  it was no illusion or chance resem-
blance rough as the painting was
the likeness was excellent

  all the well-known features which
made her so different from other
women were there though expressed
by a mere dexterous turn of the knife
the jet-black formally parted hair the
clear bright complexion the pale in-
scrutable eyes all were there even to
the steady penetrating expression that
looked out at me -from the canvas as
if in silent recognition

  as i sat staring at the picture with
a surprise that almost amounted to
awe sylvia looked at me a little
blankly

   well  she exclaimed at length
 i meant to give you a surprise but
-what is it humphrey do you
know her 

  yes i replied and so do you
dont you remember a woman who
looked in at you through the glass
door of robinsons shop  

   do you mean that black and scar-
let creature i didnt recognize her
i had no idea she was so handsome
for this is really a very beautiful face
though there is something about it that
i dont understand something-well
eery-rather uncanny and almost sin-
ister dont you think so 

   i have always thought her a
rather weird woman but this is the
weirdest appearance she had made
how on earth came her face on that
canvas  

   it is an odd coincidence and yet
i dont know that it is she may have
been some relative of that rather
eccentric artist or even his wife i
dont know why it shouldnt be so

  neither did i but the coincidence
remained a very striking one to me at
least much more so than sylvia real-
ized though what its significance
might be-if it had any-i could not
guess

  nor was there any opportunity to
discuss it at the moment for it was
high time for me to be gone

   you will send me a telegram when
you get back to say that you have ar-
rived home safely wont you said
sylvia as we descended the stairs with
our arms linked together  of course
nothing is going to happen to you but
i cant help feeling a little nervous
and youll go down to the station by
the high street and keep to the main
roads you will give that as a prom-
ise wont you  

  i made the promise readily having
decided previously to take every pos-
sible precaution when i had wished
sylvia  good-by  at some length i
proceeded to execute it making my
way down the well-populated high
street and keeping a bright lookout
both there and at the station

  once more i was fortunate in the
matter of trains and having taken a
hansom from broad street to the
temple was set down in kings
bench walk soon after half past six
as i approached our building i looked
up with some anxiety at the sitting-
room windows and when i saw them
brightly lighted a suspicion that thorn-
dyke had returned earlier than usual
filled me with foreboding

  i had had my dance and now i was
going to pay the piper and i did not
much enjoy the prospect in fact as i
ascended the stairs and took my latch-
key from my pocket i was as nervous
as a schoolboy who has been playing
truant

  however there was no escape unless
i sneaked up to my bedroom so in-
a silent witness



serting the key into the lock i turned
it as boldly as i could and entered

chapter xviii
a visitor from the states

as i pushed open the inner door and
entered the room i conceived the
momentary hope of a reprieve from
the wrath to come

  i found my twofriends in what was
evidently a business consultation with
a stranger and was on the point of
backing out when thorndyke stopped
me

   dont run away howard said
he  there are no secrets being dis-
closed-at least i think not we have
finished wtith your affairs mr odon-
nell havent we  

  yes doctor was the answer
 youve run me dry with the excep-
tion of your own little business

   then come in and sit down how-
ard and let me present you to mr
odonnell who is a famous american
detective and has been telling us all
sorts of wonderful things

  mr odonnell paused in the act of
returning a quantity of papers to a
large attache-case and offered his
hand

   the doctor he remarked  is
blowing his trumpet at the wrong end
i havent come here to give informa-
tion but to get advice but i guess i
neednt tell you that

    i hope that isnt quite true said
thorndyke  you spoke just now of
my little business havent you any-
thing to tell me  

   i have but i fancy it isnt what
you wanted to hear however well
just have a look at your letter to curtis
and take your questions one by one
by the way what made you write to
curtis 

   i saw when i inspected maddocks
will at somerset house that he had
left a small legacy to curtis nat-
urally i inferred that curtis knew him
and could tell me something of him

   it struck you as a bit queer i
guess that he should be leaving a
legacy to the head of an american
detective agency

   the circumstance suggested possi-
bilities thorndyke admitted
odonnell laughed

   i can guess what possibilities sug-
gested themselves to you if you knew
maddock your letter and the law-
yers announcing the legacy came
within a mail or two of one another
curtis showed them both to me and
we grinned we took it for granted
that the worthy testator was foxing
but we were wrong and so are you
if that is what you thought

   you assumed that the will was not
a genuine one 

   yes we thought it was a fake put
up with the aid of some shyster to
bluff us into giving up mr maddock
as deceased so as i had to come
across about these other affairs curtis
suggested that i should look into the
matter and a considerable surprise
i got when i did for the will is per-
fectly regular and so is everything else
that legacy was a sort of posthumous
joke i guess

   then do i understand that mr
curtis was not really a friend of mad-
docks

  odonnell chuckled

   not exactly a friend doctor said
he  he felt the warmest interest in
maddocks welfare but they werent
what you might call bosom friends
the position was this curtis was the
chief of our detective agency mad-
dock was a gentleman whom he had
been looking for and not finding for
a matter of ten years at last he
found him and then he lost him again
and this legacy i take it was a sort
of playful hint to show which hole
hed gone down

   was maddock in hiding all that
time   asked thorndyke

   in hiding  repeated odonnell
 bless your innocent heart doctor he
had a nice convenient studio in one of
the best blocks in new york a couple


all-story cavalier weekly

of doors from our agency and he used
to send us cards for his private views
no sir our dear departed friend was
not the-kind that lurks out of sight in
cellars or garrets it was maddock
sure enough that curtis wanted only
he didnt know it but i guess im
fogging you id best answer the
questions that you put to curtis

   first do we know anything about
maddock yes we do but we didnt
know that his name was maddock un-
til a few months ago isaac van
damme was the name we knew him
by and it seems that he had one or
two other names that he used on oc-
casion

   we now know that the gay isaac
was a particularly versatile kind of
crook and a mighty uncommon kind
too the lord be praised for if there
were many more like him we should
have to raise our prices some he
wasnt the kind of fool that makes a
million-dollar coup and then goes on
the razzle and drops it all that sort
of man is easy enough to deal with
when hes loaded up with dollars
everybody knows it and hes sure to
be back in a week or two with empty
pockets ready for another scoop

   isaac wasnt that sort when he
made a little pile he invested his win-
nings like a sensible man and didnt
live beyond his means and the only
mystery to me is that when he died
he didnt leave more pickings i see
from his will-which ive had a look
at-that the whole estate couldnt have
been above five thousand dollars he
had a lot more than that at one time

   he may have disposed of the bulk
of his property by gift just before his
death jervis suggested

   thats possible agreed odon-
nell  hed escape the death dues that
way however to return to his en- 
gaging little ways his leading line
was penmanship-forgery--and he did
it to an absolute finish he was the
most expert penman that i have ever
known

   but where he had us all was that

he didnt only know how to write ati-
other mans name he knew zvhcn tc
write it i reckon that the great bulk
of his forgeries were never spotted at
all and of the remainder very few got
beyond the bare suspicion that they
were forgeries in the case of the few
that were actually spotted as forgeries
his tracks were covered up so cleverly
that no one could guess who the
forger was

   and how did you come to sus-s
pect him eventually   thorndyke
asked

  ah said odonnell  ther
you are every crook even the clevn
erest has a strain of the fool in him
isaacs folly took the form of suspi-i
cion he suspected us of suspecting
him we didnt but he thought we
did and then he started to dodge and
make some false clues for us

   that drew our attention to him
we looked into his record traced his
little wanderings and then we began
to find things out a nice collection
there was too by the time we had
worked a month or two at his biogn
raphy-forgeries false notes and at
least two murders that had been a
complete mystery to us all we made
ready to drop on isaac but at that
psychological moment he disappeared

   it looked as if he had left the
states and as we have no great afi
fection for extradition cases we let
the matter rest more or less expect-
ing that he would turn up again
sooner or later and then came this
lawyers letter and yours announcing
his decease of course curtis and i
thought he was at the old game that
it was a bit of that sort of extra cau-
tion that wont let well enough alone

   so as i was coming over i thought
id just look into the affair as i told
you and to my astonishment i found
everything perfectly regular the will
properly proved the death certificate
made out correctly and a second cer-
tificate signed by two doctors

   did you go into the question gl
identity asked thorndyke
a silent witness



   oh yes i called on one of -the
doctors a man named batson and
ascertained that it was all correct
batsons eyesight seemed to be none
of the best but he made it quite clear
to me that his late patient was cer-
tainly our friend isaac or maddock

   so thats the end of the case and
if you want to go into it any further
youve got to deal with a little pile of
bone-ash for our friend is not only
dead-hes cremated thats enough
for us we dont follow our clients
to the next world we are not so
thorough as you seem to be

  you are flattering me unduly
said thorndyke  im not so thor-
ough as that but our clients when
they betake themselves to the happy
hunting-ground usually leave a few of
their friends behind to continue their
activities do you happen to know
what maddocks original occupation
was  had he any profession  

  he was originally an engraver
and a very skilful engraver too i un-
derstand that was what made him
so handy in working the flash-note
racket then he went on the stage for
a time and didnt do badly at that
but i fancy he was more clever at
making-up and mimicry than at act-
ing in the dramatic sense

   for the last ten years or so he
was practising as a painter - chiefly
of landscape though he could do a
figure subject or a portrait at a pinch
i dont fancy he sold much or made
any great efforts to sell his work he
liked painting and the art covered his
real industries for he used to tour
about in search of subjects and so
open up fresh ground for the little
operations that actually produced his
income

   was his work of any considerable
merit   thorndyke asked

   well in a way yes it was rather
in the american taste though mad-
dock was really an englishman our
taste as you know runs to technical
smartness and novelty of handling
and maddocks work was very pecul-

iar and remarkably smart and slick in
handling he used the knife more
than the brush and he used it uncom-
monly cleverly in fact he was un-
usually skilful in many ways and
thats the really surprising thing about
him when one considers his extraor-
dinary-looking paws

   what was there peculiar about
his hands  asked thorndyke were
they noticeably clumsy in appear-
ance  

  clumsy exclaimed odonnell
 they were more than that they
were positively deformed a mon-
keys hands would be delicate com-
pared with maddocks they were
short and thick like the paws of an
animal theres some jaw-twisting
name for the deformity that he suf-
fered from - bronchodactilious or
something like that

   brachydactylous suggested dr
thorndyke

   thats the word and i dare say
you know the sort of paw i mean it
didnt look a very likely hand for a
first-class penman and engraver of
flash notes but you cant always judge
by appearances

   and now as to your other ques-
tions you ask what maddock was
like in appearance i can only give
you the description which i gave to
batson and which he recognized at
once

   had he noticed the peculiarity of
the hands   inquired thorndyke

   yes i asked him about it and
he remembered having observed it
when he was attending maddock
well then our friend was about five
feet nine in height fairly broad and
decidedly strong about fifty-five years
of age of a medium complexion with
gray eyes and nearly white hair
thats all i can tell you about him

   you havent got his finger-prints
i suppose 

   no he was never in prison so
we had no chance of getting them

   was he married  

   he had been but some years aga


all-story cavalier weekly

his wife divorced him or he divorced
her latterly he has lived as a bach-
elor 

   there is nothing else that you can
think of as throwing light on his per-
sonality or explaining his actions  

   nothing at all doctor ive told
you all i know about him and i only
hope the information may be more
useful than it looks to me

  h thank you said thorndyke
 your information is not only use-
ful i expect to find it quite valuable
reasoning you know mr odon-
nell he continued  is somewhat like
building an arch on a supporting
mold the builder lays a number of
shaped stones or voussoirs but until
all the voussoirs are there it is a mere
collection of stone incapable of bear-
ing its own weight then you drop
the last voussoir-the keystone-into
its place and the arch is complete and
now you may take away the supports
for it will not only bear its own
weight but carry a heavy superstruc-
ture

   thats so doctor said odon-
nell  but if i may ask is this all
gratuitous wisdom or has it any par-
ticular bearing 

   it has this bearing replied thorn-
dyke   i have myself been for some
time past engaged metaphorically in
the building of an arch when you
came here to-night it was but a collec-
tion of shaped and adjusted stones
supported from without with your
kind aid i have just dropped the key-
stone into its place that is what i
mean

  the american thoughtfully ar-
ranged the papers in his case casting
an occasional speculative glance at
thorndyke

   id like to know he said present-
ly  what it was that i told you it
doesnt seem to me that i have pro-
duced any startling novelties how-
ever i know its no use trying to
squeeze you so ill get back to my
hotel and have a chew at what youve
told me

  he shook hands with us all round
and when thorndyke had let him out
we heard him bustling down-stairs
and away up kings bench walk to-
ward mitre court

  for a minute or more after his de-
parture none of us spoke thorn-
dyke was apparently ruminating on
his newly acquired information and
jervis and i on the statement that had
so naturally aroused the detectives
curiosity

  at length jervis opened the inevi-
table debate

   i bein to see a glimmer of day-
light through the case of septimus
maddock deceased said he  but it is
only a glimmer whereas from what
you said to odonnell i gather that
you have the case quite complete

   hardly that jervis was the re-
ply  i spoke metaphorically and
metaphors are sometimes misleading
perhaps i overstated the case so we
will drop metaphor and state the po-
sition literally in terms of good plain
school-book logic

   it is this we had certain facts
presented to us in connection with
maddocks death for instance we ob-
served that the cause of death was
obscure that the body was utterly
destroyed by cremation and that
jardine who was an unofficial witness
to some of the formalities was subse-
quently pursued by some unknown
person with the unmistakable purpose
of murdering him

   those were some of the observed
facts and the explanation of those
facts was the problem submitted to us

-	that is to say we had to connect
those facts and supply others by de-
duction and research so that they
should form a coherent and intelligi-
ble sequence of which the motive for
murdering jardine should form a part

   having observed and examined
our facts we next propose a hypoth-
esis which shall explain them in this
case it would naturally take the form
of a hypothetical reconstruction of the
circumstances of maddocks death
a silent witness



that hypothesis must of course be in
complete agreement with all the facts
known to us including the attempts to
murder jardine

   then having invented a hypoth-
esis which fits our facts completely
the next stage is to verify it if the
circumstances of maddocks death
were such as we have assumed cer-
tain antecedent events must have oc-
curred and certain conditions must
have existed

   we make the necessary inquiries
and investigations and we find that
those events had actually occurred and
those conditions had actually existed
then it is probable that our hypoth-
esis is correct particularly if our re-
searches have brought to light nothing
that disagrees with it

   with our new facts we can prob-
ably amplify our hypothesis - recon-
struct it in greater detail - and then
we have to test and verify it afresh
in its amplified and detailed form
and if such new tests still yield an
affirmative result the confirmation of
the hypothesis becomes overwhelming-
ly strong it is however still only
hypothesis but perhaps we light on
some final test which is capable of
yielding a definite answer yes or no

  if we apply that test - the  cru-
cial experiment  of the logicians -
and obtain an affirmative result our
inquiry is at an end it has passed out
of the region of hypothesis into that
of demonstrative proof

   and are we to understand asked
jervis  that you have brought mad-
docks case to the stage of complete
demonstration  

   no answered thorndyke  i
am still in the stage of hypothesis and
when odonnell came here to - night
there were two points which i had
been unable to verify but with his
aid i have been able to verify them
both and i now have a complete
hypothesis of the case which has been
tested exhaustively and answered every
test all that remains is to apply the
touchstone of the final experiment

   i suppose said jervis  you have
obtained a good many new facts in the
course of your investigations

   not a great many replied thorn-
dyke   and what new data i have
obtained i have for the most part
communicated to you and jardine i
assure you jervis that if you would
only concentrate your attention on the
case you have ample material for a
most convincing and complete elucida-
tion of it

  jervis looked at me with a wry
smile

   now jardine-howard said he
 why dont you brush up your wits
and tell us exactly what happened to
the late mr maddock and why some
person unknown is so keen on your
vile body you have all the facts
you know

   so you tell me i retorted  but
this case of yours reminds me of those
elaborate picture puzzles that used to
weary my juvenile brain you had
a hatful of irregular-shaped pieces
which if you fitted them together
made a picture only the beggars
wouldnt fit together

   a very apt comparison said
thorndyke  you put the pieces to-
gether and if they made no intelligi-
ble part of a picture you knew you
were wrong no matter how well they
seemed to fit on the other hand if
they seemed to make parts of a pic-
ture you had to verify the result by
finding pieces of the exact shape and
size of the empty spaces

   that is what i have been doing in
this case trying the data together and
watching to see if they made the ex-
pected picture as i have told you
odonnells visit found me with the
picture entire save for two empty
spaces of a particular shape and size
and from him i obtained two pieces
that dropped neatly into those spaces
and made the picture complete all
i have to do now is to see if the pic-
ture is a true representation or only a
consistent work of imagination

   i take it that you have worked the


all-story cavalier weekly

case out in pretty full detail said
jervis

   yes if the final verification is
successful i shall be able to tell you
exactly what happened in maddocks
house what was the cause of death-
and i may say that it was not that
given in the certificates-who the per-
son is who has been pursuing jardine
and what is his motive together with
a number of other very curious items

   and the mention of that person
reminds me that our friend has been
disporting himself in public contrary
to advice and to what i thought was
a definite understanding

   but surely i said  it doesnt
matter now we have given that spy
chappie the slip and even if he hasnt
given up the chase as hopeless we
know that he is quite harmless

   harmless  exclaimed thorn-
dyke  why my dear fellow he was
your guardian angel didnt you real-
ize that from mr walliss statement
he shadowed you so closely that no
attack on you was possible in fact he
actually caught a rap on the head that
was apparently meant for you you
were infinitely safer with him at your
heels than alone

   but weve given the other fellow
the slip too i urged

   we mustnt take that for grant-
ed said thorndyke  the french
detective you remember came on the
scene quite recently whereas the other
man has been with us from the begin-
ning he probably saw jervis and me
enter the mineral-water works on the
night of the fire for he was certainly
there and he may even have followed
us home to ascertain who we were

   there are several ways in which
he could have connected you with us
and traced you here so i must urge
you most strongly not to venture out
of the precincts of the temple for the
next few days in fact it would be
much wiser to keep indoors altogether
it will be only a matter of days unless
i get a quite unexpected setback for
 hope to have the case finally com-

pleted in less than a week and when
i do i shall take such action as will
give your friend some occupation
other than shadowing you

   very well i said  i will prom-
ise not to attempt again to escape
from custody but all the same my
little jaunt to-day has not been entire-
ly without result i have picked up
a new fact and a rather curious one
i think what should you say if i
suggested that mrs samway was the
wife of that eccentric artist who used
to paint on the heath the man i
mean who always worked in gloves  
 i have assumed that she was in
some such relation to him replied
thorndyke  but i should like to hear
the evidence

   mrs samway jervis said in a
reflective tone  isnt that the hand-
some uncanny-looking lady with the
mongoose eyes who reminded me of
lucrezia borgia 

   that is the lady well i met
with a portrait of her to-day which
was evidently the work of the man
with the gloves and here i gave
them a description of the portrait and
an account of the odd way in which
it had been disinterred from the land-
scape that had been painted over it
to which they listened with attention

   its a queer incident said thorn-
dyke  and quite dramatic if one
were inclined to be superstitious one
might imagine some invisible agency
uncovering the tracks that have been
so carefully hidden and working un-
seen in the interests of justice

   but havent you rather jumped to
your conclusion the existence of
the portrait establishes a connection
but not necessarily that of husband
and wife

   i only suggested the relationship
but it seemed a likely one as the por-
trait had been painted over and thrown
into the rubbish-box

  jervis laughed sardonically and
even thorndykes impassive face re-
laxed into a smile

   our young friend said the for-
a silent witness



mer  doesnt take as favorable a
view of the married state as one might
expect from a gay lothario who
breaks out of his cage to go philan-
dering but well overlook that in
consideration of the very interesting
information that he has brought back
with him not that it conveys very
much to me it is obviously a new
piece to fit into our puzzle but im
hanged if i see at the moment any
suitable space to drop it into

   i think said thorndyke  that
if you consider the picture as a whole
you will soon find a vacant space
and while you are considering it i
will just send off a letter and then we
had better adjourn this discussion
iwe have to catch the early train to
maidstone to-morrow and that i
hope will be the last time our case
ought to be disposed of by the after-
noon

  he seated himself at the writing-
table and wrote his letter while jervis
stared into the fire with a cogitative
frown when the letter was sealed
and addressed thorndyke laid it on
the table while he went to the lobby to
put on his hat and coat and glancing
at it alnlisist unconsciously i noted that
the envelope was of foolscap size and
was addressed to the home office
whitehall

  the name of the addressee escaped
me for suddenly realizing the impro-
priety of thus inspecting another mans
-letter i looked away hastily

  but even then when thorndyke
had taken it away to the post i found
myself speculating vaguely on the
nature of the communication and
wondering if it had any relation to
the mysterious and intricate case of
septimus maddock

chapter xix

into the darkness

the resigned composure with which
i accepted thomdykes sentence
of confinement within doors was not

entirely attributable to discretion or
native virtue for having enjoyed my
little dissipation i could now contem-
plate with fortitude a brief period of
retirement

  moreover the weather was in my
favor being-as polton reported when
he returned blue-nosed and powdered
with snow with a fresh supply of to-
bacco for me-bitterly cold with a
threatening of smoky fog from the
east

  under these circumstances it was
no great hardship to sit in a roomy
armchair with my slippered feet on the
fender and read and meditate as i
basked in the warmth of a glowing
fire

  to be sure my reading was per-
functory enough for the treatise of
 the surface markings of the hu-
man body admirable as it was com-
peted on very unfavorable terms with
other claimants to my attention

   in truth i had plenty to think about
even if i went no farther for matter
than to the events of the previous day
there was my visit to sylvia for in-
stance i had not said much to her
but what i had said had pledged me
to a lifelong companionship which
was a solemn thing to reflect upon
even though i looked forward to the
fulfilment of that pledge with nothing
but hopeful pleasure

  the dice were thrown of course
they would turn up sixes every one
but still-the dice were thrown

  from my own strictly personal
affairs my thoughts rambled by an
easy transition to the singular episode
of the buried portrait and thence to
the subject of that strange palimpsest

  viewed by the light of mr odon-
nells revelations mrs sam ways po-
sition was not all that could have been
desired she and her husband had
unquestionably been closely associated
with maddock but maddock was it
seemed a habitual criminal

   could this fact have been known to
the samways or was it that the
running forger and swindler had shel-


all-story cavalier weekly

tered himself behind their respecta-
bility 

  it was impossible for me to say

  then there was the strange and per-
plexing case of the man maddock
himself i could make nothing of
that had not indeed been aware that
there had been a  case  until thorn-
dykes investigations had put me in
possession of the fact

  and even now i could see nothing
on which to base any suspicion apart
from the attempts on my life which
we were assuming to be in some way
connected with events that had oc-
curred in maddocks house

  the cause of death was apparently
not  morbus cordis which might
easily enough be seeing that the diag-
nosis of heart disease was a mere
guess on batsons part but if not
morbus cordis what was it

  thorndyke apparently knew and
seemed to hint that it was something
other than ordinary disease

  could there have been foul play
and if so were the samways in-
volved in it in any way

  it seemed incredible for had not
maddock himself suspected that he
was in a dangerous state of health

  there was certainly one possibility
which i considered with a good deal
of distaste namely that maddock
had been in a hypochondriacal state
and that the samways had taken ad
vantage of his gloomy views as to his
health to administer poison the
thing was actually possible but i did
not entertain it for even if one as-i
sumed that poison had been adminis-
tered at any rata the cremation of the
body was not designed to hide the
traces of the crime

  the samways had nothing to do
with that the cremation had been
adopted in preference to burial by
maddocks own wish

  so my thoughts flitted from topic
to topic with occasional interludes of
 surface markings through the
lazy forenoon until polton came to lay
my solitary luncheon and after this

little break in the comfortable monot-
ony another spell of meditative idle-
ness set in

  polton was busy up-stairs in the
laboratory with some photographic
copying operations and i was dis-
posed to wander up and look on but
my small friend politely but very
firmly vetoed any such proceeding

  on some other occasion he would
be delighted to show me the working
of the great copying camera but just
now he had a big job in hand and as
he was working against time he would
prefer to be alone

  he even suggested that i might at-
tend to any stray callers and make my
own tea on the gas-ring so as to avoid
interrupting his work and when i had
agreed to relieve him to this extent
he thanked me profusely and retired
and i saw no more of him

  for some time after his departure i
stood at the window looking out
across the wide space at paper build-
ings and the end of crown office row

  it was a wretched afternoon the
yellow turbid sky brooded close down
upon the house-roofs and grew darker
and more brown moment by moment
as if the invisible sun had given up in
despair and gone home early

  a comfortless powdering of snow
filtered down at intervals and melted
on the pavements along which de-
pressed wayfarers hurried with their
coat-collars turned up and their hands
thrust deep into their pockets

  i watched them commiseratingly
reflecting on the superior advantages
of being within doors and forbidden
to go out and then having flung an-
other scoopful of coal on the fire i
betook myself once more to the arm-
chair the  surface markings and
idle meditation

  it was some time past four when
my reflective browsings had begun to
proceed in the direction of the tea-
kettle that i heard a light footstep on
the landing as of some one wearing
galoshes

  then a letter dropped softly into
a silent witness



the box and as i instantly pushed
back my chair to rise the footsteps
retreated i crossed the room quickly
and opened the door but the messen-
ger had already disappeared down the
dark staircase and had gone so silent-
ly on his rubber soles that though i
listened attentively i could hear no
sound from below

   having closed the door i extracted
the letter from the box and took it
over to the window to examine it i
was not a little surprised to find that
it was addressed to w m howard
esq

  this was the first communication
that i had received in my borrowed
name and my surprise at its arrival
was not unreasonable for of the
few persons who knew me by that
name none-with the exception per-
haps of mr marchmont-was in the
least likely to write to me

  but if the address on the envelope
had surprised me the letter itself sur-
prised me a good deal more for
though the writer was quite unknown
to me even by name he seemed to be
in possession of certain information
concerning me which i had supposed
to be the exclusive property of thorn-
dyke jervis polton and myself

   it bore the address  eigtree court
 inner temple and ran thus

dear sir

   i am taking the liberty of writing to yo
 to ask for your assistance as i happened to
 know that my friends drs thorndyke and
 jervis are away at maidstone and not
 available at the moment and i understand
 that you have some acquaintance with
 medical technicalities

   the circumstances are these at half
past five to-day i shall be meeting a solic-
itor to advise as to action in respect of a
case in which i am retained and the deci-
sion as to our action will be vitally affected
by a certain issue on which i am not com-
petent to form an opinion for lack of med-
ical knowledge if dr thorndyke had
been within reach i should have taken his
opinion as he is not it occurred to me to
ask if you would fill his place on this occa-
sion it being of course understood that
the usual fee of five guineas will be paid
by the solicitor

     	a-s c

  if you should be unable to come to the
consultation do not trouble to reply as i
am now going out and shall not be return-
ing until five-thirty the time of the ap-
pointment

   i am

yours faithfully

                arthur courtland

  the contents of this letter as i have
said surprised me more than a little
how in the name of all that was won-
derful had this stranger whose very
name was unknown to me come to be
aware that i had any knowledge of
medicine

  not from thorndyke i felt perfect-
ly sure nor from jervis who not-
withstanding a certain flippant face-
tiousness of manner was really an ex-
tremely cautious and judicious man

  could it be that my principal was
overseen in his trusted laboratory
assistant was it conceivable that
the suave and discreet polton had mo-
ments of leakiness when in unofficial
talk outside he let drop the secrets
of which his employers unbounded
confidence had made him the reposi-
tory

  i could not believe it not only did
polton appear to be the very soul of
discretion there was thorndyke him-
self he was not the man to give his
confidence to any one until after the
most exhaustive proof of the safety
of so giving it

  nor was he a man who was likely
to be deceived for nothing escaped his
observation and nothing that he ob-
served was passed over without care-
ful consideration

  my lethargy having been shaken off
i addressed myself to the task of pre-
paring tea and as i listened to the
homely crescendo of the kettles song
i turned the matter over in all its
bearings

  by some means this mr courtland
had become aware that i was either
a doctor or a medical student

  but by what means was it pos-
sible that he had merely inferred from
the circumstance of my being associ-


all-story cavalier weekly

ated with thorndyke that i was of the
same profession

  that was just barely conceivable
but if he had then as jervis had said
of mr wallis he must be  a devil at
guessing

  as i made the tea and subsequently
consumed it i continued to ruminate
on the contents of that singular letter

  no answer to it was required then
what was mr courtland going to do
if i did not turn up he admitted
that the issue which seemed to be an
important one was beyond him and
yet he had to give an answer to the
solicitor

  and he was prepared to pay - five
guineas for the advice of a man of
whom he-presumably-knew noth-
ing that was odd

  in fact the whole tone of the
letter with its inconsistent mixture of
urgency and casual trusting to chance
seemed irreconcilable with the care
and method that one expects from a
professional man

  and there was another point the
time of the consultation was half past
five

  now within an hour of that time
thorndyke would be back-or even
sooner if he came by the earlier train
as he had done on the previous day
as mr courtland must have known
since he knew whither my principal
had gone and he must have often at-
tended assizes himself

  could he not have waited an hour
and again had this business been
sprung upon him so suddenly that he
had had no time to get thorndykes
opinion 

  and yet again why had he written
at all instead of dropping in at our
chambers with the solicitor as was
so commonly done by thorndykes
clients 

  all of which were curious and puz-
zling questions which i put to myself
one by one and had to dismiss un-
answered

  and then i came to the practical
question to which i had to find an

answer and which was  could i under
the existing circumstances accede to-
mr courtlands request to go out-
side the precincts of the inn was i
recognized absolutely forbidden but
i had given no actual promise to re-
main in our chambers nor had i been
positively forbidden to leave them

  thorndyke had advised me to re-
main indoors and his advice had been
given so pointedly and with so evident
a desire that it should be followed that
i had not hitherto even thought of
leaving our premises

  but this was-an unforeseen contin-
gency and the question was did it
alter my position in regard to thorn-
dykes advice

  i think i have never been so unde-
cided in my life on the one hand i
was strongly tempted to keep the ap-
pointment the prospect of trium-
phantly handing to thorndyke a five-
guinea fee which i had earned as his
deputy appealed to me with almost irre-
sistible force

  on the other hand my knowledge of
thorndyke did not support this appeal
i knew him to be a man to whom a
principle was much more important
than any chance benefit gained by its
abandonment and my inner conscious-
ness told me that he would be better
pleased by a strict adherence to our
understanding than by the increment
of five guineas

   so my thoughts oscillated to and fro
now impelling me to risk it and earn
the fee and now urging me to keep to
the letter of my instructions and mean-
while the time ran on and the hour of
the consultation approached

  what decision i should have reached
in the end it is impossible to say as
matters turned out i never reached any
decision at all for just as the treasury
clock struck a quarter past five i heard
a light quick step on our landing and
immediately after a soft but hurried
knock at the door

  i strode quickly across the room
and threw the door open

  and then i started back with an ex-
a silent witness



claraation of astonishment for the
visitor-who stood full in the light of
the landing lamp-was a woman and
the woman was mrs samway

  as i stood gazing at her in amaze-
ment she slipped past me into the room
and softly shut the door

  and then i saw very plainly that
there was something amiss for she was
as pale as death and had a dreadful
frightened hunted look which haunts
me even now as i write she was
somewhat disheveled too and though
it was a bitter evening her plump
shapely hands were ungloved and cold
as ice as i noted when i took them in
mine

  are you alone she asked peer-
ing uneasily at the door of the little
office

   yes quite alone i replied

  she gazed at me with those strange
penetrating eyes of hers and said in a
half whisper

   how strange you look with that
beard i should hardly have known
you if i had not expected-

  she stopped short and casting a
strange scared glance over her shoul-
der at the dark windows whispered

   can they see in  can any one see
us from outside 

   i shouldnt think so i replied
but nevertheless i stepped over to the
windows and drew the curtains

   that looks more comfortable at
any rate said i  and now tell me
how in the name of wonder you knew
i was here

  she grasped both my wrists and
looked earnestly almost fiercely into
my eyes

 ask me no questions  she ex-
claimed  ask me nothing but
listen i have come here for a purpose
has a letter been left here for you
 yes i replied

   asking you to go to a place in fig-
tree court 

   good god  i exclaimed  hqw
on earth-

  she shook my wrists impatiently in
her strong grasp

   answer me  she exclaimed
 answer me 

   yes i replied  i was to go
there at half past five

  again her strong grasp tightened on
my wrists

   humphrey she said in a low
earnest voice  you are not to go do
you hear me you are not to go
and then as i seemed to hesitate
she continued more urgently

   i ask you-i beg you to promise
me that you wont 

  i gazed at her in sheer amazement
but some instinct some faint glimmer
of understanding restrained me from
asking for any explanation

   very well i said  i wont go
if you say im not to

   that is a promise 

  yes its a promise besides its
nearly half past already so if i dont
go now the appointment falls through
 and you wont go outside these
rooms to-night promise me that
too 

    if i dont go to this lawyer i shant
go out at all

   and to-morrow too give me
your word that you wont let any sort
of pretext draw you out of these rooms
to-morrow or the next day or in fact
until dr thorndyke says you may
for a few moments i was literally
struck dumb with astonishment at her
last words and could do nothing but
gaze at her in astounded silence

  at length recovering myself a little
i exclaimed

   my dear mrs samway- but
she interrupted me

   dont call me by that horrible
name give me my own name-le-
titia-or  she added a little shyly and
in a soft coaxing tone  call me lettie
wont you humphrey just for this
once

   you neednt mind you wouldnt
if you knew i should like when i
think of my friend-the only friend
that i care for-to remember that he
called me by my own name when we
said good-by youll think me silly


all-story cavalier weekly

and sentimental but you neednt mind
indulging me just for once its the
last time

   the last time  i repeated
 what do you mean by that lettie
and by speaking of our saying good-
by are you going away 

   yes i am going away i dont
suppose you will ever see me again i
am going out of your life

   not out of my life lettie we
are always friends even if we never
see one another

  are we she said looking up at
me earnestly  perhaps it is so but
still this is good-by i ought to say it
and go but oh god  she exclaimed
with sudden passion  i dont want to
go-away from you humphrey out
into the cold and the dark 

  she buried her face against my shoul-
der and i could feel that she was sob-
bing though she uttered no sound

  it was a dreadful situation instinc-
tively certain though i was that her
grief had a real and tragic basis i
could offer no word of comfort

  for what was there to say she
was going clearly to a life of wretch-
edness without hope of any relief or
change and without a single friend to
cheer her loneliness that much i
could guess vaguely and dimly

  but it was enough and it wrung
my heart to witness her passion of
grief and to be able to offer no more
than a pressure of the hand

  after a few seconds she raised her
head and looked in my face with tears
still clinging to her lashes

   humphrey she said laying her
hands on my shoulders  i have a few
last words to say to you and then i
must go listen to me dearest friend
and remember what i say

   when i am gone people will tell
you things and you will come to know
others people will say that i am a
wicked woman which is true enough
god knows but if they say that i
have done or connived at wickedness
against you try to believe that it was
not as it seemed and to forgive me

   and say to yourself  this wicked
woman would have willingly given her
hearts blood for me say that hum-
phrey it is true i would gladly give
my life to make you safe and happy
and try to think kindly of me in the
evil report that will reach you sooner
or later will you try humphrey  
 my dear lettie i said  we are
friends now and always nothing that
i hear shall alter that

   i believe you she said  and i
thank you from my heart and now
i must go-i must go and its good-
by-good-by humphrey for the very
last time

  she passed her arms around my neck
and pressed her wet cheek to mine
then she kissed me and turning away
abruptly walked across to the door and
opened it

  on the landing in the light of the
lamp she turned once more and i saw
that the hot blush that had risen to
her cheek as she kissed me had faded
already into a deathly pallor and that
the dreadful frightened hunted look
had come back into her face

  she stood for a moment with her
finger raised warningly and whispered
 good-by dear good-by shut the
door now and shut it quietly and
then she passed into the opening of the
dark staircase

  i closed the door softly and turned
away toward the window and as i did
so i heard her stumble slightly on the
stair a short way down and utter a
little startled cry

  i was nearly going out to her and
did in fact stand a moment or two
listening but as i heard nothing more
i moved over to the window and draw-
ing back the curtain looked down on
our door-step to see her go out

  my mind was in a whirl of confused
emotions profound pity for this lone-
ly unhappy warm-hearted woman con-
tended with amazement at the revela-
tion of her manifest connection with
the mystery that surrounded me and
i stood bewildered by the tumult of
incoherent thought grasping the cur-
a silent witness



tain and looking down on the great
square stone that i might at least catch
a farewell glance at this poor soul who
was passing so unwillingly out of xny
life

  the seconds passed a man came
out of our entry and turning to the
left walked at a rapid pace toward the
tudor street gate

  still she did not appear perhaps
she had heard him on the stairs and
was waiting to pass out unnoticed

  but yet it was strange nearly a
minute had elapsed since she started
to descend the stairs could i have
missed her it seemed impossible
since i had come to the window almost
immediately

  a vague uneasiness began to take
possession of me i recalled her white
face and frightened eyes and as i
stared down at the door-step with
growing anxiety i found myself listen-

ing-listening nervously for i knew
not what

  suddenly i caught a sound - faint
and vague but certainly a sound and
it seemed to come from the staircase

  in a moment i had the door open and
was stealing out on the landing

  the house was profoundly silent
no murmur even penetrated from the
distant streets i crept across the land-
ing breathing softly and listening

  and then from the stillness below
but near at hand came a faint whis-
pering sigh or moan

  instantly i sprang forward all of a
tremble and darted down the stairs

  at the first turn i saw projecting
round the angle a hand-a womans
hand-plump and shapely and white as
marble

  with a gasp of terror i flew round
the turn of the staircase and-

  god in heaven she was there

chapter xxxi
face to face

irst of all it seemed to birkland
that he was looking at a
stranger

a moment and it seemed as though
their paths had never led aparfer he
ixad expected to find her older-a little

thi story began in the all-stoi

old-fashioned old-maidish it was the
surprise that had given him that im-
pression that here was a stranger

  it was the revivified memory of her
youth that blotted out this impression
with the other

   mary for the love of heaven 
he exclaimed foolishly as they looked
at each other

cavalier weekly for june 
the lost hearthstone



   how do you do henry 

  she was smiling perfectly self-pos-
sessed

   i think ill kiss you too he said

   you may she answered

  he had taken one of her hands he
put a hand lightly on her shoulder
his lips touched her cheek

  she radiated strength warmth
mystery but above all perfect calm
perfect self-reliance good god he
thought and he had secretly been feel-
ing a little sorry for her had been al-
lowing his meditations concerning her
to be touched with a tinge of charity
had conceived her to be countrified
passee-his little faded wild-flower

  without being capable of noting de-
tails he was struck none the less that
she was charmingly dressed that her
complexion was perfect that her hair
was becomingly arranged - ah there
was a tuft of gray just over her fore-
head after all

  he was grateful for that touch of
gray he had begun to feel a little
frightened his eyes came back to
hers having scarcely left them they
were almost on a level with his own

   id like to do it again he said as
they all laughed

  go ahead go ahead roared
the major happily

  and all through the supper that fol-
lowed-or dinner with its barley soup
fried chicken vegetables containing
the distilled essence of the country jel-
lies of haunting perfume-birkland
couldnt get over the wonder of it
this was mary harmon still young
still beautiful with no other legacy
from the passing years than that of a
greater charm

  not even when the conversation
touched on the wrecked bank and the
suicide of custis campbell was birk-
lands attention wholly diverted not
very much was said anyway only it
appeared the campbells had been
neighbors of theirs-lived just across
the street and mrs woods had been
over to see  poor little mrs camp-
bell

   does she try to explain it   asked
the major gently

   yes she does answered mrs
woods with hesitation she was one
of those women who could never say
anything that might be derogatory to
some one without hesitating first
 she seems to blame it on mr
miller

  cyrus f miller -of milldale
asked birkland

  the major snorted there was
neither gentleness nor sympathy in the
way he did it

   yes cyrus f miller of milldale
hes a deep one-deep and crooked
and dark like a skunk-hole

   bliphalet 

   henry have some more coffee
said the major rebuked but not dis-s
mayed

  music slightly agitated but meri-
torious withal by the inspirational
luella more music of a maturer sort
-with some slight hint of agitation
here too perhaps-by mary some
kindly homely conversation on gen-
eral topics and the major cleared his
throat

    mother he said  lets say good
night that neednt concern you young
folks he hastened to add

   i guess ill remain up a while
too luella ventured

  but grandmother woods whispered
something in luellas ear topping it
off with a kiss and a hug

   good night aunt mary said lu-
ella lifting her face and then

 good night uncle henry

  birkland touched one of luellas
fine-gold eyebrows with his lips
chords that had slumbered within the
innermost depths of his being for ages
-it seemed-were aquiver with angel-
music lord and he had believed
himself alone in the world

  if there were no tears in his eyes
when he finally looked across at mary
through the yellow lamp-light there
might have been so far as his feelings
were concerned

  there was no noise in that part of


all-story cavalier weekly

 hambleton a great silence a great
 peace-as fathomless as the night it-
 self-seemed to have fallen on every-
 thing

   mary had been standing at the side
 of the center-table idly turning the
 pages of a magazine as she looked
 up the light from the lamp shone
 strong on the white smoothness of her
 throat deepened the shadows about
 her eyes

   as birkland looked at her he felt a
 -sort of suffocating wave of gratitude
 that he hadnt wavered along the road
 -that this wasnt julia or any one else
 in the world that confronted him other
 than she who stood there

    mary he whispered

   her only answer was to smile to
 turn from the lamp and start slowly
 across the room before she had taken
 three steps he was at her side had
 taken her hand

   mary he repeated tensely
 listen-youre a dream come true-
part of a great magical dream come
true 

   she was facing him-not bashfully
 just gently and proudly mistress of
 herself

  you still dream she asked
softly

   it came like an echo from years all
 but forgotten he remembered now
 how much they had talked about
 dreams in the old days dreams and
 ideals and things like that

   he was standing very close to her
 holding both of her hands now

    shut your eyes he whispered

   she knew what he contemplated
 her seraphic smile showed that but
 she did as she was ordered unhesita-
 tingly birkland closed his own eyes

   it all became a miracle of a sort

   they were standing again in the
 shadow of the methodist church at
 milldale stars and swaying branches
 overhead the night-air stirring soft-
 footed around them organ-music
 dissolving earth and heaven into one

   and do you also dream   he
asked at last

   yes

 of-the thing ive dreamed of  
she smiled  ive dreamed of you
he pressed her to him  mary-
youre going to-you have to-youre
going to be my wife  

but even as he said this he felt a
stab of remorse it is often like that

-	some tragic note in the triumphal
march some mummy appearing at the
feast

  ruined he was ruined and he was
willing to thrust his poverty on her

  she had reached up and touched his
face her clear eyes were looking into
his as she answered  yes 

 but i must-must- he began
the hand on his face made a gentle
little stroking movement it was such
a caress as a mother might use in
soothing a hurt child

   you must fight for your dreams
my dear boy she said softly you
must demand their fulfilment dont
you suppose i know that youll do this
-that well do this-together  

   then you knew-you did send me
that fifty dollars

   in a place like this every one
knows everything-provided it isnt
vital its only the great truths that
they miss the truth with a capital

   and youre not worried - not
frightened 

  miss harmons only answer was to
draw birklands face down ever so
gently toward her own

chapter xxxii
deep and crooked and dark

rut that night when birkland was
alone in his room there again re-
curred to him despite the tremendous
stimulus that had been given him to
more cheerful thinking a twinge or
two of dread from his window he
had looked across the street

  it was late an hour when most of
hambleton had already gone to bed
but there was another house over there
with lighted windows
the lost hearthstone



  it was the house of his boyhood
friend - poor custis campbell lying
dead a white night there for  poor
little mrs campbell and his mental
image of the widow threw up on the
screen of his imagination the baleful
shadow of the man he had never seen
mr cyrus f miller of milldale

  he saw mr miller next day and
his premonitions were confirmed

  he was one of those men who look
as though they have tasted alum - a
tight little mouth slued down to one
side open and showing the lower teeth
but hard he had alert prehensile
eyes that looked out unsteadily from
under bushy red-brown eyebrows
otherwise his face was normal clean-
shaven but far from handsome

  fifty birkland reflected and
deep and crooked and dark 

  he turned to the major who had
accompanied him up-town  i agree
with you on your characterization he
said

   are you sure you want to negoti-
ate that land-deal yourself henry
asked the major  hell want to rob
you thats in his line

  birkland took thought

  after all it would be a mere open-
ing of negotiations before the pur-
chase could be consummated he would
have to get money-money at any
price and if he was to have this man
as a neighbor there might as well be
frankness on his own part whatever
might be forthcoming from the other
 ill try it myself major

   remember if he asks more than
three thousand for that particular tract
hes trying to skin you

  ill remember

  mr miller had evidently been
brought into town early through his
anxiety for the wrecked bank it was
on the steps of the bank building that
he now stood talking to a growing
group of citizens

   of course i cant tell whatll be
done he kept saying  you must
remember i am only a director

   but the most important some one

said it was evidently put forward not
as a compliment but as a means of
forcing some definite statement mr
miller emitted a sour little laugh from
his small wry mouth

    us directors may all chip in so
far as were able-every little 
count

    thats a most extraordinary offer
for a mean man to make birkland
communed with himself

   have they located any of the
money   asked a fat man with a white
and flabby face

    ask the police ask the police 
said mr miller in falsetto tones he
had been asked the same question be-
fore and manifestly it made him
peevish the crowd was growing mo-
mentarily larger mr miller looked
out over it seeking possibly for a
friend his search must have been
vain

  a small man with a derby hat on
a head that was too big for him el-
bowed his way brutally to the front

   are you sure he demanded
 that the directors didnt cop out that
cash  

  mr miller sought to freeze him
with a look of his shifty eyes but
failed

   are you sure that some dost
friend of hisn didnt cop it out
persisted the little man

  mr miller didnt answer that but
the crowd did somehow it sent a
little crisping chill down birklands
backbone when he heard the crowds
answer-a ragged spasmodic attempt
at a cheer

  mr millers face went black with
rage he saw one of the towns four
policemen standing near the curbstone

    officer he piped  youll have to
keep order here

  there were a good many boys in
the crowd now they led the cheering
at that but a good many men joined
in naggingly

    i bet you know where that cash is
yourself shouted the small man sure
of his backing


all-story cavalier weekly

  mr miller spat out the beginning of
an oath checked himself smiled
crookedly

   and by god we ought to choke
it out of him cried the little man
facing the crowd

  mr miller had decided to go else-
where was worming his way down
one side of the stone stoop at the
same time the policeman was creating
a diversion forcing his way through
the crowd evidently he was known
to the majority of the citizens there
several of them were frankly obstruc-
ting his way calling him by name and
urging him not to persist

   leave him alone charley   he
didnt hurt any one  hes all
right

   hey you said the policeman
when he was as close to the little man
as possible  dont you make no dis-
turbance here or ill run you in

   you can club my nut off said
the little man  theyve robbed me of
all i had

  he turned and smiled pitifully out
over the crowd he was standing on
the topmost step every one could see
him despite his small stature-big
brow mustache over a weak chin and
mouth his derby hat pushed far back
like that of an agitated business man

  again they cheered

  finding himself in such a prominent
position with so many eyes focused
upon him seemed to excite him even
more he had probably passed a
sleepless night poor fellow anyway
he begun to make a speech

   im as peaceable as the next one
he began and the boys in the crowd
urged him on with shrill cries  but
by golly fellows when a fellers got
you by the windpipe you want to punch
him

   you got tq stop that cried the
policeman making another attempt to
get nearer

   ah leave him alone charley a
dozen voices protested friendly hands
were holding the policeman bade

  more cheering the little mail ya

becoming more and more excited by
his situation and attendant circum-
stances he pushed his hat further
back tugged savagely at his mustache

   i agree with shakespeare that you
shouldnt speak evil about dead peo-
ple he went on  and i dont do it
now the crook or the crooks that has
got your money and mine in their jeans
to-day aint dead you can bet your
sweet life on it they aint theyre
alive but by golly if i had my say 
-the voice rose to almost a scream-
 they wouldnt be 

  the crowd roared at that

  there was some laughter in it n
doubt for all of those present were
not losers a good deal of the noise
certainly came from the small boys
but again birkland felt a thrill run-
ning up and down his backbone i

  he suddenly realized that he hai
almost cheered himself

  it made him feel foolish he hatj
started out such a little while before
so calm and fortified whatever had
happened to him the future was briln
liant

  nothing could go wrong if he kept
his mind in the proper attitude-that
was what mary had impressed upon
him

  he was to go ahead and negotiate
the purchase of his old homestead just
as though nothing at all had happened
to him just as though mr cyrus f
miller of milldale was one of the finest
gentlemen in the land

  had he allowed mr miller td
escape 

  the crowd was still cheering as h
cast a glance around him he saw the
man he wanted not more than half a
block away untying his horse prepara-s
tory to driving off

  mr miller still had his back turned
when birkland came up to him foi
he was engaged in arranging the yeli
low blanket he had just taken from hi
horse as an extra cushion for thq
buggy birkland hesitated a moment
then touched him on the shoulder hfj
was shocked by what followed-
the lost hearthstone



  mr miller had given a violent start
whirled upon him with a face that was
shot with dread

      chapter xxxiii
      known and unknown

it only lasted for a moment or two-
that look on mr millers face-
but birkland was never to forget it
especially as he was to see it again-see
it under circumstances more striking
and tragical still the dread changed
to suspicion over the suspicion there
was spread a thin veneer of politeness

   what can i do for you   mr
miller asked

  birkland also recovered himself
the shock of what he had seen had
sent his own mind momentarily racing
back to the scene he had just left-to
the small man on the steps of the bank
his pitiful perilous harangue the
crowd half mocking half sympathet-
ic mobs sometimes grew from crowds
like that

   i beg your pardon he said  i
merely wanted to see you about the
purchase of a certain piece of land

  a light of further relief came into
millers shifty eyes

  what lands that

   that old birkland property out at
milldale

   umph-the richest land in butler
county said mr miller more from
force of habit perhaps than any im-
mediate desire to bargain his eyes
were down the street in the direction
of the bank  get into the buggy and
well drive over to the court-house
we can talk better over there mr-
mr-

   birkland-my name is birkland
very little was said after that -
just then but during the short drive
to the court-house birkland had fur-
ther opportunity to study the face of
the man at his side it was a face of
shifting expressions despite its hard
lines

  greed and cunning bitterness and

satisfaction fear and desperate resolu-
tion-a very remarkable face indeed
so birkland thought

  there was a dismal room in the base-
ment of the court-house with a tin
sign on the door bearing the inscrip-
tion  county assessors mr miller
unlocked this door with a key he car-
ried went in invited birkland to fol-
low then closed and locked the door
behind them

   this is my office when i come to
town he said shortly  sit down
they looked at each other through
the dim and dusty light of the place
oddly enough birkland thought of
mary perhaps it was because it re-
quired such an effort on his part to
choke back the instinctive hatred he
felt for the man in front of him
could even she he wondered be
charitable to such a man as this

   well mr miller how much do
you want for it

   i never thought of selling it you
see its just as i said-about the rich-
est tract in butler county you can
raise everything on land like that

   i wasnt expecting to farm

   and land like that is doubling in
value right along-milldale growing
fast hambleton spreading out in that
direction speculators been after me
all along just day before yesterday
i had an offer of five thousand i
was expecting the  gentleman back
from cincinnati to close the deal
birkland knew that the man was
lying in all his experience with men
of one kind or another a lie had never
been more manifest

   mr miller he said  im not a
speculator any more than im a farm-
er moreover im not a millionaire
ive come out here to buy that place
merely as a matter of sentiment-be-
cause my folks lived there because it
was my old home i want to live
there again thats why i want to
buy it thats why im willing to pay
you a fair price for it

  birkland was rather prottd of that
speech


all-story cavalier weekly

  eor honesty and ingenuousness he
told himself mary herself couldnt
have improved on it but if birkland
was satisfied it was evident that mr
miller was even more so his face
simply radiated crooked delight

   oh he crooned  thats a hoss
of another color sentiment is it
now i understand sentiment and ill
tell you what ill do ill let you take
that passel of land and not another
word said to any one for six thousand
dollars-cash

   mr miller thats just twice too
much and you know it

  six thousand-cash 

   were going to be neighbors -
good neighbors i hope - and you
know very well that if you hold out
for an unfair price its going to cause
regret

   are you talking cash or time-pay-
ments asked mr miller suddenly

  in the silence that followed there
seemed to come from the corridor be-
yond the locked door a shuffling foot-
fall very light like that which might
be made by a heavy person who seeks
to walk cautiously mr miller raised
a finger and listened

  again a slight movement outside
something like suppressed breathing

  birkland had an inspiration he
disregarded mr millers signal raised
his voice instead

   im talking cash 

  it was odd that this simple declara-
tion even if it was delivered in a voice
that was a little louder than necessary
should have sent through mr miller
such an obvious pang of nervousness

  suddenly he got to his feet tiptoed
over to the door stood there listening

  birkland was watching him a new
light dawning on the horizon of his
mental vision there was a muffled
movement outside the door - there
was no doubt about that

  mr miller quite as suddenly as he
had left his chair wrenched open the
door and looked out it was evident
that he saw no one for he looked long
in one direction then in another

  when he had closed the door again
and locked it he came back visibly
shaken

   i dont mind telling you he said
with a crooked mirthless effort at a
laugh  that im getting rid of a lot
of my farming property and i
havent so much faith in those cincin-
nati gents theyll probably want to
hem and haw their offer stands for
you now if you could come around
with five thousand cash-

   three thousand said birkland
steadily his eyes never shifting from
the others face

  but even as he was saying it his
mind was working madly in other di-
rections he could raise three thou-
sand dollars cash somehow at short
notice there was the offer that ma-
jor woods had made and which he
shouldnt refuse under the circum-
stances

  he would sell out every share of
stock remaining to him in the sus-
quehanna if necessary however great
the sacrifice might be and that would
bring him five or six thousand dollars
at least

  u cling fast to your vision-demand
its realization 

  both his own philosophy and that
of mary - god bless her -were in
accord as to that

  but there was something else -
something that gave him a little
tingling sensation of an even more
imminent power-was taking form in
his mind it was still shifting nebu-
lous like the vapors of dawn seen in
that new light that had begun to
come up a little while before on his
mental horizon

  custis campbells widow blamed
what had happened at the bank on
cyrus f miller

  there were others who thought
likewise - the small man with the
large head he who had made the
speech and some of those who had
cheered him on birkland recalled the
look of dread on millers face in re-
sponse to the touch on his shoulder
the lost hearthstone



his manifest uneasiness just now his
declaration that he was getting rid of
his land

  he looked steadily at mr miller
nor even deigned to smile

   three thousand cash he re-
peated

   not so loud 

  there was no mistaking the fact
this time that something or some one
was again astir just outside

  if i did do such a darn - fool
thing mr miller went on  it would
be as a matter of sentiment he be-
gan to whine a little and raised his
own voice to a louder pitch  id do
a whole lot for sentiment i always
did

  sure said birkland theres
the case of poor custis campbell

  mr millers shrunken mouth
twitched and his shifty eyes went to
the door

  it sounded as though there might
have been two persons out there who
whispered

     chapter xxxiv
     the voices at the door

more than once in his career had
birkland put his trust in the sim-
ple fact that his position was unassail-
able- that his principles were right
that his motives were fair that he had
nothing to hide or to be afraid of

  honesty with him wasnt an ab-
straction it was something real-as
solidly practical as the rock founda-
tion of a lighthouse or a sky-scraper

  and more than once he had seen
men squirm-bigger men than cyrus
f miller-through lacking this thing
somewhere in the construction of their
lives there was a hidden fault-a shift-
ing foundation a missing girder cheap
material

  such spectacles apart from his in-
stinctive charity had always consoled
him strengthened him in his own
course but he was experiencing a
different sentiment now

  this time there was no charity he
didnt want to gloat but he did -
just a little

  mr miller was obviously afraid
whatever the cause of it birkland was
fully conscious now of the advantage
that it gave him there was another
whispering advocate pleading his
cause apart from the one or the sev-
eral at the door

  it was mr millers own conscience
and it didnt matter much whether its
theme was the wreck of the hambleton
national bank and the suicide of its
president or something else

   i always have to be a little carefut
in discussing my affairs here said
mr miller as he wiped his dry lips
with the back of his hand he laughed
unevenly  theres always such a lot
of rubbernecks hanging around-

  he stopped short and listened then
once more went over to the door with
affected carelessness this time and
threw it open no one was there

  birkland watched mr miller as he
once more stared long in one direction
then the other

  he made a curious picture of doubt
and wondering suspicion for his neck
was long his jaws bulged roundly just
under the ears and the ears themselves
stood well out from the head

  and birkland himself was interest-
ed he had heard the sounds there
could be no doubt about them he
ventured a suggestion

   maybe it was a rat

   rats dont whisper the other ob-
jected

   then its to be three thousand
dollars said birkland resuming
negotiations

   cash-this afternoon

   or to-morrow

   to-morrow at the latest subject
to one condition mr birkland im
a fool to make such a bargain but the
fact neednt be advertised i want
you to keep quiet about it i can keep
the transfer quiet what did i say-
three thousand dollars oh i cant
let it go for that 


all-story cavalier weekly

   and i also have a condition or
two mr miller said birkland dis-
regarding the last declaration  i
want the old house you moved off for
a cider-mill

   all for four thousand dollars  

   for three-and then something
else

  mr millers eyes shifted to one of
the windows almost opaque with
grime then back to the door

   thats curious said birkland
evenly i also heard it again-just
outside the door he waited for a
moment or two  for three thousand
dollars and then something else
what

   mr miller when i lived in that
house there was a big stone in front
of the fireplace-the old hearthstone
do you remember it 

   what-an old hearthstone  

  it was evident that mr miller was
either sparring for time or that his
mind was too taken up with other
thoughts

   yes where is it 

   why i dont remember anything
about an old hearthstone

  think

  mr miller nervous suddenly lost
his temper

   what are you talking about
now   he demanded with snarling in-
solence  you come around here
with a picayune offer for your dad-
blasted land and i give in to you like
a dad-blasted fool and you want me
to throw in a dod-rotted shack and
now you begin bellerin for a hunk of
dirty claystone-

   so you do remember it  said
birkland where is it

   its none of your business where
it is

   where is it 

  birkland hadnt turned a hair nor
shifted his eyes his voice was low
well by- well by-

  miller stopped suffocated

   where is it  demanded birkland
more softly still he even smiled a
little

  two sounds reached them as they sat
there in the grimy little room one
was a confused murmur in the distance
- a crowd cheering perhaps the
other was a recurrence of that ghostly
sibilance at the door

  you can go to hell said mr
miller whiningly  im going to get
out of here ive got other things to
attend to

   sit down birkland whispered
 and listen to what i have to say it
wont take long

  fear and anger were both on the
others face as he again sat down
there followed another period of lis-
tening birklands voice was still dis-
passionate as he resumed

   you and i will go over together to
major woodss office and seal this bar-
gain for the land and the house as we
agreed and youll have that much off
your mind youve got enough on
your mind havent you cheers up
the street whispers at the door rumors
going around town - some pretty
shrewd investigators busy at the bank
 what do you mean 

   wheres that old hearthstone  
miller let out a raucous little cry not
very loud but hideous-a laugh and a
sob and a curse

  all right said birkland thats
enough for one day come on well
go and see majorwoods

  it was miller who opened the door
but before he went out into the cor-
ridor he once more extended his long
neck for a look to left and to right
no one there and he laughed

  birkland also paused just outside the
door he was puzzled those voices
couldnt have been all imagination a
soiled newspaper on the dirty unswept
floor at his feet attracted his attention
it was a copy of the special edition that
had heralded the failure of the bank
and campbells death

  he read again the head-line

bank rifled-president a suicide

as he read a passing breeze gave the
page an air of animation it lifted and
the lost hearthstone



scraped against the door with a rus-
tling whisper

chapter xxxv
signs of storm

it isnt often that there is a concord-
ance between weather and human
events on this planet

  many of the worst tragedies befall
under a smiling sky the sun shines
bright and the boy drowns the girl
goes wrong the invalid opens the door
on eternity

  but as birkland followed miller out
into the street it seemed somehow as
though the whole world partook of
those qualities that distinguished the
room they had just left-dust and
gloom a gray atmosphere of huddling
fear he cast an eye aloft

  a storm was coming up

  the sky was overcast with coldly
sodden clouds driven furiously out of
the north there had been a marked
drop in the temperature since morning
now and then a gust of wind lashed
out with an invisible knout cutting and
freezing the shrinking mortal wherever
it struck

  birkland shivered shivered twice-
once physically once mentally

  it wasnt like this that he would have
had things come about he told himself
it wasnt on this sort of a day that he
would have negotiated the purchase of
his birthplace it seemed to him al-
most as though he were participating
in a crime

  perhaps he was just how much
had there been of blackmail in these
negotiations so far as they had gone

  miller slumped along furtively ab-
sorbed planning something that only
he might know then he and birkland
were brought together by a peculiar in-
cident-peculiar because it seemed so
out of place in the frigid gloom-a re-
currence of the cheering they had
heard

  yet the steps of the bank were de-
serted

  they looked at each other before
they had time to speculate as to the
nature of the celebration-or whatever
it might be-the cause of it appeared
charley the policeman had at last
made his arrest

  the prisoner was the small man with
the big head there had evidently
been a chase both were panting and
disheveled

   i tell you shouted the little man
 they dont arrest no robbers they
arrest the feller thats robbed 

  again the crowd cheered enjoying
the diversion mightily

  cyrus f miller stepped into a door-
way and birkland instinctively placed
himself in front of him the crowd
was coming in their direction but the
little man had seen him

   theres one of them now he
howled

  charley the policeman jerked him
by the arm bade him to come along
but the crowd was pressing close and
the prisoner felt that it was with him

   if i had my way he bawled
savagely  id hang him up now to a
telephone-pole

  there were hoots and jeers the
crowd surged past the little man
making a desperate effort to delay the
march

   youll get yours you old skin-
flint

  what else he had to say was lost in
the noisy tumult of the crowd birk-
land looked back at the man behind
him with a smile mr miller also
smiled crookedly but he was
trembling

  major woodss office was in the
templar block on high street it
was there that the good templars had
their hall and on this particular day
many of the younger generation un-
awares of the greater excitement in
the street were in the hall getting
ready for some festival or other

  there was a piano in the hall and
every now and then there floated down
to the large but somewhat bare office
where the major sat a sound of dance-


all-story cavalier weekly-

music the ripple and pulse of laughter
and conversation

  the big round stove sizzled and
clinked cheerfully with its charge of
coal-summer-weather so far as the
major was concerned life was cer-
tainly good

  he dozed awake-in that pleasant
state of somnolence wherein dreams
are subject to the will and the major
had sent his dreams back a good many
years to the time when he and jo
birkland were still rivals for the hand
of sarah deane

  his white beard was on his bosom
but now and then he slowly shook his
head up and down and again from
side to side

  once he murmured half aloud

   ah me ah me  and again i
good lord good lord

  like many men who have kept old
sorrows and romances alive and have
never given the world at large any
sign of it the major had developed
into a good deal of a mystic such
dreams were the consolation of his old
age-they had always consoled him

  how like it was to sarahs boy that
he should return like that from the
tast in the sudden quest of an ideal

  sarah had been like that sarah
had married jo birkland because-be-
cause she was sorry for him sorrier
for him than she had been for eli-
phalet woods because he eliphalet
had been proud in those days and the
richer of the two

  to the old major sitting there with
his white beard on his spotless white
shirt and his equally white and spotless
waistcoat it was very sweet to hear
the merrymaking of the young tem-
plars-almost as though they were his
and sar-

  there was a knock at the door and
the major roared come in

  early night was drawing on-mys-
terious wild and threatening but as
birkland looked out of the window
of the majors office with the major
at his side he felt isuch a warmth in

his heart as he had hardly ever known
before

  in the breast-pocket of his coat was
the deed to the land at milldale

  yellow lamplight glimmered from
the windows of all the private houses
he could see and in each one of them
he could picture some happy family-
group around a fireplace such as he
would make his own-a bivouac of
comfort sympathy and love

  for the first time in his life he was
appreciating what it had meant to be
alone in the world what were riches
and success to a heart gnawed by
loneliness

  fireside and family

  these were the very beginning of
things men were already fighting for
them back in the stone-age

  then the wind howled a white
moon with a wobegone face peered
ghastly from between runaway clouds
at the same time a lean horse hitched
to a buggy sprang to the touch of a
whip in the street just below

  it was cyrus f miller starting out
on his long drive to milldale

   is he married   asked birkland
trying to pursue even in this connec-
tion his former line of thought

  him- no said the major
with contempt lives alone-hires
paupers from the poor-house imbeciles
and such to do his work

   why did you insist on paying him
the entire sum this afternoon i could
get the money from new york by to-
morrow or a couple of days at most
 who knows whatll happen in a
day or so he may go the way of
custis campbell although i dont
think he will hes too mean he
may jump the country

   but why should he lie so about
that hearthstone  

   lord henry lets not ask why
human happiness is never perfect-
never right away at first that is

  his hand descended gently on birk-
lands far shoulder but something of
the outer cold and the wind-drivert
clouds and the gaunt horse with the
the lost hearthstone



enterprises such as aiding for exam-
ple the panting hordes of the slums to

sun and shadow

this feeling was to remain with
    him for days

  he didnt know it then he was
only conscious that it was there-that
the garden of his dreams had a ghost
in it and methodically he set out to
lay it

  he had ample time to think-some-
thing that he had lacked for a good
many years-for with the abundant
tact of native kindness the members
of the woods household recognized
his needs and left him much to him-
self even mary

  he was willing that this should be
so he had enough to think about

  first of all he knew now that he
stood committed that he had put his
new york life behind him forever
he had never been perfectly at home
there-not as bruce howland for ex-
ample was at home there

  this was where he was at home out
in the open where neither people nor
hours were crowded

  not that he objected to work he
expected to work he had liquidated
his susquehanna holdings had paid
back to major woods the money ad-
vanced for the payment to miller had
even stripped himself to the extent of
three thousand dollars more which he
had sent to bruce howland as a return
of the friendly deception in the matter
of the undeclared dividends

  he was a poor man with scarcely
four thousand dollars to his credit he
would have to work

  but he expected to both work and
grow it was in such towns and coun-
ties and states as this that the country
had found her presidents

he nourished no delusions about
ever becoming president nor of enter-
ing politics even but there were other
big jobs abroad-great constructive
 a-s c

men

  thus he became certain that back of
the impulse which had caused him to
put new york behind him was some-
thing more than mere sentiment pow-
erful as sentiment is in the life of every
man

  he had in some way obeyed the
call of destiny as well all men are
 men of destiny said birkland to
himself it was destiny which had
brought him back to the miami valley
and it was here that destiny would give
him his work to do

  therefore it was fated that he go
on with his project to put his old
homestead in order-whatever diffi-
culties were in his way-and to build
up a family around him-whatever
difficulties might be in the way of that
either

  and wasnt it destiny also which
had kept mary harmon free youthful
beautiful

  mary sustained him in all things he
couldnt keep even his worries to him-
self however much he might have
wanted to she was one of those rare
creatures-not so rare to-day as they
were a while ago-who have a work-
ing philosophy of life and abide by it
and impart it to others

   keep demanding keep asking
she would thrill to him when she knew
that he was depressed  and youll re-
ceive

  he couldnt quite see why this -
should be but it consoled him he
even came to believe it

   dont worry about the future
she would urge again  do the right
and beautiful thing now-the thing
thats in line with the plan and youll
see how splendidly everything will
work out

  birkland would look at her with
baffled wonder

  up to then he had been optimistic to
the ejstent that two plus two equal

four and that a brick would stay up if
it were laid level on two other bricks
and fastened into place with mortar

   well ive done the right and
beautiful thing to-day he confessed
one evening at the supper table

  the major laughed mary looked
across at him with shining eyes mrs
woods paused in serving the mashed
potatoes

  oh where is it may i see
cried luella

   you may said birkland laugh-
ing on his own account  the very first
time you go to the livery-stable ive
bought dan

  heigh-ho cried the major

   our first horse said mary clap-
ping her hands

  yes birkland went on but i
tempered your philosophy with mine-
made them take fifty dollars off the
price they asked-reminded them that
dan was a sooner when it came to eat-
ing and wearing out his shoes

   glorious  said mary  now im
sure sure as i always have been that
our demands are being heard

  it was dan-solid not too much in
a hurry but kind and obedient withal
-who conducted birkland and mary
harmon on their first joint trip to
milldale

  birkland taking the advice of the
major and obedient to his own impulse
in the matter had lost no time in hav-
ing the old homestead restored to its
original position john brown the
milldale blacksmith had undertaken
the job and done ft well-careful not
to break anything sparing the hedge
sparing the rose-bush that had run
wild

  and it was john brown who was
the first in milldale - apart from
marys aunt miriam-to be informed
of their engagement

  he came out from his forge with his
wrought-iron face pliant with affec-
tionate enthusiasm

   i had an eye to that he confided
 i hoped itd be so i couldnt believe
itd be otherwise	e

   why so   asked birkland

  he gave them a mystic smile went
back presently to his work pondering
no doubt on this welding of human
lives - blacksmith work also yet so
delicate so tremendous

  they drove on past the creamery-
very busy with its smoke-stack and
panting steam-vent there was a pos-
sible investment there said birkland

  a man with limited capital but not
too limited as to brains and energy
could take over a plant like that and
make it grow-grow like a pumpkin-
vine in these rich bottoms where cows
had everything to make them happy

   then later on birkland con-
tinued  there will be a fortune in the
building of an electric road through
this section -  the miami  mill-
dale electric railway company -see
ive figured it out given it a name
ive even seen the farmers carrying
out their stuff for the early morning
freight-car service-a basket of eggs
for oxford a crate of chickens for
hambleton a barrel of onions for the
grand hotel-hamburger steak

   oh thats the way of success
cried mary  visualize what you
want then fill it in with facts 

   is that the way youve kept
beautiful 

   am i beautiful 

  birkland guided dan into the shore
road where he knew that no one could
see before he answered

  he needed-both of them needed
perhaps-a stimulus to new courage
just then so small so empty-it
stood there in front of them their
future home

  mary instantly had tears in her
eyes birkland starting to make some
jocular remark suddenly stopped with
a lump in his throat

  then she smiled

   see it with flowers blooming all
around it she said  see it with the
roses clambering right up to the roof
see it even as merely a part of the
big and beautiful home that is to be

mary as long as that one thing is
missing-miller has done something
with that hearthstone and i cant find
out its the heart of everything i
carved yotir initial on it as i did on
my own heart its the symbol its
the holy grail its sacred

   dear heart whispered mary
 go ahead with the vision

   it haunts me-the ghost in my
garden 

    all ghosts are laid sooner or later
if we can keep the darkness away from
our thoughts	

   i could take miller by the neck
and-

   sh-h listen well go ahead just
as though we had it and then when
the time comes- youll see

  was mary a prophet perhaps
for even then fate was preparing one
of those master plays with which she
occasionally amuses herself

     chapter xxxvii
     the voice of the mob

prom that stormy evening when
birkland watched cyrus f
miller start off behind his gaunt horse
for the drive to milldale miller had
kept out of birklands sight

  at first birkland had made several
attempts to see the man determined
to end some way or other the foolish-
ness concerning the hearthstone but
miller wouldnt be seen

  his house kept prim and clean by
pauper labor was an inhospitable place
at the best

  it stood on a hill about a mile back
from birklands place it had about
it a certain air of hard prosperity -
painted perfectly conserved but the
shutters were always closed

  no guests ever came or went a
large belligerent dog barked at all
those who passed in the road

  it was here that miller lived alone
he was unmarried he had no rela-
tives so far as any one knew he
took no interest in his neighbors

  he did no farming he was the
country financier feared by some dis-
liked by all

  the first time that birkland went
up to the house on the hill he got no
further than the paling fence that sur-
rounded the door-yard it was the big
dog a sort of mongrel mastiff that
stopped him he saw no one

  he got no answer to his hail

  the second time he penetrated the
door-yard the dog this time being
held in check by an imbecile man but
the mans only answer to his inquiries
was open-mouthed silence and a vacant
stare

  the third time his discomfiture was
even greater for not even the dog was
in evidence-nor a living soul

  and birklands wrath was cooled by
a certain chilling of the blood he
wondered whether it could be true-
or whether the feeling was due to mere
nervousness - that he had been
watched by invisible eyes all the time
that he was there

  but this was true-events in ham-
bleton were so shaping themselves that
he was not alone in concentrating more
or less interest on mr miller and his
inhospitable house

  the deeper the investigation pro-
ceeded into the affairs of the hamble-
ton national bank and the circum-
stances leading up to the death of
custis campbell deeper became public
conviction that miller was in some way
involved nothing much was said as
yet-save by the scatter-brained and
the gossips

  such subterranean murmurs often
come and go-especially in small
towns where they are more easily
heard sometimes they are the fore-
runners of a cataclysm

  as for birkland he had decided to
take marys advice and let matters
take their course-so far as they lay
beyond his control this was the
policy he adopted with regard to the
wrecked bank

  all in good time the affair would
be straightened out so far as they
	all-story cavalier weekly

                      

could ever be straightened out and
he would get his share with the others
already it was being computed that
the depositors would receive about
fifty per cent

  that would mean ten thousand dol-
lars for him and with ten thousand
dollars-

 mild weather had again set in after
the recent storm and although there
was some snow on the ground he had
taken dan and moved out to milldale
there to make his temporary home with
marys aunt miriam

  he had work to do out there and
for the time being it was the only work
that appealed to him

  there he could stand with his feet
on the ground-ground that his father
and mother had trod-ground that was
his own he loved it

  he trimmed the trees and hedges
he and dan worked for days hauling
boulders for the new chimney he was
to have built and more boulders still
for the stone wall with which his
whole domain was to be surrounded

  much of the time mary was there
with him and it must have been a
sight to entertain the angels to see
these two mated creatures planning
and building their nest against the
coming of the spring paths laid out
planations of trees both useful and
ornamental decided upon a rock-
garden there with a fountain in it

  a real fountain why not with
a small gasoline engine to do the work
and the abundant water that was
theirs

  but through it all-and birkland
was sounding depths of happiness he
had never before imagined-there ran
that minor strain of the missing hearth-
stone

  it had become a sort of obsession
with him he couldnt think of it
without feeling the skin along his
spinal column creep-where our an-
cestors perhaps had bristles-making
him feel a good deal as that dog of
millers looked whenever there were
strangers about

  the hearthstone was necessary

  it was to be the talisman of this
new life of his it was to throw all
of the good luck that might be coming
to him into this new life of his he
worked but he knew that he was do-
ing this chiefly through the blind faith
that mary and his own dreams in-
spired

  but he was waiting-waiting-

  then one night fate raised the
curtain on that master-play of hers-a
master-play so far as he and certain
others were concerned

  he had retired for the night at aunt
miriams the ojd lady lived in a
pleasant house that topped a rise on the
other side of milldale the weather
was mild but not unseasonably so

  and birkland with his window
wide open had tucked the quilt about
his ears it seemed to him that scarcely
had he closed his eyes than the waters
of the branch had risen in a spring
freshet were roaring as they used to
roar in the old days under the covered
bridge

  then suddenly he was wide awake
but the roaring continued

  there was something grisly about
it-continuous remote yet suggestive
of human passion it wasnt the river
that had a voice like that nor was it
aunt miriam nor sally the hired girl
it was outside-far away

  there came a shot faint yet dis-
tinct then another and another while
the roar went two full tones higher
it wasnt one voice there were many
of them-the complex thrilling note
of a mob

  in an instant he was out of bed and
hurrying into his clothes with no
very definite idea as to what was hap-
pening as yet still his mind kept re-
verting to the scene outside the ham-
bleton national bank the first day
that he had seen cyrus f miller

  the crowd then had made a sound
something like the one he was hearing
-only smaller more fragmentary

  he was outside in the black village
street before the rest of the household
the lost hearthstone



 was disturbed but there were lights
 in several windows several men
 whom he did not recognize but who
 called him by name passed him with
 incoherent explanations

   a red glow appeared to the north
 beyond the branch in the direction of
 his home- his home 

   it couldnt be that but with a sud-
 den gripping at his heart he started to
 run nor did he stop until he had
 crossed the bridge plunged down the
 shore-road and stood gasping inside
 the wall that he himself had built

   even here in the blackness the
 place was hallowed

   he loved it the spirits of his
 mother and father of his brothers and
 sister of mary and of his own ac-
 cumulated dreams pressed about him
 he stood there getting his breath back

   the red glow was brighter on the
 horizon strangely near there was a
 whirling gust of flame and fantasti-
 cally luminous smoke now he knew
 comprehension staggered him

   that was millers house-the in-
 hospitable the mysterious the roar
 of the flames that consumed it were
 almost as loud as the roar of the mob
 that watched it bum

just then a black form emerged
from behind birklands own shadowy
house and kept on at an awkward run
toward the road instinctively birk-
 land had leaped in pursuit

chapter xxxviii
men and masks

 jt was miller himself

    birkland knew it - knew it as
 certainly as a sleuth-hound knows its
 quarry perhaps it was the sleuth-
 hound instinct that was uppermost
 within him just then-that here was
 the man he had been looking for and
 who never again should escape

   a moment and he had seized him
 roughly by arm and collar had almost
 thrown him to the ground

    stop where are you going  

  miller was gasping for breath but
there was another reason why no
words came the face that he turned
on his captor was stamped with the
same expression that birkland had
seen there once before

  the darkness made it all the more
ghastly accentuated the lines of dread
and evil

  for gods sake he panted
 for gods sake 

   whats the matter 

   the mob - theyre burning my
house they want to kill me let me
go  he repeated the request in what
would have been a shriek if tones so
small and strangled could be called a
shriek  let me go 

   where 

   to get away

   youre guilty-you made custis
campbell kill himself

   so help me god 

  miller made a sudden effort to free
himself but birkland was gripping
him with all the new strength that had
come to him with  his work out-of-
doors

  an inner rage controlled but burn-
ing fiercely added to this strength
now was the time to choke from this
creature the one thing he cared to
know-that secret so trivial and yet
so vital

  miller read his thoughts even while
he squirmed and moaned

   i sold it-thats why i wouldnt
tell you about it

   sold the hearthstone  

   a professor-

   where

  miller was struggling again he
struck and kicked with the desperation
of panic he began to curse weep-
ingly

   theyre coming theyll kill me
you want to murder me oh-
while he stormed blasphemously
taxing birklands strength to keep his
mastery there was a resurgence of
cries nearer more chaotic what
miller had said was true

  it was the imbecile of the open

mouth and vacant stare who had seen
his master flee then with some
eleventh-hour awakening of the intel-
lect--under stress of the unusual ex-
citement the slowly accumulated
stimulus of dumb vengeance for real
or fancied wrongs-had given the
word

  there was no time to be lost birk-
land sought to listen to form a plan

  he shook miller savagely

   keep quiet he hissed  or ill
smash you myself

   save me  miller sobbed  let
me go 

  the request hysterical as it was
gave birkland hard pressed the idea
he sought

   ill save you but i wont let you
go he said  come with me

   still gripping his prisoner he made
for the shore-road and started toward
the village now and then he looked
back xhe mob was coming on

  some of its members carried
lanterns some carried improvised
torches which they sought to keep
flaming by whirling them overhead
but progress was slow they were
scattered they were making some
pretense at trailing over the half-
melted snow where to

  birkland had a half-formed plan of
hurrying miller on through the village
to aunt miriams house greatly as he
disliked to do so but even that would
be preferable to turning miller over
to the mob he knew what a mob
might do

  he remembered having seen once
when he was a little boy a souvenir
of mob-rule hanging to a tree one
frosty morning in a village not ten
miles away he shuddered

  he was equally determined how-
ever to prevent millers flight

  in his own mind he believed that
miller was guilty if only in part of
the ruin of campbell and the wreck-
ing of the bank had believed so ever
since that morning he had seen the
man shiver and turn white at the touch
of a strange hand on his shoulder

  they were passing through the all
but opaque shadows of the cotton-
wood-trees near the bridge when
miller made his last desperate attempt
to free himself from birklands grasp
it came without warning-a backward
kick a blow a floundering lurch

  then before birkland could have
retaliated even had he wanted to they
had all but collided with some one else
in the dim light birkland recognized
the silhouette of the newcomer and
his heart gave a surge of relief

  it was john brown the blacksmith
he had come just in time

  while birkland was still gasping
out an explanation there was an out-
burst of hoarse cries not far back of
them the vanguard of the mob had
come upon the fresh footprints doubt-
less at the side of the deserted house

  the blacksmith had taken one of
millers arms in his own mighty grip
he listened to birkland disregarding
altogether the blasphemous demands
and whimperings that again poured
from the prisoners crooked mouth

   well run him up to the forge
said brown  and keep him there until
the crowd goes away

  but they hadnt taken a dozen steps
before the crowd was on their trail
with wild hurrahs birkland cast one
glance over his shoulder saw a con-
fused and grotesque constellation of
flickering bobbing lights

   well have to run he gasped

   run ordered brown jerking at
millers arm

  but it was almost more than miller
could do  he sagged and lurched like
a drunken man there came a click-
ing sound from his throat as though
his body refused to breathe even with-
out a protest

   run dog-gone you  commanded
the blacksmith again

  by this time he and birkland were
dragging miller along in a shuffling
effort at speed it was heartbreaking
labor the crowd was gaining
though still unconscious that the man
they sought was just ahead
the lost hearthstone



  they had mounted the rise by the
bridge were in the main street of the
village with the blacksmith-shop not
a hundred yards away when the thing
happened it fell upon them like so
many big events with unnoticed pre-
liminaries for all of a sudden without
gradation the mob was upon them and
around them

  there was an orgie of disordered
light and movement and clamorous
sound

  birkland was fighting and shouting
to protect the man to whom he clung
he knew that the blacksmith was
doing the same

  it was phantasmal nightmarish for
he wasnt fighting men-there were
men in the background whom he dimly
saw-but he was fighting with
creatures who were masked and who
made no human sound

chapter xxxix

missing one prisoner

they were at the door of the forge
before birkland had his first con-
scious communication with the black-
smith since the fighting began

  he knew that he had been struck
and that he had struck but his body
was too hot and his nerves too excited
for details the communication of
the blacksmith reached him rather by
some sixth sense than by the ordinary
sense of hearing

   hold them off a minute while i
get him inside

  and birkland did so

 suddenly he laughed he was
breathless wildly excited had burning
spots about him that he dimly recog-
nized as hurts but he laughed for
in the sweaty dusty brutal phantas-
magoria of which he was the center he
had recognized a familiar figure

  it was that of the small man with
the big head

  he still wore his derby hat pushed
far back from his bulging forehead
like most of those who were pressing

close he was masked-an ordinary
handkerchief tied across his face and
holes cut in it

  as if there could be any disguise for
that miniature stature and oversized
head

  a napoleon of a man a little
corporal

  to make the analogy still more com-
plete this hideous funny little figure
wore the counterpart of a military sash
-a sinister and lugubrious thing for
it was a coil of manila rope swing-
ing from one shoulder down to the
opposite hip

  time-that was the thing that was
most needed now concentrating all
the physical strength that remained to
him birkland almost in a single
movement had grasped the coil of
rope bringing the little man with it
and was leaning back against the door
through which the blacksmith had just
disappeared

  intuition always quicker and more 
direct than thought had told him that
here was his one best hope for diver-
sion even in a mob a mans vanity
may be reached

   tell your men to hold off a min-
ute he shouted

  the wearer of the rope was waving
his arms leader he was perhaps

   hold off a minute he bellowed
and again  hold off a minute
you-

  he backed up the adjuration with
a string of frightful oathsa he was
creating a diversion at any rate
there was a sufficient subsidence of
other sound for him to be heard

  there were others who began to
laugh-from sheer hysteria most
likely

   no mob-law here shouted birk-
land this is our county this is our
state

  the little man turned wrath at
having been tricked even for a mo-
ment burning manifest through his
flimsy disguise making his body
quiver

   the hell you say  he shrieked


all-story cavalier weekly

 we come out here for miller boys
hes trying- to save him as robbed us 
birkland didnt let time enough
elapse for this verbal firebrand to do
much damage he was thrilled by the
image of his own words- our
county our state  he could never
have used such words nor conceived
such a thought even a little while ago

    i tell you mob-law is a disgrace
he shouted at the top of his lungs
 therell be none of it in butler
county-therell be none of it in this
part of ohio so help me god

  there were those who were listen-
ing-he could feel it-especially on
the outer fringe of the crowd boys
and men who had had no part in the
mobs original activities and purpose
 youre not attacking one man
youre attacking all of us youre
disgracing other homes 

   come on boys well duck him in
the crick  bellowed the little man
hes millers friend

  he raised his arm and struck twice
at birkland hitting him on breast and
chin

  sporadic fights were starting else-
where between members of the orig-
inal mob and some of the villagers no
doubt on one side of him some one
had lit a newspaper and was trying to
set fire to the old plank walls of the
smithy

  there was a crushing attack in that
direction and the attempt became a
scrimmage

  on birklands other side another
member of the mob had discovered a
plank that was loose and started to
pull it off a moment later he had
fallen back with a cry all but impaled
by a steel rod thrust from the interior

  then there was the blacksmith at
birklands side again it wasnt a mo-
ment for fine ethical questions as to
the propriety of choosing an antago-
nist of ones own size

  john brown signalized his return to
activity by bringing his mighty palm
down with crushing weight on top of
the derby hat the little corporal

  went down as though he had been a
peg on soft ground and hit by a
mallet

   we want miller came a raucous
voice on an alcoholic gale

  birkland saw a revolver with a
general background of handkerchief
and mustache he and john brown
had grabbed at the weapon both at
the same time there was a report

  it felt to birkland as though one
of his fingers had been blown away-
as a matter of fact he was merely
burned and slightly nicked-but he
caught the revolver as it fell the
blacksmith had seized the fellows arm

   it was that shot then a shriek

  youve broken my arm

   thats what i wanted to do said
the blacksmith

  birkland held up the revolver in his
wounded hand there was little light
torches had been abandoned several
of the lanterns had gone out altogether
or were flickering dimly kicked about

  how long would it last the whole
thing had lasted but a few seconds
that he knew

  simultaneously with his movement
and his thought came the diversion
that he was unconsciously praying for

  there was an eddy of movement a
new vortex of sound off to the left
and he saw that out of the night some
one had arrived in a buggy he caught
a glance of a thin-necked horse with
its head held high then of a bearded
man striking to left and to right and
getting no blows in return

  erom the rim of the crowd a dozen
voices clamored the news

    its the sheriff 

  then the man himself declared the
fact

    im sheriff of this county

   then he raised his voice still louder

   grab one or two of them bill
before they get away 

  there was a stampede

  only the man with the broken arm
was left behind - and him only be-
cause he was too sick to run the
little man with the derby hat might

have been caught only in that mo-i
mentous fraction of a second the
blacksmith was engaged in giving him
a kick in the region where a kick is
most likely to induce speed

   it induced speed this time-the little
corporal was off like a scared rabbit
rope and all

    boys said the sheriff addressing
birkland and the blacksmith indiffer-
ently  it pears i got here a little
late

  there was a minute or so of con-
fusion and then they were crowding
into the smithy it was cavernous and
dark

  hey miller cried mr brown
 heres the sheriff

  no voice answered him

  cyrus f miller was gone

chapter xl

the one great thing

woure a hero said mary as
she corked the arnica-bottle on
the following afternoon and brought
birklands bandaged hand lightly to
her cheek  ah i almost wish that
you were still more badly hurt-nos
i dont mean that-so that i could
take still greater care of you

   what if id been crippled for
life asked birkland with a quiz-
zical smile merely wondering what
she would say

   oh i should have loved it-you
know what i mean-to be your nurse
your mother your-your-

   i know birkland answered
softly my-my-everything

  he used his hurt hand this time
to draw her closer to him knowing
that it would furnish her sufficient ex-
cuse if one were needed for not
resisting overmuch

  she had given him the news from
hambleton

  it appeared that little mrs camp-
bell in searching through her hus-
bands effects had at last discovered
a paper that had made it abundantly

clear that cyrus f miller was impli-
cated in the dead bankers peculations
if not actually the instigator of them

  it had begun by illegal loans-to
miller-and then miller had used
these very loans as a club to force the
banker on down the crooked path
the word had gone abroad and late
that evening the mob had formed

   youre a hero she repeated
 the sheriff says that if it hadnt
been for you there would have been
one of those horrible lynchings

   john brown did more than i did
you and mr brown but youve
shed your blood in defense of a princi-
ple such actions never fail to do
good in the world-to bring their own
reward

  birkland laughed

   i lost an opportunity rather i
had the measly rascal where i wanted
him-luck threw him into my hands
i could have settled the matter of the
hearthstone at least once and for all
but i let him get away

   that doesnt matter she con-
soled him with conviction  the
great thing is to act always as though
you had the thing you wanted-thats
the real test of strength and faith
thats what youve done youll see
-ah cant you see that all the happi-
ness and wealth and power in the
world is ours already that the great
plan is working out

   yes birkland whispered as she
forgetful of herself in her seriousness
lifted her face to his

  as a matter of fact it did seem
that events were shaping themselves
for the good-that the plan as mary
called it was beneficent in its general
drift whatever the incidental features
of it might appear

  miller was gone-good riddance of
a bad neighbor

  so much of a blight removed from
future peace and happiness so birk-
land figured it he could never have
been perfectly content with a neigh-
bor like that soiling the landscape and
atmosphere

    then one day he got a letter from
 amos t merriman julias father
 birklands heart missed a beat as there
 fell from the envelope a check for
 thity-one hundred dollars the old
 gentleman explained succinctly that
 he had made a  killing  in ice and
 that he was merely returning birk-
 lands principal and his share of the
 profits

   great heavens and he had per-
 mitted himself to harbor doubts about
 the future

   as he stood there with the check in
 his hand some trick of the imagina-
 tion transformed marys philosophy
 into something that he could visualize

   milldale butler county ohio the
 united states the world at large in-
 finity-these were the heritage of the
 optimists the deed to their posses-
 sion was faith-the ability as mary
 had said  to act always as though
 you had the thing you wanted faith
 had started him out from new york
 it had given him this check it had
 given him mary

   it was the one great thing and on
 this he would build his home and his
 future

he acted on this clear vision with-
out delay he hitched up dan and
 drove into hambleton and there hired
a carpenter and a maspn winter was
breaking

   there were evidences of an early
 spring work on the old house could
 begin at once

   then he drove down to the grand
 hotel and called out the porter the
 negro came with a shuffle and a grin
 he and birkland had become better
 acquainted

    ambrose said birkland  ive
 been thinking over what you said
 about wanting to work in the country
 when can you begin  

    does you mean when i can begin
 boss  

   ambrose was still trying to smile
 but his emotions were getting the
 better of him he had long been har-
 boring thoughts of marriage

   yes ill want a god strong man
for a lot of hard work-looking after
the horse raising some vegetables and
com

   con  cried ambrose softly
and he repeated the word with a rising
quaver quite as though the word con-
veyed some promise that was too good
to be true  con oh lawdy mis-
tah birkland jest see this nigger in de
vineyard 

  birkland drove on around to the
woods home he had been saving
this part of his days activities to the
last

  luella opened the door for him he
gave her a hasty hug and a kiss saw
mary appear in the hall without an
instants hesitation he advanced and
threw both arms about her kissing her
also as luella watched first with
amazement then with skipping joy

   when are you going to marry
me   he demanded without other pre-
liminary  dont run away luella
this is a family affair when he
persisted  to-day to-morrow next
week or when the first spring flowers
are in bloom  

  oh henry

  youve found your hearthstone
she thrilled

no he answered im taking
your advice-acting as though i had
 then youll be sure to have it

  when

   some day soon i know it will
turn up-

  no i mean-when-will-you-
marry me  

  with his arms about both luella
and mary he led them into the parlor
mother woods was away at a meeting
of the ladies of her church major
woods had not yet returned from the
law-office where he still made a pre-
tense at business there was ample
time for discussion

   and now dear little luella said
birkland you go over to the piano
and play all the prettiest pieces that
you know

   i make a good many mistakes

found found at last

cpring coming on and the miami
valley with the rest of the
northern hemisphere was getting ready
to perform the annual miracle-play

  it might have been merely due to
his changed outlook on life or it might
have been due to the actual betterment
in his prospects but as birkland went
about his daily work he felt for the
first time in his life that he was in
partnership with everything about
him

  during his early struggles in new
york he had often envied those men
who possessed  influence -men in
touch with the  big interests the
great banks and the great corporations

  he was becoming master now of
another sort of influence-an influ-
ence compared with which the sort he
once envied was a most trivial thing
he was in touch with something
greater than any millionaire or any in-
stitution he was in touch with some-
thing that was superhuman it was
the primal cause

  he knew it-the thing that was in-
forming nature was informing his own
life and he acted accordingly

  he and mary were to be married
the first week in april he was pro-
ceeding with his arrangements for this
event as calmly and confidently as the
cottonwoods and willows were pre-
paring for their own part in the spring
pageant

  the rock-chimney was rising in its
place

  there was a wide porch around the
house the paths that he and mary
had laid out were being smoothed and
graveled trees and bushes were ar-
riving by the dozen from the nursery

and were being set out each in its
proper place

  there was a rock-garden with a
fountain in it a magic day would
come-before very long now-when
the flowers would bloom and the
sparkling water leap into the air

  dan went about his work with per-
fect patience a perfect understanding
-apparently-what it was all about
how solemn it was and important

  and it was with the same patience
the same sense of importance but with
a degree of more manifest enthusiasm
that mr ambrose white went about
his part of the labor for there was a
small house-white folks would have
called it a bungalow-newly built
back by the wood-lot and already
there were morning-glory seeds in the
clean and fecund earth at the side
of it

  ambrose had secretly decided upon
the same day in april for his own
nuptials some day he told himself
there would be piccaninnies running
about these fields and fishing for tooth-
some catfish in the branch

  there were two things that might
have caused birkland worry - that
might at any rate have put a couple
of drops of gall into the ambrosia of
this new life of his

  one of these was hi financial con-
dition by careful management he
would be able to live on what he had
without the necessity of looking for a
job

  he was a poor man judged by the
standards he had built up for himself
and to which he still adhered only a
few months back

  it surprised him at times to find
himself so calmly looking the future
in the face thinking big thoughts
planning big things despite this handi-
cap but even when he tried to he
couldnt get rid of the sense of abun-
dance that he would have all that he
needed and that when lie needed it
the necessary money would appear

  there was a material basis for this
feeling


all-story cavalier weekly

  he was getting more encouraging
letters from bruce howland of late
bruce had been making a long uphill
fight and was winning out

  he had taken the three thousand
dollars that birkland had sent back to
him and bought with it for birklands
account-so he said-as much of the
stock as he could that birkland him-
self was offering

   you showed faith in me old
man he wrote  when the world was
pronouncing me a rotten risk now
ive got faith in myself faith in the
susquehanna-

  birkland sent back a telegram-
 stick to your faith and god bless
you

  but even without the susquehanna
there was wealth enough for every
one right there in the miami valley
-the countless billions of cells each
one a wealth-factory that went to
make up organic and inorganic nature
it made birklands head swim to think
of the opportunities that lay waiting
for him at his door

  the other thing that might have
caused him worry but did not was
the matter of the missing hearthstone

  that was the one detail of the re-
juvenated old home that remained un-
finished he had lacked the heart-
or the indifference-to put in another
stone as yet	r

  he fought the matter over in his
mind especially at night often he
would get up in the morning de-
termined to settle the matter once and
for all by putting the new hearthstone
into place if the old one appeared
later on no harm done-that would be
time enough for a change

  but he could never quite bring him-
self to carry this plan into execution

  a thousand subtle advocates would
appear to bid him stay-some forgot-
ten sight or smell or association that
would bring the whole world of spirit
and imagination into pulsing life the
very feel of the air around him
waking in the back of his brain the
loves and aspirations of boyhood

  and then once more birkland
would recognize that this particular
piece of stone was not only a symbol
that he sought but a talisman

  he discussed the matter at length
with john brown the blacksmith who
was a kindred spirit and could under-
stand-told him what miller had said
about it the night he fled

   said he sold it did he  he could
hardly have made that up-not with
that mob at his heels

   yet who would have bought it 
 it might have made a tombstone
no-it couldnt have been that-not
harris at any rate harris has a
quarry of his own except for fancy
granite and marble

   it might have been bought as a
geological specimen

   thats right-there was a pro-
fessor around here some years ago
picking at the rocks

  he followed these clues with no great
hope twice he hitched up dan and
mary at his side visited the cemeteries
for miles around

  once he drove to oxford ten miles
away where there was a university
and talked to the professor of geology
there even his disappointment on
these occasions was tinged with a sort
of melancholy pleasure he was neg-
lecting nothing-was doing what he
ought to do

  then one evening in the middle
of march he had a sudden pulse-
quickening premonition that all was
well

  he was walking from the post-of-
fice to aunt miriams at the time he
stopped in his tracks and wondered
what it was he knew that this feel-
ing that had swept in upon him was
not due to ordinary causes mary had
been waiting for him on other eve-
nings than this on other evenings
the air had been exhilarating cool
spiced with the perfumes of stirring
life

  he hurried back to the shore-road
how beautiful his home looked there
in the glamouring dusk
the lost hearthstone



  a moment later he was hailed by
the voice of ambrose white

   hey mistah birkland weve
found yo hearthstone 

chapter xlii

out of the shadows

ymbrose wasnt alone he was
accompanied by a thin wraith of
a figure whom birkland immediately
recognized

  it was the imbecile pauper who had
formerly worked for cyrus f miller
sight of him brought with it a meas-
ure of revelation birklands thought
flew to the hill where millers house
had formerly stood

  ever since the night the mob had
visited the place and miller had fled
it had remained deserted - lonely
haunted hideous ashes charred wood
crumbling brick and twisted metal
where the prim house and stables had
been poultry scattered no one knew
where the body of that belligerent
dog somewhere in the ruins the three
horses and a cow that had been
millers  boarded out  until the day
that the sheriff should sell them to pay
the cost of their  keep

  that was where the hearthstone
must be in his supreme moment
with sudden death clamoring at his
heels miller had been true to the
habits of a lifetime and had lied
that was the truth

  ambrose explained that late that
afternoon he had seen the pauper
poking round in the ruins and had
watched him wondering what he was
about then he had seen the man try-
ing to lift a weight from among the
debris that half filled the cellar of the
house it was the hearthstone

  ambrose recognized it from having
heard birkland speak about it

   he started fer to run away said
ambrose with a touch of legitimate
pride  but i says  no sir you
come along wif me mistah birk-
landll want to talk wif you i says

  did he kick asked birkland

  no sir he didnt ject any

  birkland looked at the pauper he
stood there mouth open indifferent as
one who bears his honors lightly it
was getting dark

   what did you want there  
birkland asked gently

  the man squirmed like a bashful
child murmured something looked
over his shoulder

   he says as how he wants to go
back there ambrose interpreted

   get your lantern ambrose and
come in birkland ordered

  he wouldnt allow himself to get
excited-wouldnt admit the emotion
that was knocking at the doors of his
heart not yet there might be a mis-
take yet all the time he was hearing
the rising voices of that invisible choir
of his-the one that had rustled its
wings on a certain other evening that
time when he had first kissed mary
harmon

  they traversed the old orchard
made their way up over the darkening
hillside still silent they entered the
haunted precinct and clambered with
precaution into the odorous littered
cellar-the pauper the negro the man
who had risked his all to find this
thing	

  a great hush fell momentary
secular

  then ambrose with a gurgling ex-
pression of satisfaction had dropped
on one knee was holding the lantern
close

  birklands knees were trembling
his heart was like a castle besieged
by this time battered almost at the
point of giving away there was no
mistake

  even had his senses failed him fhere
would still have been no chance for
mistake his very soul was pro-
claiming the thing

  here was the hearthstone

  ambrose was busy with one of his
padded efficient palms brushing the
ashes away birkland knelt beside
him


all-story cavalier weekly

    detail after detail came into view-
 each one signaling an incident or an
 epoch in his life here was the string
 of  lozengers  he had traced time
 and again into the mysterious depths
 of the rock like a little chain of
 events that would end-who could see
 where and how

    praise god  crooned ambrose

    little  curlicues  appeared tiny
 fossils of a life long since extinct

	vibrant still with that other life which
  living they had never known

     oh praise his name  breathed
 the negro his emotion breaking into
 incipient song

   the imbecile behind them stirred
 from his trance and mumbled softly
 incoherently but neither birkland nor
 ambrose paid attention

   as the ashes were brushed away
 there appeared an area more polished
 than the rest-polished birkland rec-
 ollected with a fresh catching at his
 heart by a blessed human contact that
 this stone brought back to him made
 his again to have as long as he lived

    his fathers knees had rested here
 as he knelt in the holy domestic serv-
 ice of lighting the fire his mother had
 swept it and scoured it kept it sweet
 and clean his brothers and sisters
 had played there with him the soles
 of his bare feet knew the warm
 smooth comfort of it

   and there came back to birkland
 the slap of warm water and the smell
 of castile soap an evocation of his
 mother giving him on such a night as
 this a warm bath before sending him
 off to his dreams

     mr birkland said ambrose  i
 jes feel like singin a hymn now
 you got two hearthstones

    you can have the other one
 said birkland stifled  you and
 priscilla will want a new one-for
 you and your children and your chil-
 drens children

    ambrose was cleaning out a little
 hollow it surrounded a  trolobite 
 that birkland recognized he and
 lem had worked long with their dull

old barlows to dig it out of the em-
bedding rock

  then birkland remembered another
detail he had not forgotten it com-
pletely even now through the stress
of all those othr crowding memories
it had hovered near elusive yet ready
to assert its claim

   this corner ambrose he whis-
pered  brush it off here

  then he saw it-like a smile of one
of the spirit presences around him
suddenly materialized it came to him
-the mark that he himself had
carved there with such secret love and
yearning the dim beginning of a
letter  m

  there came to him now a passion of
energy a sort of leaping eagerness to
hasten this long long dream of his
to final realization 

   come on ambrose he cried
 well lift it up get it out of here
every wasted moment had become
a moment of desecration

  the stone was lying flat only a
slight hollow under one corner of it
-made by the pauper that afternoon
no doubt but as birkland started
to lift the imbecile once more showed
signs ef excitement mumbled inco-
herently

   theres something under it said
ambrose

  like many of his race he had an
uncanny faculty for reading the
thoughts of all dumb creatures
well see said birkland

  they bent their strength to it even
the pauper assisting more excited still
the stone came up

  as it did so birkland and the negro
each let out a cry of surprise 

chapter xliii

hidden treasure

he stone had been made the cover
of a home-made safe a primitive
safety-deposit vault in a rudely
bricked receptacle under it were stacks
and stacks of paper currency
the lost hearthstone

ill

  even in that first glance birkland
saw that many of the sheafs of bills
were still bound with paper bands
stamped with the name of the ham-
bleton national bank

    go tell the village said birkland
 tell mr brown tell the justice of
the peace tell- for the first time his
voice quavered slightly -  tell miss
harmon then ask mr bowers to
telephone for the sheriff quick 

   ambrose gone at a loping run

  birkland and the pauper eased the
old hearthstone back on its edge
against the cellar wall stone and pau-
per each so mute and mysterious his
only witnesses birkland raised his
eyes to where a blue star joyful and
majestic flamed in the cloudless sky

  the village came out-john brown
hatless still in his leather apron for
he had been working late the thin man
with the large adams-apple mr
bowers the inn-keeper the boy wil-
lie and all the other boys large and
small the justice of the peace the
foreman of the creamery the baptist
methodist and presbyterian minis-
ters  then horses and buggies with
girls and women an occasional auto-
mobile

   marys eyes were brilliant

  she had little to say-little that
could be said in front of a crowd but
birkland noticed how much more
beautiful she was than any other wom-
an there young or old

   it became a celebration

  they lighted bonfires boys and
girls began to pair off or to form lit-
tle groups apart and naively to talk
of other things for the spirit of
spring was already in the air and
apart from that flaming star and its
lesser sisters there was a white moon
 in the east

  then some one suggested supper
and because no one was quite certain
what should be done it was decided
that the men should remain and that
the ladies would bring out coffee and
food

  it was after nine oclock when the

sheriff arrived for he had elected to
come not alone there were other
county officers and lawyers in the
band

  milldale stood around while the
money was counted-one hundred and
sixty-five thousand dollars

   and every cent of it said the
lawyer representing the wrecked bank
 the property of the depositors

   minus your fees jo laughed the
sheriff minus your fees

  and so it turned out after not very
much litigation for a few weeks
later at the time of the first spring
freshet two little boys who had gone
far down the branch on an expedition
after muskrats found that which sent
them scurrying back home for their
elders

  it was the body of cyrus f miller
and he had been drowned or frozen or
had died of exhaustion perhaps that
night he had fled from the mob

  birkland and mary had slipped
away at last from the rest of the
crowd were walking home by way of
the path that would take them through
 their place

  as they crossed the wall and stood
on the more familiar ground it was as
though some special essence came up
from it to bid them welcome both of
them noticed it no doubt a tender
silence fell upon them

   there is no loyalty like that of the
earth mused birkland  however
many owners have ever walked upon
it each feels the same mighty un-
grudging devotion no wonder that
the love of the earth becomes a pas-
sionate thing the most deep-seated
the most lasting the most sacred-
one of his hands had been lifted to
contact with a cool smooth cheek and
with warmer lips

  it startled him what a fool he
was what would this land be the
house the hearthstone without this
crowning glory of them all

  they stopped where they were for a
little while

  the great star flamed with perfect


all-story cavalier weekly-

acceptance of the rising moon the
waters of the branch rippled a whis-
pered chorus to the minor song of the
night the old apple-trees who had
seen things like this before no doubt
looked on approvingly

  suddenly there was a burst of cheer-
ing back in the direction from which
they had just come-jubilant almost
musical

  oh see whispered mary
 theyre coming this way too

  they watched and listened with
bated breath	l

  scattered lights had drawn together
again they heard laughter and sing-
ing-the opening phrases of  way
down upon the suwannee river all
tangled up with  my country tis of
thee then more laughter and cheers
yet in spite of this vocal levity there
was a certain dignity in the slow ad-
vance

  then they understood

   theyre bringing the hearthstone
thrilled mary

   theyre bringing the hearthstone
birkland echoed

  john brown and ambrose white
were the principal bearers but they
were aided-whether they needed it or
not-by a hundred willing hands

  birkland with mary pulsing at his
arm felt his knees get weak the old
lump come back in his throat

  the crowd saw them standing there
and cheered and sang

   were bringing her home mr
birkland john brown shouted
 were going to put her where she be-
longs

  more cheers

  every one was there the justice of
the peace and the ministers included
for the affair had their enthusiastic
sanction birkland and mary found
themselves escorted at the head of the
procession by men and women boys
and girls who sang and laughed

  at the side of them marched john
brown and ambrose white bearing
the precious burden and the old stone
stirred and sent back a reflected sheen

as though it were conscious of the cele-
bration

  careful now folks dont break
anything john brown shouted as
they entered the little park

   be careful - dont break any-
thing a dozen voices echoed

  they came to the door of the house
and entered the blacksmith and the
negro gently put the old hearthstone
down in front of the fireplace then
straightened up and looked around

  the place was filled lit up by many
lanterns the men and boys had taken
off their hats an odd embarrassed
silence fell upon them for an instant
or two no one spoke

  then the rev mr hargitt and the
rev mr hall looked at their senior
the rev mr cross

   brother cross they said  will
you lead us in prayer

chapter xliv
on this rock

there appeared a bucket of cement
and a trowel and the stone was
fitted into place birkland and mary
each having a hand in the work - a
good deal as a king and a queen might
assist at the laying of a cornerstone

  then mr brown appeared with his
brawny fists filled with shavings and
pine sticks and birkland with a trem-
bling hand put them into place and
touched a match to them

  the flame caught-brightly almost
gratefully it seemed-and up from this
new-old altar of domestic concord and
happiness there went a crackling peti-
tion to the guardian-angels of such
things

  a new home was bom and birk-
land saw this light reflected in the eyes
oof the woman he was going to marry

  willie and the other boys brought in
more wood the new chimney was
doing nobly how could it have done
otherwise 

  the justice of the peace stepped for-
ward
the lost hearthstone



    feller citizens he began

   and ladies some one supple-
mented

   theyre feller citizens too said
the squire amiably  but what i
wanted to get at was this we got in
our midst to-night cheers  some
one who-some one who-

  the squires voice rose

  he was contemplating a flight of
eloquence he turned his head a
little to one side looked at the ceiling
momentarily words failed him the
ministers and some of the ladies en-
couraged him by clapping their hands

  the squire bowed in acknowledg-
ment

   now as i was about to say he
went on i remember--re-mem-
ber-r-r  fresh cheers and sounds of
sh-h when this-this party
who we have in our midst-was the
first to raise his hand-in support of
law and order thats right isnt it
mr brown  

   thats right said the black-
smith stoutly

  fn other words feller citizens
the squire said hastening on to his
conclusion  weve got-wete got 
oratorical pause a new feller
citizen in our midst i want-

  the squires closing words were
lost in the outburst of applause as he
smiled at birkland and with rough
geniality poked him in the ribs

  birkland had never made a speech
in his life-except privately or at the
most before a group of his own direct-
ors he was a little embarrassed

  but as he confronted the kindly
good-natured crowd in front of him
this embarrassment was engulfed in
other feelings

  there flashed through his brain an
epitome of all that he had undergone
all that he had hoped for-his pas-
sions his plans and his dreams

  he was standing at last on the
hearthstone-smooth and warm-of
his own home the woman he loved
was there at his side these people
were his neighbors his friends

      a-s c

    i wish i could make a speech he
said softly as sudden silence once
more swept over the room  you
folks are mighty good youve added
the supreme touch to a great event
this is my home the minister has
called down a blessing on it the
blessings here youve air helped it
to come about

  he was going to stop at that but
every one applauded and the squire
and the ministers were among those
who urged him to go on

    friends he said  were here to-
night with such perfect understanding
because we have so much in common
some of us still have our fathers and
mothers with us some of us are
orphans but each one of us way
down deep in the bottom of his or her
heart had the same thing planted
there at the beginning of life by some
sainted woman

   you know what it is

   even a man doesnt have to be
told what

    a woman with a little baby in her
arms-the future squire the future
blacksmith the future minister-but
helpless toothless a little mass of pure
flesh and spirit and oh how she pours
into it her yearning for peace for
plenty for right living for high
ideals

    thats the way the home-spirit is
born for these things are the elements
of home

  shall i stop asked birkland
quite suddenly with a smile

  the older ladies especially shook
their heads most of the younger
-people were listening absorbed sur-
prised open-mouthed

    then just this in conclusion we
can wander far we can go after
other things - after power after
money after fame but greater than
our desire for these things is that
holy primal passion implanted there
not by one mother only but by the
lord knows how many generations of
mothers ahead of her the wanderer
turns back the spirit-voice of his

heart bids him put up a temple to this
religion of the worlds good women

  many of the ladies present pinked
up pleasurably at that in acknowledg-
ment of the compliment there was
brief applause

   a temple it is said birkland

   indeed it is brother said the
rev mr hargitt

   and god defend it  said the
rev mr hall

  brother cross the elder of the
three nodded his head in solemn
affirmation

   and out from it to sweeten and
enrich the earth birkland resumed
 there drifts the spirit of that woman
with the baby in her arms her yearn-
ings become a power-for peace for
plenty for right living and for high
ideals 

  john brown and the squire shook
each other by the hand

   so birkland concluded  herq
with my feet on this rock on this old
hearthstone i-i sort of feel that its
an altar dedicated to such things-for
the good of milldale for the good of
miami valley for all mankind

conclusion

there have been years of happi-
ness and accomplishment since
then piccaninnies dodging about-
five or six-no one ever knows ex-
actly how many except mr and mrs
ambrose white the new electric rail-
way paying dividends the creamery
become a large and prosperous coop-
erative plant the youngest fruit-trees
beginning to bear the fountain and
the rock-garden graced and beautified
by a first growth of lichens and moss

  even birklands house has grown

  the old part-the most important
part-is still unchanged but now it is
the wing of a rather stately but old-
fashioned dwelling the very simplicity
of which bespeaks the work of a high-
priced architect

  in this new part of the house there
are music-rooms and drawing-rooms
guest-chambers boudoirs and dens-
all very nice when theres entertaining
to be done which is pretty often for
when luella or mary are not giving
something or other the house is being
loaned to the ladies of the church or
the foresters or the maccabees

   but it is in the old part of the house
that birkland and mary love to pass
their hours together when they are
alone

  there mary takes her place at the
center-table with the yellow lamplight
flooding her shimmering hair accen-
tuating the softened beauty of her
face-that beauty which comes to
women who are happy and which
grows with years

  and birkland even when the nights
are warm and there is no excuse for a
fire still takes his place on the old
hearthstone

  with his feet on that and his eyes
on mary-and always that same
vague hunger in his heart - his
thoughts soar off into the clouds
there and like that he has always
dreamed his greatest dreams and
worked out their execution

  there was the matter of children
for example

  they adopted luella but soon in
a general way they were adopting all
the children of the countryside or-
phaned or otherwise

  then birkland built another and
larger home on the hill where cyrus f
miller used to live made it something
of a monument to consecrate the
aground where the hearthstone had
lain in exile and there started an en-
terprise that he and mary have ever
since delighted in-changing the bad
luck of still other children into good

  every year when he and mary go
to new york-where birkland at-
tends the annual directors meeting of
the susquehanna-they pick out an
additional quartet two girls and two
boys two of them ugly and two of
them handsome
the lost hearthstone	v 

   and it pleases them mightily when
 after a year or so the ones that they
 thought were ugly surprisingly out-
 grow that claim

   growing old

   there is no age in surroundings like
 that

   witness old major woods-white
 growing deaf more patriarchal still
 with his snowy beard and flowing
 mane-but he still comes out to mill-
 dale to visit sarahs boy plants the
 heels of his boots on the old hearth-
 stone and leaning back in his favor-
 ite chair dreams himself into the mys-
 tic past until the past is the present
 and he is a youth again

   julia merriman-married happily
 bringing with her a small and chubby
 edition of herself-has been their
 guest

    did he tell you that-i loved you
 before i ever saw you asked julia

    yes thrilled mary with an im-
 pulsive kiss

   bruce howland has been there sev-
 eral times

    by gad hen he exclaimed the
 last time that he was out  you know
 this would be great if-if it werent so
 far from new york

    new york would be all right if it
 werent so far from-from this
 birkland answered quickly with a grave
 smile

   bruce looked out over the superb
 garden the soaring trees the new
 head gardener of the birkland place
 was an importation from the bonnie
 river wye some sort of a forty-second
 cousin to hawkins-who by the way
 was still writing regularly was still
 doing finely and god bless you sir

    its so beautiful and yet-and
 yet- said bruce with a troubled face

    and its home  cried birkland
  do you know what that means-
 h-o-m-e no i suppose not youll
 discover your valley of peace like
 most new yorkers only when you-
 hold on valley of peace peace val-
 ley-by gad bruce a name ive been
 trying to remember 

  and birkland wrote a letter to will
lovetts peace valley missouri re-
calling that night on the banks of the
hudson when they were both home-
ward-bound  when will had taken in a
certain stranger fed him cheered him
up and had sung to him a wonderful
song

  in less than a week an answer came

  will wrote

dear frend

  o i was glad to hear from you o how
happy i was to no who slipped me that fifty

   there was a photograph in the letter
a fairly good snap-shot of a happy
family group in a buggy-a brand-new
buggy to which was hitched a clean-
limbed roadster with beautiful lines

  birkland recognized will imme-
diately

  he was a little stouter but other-
wise he hadnt greatly changed his
shrewd and kindly face was still the
face of a man who would play tlje
guitar in his family circle and compose
his own songs

  mrs lovetts of generous propor-
tions was at his side her eyes mani-
festly on two dressed-up healthy
youngsters squatting at the dashboard
her ample arms enfolding  the latest

  little henry had moved unfor-
tunately his features were not very
distinct still he gave out an impres-
sion of baby fatness and good cheer

  in due time the present came-

rious two-year-old of kentucky strain

the girl in the doorway

sejor guerrero led the way
down the dark and narrow alley
and softly opened the door the
man behind him waited close to the
wall

  a shaft of light pierced the dark-
ness with it came the sound of
strong voices raised in ribald song and
the tinkling of a piano scarcely heard
above the din

  feet shuffled liquor gurgled glasses
rang as they were placed on the tables

  foul air rushed out bearing odors
of stale tobacco - smoke and cheap
liquor in an instant the clean smell
of water - soaked pine was gone and
the breeze that swept up the street
from the river and the distant sea
seemed instantly polluted

   the coast i think is clear senor
guerrero whispered

  he slipped inside and captain bill
adams followed and stood against the
wall for a moment while guerrero
closed the door behind them

  captain adams had a soft hat pulled
down to his eyes and his eoat collar
turned up in an attempt to pass with-
out being recognized there was no
disguising his broad shoulders great
hands and massive form yet the risk
was small for those men in the room
who knew him were scattered in the
crowd or sitting at tables near the
street door

  adamss lips curled in scorn as he
followed guerrero along the wall to
a table in a far corner at which there
were two chairs both unoccupied

  as he sat down he glanced over the
room

  there was a bar along one wall
with a crowd of men before it there
were scores of tables to which silent-
footed chinese carried liquor on a
platform in one corner was an old
piano a woman playing it another
woman stood beside her and sang in
a cracked voice

  in another corner were poker-tables
where the players silently eyed one
another speaking in low voices only
when it was necessary there were
wild norene



faro-tables and roulette-tables and
there were women who mingled in the
throng painted women dressed in
gaudy gowns

   it is a place said captain adams
slowly and with conviction  where a
man would expect to find a traitor

  strong men of the sea called adams
king he was a relic of the days of
bucko mates he had slain a man
with a single blow of his fist he had
quelled mutiny single-handed

  his name was a synonym for fear
from valdez to cape horn in hono-
lulu in the ports of china and japan
australia and the south seas

  that name also was coupled with
justice for captain adams never gave
a demonstration of brute force with-
out good and sufficient provocation

  he always showed his strength at
sea never on land the usual haunts
of sailonnen did not know him he
left his ship only to transact business
he was an abstainer and morally
clean

  because he never appeared in a
gathering to refute them seamen told
great tales of his strength and brutal-
ity when provoked thus making his
reputation in that regard thrice what
he deserved

  now he bent forward at the table
his keen eyes taking in the scene be-
fore him guerrero had ordered
liquor and as soon as the chinese
waiter had gone captain adams had
thrown his in a cuspidor

  if our suspicions prove true-
guerrero began

   well say nothing until we are
certain the captain interrupted  its
a bad thing to accuse a man of unless
there is an abundance of proof

   and if we get the proof 

  captain adams straightened his
shoulders and waited a moment before
replying

  if we get the proof ill attend to
the matter personally he said  you
are not concerned in it senor except
that you are a sort of guide for me
ashore

  not concerned in it exclaimed
the other hoarsely  not concerned
in it when there may depend on it
success or failure

   screech senor and tell our busi-
ness to the world the captain advised
 there are some in this place i be-
lieve who would be glad to hear

   i beg your pardon guerrero said
and fell silent

  captain adams looked over the
room again the woman at the piano
had ceased playing and was standing
at the end of the platform talking
with some men she was tall grace-
ful and fair despite her painted face
but there were lines about her eyes
and a wistful look was about her lips
 what a place  adams gasped

   sailors must have relaxation after
a long voyage suggested guerrero

   this isnt relaxation they spend
two months wages here in a night
drinking vile liquor trying to beat
gambling games that cannot be beaten
ive been a sailor for thirty years and
i dont need this sort of relaxation
and the women-

   that tall one who was playing the
piano is sally wood said guerrero
 every one in astoria knows her
she has a history

   i dont doubt it

   not the sort you think senor
she lived in seattle as a girl a man
won and married her then he took
her aged fathers savings and deserted
her left her penniless with a baby-
the old story

   and she turned to this sort of
thing 

   again senor not as you think
she turned to this sort of thing be-
cause she can play a piano and be-
cause she gets more money here in a
night than she could any place else in
a month the sailors worship her
senor sometimes when she plays
they throw silver and gold on the plat-
form showers of it and she thanks
them prettily

   pity she wouldnt take her silver
and gold and get out of here then


all-story cavalier weekly

   she stays because she needs much
silver and gold every one seems to
know the story she is laying it by
when she has an adequate amount
she intends trailing the man who de-
serted her and when she finds him-
ah seiior when she finds him such
a woman will know how to take her
revenge

   her child is a girl-she keeps the
little one in a school i admire sally
wood seiior she mingles here with
the scum of the earth yet is not defiled
she is a good girl countless men will
tell you so countless men would
fight for her in an instant to avenge
an insult they know her story tell
it to every newcomer help her in
every way

  captain adams showed sudden in-
terest

   if that story is true if she is a
good girl and can mingle with this
sort and keep her goodness for such
an object i pray heaven she finds the
man he said earnestly

   there is also another story con-
tinued guerrero  there is a man
hereabouts by name jack connor a
pleasant giant a happy-go-lucky devil
of a sailorman of the usual sort he
is at present out of a place and is here
in astoria visiting his aged father
he is a favorite of men and women
he drinks with the men-but he has
no use for the women

   half sensible at any rate said
the captain

   sally wood so the story goes re-
buked him on a certain night because
he was drinking heavily the propri-
etor of this place even lets her do such
a thing as that for it delights his cus-
tomers to see one of their number the
subject of a sermon jack connor
treated the girl courteously but con-
tinued drinking if he had done as
she requested she would have forgot-
ten him since he refused to obey her
wish she loved him

   womanly said captain adams
 so she loves him  

   in her own sweet way seiior all

have noticed it her eyes follow him
continually when he is here and he
continues to treat her courteously but
that is all

   jack connor say his friends has
little use for women he respects
them - the good ones - too much to
ask one of them to share his lot he
says and the other sort he does not
respect enough to consider at all

   he has the making of a man in
him then the captain decided  sail-
orman out of a job eh i need a
couple more men

   a very devil of a fellow seiior
i have seen him i do not know of
course whether he would be the man
for our business he has an independ-
ent way about him speak of the
angels-

  voices near the door had been
raised in eager greeting the throng
parted and through it strode a man
the appearance of whom made cap-
tain adamss eyes sparkle

  more than six feet he stood with
shoulders almost the equal of the cap-
tains his hair was yellow his eyes
blue his face boyish he walked with
an easy swagger that betrayed his
agility

  such was jack connor

  friends crowded close to him voices
called to ask him what his drink
would be a bartender smiling in
welcome brought forward a private
bottle and sat it on the bar before him
and polished a glass and sat beside it

  he and his friends drank

   jack the woman-hater caught at
last one of the men shrieked in
laughter

  guerrero tapped the captain on the
shoulder

   the man who is talking the one
with his arm on connors shoulder is
his best friend a sailorman by name
morgan he whispered

   listen  the captain commanded

  there had come a flush into jack
connors face not caused by liquor
he turned toward morgan menacing-
ly but still smiling
wild norene



     hold him while i tell the story 
  morgan cried  it is too good - to
  keep

     if you open your mouth- con-
  nor began

    but laughing three of them held
  him the others in the room had
  grown quiet to listen

    morgan ran away a few paces and
  faced them

    we were walking down commer-
 cial street he said  a girl passed
 her eyes met connors my friend
 jack was done then and there 

     love at first sight ehv cried
  another

   wait morgan cried he in-
 sisted on following her think of
 that-jack connor who never looks
 at a woman oh he did it in a proper
 fashion he never took his eyes from
 y her she dropped a handkerchief-

     they always do something like
  that interrupted another

    with a roar of rage jack connor
  hurled away the men who held him
  and looked into the crowd

     understand me   he cried  the
  young lady - lady i said - dropped
  her handkerchief i ran forward and
  picked it up im not ashamed of it
  i never saw her before-i dont know
  her name

     but shes a lady-and not to be
  talked about in a crowd like this un-
  derstand me

     i walked down the street with
  her talked with her while morgan
  waited shes the sweetest girl i ever
  saw im not worthy to speak of her
  and if i am not neither are any of
  you so well drop the subject un-
  derstand  

   there was no answer no mans
 eyes met his he smiled at them again
 and motioned toward the bar the
 men crowded forward

     he strikes me as pretty much of
  a man said captain adams to guer-
  rero in their corner

    sally wood sitting at her piano
  had heard now she began playing
  furiously and some of the men near

the platform began to sing and the
noise broke out anew

  jack connor and half a dozen of
his friends made their way across the
room to a table within fifteen feet of
where captain adams and guerrero
were sitting

  the captain turned toward the wall
his back to the room and there he re-
mained talking with guerrero in
whispers until he heard his own name
mentioned it was jack connor
speaking

   the amingo is the cutest little
steam schooner that ever carried a
cargo of lumber he was saying  i
never saw her until she dropped down
the river from portland this morning
but ive heard a few things about her
and her skipper

   who hasnt   morgan asked

   if all i hear of capn adams is
true-

   you can bet it i morgan inter-
rupted and the others nodded their
heads

   then ive got to set eyes on the
old sea-dog some time hes turned
some good tricks in his day but hes
getting careless must be feeling his
age

  captain adamss shoulders straight-
ened but guerrero warned him and he
slouched forward in his chair again

 meaning just what morgan
asked

  whats his old scow doing
asked connor

   lumber portland to mazatlan
said morgan

   oh she carries a deck-load of lum-
ber all right said connor laughing
 but what she carries in her hold is
the joke

   contraband   one of the men
asked

   not so loud friend we dont
want to queer capn adamss deal
only hes getting careless i know
what hes up to and if i know it what
must persons know whose business it is
to find but he isnt carrying opium
or chinks if that is what you mean


all-story cavalier weekly

but hes got an interesting cargo all
the same

   meaning  asked morgan

   meaning it is none of our busi-
ness said connor  only id hate to
see an old sea-dog like capn adams
spend his last years in a federal
prison

  the face of captain adams flushed
then grew ashen as the meaning of the
mans words came to him

  this man knew-he knew

  and across the table senor guer-
rero muttered a good spanish oath that
has no just equivalent in english and
started to rise from his chair

  but captain adams gripped his arm
so that the bone almost snapped and
the seiior resumed his seat

   queer old fish the capn jack
connor went on  and that niece of
his- what about her i never heard
much of it

  morgan enlightened him

   they call her wild norene she is
captain adamss brothers girl and
shes lived with the capn for ten years
since her daddy died sails with him
all the time capn taught her to read
and write aboard the schooner pretty
as a picture strong as a man yet soft
as a woman and wild and untamed

  connor laughed

   she needs a man to tame her

maybe

   maybe youd like the job chuck-
led morgan

   and i could do it if i was in the
woman-taming business connor an-
swered  honestly i mean ill bet
i could make her love me-make her
promise to marry me i could tame
her so shed eat out of my hand

  again guerrero restrained the cap-
tain whispering to him that he could
wait for vengeance - that to betray
himself now meant to spoil their en-
terprise

  morgan and the others were laugh-
ing

   why she wont even look at a
man said morgan  shes waiting
to find one that measures up to her

uncle capn bill adams and sheh
have a long wait im thinkin

  if what i hear is true shell have
a long wait assented connor  wont
look at a man eh if i was in the
woman-taming business id make her
look at me pretty eh  

   like a picture said one of the
men  i really-saw her once

   im getting interested remarked
connor laughing again

   and youre gettin blamed incon-
sistent-i guess thats the right word
a few minutes ago you raised blue
blazes because we mentioned a certain
young lady in this place and now
youre not only mentioning one but
youre mentioning names

  jack connors face grew sober

   theres a difference he said
 there are but two classes of women
one class should never be mentioned
by such men as us-theyre too good
and the other class-whats the differ-
ence this niece of capn bills-this
wild norene as you call her-scarce-
ly comes under the first class

  captain adamss face grew ashen
again and he gripped the sides of the
table but made no attempt to get out
of his chair

  guerrero felt sudden fear he knew
captain adams was waiting for this
jack connor to go so far-then the
blow would fall

   for gods sake senor he whis-
pered  dont wreck our plans wait
until the other business is disposed of
then we can find this jack connor and
you can kill him hold on to your tem-
per we can find him easily hell be
about all night

  captain adamss lips were set tight-
ly he looked across the table at guer-
rero and nodded assent

   this wild norene connor was
saying  must be the other sort i
dont know what her father was but
we all know her uncle bucko mate
once he was blackbirder too
traded in human flesh his names a
terror in the south seas hes been a
smuggler he is yet hes pulling off a
wild norene



crooked deal right now and this
wild norene has been on his schooner
knows his life and how he makes his
money helps him no doubt so what
sort of a girl do you suspect her to be
too good to be mentioned in a place
like this  im sorry for the girl but-
bah 

  they nodded their heads as they
picked up the drinks a chinese had
placed on the table

  captain adams was looking straight
at guerrero and not seeing him and a
tear was rolling down the captains
cheek

  no man ever knew the pain he suf-
fered in that instant like a flash his
life was before him - his life and
norenes captain bill loved his niece
worshiped her and he realized now
how men regarded her they meas-
ured her by his standard

  but connor had been wrong

  adams never had been a blackbirder
-never had dealt in human beings he
had been honest in a way in his deal-
ings he had broken revenue laws
smuggled chinese carried arms and
ammunition to revolutionary armies
and landed them by dodging gunboats
but he had been honest in business
dealings

  and norene he thanked heaven
was innocent of it she did not know
the truth

  he had kept her with him rather
than placing her in a school because
he thought he could guard her better
so and now it appeared from this
mans talk that he had made a great
mistake

  but he felt rage at the thought that
this man could talk so he could tame
norene could he she was of the sort
to be spoken of lightly

  captain adams said nothing aloud
but he cursed bitterly in his heart and
stored up rage against jack connor the
man he had liked at a first glance

  guerrero was looking across the
table at him appealingly

   ill not spoil our plans the cap-
tain whispered to him  ill wait 

   heaven be thanked seiior i-i
was afraid after we have attended
to this other business youll-youll kill
this man  

   there are things worse than death
guerrero and this is my own affair
keep your nose out of it 

  the men at the other table had risen
and were scattering some of them re-
turning to the bar some going to
the gambling tables others crowding
about the platform where sally wood
was playing

  captain adams heard guerrero gasp
-realized that one of the men had
stopped beside him

   can i trouble you for a match 
a voice asked

  adams looked up jack connor was
smiling down upon him

  the captain got to his feet while
guerrero trembled and waited for the
outcome but captain adams had
lived a life full of experience and
could control himself even at such a
time as this he ran his hand in a
pocket and handed connor the match
for which he had asked

   thanks connor said he lit his
pipe and puffed slowly  lots of the
boys around to-night he added

   seems to be replied adams re-
suming his seat guerreros fear was
unnecessary the captain was studying
the man before him was not ready to
take vengeance yet

   sailorman   asked connor

   yes came down from seattle to
meet a friend of mine whos skipper of
a german bark going to sign on with
him the captain replied

   astoria isnt the port she used to
be but shes still some port said con-
nor  lots of queer fish float in here
theres a funny old tub in the river
now notice her

   which one   adams asked guer-
rero felt the fear again

   the letters on her stern spell

	hester  replied connor  but
thats a joke i know her once away
from the river shell be the benito and
therell be guns on her and her sailor-


all-story cavalier weekly

men will put on uniforms then shell
be a mexican gunboat her skipper
is garza capn in the mexican navy-
or what they call their navy-and hes
a secret service agent too

   why the disguise  asked the cap-
tain

   thats another joke ever hear
of capn bill adams of course you
have since youre a sailorman capn
bills old scow is in the river now and
the gunboat is watching far old bill
must be losing his cleverness

   why is the gunboat on his trail  
the captain asked

   nobody knows exactly but there
are suspicions it wouldnt be the first
time bill adams had carried arms and
ammunition marked sewing machines
but nobody dares tackle adams with-
out getting the goods on him first be-
lieve me theyd better not have a
drink no much obliged for the
match

  connor hurried away toward the
bar and the captains eyes met guer-
reros across the table

  the sehor was vastly troubled

   we must get away to-night he
whispered  great heaven every
one seems to know 

   remember what the fellow said-
nobody tackles adams without getting
the goods on him first and they
havent got the goods on me-yet 

   but the man for whom we wait-
 that man thinks we sail to-morrow
evening if he does what you think
hell do we can attend to him and get
away before daylight i can get out-
side the three-mile limit before that old
scow of a gupboat catches me

   sit as you are said guerrero  i
am watching for your man when he
comes in- ah he has arrived
the captain did not turn

   and the other   he asked

   i do not see garza yet wfe have
been watching him closely and one of
my men will trail him here your
mate is to meet garza here to-night and
tell him the cargo is aboard and when
you are to sail

  captain adamss hands gripped the
sides of the table again

   i hate a traitor and know how to
deal with one he said  what is
riney doing 

   is that his name hes looking
through the crowd now he has seat-
ed himself at a table theres no doubt
of the mans guilt

   riney had been my mate for two
years and there is doubt of his guilt
until i hear from his own lips words
that prove him to be dishonest said
the captain  you dont suppose he
can recognize me if he looks over
here

   sit as you are you are in the
shadow i am watching

  riney captain adamss mate ap-
peared nervous he arose and went
to the bar again then resumed hi seat
at the table

  in the corner of the room men were
wildly applauding sally woods music
she ceased playing when she saw jack
connor standing near the plaform and
walked over to him

 youve been drinking too much
again she accused  why do you  
 now sally im not in a mood for
a lecture to-night youve been play-
ing too much you look tired

    i get sick of it at times

  there was agony in the womans
voice connor looked down at her
with sympathy in his face it was not
sympathy she wanted to see there

   it is pretty hard on you he said
 why dont you give it up let the
scoundrel go 

   not until i find him and punish
him he took my fathers savings re-
member my father didnt-didnt
have quite enough to eat for a year be-
fore he died

  she looked away biting her lip to
keep back the tears soon she turned
toward him again trying to smile

  but jack connor was looking away
toward the opposite side of the room
an expression of unbelief was on his
face

  in that opposite wall was an open
wild norene



doorway twice as wide as an ordinary
door that led to a cheap cafe and res-
taurant where sailormen ate and paint-
ed women sometimes took their meals

  framed in it for an instant beckon-
ing him he had seen the girl he had
met in the street while with morgan
the girl whose handkerchief he had
picked up mention of whom he had
prohibited in this sorry resort

chapter ii 

defiance

cally wood had not seen the
girl who had stood for an instant
in the doorway and thought little of
it when jack connor excused himself
and hurried across the room thinking
some friend had called him

  connor made his way rapidly
around the room shaking off his ac-
quaintances who would have detained
him and reached the open doorway
he waited there for a moment until
he was sure nobody was watching
him then slipped into the other room

  she stood a dozen feet from the
doorway awaiting him in an instant
he was at her side

  you wanted me he-asked

  he looked down into her face he
regretted the liquor he had taken and
the very thought of such a girl in
such a place half sobered him but
her eyes met his without drooping and
he read in them that she was good

   perhaps wed better walk out on
the street he said this is scarce-
ly a place-

   wait she interrupted  i want
you to do something for me you
said this afternoon-

   that any time i could do you a
service you had but to let me know
i still say the same

   look through the doorway then
you see the third man from the end
of the bar-the one with the red hand-
kerchief about his neck 

   the one with the scar on his right
cheek

   yes my father gave him that
scar one day because he was impudent
he has hated my father and me since
this evening i learned of something
he said-about me

  yes

   it wasnt complimentary it was
an insult

  connors eyes met hers again and
he did not need to ask more questions
his fists clenched

   i saw him come in here a short
time ago the girl went on  and as
i passed the place the door was open
and i saw you i remembered what
you had said and took the liberty of
entering and asking you to do me a
service

   i shall do so gladly

 i want you to thrash that man
he looked at her quickly this
girl with goodness in her face
thought nothing apparently of asking
that a man be given a beating

  he looked through the doorway at
the man again

 his name is riney the girl was
saying youll thrash him for me
because of the insult he has offered  
 consider it done connor said

   but first you may walk as far as
the corner with me if you will

  he ushered her from the place put
himself at her side and they hurried
to the corner she clung to his arm
and connors heart throbbed

   i suppose you think i am a pe-
culiar girl for asking you to do such
a thing she said

   i have no right to think so no
doubt you have a good reason for it
but i would suggest if youll allow
me that this part of town-

   is no place for me  i can take
care of myself sir

  she was smiling as she spoke

  he met her eyes again half afraid
of what he might see there

  and she read his thought

   i dont want you to think that i
am a-a bad girl she whispered
 dont think please that i am used
to associating with-with-


all-story cavalier weekly

   such persons as are to be found
here myself for instance he
-asked

   i did not mean that i feel sure
you are a good man

   a woman like you would make a
saint out of a sinner he said

   here we are at the corner youd
better return now i shall know if
you do as i have asked

   when i beat him i shall remember
that he insulted you

  yes and thank you

    shall i see you again   he asked
 i dont even know your name

   does the name make much dif-
ference  she asked

    none at all

   and you want to see me again 
   yes

   perhaps to-morrow afternoon ill
be walking along commercial street
where you saw me to-day i am not
certain-

    ill watch for you then

  she held out her hand and he
clasped it

  she smiled at him again then hur-
ried away

  connor looked after her until she
had disappeared in the darkness down
the street then turned back toward the
resort

  he did not question she had
asked him to thrash a man who had
insulted her and he promised himself
to do the task well

  he did not care to know the cir-
cumstances he did not care to
remember she had entered the resort
to call him he gave her credit for
courage in doing so feeling that it
had taken courage for her to stand
there in the midst of painted women
and men who thought nothing of ap-
proaching any woman to be found
there

  when he reentered the resort he did
not see the man riney at first riney
had left the bar and crossed the room
again to sit at the table within a few
paces of guerrero and captain bill
adams

  the captain was bent over the table
in the shadow listening waiting

   garza has arrived guerrero was
whispering to him

   has he located riney yet  

   yes he is coming this way he
has nodded to riney now he sits
down beside him

  garza was wise however he and
riney regarded each other as if they
had been strangers

  garza ordered a drink and when it
arrived tossed it off then he looked
across at riney and winked

  fishing good garza asked

   great  said riney  i know a
craft whose hold is full

   shipping em south eh  

   i should guess said riney slow-
ly  that she would float out to-
morrow evening with the tide

  guerreros eyes met captain ad-
amss across the table and the captain
nodded slowly

  he had heard riney his mate
had sold him out  there was noth-
ing enigmatical about his conversation
with garza the secret-service agent
the hold was full of fish-the ship
would sail to-morrow evening with the
tide the hold was full of arms and
ammunition the amingo would start
on her voyage to the aid of revolu-
tionists in less than twenty-four
hours-that was the meaning

  captain adams stood up and so
did guerrero

  the captains rage was not of the
sort that makes a man  fly off the
handle  and  have it out guer-
rero shuddered as he looked at the
face of the old sea-dog captain ad-
ams was the sort of man who would
proceed with deliberation and refined
cruelty in such a case

  not for any amount of money
would guerrero have stood in the
shoes of mate riney

  but as adams turned to confront
the traitorous mate another man
lurched across the room and half fell
against the table at which riney and
garza were sitting
wild norene



  it was jack connor feigning intox-
ication

   look where youre going riney
growled

  keep out of the way shouted
connor

  he kicked at the table and it went
over he reached for riney who
sprang to his feet and aimed a ter-
rific blow at jack connors head and
then riney realized his mistake jack
connor was not intoxicated he
stepped swiftly to one side and his
fist crashed into the mates face

  in an instant they were at it and
every one in the room had crowded
forward making a great ring of
human bodies to watch the combat

  members of the amingos crew
were there cheering on their mate
who had a reputation as a fighter
jack connors friends were there too
and stood in the ring grinning with
delight

  they had seen connor fight before
he had punishment in his blows and
he had fistic science in addition

  the mates terrific blows struck
empty air connors fists played on the
other mans face head and breast

  slowly and surely connor was beat-
ing his antagonist down he was de-
laying the final blow purposely ma-
king riney take all the punishment he
could stand he remembered only that
the man he was beating had insulted
the girl he had met that afternoon

  rineys shipmates saw how the bat-
tle was going and edged forward it
was an axiom of the sea that captain
adamss men stood together in brawls

  a foot was thrown out connor was
tripped and as he saved himself from
sprawling on the floor a blow from
rineys fist caught him on the side of
the head and staggered him

  a roar of rage at the foul trick
came from a score of throats in an
instant the fight had become general
connors friends sprang to meet the
men frorn the amingo

  but in that last instant connors fist
stretched riney to the floor

  garza had made his escape guer-
rero hung close to the wall

  captain adams towering above the
other men watched the combat as it
raged his arms folded

  riney getting upfrom the floor
with the intention of continuing the
combat saw his captains eyes fixed on
him he recognized the coat the cap-
tain was wearing and knew that the
captain had been sitting a few feet
away while he had been talking to
garza

  riney knew well nothing but sus-
picion would bring captain adams to
such a place and he realized what
form the vengeance of the captain
would take

  he stooped and started toward the
combatants again but as several men
came between the captain and himself
he turned and darted toward the door
escaped into the night and fled toward
the water-front

  sally wood standing on the plat-
form against the end of the piano
caught sight of the mates face as he
flashed past her and to the door

  her own face turned white and she
staggered to a chair and sat down

  morgan had been beaten to the
floor and others of jack connors
friends had met with disaster the
crew of the amingo could fight con-
nor found himself almost alone in a
circle of flying fists

  his rage redoubled the odds were
not fair he threw himself into the
fray with renewed zeal

  a weight of human bodies assailed
him his foot slipped and he crashed
to the floor men were on top of him
striking him trying to choke him
some one near him was screeching
let him up tie his hands be-
hind him take him to the capn 
others of the amingos crew took
up the cry

   take him to th capn capn bill
will know what to do with the man
that smashed the mate 

  connor began fighting again as they
let him up he had heard of captain


all-story cavalier weekly

bill adams he didnt intend to let
these men crry him aboard the
amingo

  but his struggles were in vain they
fastened his hands behind him and
started him toward the alley door
half carrying him some of them
guarding the rear to prevent connors
friends from effecting a rescue

   take im to th capn  they cried

  a giant of a man stepped between
them and the door and held up a hand
stop he cried turn that man
loose 

  the sailors of the amingo gazed at
him in amazement one of them
laughed aloud another looked away
afraid to meet the skippers eyes

  why its th capn another
cried  its capn bill 

  jack connor knowing the captain
had heard his conversation earlier in
the evening regarding himself and his
niece felt something like fear clutch
at his heart for a moment as he looked
at the giant in front of him whose eyes
met his and held them

   turn him loose  the captain re-
peated

   but he beat up mate riney
capn

   i saw it turn him loose 

   he beat up th mate 

   thats why im telling you to turn
him loose  cried the captain walking
toward them  he saved me a job
i was going to beat riney up myself

  wondering at the skippers manner
his men obeyed him and jack connor
soon stood in their midst with his arms
and hands free

  senor guerrero who had been
standing beside the door hurried for-
ward and stood on tiptoe to whisper
something in the captains ear the
captain nodded his head

   go aboard men-all of you  he
commanded  round up the others
i want every one aboard in half an
hour-every one except riney 

  it was the old sea-dog giving a com-
mand the men disappeared as if by
magic influence

   as for you said the captain
stepping up to jack connor  i want
to talk to you come over in the cor-
ner

	connor followed him slowly ready
for the combat he felt sure was com-
ing

  he remembered how he had made
sport of captain bill in the captains
hearing remembered what he had said
concerning the captains niece wild
norene

  morgan on his feet again holding
one hand to a bruised and bloody face
sensed the situation and attracted the
attention of certain of connors
friends at a short distance away
they waited ready to plunge to the
rescue if captain bill adams opened
hostilities

  they had heard of captain bill
even jack connor would have diffi-
culty standing up to captain bill

  captain bill sat down at the table
and motioned connor to the other
chair guerrero reniained standing
against the wall a short distance away
wishing the captain would hurry fear-
ful for the success of their enterprise

  the mate had been unmasked gar-
za the secret-service agent knew facts
and details they might not wait
many hours before making a move

  even now when the captain was
away they might be descending upon
the ship and the few men left aboard
might be making an inspection of the
carg in the amingos hold

  youre a sailor the captain
asked connor

   yes ive got a mates ticket

   it is none of my business why youi
thrashed riney the captain went on
 im glad you did it however i had
just discovered that he was a man i
couldnt trust im minus a mate do
you want his job

  connor looked up quickly and met
the captains eyes

  youre offering me the berth
he demanded

   i am

   and to-night you sat here and
wild norene



heard me grill you and say things
about your-your niece

  captain adamss eyes flashed for an
instant then he regained his com-
posure

   im not speaking of that do you
want the job 

  connor laughed lightly

   no thanks  he replied  youd
get me aboard and beat me to death as
soon as we got to sea im taking no
chances with you after you heard what
i said this evening do you think i
am a fool and besides i dont like
the voyage youre to take i dont like
your cargo

  the captain restrained his anger and
bent forward across the table

   as to my cargo he said  that is
none of your business you are not
supposed to know anything about it
when you ship as to the other thing
you mention - youve heard whether
my word is good

   ive heard it is as good as gold
said connor

   very well i give you my word of
honor that ill not lay a hand on you
during the voyage understand does
that satisfy you and you can bring
your friend morgan along i need
another man or two

   i dont doubt your word captain
but ill decline the job with thanks
their eyes clashed again

   i want you said captain adams
 youre the sort of man i need on the
amingo im going to sail within
twenty-four hours and when i sail
youll be aboard

   i guess not 

   im a man of my word youve ad-
mitted and i give you my word right
now that youll sail with me youll
sail with me as my mate whether you
want to or not 

   i dont care to sail with any one
just now said connor remembering
the girl he had met and her half
promise that he was to see her again
 and if i did id not sail with you
ive got money and friends and as-
toria is my home port

   and even captain bill adams
cant make me sign on when i dont
want to do it you can understand
that 

chapter iii
wild norene

jhe throbbing of engines the
washing of waves came to the
ears of jack connor he opened his
eyes sitting up quickly at the same
time and in an instant was lying down
again for his head had struck sharply
against the top of the bunk

  he realized then that he was in the
forecastle of some craft

  he slipped from the bunk and tried
to stand up the vessel was rolling
and pitching connor guessed in-
stantly that she was passing out over
the bar at the mouth of the columbia
river

  he cursed softly to himself as he
put his hands to his aching head and
tried to remember what had occurred
he had risen from the chair after
hurling his defiance into the face of
captain bill adams and gone to the
bar to be joined there by morgan
and some of his friends

  as they drank they had watched
captain adams and guerrero walk
through the room and out the front
door

  connor had talked with sally wood
again for a short time but sally had
acted in a peculiar fashion sallys
face had been white and she appeared
nervous and connor had left her
afraid she was going to lecture him
again for drinking so heavily

  together with morgan and the
others he had gone to another resort
there morgan and he had seated
themselves in a corner and ordered a
chinese to bring drinks

  he had tossed his off-and that was
all he could remember

  shanghaied jack connor shang-
haied 

  connor laughed mirthlessly as he


all-story cavalier weekly

held his aching head he did not
doubt that he was aboard the amingo
that captain bill adams had won

  he found a bucket of water in a
corner and drank deeply then bathed
his head a groan caused him to
whirl around a cry escaped him
crawling out of another bunk was
morgan his friend

   you  morgan gasped  you 
   the same  said connor

   where are we  

   aboard some old hooker just
crossing the bar i should imagine
were shanghaied thats what 
morgan cursed as he made his way
toward the water-bucket

   but- he began

   it isnt a hard puzzle to solve
said connor laughing again  ill
bet were aboard the amingo

   she wasnt to have sailed for
twenty-four hours

   maybe its been twenty - four
hours replied connor  and maybe
capn bill made up his mind to sail
earlier capn bill has a habit ive
understood of changing his mind at
times take another swig of that
water and well go on deck and face
the music

   shanghaied  gasped morgan
only half able to get the idea through
his befogged brain  now by davy
jones-

   going to whip the skipper and
crew and put back into port  sneered
connor  if were shanghaied aboard
the amingo we might as well take our
medicine thats what were due to
obey capns orders until we make a
port then therell be a chance to de-
sert we might as well make the best
of it

  morgan sat down on the edge of a
bunk and held his head in his hands
connor stood before him smiling

   we alight get a chance to get
square with capn bill you know he
said  that is if we are aboard the
amingo and ill make a big bet we
are and if we are were helping
pack arms and ammunition to the

mexican revolutionists and therell be
a mexican gunboat at our heels oh
well have experience and excitement
all right and maybe get shot up and
maybe go to jail

   well be lucky if we have only
the mexican to deal with one of
uncle sams revenue cutters might
take a notion to overhaul us before
we get on the high seas

   what are we going to do  mor-
gan asked

   go on deck come on

  connor led the way they reached
the deck to discover that day was
breaking to starboard the light at
north head flashed behind was the
river and astoria

  and they were aboard the amingo
as connor had guessed

  her lights were not burning and
connor guessed they had not been
burning when the craft slipped from
the river her nose was pointed to-
ward the open sea and the throbbing
of her engines told that they were
being driven to the utmost captain
adams was barking orders and mem-
bers of the crew were hurrying about

  morgan followed at connors heels
as he led the way across the deck to-
ward the skipper there was a grin
on the face of captain adams as he
met them he stood before them
with arms folded waiting for one of
them to speak

   would you mind telling us
capn what were doing here   con-
nor asked

   sleep must have robbed you of
your wits mr connor came the
reply  you are aboard the steam
schooner amingo portland to mazat-
lan with lumber of which craft you
are first mate and your friend a mem-
ber of the crew

  oh thats it im first mate
eh

   you must have taken too much
liquor mr connor that you fail to
remember i shall be obliged to deny
you shore leave when we make port
youll ruin your health
wild norene



   would you mind telling me just
how it came about  

   delighted i offered you the berth
and you refused youll remember
when you left that resort you went
to a saloon where the proprietor is
under obligations to me he put the
old reliable knock-out drops in the
poison you ordered a couple of my
men took pity on you and your friend
and carried you aboard we didnt
want to leave you behind

  morgan took a step forward his
chin made an inviting target as he
bent toward the skipper

   and let me tell you youll suffer
for this  he cried  no man can
shanghai me and get away with it 
captain bills arm flashed through
the air there was a crack and mor-
gan stretched his length on the deck

  connor did not make a move mor-
gan should have known better he
thought shanghaied or not no man
can rebuke a ships master and expect
to go unpunished

   i am glad to see mr connor that
you take a sensible view of the mat-
ter said the captain  ill ask yoit
to take the deck presently just now
i am interested in putting three miles
of the pacific between the schooner
and-the coast

  of course you must understand
theres a little vessel in the river that
might follow us you mentioned her
last night during our interesting con-
versation

  he called a couple of the men and
ordered them to take morgan to the
forecastle for the time being and place
him in irons then faced connor again

   i said id have you for mate and
ihave you he announced  i am a
man of my word i suppose you won-
der why 

   because i smashed your old mate
riney i reckon

   wrong mr connor riney de-
served the smashing but i didnt want
you for mate because i admired your
fistic ability i can supply all of that
necessary on this craft i wanted you
 a-s c

under me where i could give you the
punishment you deserved

  connors face flushed as he looked
the other man squarely in the eyes

   you gave me your word of honor
that if i made the voyage with you
youd not lay hand on me he said
 now that you have me aboard i
suppose youll take it out on me start
in captain bill adams youll win
maybe and anyway im helpless on
your ship aid out at sea but ill
leave ray mark on you-

  the look in the captains face
caused him to hesitate

   i am a man of my word replied
thecaptain  and when i said id not
lay hands on you i meant it im not
going to beat you up on this voyage

   but i am going to make your life
a hell

   i overheard you last night as you
know i dont care what you think of
me or what you have said about me
but you spoke of my niece you di-
vided women into classes and put her
in the worthless class

   you called her wild and untamed
and said you could tame her you
could make her love you promise to
marry you you said and you inti-
mated she was a woman of loose char-
acter my niece one of the sweetest
girls god ever let breathe the breath of
life you can tame her can you very
well mr jack connor thats exactly
what youll have to do 

  his eyes blazed into connors and
connor took a step backward not be-
cause of sudden fear but because of
the spectacle of wrath and pain
mingled that those eyes held

   ill be watching you the captain
continued  and heaven help you if
you show an instant of disrespect
ill tell the girl what i heard you say
shes a good girl a sweet and honest
girl ive kept her with me because i
was afraid to leave her alone in some
port i worship her whatever i
have been norene is honest aad good

  tame her then if you can make
her love you and promise to marry


all-story cavalier weekly

you and do it honestly and honorably
you have until we make port ive
put you in the -mates place so youll
have every chance im playing fair 
 suppose i do not fancy making a
young woman fall in love with me
said connor  suppose i do not
make the attempt suppose i grant
you that i made a mistake that she is
a good sweet girl  

   there still remains the fact that
you said you could tante her boasted
of it before your worthless compan-
ions you have until we reach port
 and if i do not try or do try
and fail 

   then you stand proved a liar
jack connor and ill remember the
insults and deal with you

   but youve passed your word
youll not lay a hand on me

   and ill not but i can do some-
thing else i can make it appear you
are guilty of certain things violating
international law for instance i can
swear and my men will back me up
that what this vessel carries is known
to you alone was shipped by you that
i thought it honest cargo-for so it
looks i can have you stood up
against a wall a file of mexican fed-
eral soldiers before you and shot

   do you understand now  make
good your boast tame wild norene
after she knows what you have said
about her-or die take the deck 
captain adams went aft connor
stood near the rail looking after him
what the skipper had said was
damnably true-adams could per-
haps do as he promised

  ordinarily connor would have had
no scruples he would-have laid siege
to the heart of wild norene and won
it to save his own life if he could

  but now the scheme seemed dis-
tasteful to him even if such a thing
were possible after the girls mind had
been poisoned against him he did not
want to play with a girls affections
only to cast her aside if he won

  he remembered the girl in astoria
the one he could not meet now on

commercial street as he had hoped
he saw a vision of her before him-
her large trusting eyes and frank face
she was the first woman he ever had
met for whom he thought he could
care

  what would she think of a man
who would make love to a woman
when he did not mean it merely to
save his own half-worthless life

   ill not do it  he muttered
 therell be some other way i can
wait until the last-put up a fight
morgan will help me 

  he took charge of the deck and for
a time worked frantically captain
adams watched him and recognized
that connor knew his business that
the new mate was familiarizing him-
self with the men and the ship

  half an hour passed then connor
turned aft-to meet the vision of
which he had dreamed

  she was coming across the deck
toward him her face flushed her eyes
wide in wonder she was dressed in
a loose blouse and short skirt and her
hair was whipped about her face by
the wind connor stared at her as she
advanced

  what could she be doing here he
wondered if she was surprised to
see him he was more surprised to see
her but his heart beat wildly as he
realized she was aboard that he would
see her every day talk with her walk
the deck with her

  tame wild norene to save his own
life not with this girl aboard he
could not act falsely before her could
not let her despise him as he felt sure
she would if he did such a thing

  you he heard her say you
are the new mate 

   i whipped riney then got his
job he replied laughing  but how
do you happen to be here i was to
have -met you this afternoon in as-
toria

   i intended to sail on the amingo
but she wasnt to have sailed until to-
night she answered  there was a
change in plans i really expected to
wild norene



see you in astoria this afternoon
and now-to find you here-

   but why are you here  he asked
 i didnt know the amingo carried
passengers

  captain adams smiling evilly
stepped between them

   mr connor he said  let me
make you acquainted with my niece
miss norene adams 

  the captains eyes  were upon him
but connor could not prevent the look
of amazement and pain that came into
his face

 norene adams this woman he
had met on the street in astoria the
only woman he ever had taken the
trouble to look at more than once the
woman for whom he had thrashed a
man the woman it had pained him to
see in the resort mention of whose
name he had prohibited there-was
wild norene of whom he had spoken
lightly to his friends

  the girl was dimpling her eyes
sparkling ready to laugh at her uncle
and tell him they had met before
but connor watching the evil smile
on the captains face was thinking of
the predicament in which he found
himself

  that this girl could be the wild no-
rene of whom he had heard so much
was not to be believed how she
would despise him when her uncle
told her

  there was a pleading in connors
face as he looked at the skipper but
captain bill did not show mercy

   norene he said  ive something
to tell you in mr connors presence
well uncle

   you know i went to a certain
resort in astoria last night to learn
the truth about riney being a man i
could not trust  

   i heard you say you were going
with senor guerrero

 mr connor was sitting at a table
near me with some of his companions
they began talking of the amingo
of me and my business finally of you
 of me  she exclaimed 

   very complimentary wasnt it to
speak of you in such a place mr
connor spoke too in a tone half the
persons yi the resort could hear one
of his companions remonstrated with
him about mentioning your name
there

  do you know what he replied
that there were but two classes of
women one too good to be mentioned
by men of his stamp and the others
of such standing that it made no dif-
ference what a man said about them

   he put you in the latter class

   oh  the girl cried her face
flushed scarlet

  she looked at connor but he was
not watching her his eyes were bla-
zing into those of the captain and he
said nothing

   is this-true j  she asked him

   your uncle has said that it is he
replied without taking his eyes from
the captains face

   wait norene that is not all the
skipper resumed  one of the men
said you were called wild norene
and mr connor said you needed a
man to tame you

    i would tame her he boasted

	i could make her love me promise
to be my wife i could tame her so
shed eat out of my hand

   that was his boast norene to
his drunken companions in a dive
where other men could hear

   so i had him knocked out and
carried aboard and ive made him
mate well see if he makes good his
boast ive given him until we reach
port to win your love and your prom-
ise to be his wife if he fails there
will be punishment provided

  captain adams laughed raucously
anger flamed in the girls face as she
turned toward connor and stepped
close to him

   is all this true   she demanded
   capn adams saysit is

 i want to hear you say so did
you make that boast before your
drunken companions in that resort  
 listen to me  connor cried  i

met you accidentally yesterday after-
noon on the street youre the first
woman i ever took the trouble to look
at twice my friend taunted me about
it when we went to that resort and i
warned all men they were not to men-
tion you even without mentioning
your name your uncle if he was
there at the time will say this is the
truth

   i didnt know you were wild
norene id never have guessed it i
knew only that you were a woman
and a good woman

    i saw you later at the door of that
resort and you asked me to thrash a
man who had insulted you acted as if
your presence in such a place was
nothing unusual and still i knew that
you were good

   when i spoke as i did to my
friends i was not speaking of you i
was talking of the norene i knew by
reputation only thinking only of what
i had heard men say-

   then you did say it 

   i said it-yes but i didnt
know-

  her eyes held his her face went
white for an instant and with all the
strength at her command she struck
him across the face with the flat of her
hand her fingers left white marks
in the red and tan but connor did not
move

  she started to turn away half
ashamed of what she had done

   i didnt know  he said  great
heavens girl do you suppose id insult
you purposely whether i knew you
personally or not i tell you youre
the last woman in the world whose
name id speak lightly-the only wom-
an in the world id look at a second
time-

   you already are beginning to tame
me i see you are trying perhaps to
make me believe you love me trying to
make me love you she said in scorn

   miss adams cant you under-
stand i didnt know you were wild
norene

   and how may i be sure   she

asked  you boasted you could tame
me when i asked you to thrash riney
for his insult to me you did it instantly
perhaps that was to gain my gratitude
maybe that was part of the taming
process

   miss adams i-

   i do not care to discuss the matter
with you she interrupted  you are
beneath notice you may prepare to
take what punishment my uncle has
promised for small chance you have of
taming me and winning my love 

   and if that punishment is-
death  

   it does not matter to me i am not
interested she said

  without another word she turned
her back upon him and walked slowly
away to the rail to stand there looking
out over the sea making a picture to
attract the eyes of any man

  connor looked after her he was
cursing himself for the words he had
spoken in the resort

  captain adams was chuckling

   i guess she told you something 
the skipper said

  connor whirled upon him

  and ill tell you somethinig  he
exclaimed  this is the third time
ive met her but i love her do you
understand  i think shes the best and
sweetest woman in the world and
ill do what i boasted i could do in
spite of the way you have poisoned her
against me

   ill win her and ill marry her
and ill not do it to escape any punish-
ment you may hand out but because
shes the woman i want-the woman
im ready to fight for can you un-
derstand that

the stowaway

the noon hour found the steam-
schooner amingo on the broad
sea far off the coast her nose pointed
to the south the oregon shore half
obscured by a fog
wild norene



  connor had gone to the forecastle
at captains bills orders to remove
the irons from morgan and after de-
livering a lecture send him on deck
he made the most of the opportunity
and told morgan all that had trans-
pired an attempt to outwit captain
adams was decided upon and both
were to apply their minds to inventing
ways and means

  there would be safety for several
days for the captain would keep his
word they knew and make no move
to harm connor until the end of the
voyage

  it was at this time that two members
of the crew climbing over the lumber
lashed to the deck discovered the stow-
away

  the stowaway was a woman

 captain adamss eyes bulged with
surprise as the two men led her across
the deck toward him she was tall and
shapely dressed in serviceable clothing
and had no hat her hair was dishev-
eled and flying in the breeze

  she made no attempt at resistance
but walked forward proudly not even
trying to shake off the men who
grasped her arms and urged her on

  the brow of captain bill was wrin-
kled in thought he told himself he had
seen the woman before the men led
her up to him and her eyes met his un-
flinchingly

   stowaway capn one of the men
said grinning  she was hidden be-
tween two piles of lumber

   go forward 

  the men obeyed turning frequently
to look back at the woman who re-
mained standing in front of the skip-
per waiting for him to speak

  a woman stowaway was unusual
and any sort of a stowaway was a rarity
alxard the amingo

   well  the skipper demanded

  the woman put her hands behind
her back and regarded him without
apparent emotion

   how did you come aboard   cap-
tain adams asked

   i took a small boat and rowed out

to the schooner this morning about
three oclock i understood you would
sail before daylight so i had no time
to lose i caught a line under the bow-
sprit and made my way to the deck and
hid in the lumber i let the boat drift
out to sea

  it is rather unusual for a woman
to do such a thing why did you
do it

   i had good reasons

   you live in astoria 

   ive been living there for some
time

   running away from the police  
the girls face flushed as she re-
plied 

   i have done nothing to put the po-
lice on me sir

   i guess youll have to explain
when a woman does what you have
done-sneaks aboard a vessel-there
must be some compelling reason there
isnt much charity for stowaways do
you know where this vessel is going 
 no sir

  what i supposed naturally you
wanted to get to a certain port and had
no money why in heavens name
did you stow away on a craft whose
destination is unknown to you  

  im not anxious to get to any cer-
tain port she said  and i have plenty
of money i can pay my passage
she reached in the front of her waist
and drew out a roll of bills and a small
bag filled with silver and gold coins

   this isnt a passenger vessel said
the captain  and if you wanted to
sail with us and had money why didnt
you see me about it instead of playing
stowaway 

   youd not have given me passage
would you  

    i scarcely think so

   thats why i sneaked aboard in
the way i did i was determined to
sail on this vessel and none other

   seems like ive seen you some
place before

   you no doubt have sir ive been
playing the piano in a certain resort in
astoria my name is sally wood


all-story cavalier weekly

 ah i remember now your
story was told to me last night i think
i am more than justified in asking you
for an explanation now you dont
know where we are bound but were
determined to sail with us why

   you say youve heard my story 
   yes

   then you know that ive been
working-where i have-in order to
get money quickly and you know for
what reason  

   to trail the man who married you
and deserted you i was told

   the man who stole my fathers
savings and left us penniless she add-
ed  last night i saw that man
thats why im aboard this vessel he
is a member of your crew

   a member of my crew  the
captain cried  prove that girl and
convince me your story is true and
ill manhandle him myself

   i will take care of him she said
 i always thought id kill him when
i found him now im not so sure
but what ill make him suffer first i
dont know how its to be done but
ill find a way just let me pay pas-
sage so i can be near him and watch
ill not create a disturbance aboard
your ship

   youll pay no passage  the cap-
tain exclaimed if ive got a man
like that aboard this ship i want to
know it and ill help vou punish him
who is he

  your mate sir

 what

   he was fighting last night and i
recognized him just as the fight was
over i learned he was your mate and
discovered that you had ordered your
men aboard i knew you meant to
sail immediately i got my money
changed clothes left the place where
i was employed and boarded the
schooner now i want to meet him
face to face

  the captain looked away across the
sea for a moment then back at her
she was watching his face waiting for
his answer

   im afraid youve made a mistake
girl he said

   do you think i dont know the
man who wrecked my life helped send
my father to his grave  

   i didnt mean a mistake in that
way you say he fought in the re-
sort  

   you saw the fight for i saw you
watching he was fighting with jack
connor he sneaked away like the
coward he is

  you mean riney then

   his name was wood when i mar-
ried him the man i mean has a scar
on his face

   he didnt sneak away because he
was afraid to continue the fight for
my men won said the captain  he
sneaked away because he saw me there
-because he knew i had discovered
he was a man not to be trusted he
sneaked away so i couldnt get my
hands on his worthless throat-

   and now youve-youve pun-
ished him   she asked in her eyes
was the fear that she would not have
a chance for vengeance that the cap-
tain had taken that chance away from
her

   ive had no chance to punish him
captain adams said  hes deserted
the ship girl ive got a new mate
though i had a deuce of a time get-
ting him my new mate is the man
who thrashed riney-jack connor
 oh  there was surprise in her
voice at this last statement of the cap-
tains

  then realization of her position
came to her

   so he has escaped me too  she
cried  ive stowed away to get him
and hes behind in astoria laughing
and im aboard this ship bound for-
heaven knows where 

  captain adams patted her shoulder
 dont worry girl he said  it
isnt as bad as you think ive a good
notion that the man you want will
meet up with you soon im pretty
sure hes on a craft thats going to
follow us down the coast you just
wild norene



make yourself comfortable aboard
itd do me good to see you meet him
and ill arrange it if i can my niece
is aboard and shell be company for
you and there is jack connor too
the captain chuckled as another
thought came to him  it is fortu-
nate connor is my new mate he said
 i think he likes you girl

  her face flashed crimson as the
captain looked at her he had re-
membered what guerrero had said-
that this woman loved jack connor
if she thought connor returned her
affection shed pay considerable atten-
tion-to him it would prove another
barrier between connor and norene

  captain adams didnt think another
barrier was needed but it was better
to be on the safe side

  it happened that at that moment
connor and morgan came from the
forecastle connor and sally wood
faced each other across six feet of
deck

 you connor gasped for
the love of heaven sally what are
you doing here  

   she came to find her husband the
man who deserted her the captain
said  riney was the man

   then im doubly glad i smashed
him but you missed him-you are
here and he has remained behind

   she played stowaway to get at
him the captain said  two of the
men found her among the lumber piles
forward theres nerve for you
well take care of her connor and
if riney follows on that fool gun-
boat well see that she meets him face
to face and makes him uncomfort-
able take her below and see that
she has something hot to eat

 thank you sir connor replied
sally wood staggered as she started
forward and connor threw an arm
about her and helped her across the
deck

  wild norene came from below just
in time to see them she stood to
one side as they passed connor gave
her no attention he was bending over

sally wood and talking to her in a
low tone

  wild norenes face flushed and she
hurried across to her uncle

   who is that woman   she asked
 what is she doing here  

  the captain laughed

   shes a stowaway niece the men
found her behind a lumber pile she
crept aboard at astoria just before we
sailed

   but-

   she was afraid id not take her
as a passenger and she was deter-
mined to sail on the amingo thats
why she stowed away interested in
the mate

   interested in the mate norene
repeated looking in the direction
connor and sally wood had taken
 what sort of a woman-

   shes a musician she played the
piano in the place where riney and
connor had the fight last night

   oh  there was deep scorn in
norenes voice

   both interested in this girl i
imagine perhaps thats why they
fought the fight seemed to start over
nothing at all

   oh  she gasped again

  it flashed over her mind that here
was the reason jack connor had
agreed so promptly to thrash riney
and without asking questions as to
why he should be thrashed she had
thought he was fighting for her-and
he had been fighting for this woman

  wild norene said nothing more to
her uncle but turned and went for-
ward to stand near the rail and look
ahead at the tossing sea

the remainder of that day and that
night and the day following there was
work for jack connor to do

  captain bill adams on deck with
his mate watching the crew as they
carried out connors orders listening
to the mates hoarse voice as he bel-
lowed his commands found himself
regretting that he had planned to pun-
ish the man he began wishing he
could- have connor for his mate per-
manently

  there is danger in a blow when the
seas run high for a vessel that car-
ries a cargo of lumber lashed to her
decks

  time and time again giant seas
boarded the amingoand threatened to
tear away lashings and make every
stick of the cargo a peril to the crew
and a matter of loss to underwriters

  an afternoon a night and a day
without sleep connor held himself to
his work refusing politely to turn in
when the skipper told him he could
do so

  connor relished the work because
for the time being it took his mind
away from other matters

  senor guerrero brave enough
perhaps on the field of battle when
engaged in leading ragged revolution-
ists against their organized govern-
ment was an abject coward now
seasickness had made of the hero a
craven

  he remained below moaning long-
ing for the death that did not come

  sally wood too remained in the
small cabin captain adams had as-
signed her for sally was not used to
the sea the chinese cook offered
her food and drink which she refused
and played steward in an attempt to
relieve her suffering

  in those two days connor knew why
wild norene was so named

  she was on deck when the blow be-
gan her eyes sparkling her cheeks
flushed she clung to the rail and
watched the tumbling sea glorying in
the rushing wind the dashing spray
running away now and then to escape

a wetting she stood on the deck and
watched the man put extra lashings on
the lumber laughed and shrieked like
a wild sister of the wind that was
raging

  jack connor watching her from
afar felt his admiration grow she
had not spoken to him since the scene
that first morning she had not spoken
to sally wood at all

  the second night came and the
storm fell jack connor turned in
stiff and sore to sleep the clock
around

  he emerged from the cabin in the
middle of the next morning to find
the sea dancing in the sunshine the
coast could be seen in the distance

  behind smoke pouring from her
stacks followed the mexican gunboat
like a hound on the trail

  captain adams laughed as he saw
connor regarding the pursuing vessel

   neednt fear her lad he said
 you have graver things to fear
you havent won wild norenes love
yet i take it 

   i havent spoken to your niece
since you blackened me to her

   you lost time because of the
storm lad but thats the fortune of
war the days are slipping were
getting down the coast a bit the
voyage will not last for always

   it is my affair connor said
 you gave me until we made port
let it rest at that

  captain bill was watching the gun-
boat through his glass

   shes kicking up a real lot of
water he said  but thats all she
dare do i scarcely think shell put a
shot across our bows when old glory
is flying from our stern

   she can make as good time as the
amingo sir youll not dare go in
mexican waters

  the skipper laughed loudly

   you dont think im going to stay
on the high seas forever do you ive
a bit of cargo to deliver and itll be
delivered a measly little gunboat
with a mexican in command can be

dodged by the amingo with a yankee
sailing her and dont you forget it
ill turn in now i guess

  the amingo was making good time
and was on the right course there was
little for connor to do morgan was
with others of the crew in the fore-
castle getting sorely needed sleep after
the battle with the gale

  senor guerrero came on deck for a
time pale and weak spoke a few
words and retired again connor
imagined he did it to see for himself
whether the amingo still was afloat

  and then norene appeared

  she walked forward playing with
the ships dog mascot presently she
turned and made for the bridge

  connor watched her from the cor-
ners of his eyes she did not go aft
she stopped started up

  connor swung his glass up and
looked hard to starboard at nothing
when he lowered the glass she was
within six feet of him and with a
glass of her own was looking back at
the mexican gunboat she did not
appear to recognize his presence

  connor smiled as he turned his back
upon her and again regarded a spot
he imagined to be on the horizon
when he looked back she had
dropped the glass to her side and was
watching the antics of the dog playing
with one of the men over the piles of
lumber

  connor wondered whether she had
come there to explain by her actions
that she did not consider he existed on
earth if she would not recognize his
presence he would recognize hers he
told himself

  he was puzzled how to begin

  a plea for justice would not avail
with such a girl as norene he had
made that before and it had failed
to start an ordinary conversation
would mean to be snubbed he must
find some way to startle her some way
to make her answer to get her to talk

  an idea came to him an idea so
bold that for a moment it held him
aghast then forced him to smile in

spite of himself he would startle
wild norene as she never had been
startled before he decided

  he took a step nearer her

   i beg your pardon he said

  she turned her back on him and
made no reply raising the glass again
she contemplated the distant shore

   pardon me but passengers are not
allowed on the bridge 

   passengers 

  she whirled toward him as she
spoke then realizing she had been be-
trayed into speaking flushed and bit
her lip

  but connor was not smiling at her
nor sneering at her was not sarcastic
not angry not attempting a pleasantry
he was only the courteous firm officer
in temporary charge of a vessel on the
high seas

   pardon me for mentioning it he
continued  perhaps you did not
understand about it

   not understand-

  she bit her lip and flushed again
not understand wild norene
adams who had spent ten years
aboard a vessel with captain bill not
to understand the simple rules of the
sea

  hot anger flamed within her her
eyes flashed danger signals

   it is permissible with the captains
permission to visit the bridge with
himself or another officer but it is not
permitted you to be alone on the bridge
with the officer in charge

   are you trying to be imperti-
nent  

   also it is forbidden to speak to
the bridge officer madam

  he turned away from her and again
contemplated the horizon trying hard
to keep from smiling

   it happens she said in scorn
 that i have the run of the ship i
own one-fifth interest in her if you
desire to know it i think i may stand
on the bridge a moment

  he turned toward her again his
face grave

   it would be the same madam if


all-story cavalier weekly

you owned all of her he said  an
officer in charge of a vessel has re-
sponsibilities and certain rights he
can order an owner in irons if that
owner makes an attempt to interfere
with navigation of the ship

  her eyes flamed again

   youd put me in irons i sup-
pose  she asked

  he did smile now

   i scarcely think it will be neces-
sary he said  now that i have ex-
plained i am sure youll descend to the
deck and observe my orders

  your orders she exclaimed
 you- you dare to speak to me
like this you-you-dare order me
from the bridge of the amingo as you
would a meddlesome tourist on a jap-
anese liner you-

   ordinary rules of seafaring my
dear madam that i cannot see fit to
disobey he reminded her  pardon
me for not accompanying you to the
deck i cannot leave the bridge

  she gasped at him again then sat on
the rail crooking her feet around a
post folded her hands in her lap and
regarded him her head held high the
danger signals still in her eyes

  she knew he was laughing at her-
that he was attempting to make her
talk to him she had come up on the
bridge to punish him by acting as if
unaware of his presence and now she
could not retreat and leave to him the
victory

  she would remain and she would
ignore him

  he regarded the pursuing gunboat
again looked long at the shore then
turned toward her and pretended sur-
prise

   i believe i suggested that you
descend to the deck madam he said

  she looked away from him made
no answer

  you refuse to obey my order
he asked

  no answer she was biting at the
corner of her lip to keep from laugh-
ing what could he do now she won-
dered

  he turned away from her again

   forward  he cried  pass the
word to morgan tell him to come to
the bridge immediately with one of the
other men 

   aye aye sir 

  the amingo continued on her way
through the wallowing sea connor
did not look at her again could net
trust himself to do so

  she remained sitting on the rail try-
ing to keep from laughing he would
speak to her again soon she supposed
and again she would ignore him and
make no answer

  morgan rubbing his sleepy eyes
came from the forecastle and made his
way aft another man at his heels
they mounted to the bridge and stood
before the mate

  you wanted us mr connor

   yes this young lady refuses to
leave the bridge after being ordered
to do so conduct her to her cabin
and lock her in if she resists put her
in irons 

  norenes eyes bulged in amazement
and she got down from the rail staring
at him not believing what she had
heard not dreaming he would dare
think of going so far

   i-i beg pardon sir   asked
morgan looking from one to the
other

  you heard my orders do as i
told you  

   but-

   as i told you  connor advanced
toward him threateningly

   aye aye sir 

  morgan turned toward her the
other seaman stepping beside him

   mates orders you go below
miss morgan said

   im very comfortable here thank
you

  morgan was bewildered conduct-
ing the captains niece below was some-
thing out of the ordinary he wasnt
sure what he should do but the dis-
cipline of the sea is strong-and he had
received his orders

 but-
wild norene



   lady refuses to go below sir he
reported to the mate

   you have your orders 

  connors lips were twitching he did
not dare turn and look at them
through his glass he regarded another
spot on the horizon morgan scratched
his head a moment then faced norene
again

   mates orders must be obeyed
miss he said  officer says you must
go below

  norene realized the mans predica-
ment and did not care to cause him
trouble it was connor she wanted to
outwit

   tell your officer she replied
 that i was just going there is
much better company in the forecas-
tle

  she started to descend and morgan
and the other sailor followed her at a
respectful distance on the deck they
stopped while norene walked across
to the rail leaning against it and kick-
ing out her heels like a girl of ten

   what th dev- morgan was
muttering to himself

   morgan  came the hail from the
bridge

   aye sir

   i told you to conduct the young
lady to her cabin and lock her in do
so instantly and fetch me the key

    aye aye sir 

  morgan and his messmate started
slowly across the deck toward her
orders were orders if they had been
told to throw the chinese cook over-
board they might have done it and
stopped to think of it afterward

  norene whirled upon them as they
advanced and held out her hands

   do as your officer ordered  she
said  lock me in my cabin then
take him the key

  her face was fiery red she looked
once at the bridge her eyes flashing
angry-but connor was calmly gazing
through his glass at the imaginary
spot on the horizon

  morgan and his comrade followed
her below ushered her into her cabin

locked the door and carried the key
up to the mate in the ears of wild
norene rang the chuckle she had heard
morgan give as he locked the door

   great salt lake capns niece
and itll be in th log 

  her head held high her hands
clenched and her arms held rigid at
her sides she stood for a moment and
regarded the door they had locked
then the storm broke

  she was wild norene adams in
earnest now she pounded against the
door in her fury shrieked and
screeched hurled to the floor or
against the walls everything movable

  in another woman it would have
been old-fashioned hysterics but in
wild norene it was anger pure and
simple rage at herself for having been
conquered not at the man who had
conquered her

  the slumbering skipper in the ad-
joining cabinvas awakened when a
lamp-bracket crashed against the wall
he sprang to his feet and began pull-
ing on his clothes his ears assailed by
shrieks and cries

  he knew it was norenes voice
what had happened what in the
name of neptune he asked himself
could have happened

  he ran out and pounded on no-
renes door he saw that senor guer-
rero was standing near aghast at such
an outburst farther away sally
wood had opened a door and was
peering out fright in her face

    norene girl  the skipper cried
 what is it  open the door 

  another shriek of anger answered
him

   whats the matter  open the
door girl 

  another chorus of hysterical
screams captain bill stepped back
another instant and his gigantic bulk
crashed against the doors panels and
burst them in he half fell into the
tiny cabin

  norene was standing near a port-
hole her back toward him stamping

her feet pounding against the thick
glass with her tiny fists

  norene what is it girl

  she turned as he approached and he
tried to take her in his arms sudden
alarm in his face for never had he
seen norene in quite such a state be-
fore

  but she pushed him away and con-
fronted him wild anger in her eyes

   girl-girl what is it  he asked
   ask-your mate  she gasped

   my matel captain bill turned
and dashed from the cabin and to the
deck he had been aroused from a
deep sleep he had heard norene
screeching as if in fear and anger he
had demanded the reason and had
been told to ask his mate had con-
nor overstepped the bounds of cour-
tesy had he dared insult norene

  captain bills fists were clenched
and his breath was coming in angry
gasps as he hurried across the deck and
mounted to the bridge

  he stopped in astonishment as he
reached it jack connor was looking
through his glass at the imaginary
spot on the horizon he did not pre-
sent the appearance of a man who had
just quarreled with a woman or insult-
ed her he was the typical cool calm
and collected officer on the bridge

  captain bill began to feel ridiculous
as connor turned and faced him

   up so soon capn   he asked

   whats been goin on here  

   i beg your pardon sir 

   my niece is down in her cabin
shrieking to wake the dead she woke
me all right i asked her what was
the matter and she said to ask the
mate if youve gone too far-

   oh  sudden recollection seemed
to come to connor  she came up
here on the bridge sir i informed
her courteously that passengers were
not allowed on the bridge

   passengers-

   and asked her politely to leave
she answered me and i informed her
it was against the rules to talk to the
bridge officer

  connors eyes were twinkling and a
smile lurked on his lips as he faced his

   well  the captain demanded

   she refused to go sir mutiny
of passenger against rules i called
two of the men and had them lock her
in her cabin and fetch me the key
you- you what

    yes sir

   you did that-to norene 

   yes sir-fully within my rights
of course and in a polite and courteous
manner here is the key sjr

  captain bill xdams took the key
but did not take his eyes from the
mates face slowly the expression of
his own face relaxed his mouth
twitched then he threw back his head
and roared

  for the love of neptune he
cried and laughed again  sent her
to her cabin-locked her in-wild no-
rene great heaven how shell hate
you now fully within your rights
and in a polite and courteous manner
eh thats good by heaven its
good wild norene so thats the
way you start in to tame her eh  
captain bill laughed again connor
searched the horizon once more a
voice behind them-norenes voice-
made them both turn

   funny is it  she demanded she
had followed her uncle and made her
way to the bridge  well are you
going to thrash this fine mate of yours
the meil could not help it-they had
to carry out his orders 

  the captain laughed again while
she stood before him angrily tapping
the floor of the bridge with the toe of
one shoe the captains laugh died
down and as norene looked away an
instant he winked at connor

   mr connor tells me he ordered 
you to leave the bridge and you refused
to go

   he did-and i did

   and he called a couple of men and
had you locked in your cabin  

   he did and itll be in the log i
went because of the men-they were
wild norene



forced to obey orders now thrash
this man for me because of his impu-
dence  

  captain bill pulled at his mustache

   my dear norene he said  my
officer acted fully within his rights he
wasnt insolent was he  

   he was polite enough she admit-
ted

   you should have left the bridge
when he ordered it said the captain
trying hard not to laugh  i cannot
punish my mate for abiding by the
rules of the sea and now youve got-
ten yourself in worse than ever-
youve broken your arrest and come
up here on deck

  uncle

   must have discipline  said cap-
tain bill  youll have to go back in
your cabin until i have time to con-
sider your case mr connor ill take
the bridge until you return conduct
miss adams to her cabin i smashed
the door but you can put a man on
guard if you think it necessary

   uncle bill  she shrieked

  but the captain had turned his back
upon her for no longer could he keep
back the chuckles that bubbled to his
lips

   at least she said recovering
some of her dignity  take me back
yourself or let me go alone i do not
care to walk across the deck with a
man of mr connors stamp

  connors face grew red and there
was an expression of pain in it

   miss adams he said  i do not
care to accompany you if you think i
am unworthy i see youi are bound
not to be friends with me i explained
honestly to you once i spoke lightly
of wild norene in a low resort be-
cause i did not know you personally
then i thought but i did know you
only not by name and a few minutes
before i had prohibited mention of you
in the same place-because i had met
you and admired you because i loved
you from the first-and im not
ashamed to tell you now in your
uncles presence

   this is a part of the taming pro-
cess i suppose she sneered  do
you think i believe in your love mere-
ly because you say you love me are
you not saying it to escape the punish-
ment my uncle has promised you  do
you think i am that weak-minded
 i have told you the truth he re-
plied  believe it or not ill never
mention the subject again-and ill
take whatever punishment your uncle
sees fit to give me but do not say i
am unworthy to walk across the deck
with you for i have not lied im a
rough sailor but ive kept myself
measurably clean and what bad habits
i have can be corrected easily

   however you do not see fit to
give me a square deal ill not bother
you further miss adams regarding
the present matter with the captains
permission well consider your arrest
at an end

  he bowed fo her and turned away
the look in his eyes haunted her
she fought against feeling that his
words were true she wanted to feel
that she could condemn this man to his
face ah-

   a worthy man - you  she ex-
claimed  and just how worthy do
you know one reason i wont believe
you do you want to know one rea-
son why i think you are unworthy
what about the girl who became a
stowaway what about the girl who
played the piano in that low resort you
made your headquarters why did
she become a stowaway   interested
in the mate my uncle says a woman
like that-a vile creature like that un-
sexes herself to follow you when you
sail yet you say you are a worthy man
and you fought with riney for her-
not because i asked you to avenge his
insult to me

   stop  connor almost yelled the
word you do not know what you
are saying sally wood is a woman
in a thousand-a good woman-

   a good woman-playing the piano
there she cried laughing

  yes-a good woman connors

eyes blazed at the captain then he
faced norene again  evidently your
uncle hasnt been fair evidently he
didnt tell you this womans story its
one to make an honest womans heart
bleed with sympathy for her  in-
terested in the mate eh capn bill
didnt happen to mention which mate
did he

   what do you mean   she asked

  there was an expression of guilt in
the captains face and she had been
quick to notice it

   i wasnt the mate meant said
connor  it was riney the old
mate she followed aboard or thought
she was following him she is inter-
ested in riney-and she has the right
to be

   but a woman of that sort- she
began again

   a woman that is good and hon-
est and whom any other woman ought
to help he said  why hot ask your
uncle to set you right-to tell you the
story  i dont blame you for blaming
me if capn bill led you to believe
some things that are not true

  she demanded the story and cap-
tain adams told it in a manner that
showed he was somewhat ashamed

  norene said nothing as he conclu-
ded but there was a bit of contempt
in her face as she watched her uncle
descend to the deck and start toward
the cabin to continue his interrupted
sleep

  but captain adams turned grin-
ning and called back at her sending
a parting shot in revenge

   better get off that bridge no-
rene or the mate will have you in
irons  he cried

  her face grew red and she started
to descend without looking at connor

   miss adams he called softly as
she started  i meant what i said
ill bother you no more i love you-
i meant that too ive corrected one
false idea you had of me but i shall
go no farther i just wanted you to
know im perhaps not as badas you
thought and that sally wood was a

decent woman deserving of kindness
and sympathy youre the one woman
ive ever looked at a second time-

  she hesitated then ran swiftly down
to the deck as if afraid to hear more
she did not ask his pardon did not
by word or look express penitence

  but that evening in the moonlight
jack connor saw her walking the deck
with sally wood and wild norene
had her arm around the other wom-
ans waist

  he did not know how wild no-
renes pride had suffered that day

chapter vi

the truth comes out

qeven days passed with the steam
schooner amingo wallowing on
toward the south and the mexican
gunboat following dropping behind
by day creeping up by night always
watching ready for any emergency
ready to match wit against captain
bill adamss strategy

  the pursuing craft had thrown out
her true colors and now and then by
looking through a glass one could see
the sun reflected from her guns

  the amingo now was off the mexi-
can coast and connor knew that the
end of the voyage was near times
without number he had passed or met
norene adams but always he had
merely saluted her courteously and
passed on

  she had grown to be great friends
with sally wood and with sally
wood connor talked a great deal now
and then

  these conversations were but half
sweet to sally she was a woman
who could read the heart of such a
man as tack connor and she read
that she had his respect but not his
affection that all that was reserved
for wild norene

  guerrero now that they were ap-
proaching the end of the voyage be-
came nervous and looked continually
over the stern at the pursuing gunboat
wild norene



he held long conferences with cap-
tain adams at which the skipper re-
peatedly requested him to attend to
his own business that he had promised
to land the arms and ammunition and
that they would be landed

  on a certain afternoon the captain
mounted to the bridge during con-
nors watch and looked long at the
vessel behind

   she hangs on pretty well doesnt
she connor said

   ill shake her off when i am
ready

   do we put into mazatlan first
then out again and land the arms or
do we land the contraband first 

  the faptain whirled upon him

   who said anything about contra-
band   he demanded

  why pretend with me asked
connor  i was just wondering if
we were near the end of the trip

   you are near the end of your
trip  the captain snarled  ready
for the firing party  

   i was beginning to believe youd
changed your plans

   well i havent you insulted
my niece-youll pay for it 

  why not leave it to her asked
connor

   i gave you your chance you
havent tamedher have you and
youll never get back to a united
states port to say capn bill adams
weakened youll never tell about this
voyage maybe ive been a bit friend-
ly with you now and then and maybe
it was because you amused me but
dont think ive altered my original
program

   oh very well 

   you take it calmly enough

   why not   demanded connor
youre a man ofyour word arent
you

   i am

   very well youve promised to
keep your hands off me during the
voyage and im going to take ad-
vantage of that and tell you just what
i think of you

  the captaip sneered in his face

   go ahead 

   im not going to tell you that
youre a cruel masterful terror be-
cause youd like that-youre vain
im going to tell you that youre an
ordinary plain fool 

   captain bills fists doubled instantly
 remember your given word 
warned connor  youre ready to
send me to prison or death on some
trumped - up charge because i didnt
accomplish a task you made impossi-
ble and i didnt try i tell you again
i love norene i told you id win
her i still think ill do it but ill
not even attempt it now when she will
think i am making the effort merely
to escape punishment from you ive
done nothing to make you seek venge-
ance on me-

  nothing eh calling my girl an
unmentionable woman saying she was
a fit subject for barroom gossip de-
claring to the world you could tame
her-nothing 

   ive explained that im sorry i
did it i know her now you see id
marry her if shed have me and go
back and tell every one in astoria id
done it and beat half to death the
man that dared make a remark about
it either in a barroom or in a church
thats where i stand

   you shanghaied me and made
me mate of your law - breaking craft
against my will you placed me in a
position where i was subjected to in-
sult you let norene believe things
that were not true you havent been
fair youre not only a fool but
youre a coward

   strike me now break your word
and make yourself out a liar as well

   thats about all i have to say to
you im your mate until the climax
capn bill adams but from now on
i fight - you understand  - i fight
for myself and for norene and
youll find that a connor can fight
curse you 

   bah fight-and be cursed your-
self


all-story cavalier weekly

   im not trying to tame wild no-
rene capn bill but im starting in
right now to tame you

  for a moment they glared at each
other for a moment connor thought
the captain would break his word and
strike

  but captain bill adams only
laughed evilly and started to turn
away

   one moment  connor stopped
him  i have guessed that youre
going to try to land that cargo under
the nose of the gunboat thats been
hanging on like a dog have you
stopped to think of the conse-
quences  

   ill take care of the conse-
quences  

   there are women aboard-your
niece and another there may be a
fight these women will be in danger
theyll be in danger of wounds or
death and of a mexican prison and
mexican jailers i guess you know
what that means

    well  

   land the women first run
ahead to mazatlan and land em then
run out again and land your contra-
band you can dodge the gunboat to-
night but dont put the women in
danger

  the captain walked up close to him
again but connor did not retreat

   ill land that cargo when and
where i please he said  and you
neednt fear for the women youd
best fear for yourself 

   then youd risk norenes life and
happiness for the sake of aiding a
handful of ragged ignorant fools fight
against their own government-for
the little money the junta pays you  
connor had raised his voice and his
words carried far from below came
a snarl of rage a cry of fright

  captain adams and his mate looked
down-to see senor guerrero stand-
ing there talking to norene

  sudden hatred had flamed in the
senors eyes

   ragged ignorant fools  he

cried you call them that they
walk through jungles with naked
bleeding feet they die because of ex-
posure and poisonous snakes they are
shot down like dbgs when found they
starve they die of thirst they let
themselves be strung up and riddled
by bullets-and you call them ragged
ignorant fools they fight for what
your country boasts every man has
there-the right to live and be free 

  you americans three months
ago i was coming into new york on
a steamer from france i saw a poor
italian weep for joy when the saw
your statue of liberty god pity him
-and the thousands like him 

  the senors words choked in his
throat it seemed to be genuine emo-
tion depicted in his face

    ragged ignorant fools  he cried
again  and how could we make the
fight without breaking laws my
government is strong enough to keep
from us that with which to fight we
cant fight with the ballot for that is
denied us and if we use guns we
must smuggle them

   your country-your liberty-lov-
ing country-denies us the right to
buy guns there for shipment but we
buy them and if it wasnt for a few
fearless men like capn bill adams
who isnt afraid to carry them and
land them wed have no chance to
fight at all 

    run your guns curse you  cried
connor thoroughly angry  im not
talking of that im talking of ma-
king women run the risk-

  too late he remembered that no-
rene was standing there below beside
senor guerrero

    what does it mean   she asked
wonderingly  uncle you told me
you were going to stop along the coast
before we got to mazatlan to land
some machinery that was to go back
in the mines

    i-i know i did norene

   and now-guns 

   run on to your cabin norene
and let us talk this thing out
wild norene



  no she cried looking up at
him you-you lied to me

   now norene-

   you lied to me 

   dont you understand girl  it
wasnt necessary for you to know

   but youre breaking the law 

   it isnt a fair law girl why
should it be against the law to carry
guns and cartridges to people who
want to fight  

   because she said  unscrupul-
ous men always would be starting
trouble getting poor downtrodden
men to fight for liberty when really
they would be fighting to help rich
men seize property the law would
not have stood this long uncle unless
it had been a good law and all
nations would not have adopted it un-
less it was good you dont know
what you do

   youre making it possible for men
to shoot one another youre helping
create widows and orphans - and
youre breaking the law 

   liberty cannot be gained except
blood be shed said senor guerrero
norene looked at him in scorn

   i begin to understand she said
 you have mentioned to me that you
and your friends own oil-fields and
mines and that you could make more
money if the government favored you
more you are trying to establish a
government more to your liking i
suppose

  the banner of guilt showed in
guerreros face norenes lips curled
as she looked at him

   but i am speaking to my uncle
she went on looking up at the bridge
again  why have you deceived me
uncle 

   it wasnt any of your business
girl he said brutally  women
shouldnt bother their heads about
business

   you should have told me youd
no right to do such things when i was
oji the schooner to make me a party
tohhem-

  captain adamss anger had beet
      a-s c

growing steadily and now it flamed
forth that it was directed against
his niece happened because the last
words addressed to him had been
spoken by her

  no right he exclaimed ive
been a good uncle havent i ive
tried to raise you right youve had
everything money could buy it cost
more to have you with me instead of
putting you ashore but i did it be-
cause i wanted to be sure youd be
protected ive run guns before with
you aboard youve spent a lot of the
money i got for doing it its legiti-
mate whether the government thinks
so or not and ill continue to do it
and no mexican gunboat or headstrong
girl or fresh mate can stop me 

  protected me she cried half-
shrinking from him because of his
words and manner  in return ive
given you such love as a daughter
should give a father and how have
you protected me this man jack
connor spoke lightly of wild norene
in a barroom-spoke so because of
what he thought i must be having
been with you because you are a
breaker of laws he assumed i must
be a dishonest woman can you blame
him  by heaven i cannot  v

   norene  there was agony in
the captains voice

   i cannot i say not knowing me
as he does now what else could he
think you were a lawbreaker i was
your constant companion nearer to
you than any other human being i
sailed with you on all your voyages
what could men think except that i
was a lawbreaker too that i knew
what you were doing and agreed with
you in it that i was lawless-not a
good woman but a thing to be spoken
of in scorn  

   dont girl-you dont under-
stand-

   i do understand and i dont
blame jack connor for what he said
nor for where he said it you left
me open to the insult-you my uncle
i blame you 


all-story cavalier weekly

   girl-girl maybe i made a mis-
take-

   ive loved you and trusted you
she went on  i knew you were a
hard man and gloried in your reputa-
tion as such because i thought you 
were honest and fair i knew you
were clean compared to other men of
the sea and i thought-i thought my
uncle bill was the soul of honor

   and now youre breaking the laws
of two nations a gunboat follows
watching you as a thief and behind
youve left a nation-your country-
fooled swindled because youve got-
ten away with a contraband cargo
you fly the stars and stripes from
the stern-youre a disgrace to the flag
and the country for which it stands 

   norene  he begged

   this is my last trip with you
she said  i cannot prevent you
breaking the law this time but ill
never be with you when you do it
again ill go ashore-ill work ill
wait for my uncle to turn honest
before he can claim my friendship
again 

  sobbing her head bent she turned
and walked quickly away to go below
to her cabin to throw herself in the
berth and burst into a storm of tears

  they stared after her for a moment
-guerrero captain bill connor

  guerreros face broke into a grin
that was half a sneer anger flamed
in the captains anger more at himself
than at norene anger because she had
vindicated in a way the thing for
which he was blaming jack connor

  and jack connor meeting the cap-
tains eyes knew that he could expect
no mercy now

prisoners-and freed

wondering how it all would ter-
minate jack connor left the
bridge and went to the cabin to throw
himself in a bunk and try to sleep for
he felt he would get no sleep that night

  he realized within a few minutes
that captain adams was forcing the
amingo to her greatest speed the
attempt to dodge the gunboat had be-
gun

  had he been on deck watching he
would have seen a peculiar thing for
captain bill called the members of the
crew to him on the bridge one by one
and to them imparted certain informa-
tion these men for the greater part
had sailed with adams for some time
had played parts in his evasions of the
law and were ready to do his bidding

  others newer on the amingo could
be trusted by the skipper since they
had been vouched for by tried and
trusted men only one man failed to
get the summons to the bridge and a
message from the captain he was mor-
gan jack connors friend

  morgans guarded inquiries as to
what was up were met by sneers from
the others and one man told him to
his face to attend to his own business
morgan asked no more questions but
decided to mention the matter to con-
nor when next he saw the mate

  guerrero was on the bridge during
these conversations and heard them
all one by one the men were in-
formed that that night cargo was to be
landed grinning they nodded that
they understood

  but the remainder of the captains
message puzzled them he would not
be on deck possibly during the unload-
ing and they were to take orders only
from senor guerrero in case their cap-
tain was absent

  if connor attempted to take com-
mand they were to ignore him if he
made himself obnoxious they were to
tie him to the mast and proceed with
their work

  it was peculiar instructions but the
men did not question they knew cap-
tain bill had peculiar ways

  as far as the mate was concerned
they knew there was bad blood between
him and the captain they had missed
nothing during the voyage they had
witnessed clashes between norene and
wild norene



the mate and between captain bill and
connor

  one other instruction they received
too if the gunboat overhauled the
amingo and her officers asked ques-
tions the men were to swear that
whatever captain bill said was the
truth they understood that-many
of them had sworn to lies before for
captain bill

  the amingo began to gain on the
gunboat the latter did not realize it
until night began falling and she at-
tempted to creep nearer as she had
done on previous nights

  she found she could not the amingo
held her distance

  then the gunboat put forth her
greatest speed garza her commander
realizing that the clash was near at
hand at any time after dark he
knew the amingo might turn toward
the shore and soon get within mexican
waters

  night came captain bill still paced
the bridge hatches were opened and
huge packing cases were put on deck-
cases supposed to contain mining ma-
chinery and they might have as far
as their weight was concerned

  the men worked swiftly silently
like men used to such labor senor
guerrero was among them more
nervous than ever continually rubbing
his hands together his eyes sparkling
with excitement it was pitch-dark
and the lights of the pursuing gunboat
could not be seen

  an hour or two passed and the nose
of the amingo was turned toward the
distant mexican shore

  in the cabin below jack connor slept
in an adjoining cabin wild norene lay
in a berth her tempest of tears at an
end and sally wood sat beside her
bathing the girls swollen face and tell-
ing her of jack connor

   i heard it all-that night she was
saying  ive known jack connor for
some time he never looks at a
woman and i knew by the way he
acted that night that he never would
look at a woman unless that woman
i

was you i could read him like a book
you should have seen him hurl the men
away and prohibit them mentioning the
girl he had met on commercial street
even though they did not say your
name

   he didnt know your name then
if he had hed never have spoken of
wild norene as he did a short time
later

   i know-i know norene said
 he wasnt speaking of me he was
speaking of the girl he thought i must
be

   and he-he loves you i am sure
said sally wood

  she looked away as she said it and
there was an expression of pain in her
face

   i know he is clean and honest
she went on

   you must be in love with him
yourself norene muttered

  sally hesitated before she an-
swered

   but hes never looked at me twice
-with any interest she said  he-
he feels sorry for me i suppose i
have a share in his sympathy and per-
haps his pity but not in his love

  norene thought it best to change the
subject

   do you suppose youll ever meet
the other - rineji  she asked
 what are you going to do if you
meet him  

   i dont know sally answered
 ive had thoughts of revenge for
years but i never decided how id take
it ive thought id find a way when
i found him we never know what
well do do we when we meet the per-
son weve hated for years  

   he may be on garzas boat sug-
gested norene

   in that case i hope ill not meet
him just now for that would mean dan-
ger for you and your uncle

  norene got up from the berth and
walked across to the port-hole to stare
out at the blackness of the night

  her uncle thered be another
scene with him she knew and she

was firm in her decision to leave the
amingo as soon as the vessel was in a
united states port again she had
meant it when she said she would not
sail with her uncle again until he
turned honest

  the amingo was steaming toward
the coast without lights on the
bridge captain bill adams searched
the horizon with his night - glass try-
ing to locate the gunboat wondering
whether she had gone on south past
the place where the amingo had turned
her nose toward the shore

  and then from a masthead captain
bill caused two red lights to be dis-
played for an instant then extin-
guished then displayed again guer-
rero stood beside him and they
watched in the direction of the coast

  another hour passed the lights
winking their signal now and then and
finally the answer came-two green
lights that blinked ahead in the dark-
ness

  captain bill rang for half speed and
for a few minutes there was an ex-
change of signals between the vessel
and the shore

   i want the gunboat to come up just
after the cargo is landed and you are
safe ashore captain bill told guer-
rero

   it is a risky business seiior

   well carry it off all right you
remember your instructions

   everything shall be done as you
wish seiior

   well go below in a moment
then

  the red lights had disappeared from
the masthead on the distant shore one
green light blinked as a signal and a
guide

  the amingo crept nearer and near-
er then stopped and the anchor was
let go

  captain adams and guerrero de-
scended to the deck a few whispered
orders to the men and a boat went over
the side and the crew began letting
down the first heavy packing-case

  the stopping of the vessel had awa-

kened connor and he left his cabin to
meet captain adams and guerrero at
the head of the companionway

   youd better stay in the cabin the
captain told him with a grin  but
you can go on deck if you wish

   i beg your pardon sir is the deck
to be left without an officer 

   go on deck by all means if you
think an officer necessary the captain
retorted grinning again then walked
to his cabin with guerrero following
close behind him

  connor sprang to the deck and
looked about him he saw that a boat
had been lowered and that a heavy
packing-case was being let down

  he searched the sea but did not see
the lights of any craft nothing to in-
dicate the presence of the gunboat

   what are you doing here   he
demanded of the men near the boat

   capns orders sir

  just what are the capns orders 
he demanded

  the man did not answer but turned
to grasp a line connor gripped him
by the shoulder and whirled him
around

  answer me you scum and be civil
about it  he roared

  by way of reply the man struck
the blow grazed connors shoulder

  you would would you youd
strike an officer would you  

  as he spoke one fist shot out and
the sailor struck the deck like a dead
man but connor found others upon
him they grasped his arms tried to
trip him rained blows upon his head
and face and breast

  morgan sprang across the deck to
the mates assistance in an instant
he too had been conquered

  both were carried to a mast and
lashings appeared as if by magic
kicking trying to strike struggling
to be free did not avail the crew left
their work at the boat to help

  a moment-and connor and mor-
gan were lashed securely to the mast
so that they could move neither hand
nor foot
wild norene



   capns orders grinned one of
the men as they started back across the
deck

    youll suffer for this you dogs 
connor cried

  they gave him no reply they hur-
ried back to the boat and began low-
ering away another packing - case
they worked by only one dim light
that was shielded so there would be
no reflection in the distance of the
open sea they talked in whispers

  connor and morgan struggled at
their bonds but the sailors had done
their work well and escape was im-
possible	

   theyre landin th contraband
morgan whispered

   yes

   do you suppose it was capns or-
ders 

   yes

   but he hasnt come back on deck
there aint anybody to boss the men
 they dont need a boss snorted
connor  theyve got their orders
and theyve done this work before
then he saw guerrero who had
come slowly across the deck and was
standing before them

   we are sending the playthings to
the ragged ignorant fools guerrero
said  and you my friend will soon
be one of those men who tell no tales
he turned and walked toward the
men working at the packing-cases

   lively men  he called  youll
be remembered with something extra
apiece if we come out all right

    aye aye sir  replied the men in
chorus

   easy with that case there those
lines need more grease they are ma-
king a devil of a noise 

   capns orders muttered connor
to morgan  you notice dont you
whos commanding the ship  

   but wheres th capn   morgan
demanded why isnt he on deck
id think hed want to boss this job
himself with a gunboat liable to poke
her nose at us out of th dark any min-
ute you dont suppose guerrero has

done for th capn do you you dont
suppose th men have mutinied and
turned to guerrero  

    i do not replied connor  i have
an idea well see the captain presently
and ive an idea that hes playing
some sort of a game

  then there was silence for a time
save for the creaking of the lines and
the scraping of the cases as they were
lowered against the side and low
oaths of men who smashed fingers or
cut hands and the soft-spoken orders
of senor guerrero

  from the dark behind them after a
time came a whisper

   dont speak dont attract their
attention  

  connor felt his bonds give and knew
a knife had slashed them another
slash of a knife and he was free
morgan too was being favored and
without making noise they turned
slowly and peered around the mast at
their deliverer

  it was wild norene

chapter viii

caught

there had been a peculiar scene
enacted in the captains cabin
entering it with senor guerrero cap-
tain bill adams had closed the door
behind them locked it and draped a
towel over a crack in it through which
the light filtered

  well the captain asked then
smiling

  they sat down at the table opposite
each other

  you think theres no danger
guerrero asked

   none for you senor the cargo
will be put ashore and you will go
with it everything seems to be in
proper order as for the cargo itself
- you sjiipped it from portland to
the lumber-camp in boxes labeled ma-
chinery and we picked it up as we
dropped down the columbia to as-
toria


all-story cavalier weekly

   as far as i know i am carrying-
for you certain machinery if you de-
sire to have it landed at this spot on
the coast well and good-you know
your own business

  the captain grinned and puffed at
his cigar senor guerrero grinning
also arose and turned his back lifted
up his vest parted his shirt and so
reached the opening of a money-belt
he wore next his skin from this he
took folded bills

  he turned to the captain again and
counted out a certain sum the cap-
tain counted the bills in his turn

   correct he said  one moment
please

  behind a panel in the wall of the
cabin the captain had a strong safe
he opened this now put the money
in it and twirled the combination
knob again guerrero was half - way
to the door when he turned

   a moment senor said the cap-
tain  i wish you to do me a favor
 certainly

  captain adams took a coil of rope
from a comer and advanced to the
middle of the cabin

   the men already are moving your
cargo and have been told to obey your
orders in the matter ill not go on
deck again at present senor guer-
rero you will kindly take this rope
bind me securely and place me in my
bunk then tie me in so that i cannot
move

   i beg your pardon  

   i have a reason for this unusual
request believe me youll get your
cargo ashore before the gunboat
comes - if it comes afterward and
finds me i do not care i have a little
game of my own to play

   it is a great risk captain

   which i alone am taking youll
do as i ask  

  guerrero complied he bound the
captain securely except that one hand
was left free and in it captain bill
held a revolver so that when he was
placed in the bunk he could cover any
one who entered the cabin the cap-

tain was chuckling at the look of
amazement on guerreros face as the
senor finished the task

   now go on deck senor he di-
rected  and see that all your cargo
is landed properly after the last
load send the men back to the schoon-
er and well consider that weve said
farewell if you need me again you
know how to find me

   si senor adios 

   adios 

  guerrero unlocked the door and
went out to close it after him as the
captain had directed and hurry back
to the deck

  norene with sally wood in the ad-
joining cabin knew that the vessel had
stopped and that the cargo was being
unloaded she knew captain bill had
entered his cabin with guerrero and
when she saw guerrero go back to
the deck and leave the captain alone
she determined on an interview with
her uncle she opened the door of his
cabin and entered to stand aghast at
what she saw

    uncle bill  she exclaimed start-
ing forward  who has done this  
 stay where you are  he com-
manded

   i was going to unbind you

   	i dont want it 

   what can you mean   she asked
she stepped toward him wonder-
ment in her face

  captain adams laughed at her ap-
pearance

   go back to your cabin he or-
dered  remain there too this is
not your affair

   you-you are unloading the cargo
-the contraband   she asked

   we are-if you want to know

   but you-the captain-tied here
at such a time and the gunboat-
 this is a little scheme said cap-
tain adams  to get square with the
man who called you an unmentionable
woman and said he could tame you
he thought his words would touch
her and they did but not in the way
he imagined
wild norene



  for norene had been thinking the
past hour

   i have told you she said  that
i blame you for that more than i
blame him

  girl

  i do and now you are breaking
the law again at this minute and in
addition placing me in a position
where i may be insulted by the officer
of a mexican gunboat

   so youre taking the part of the
man who insulted you against your
own uncle are you   the captain de-
manded

   i am taking nobodys part-but i
am not blaming a man who should not
be blamed

   anger flared in the captains face
let me tell you this he ex-
claimed  if you want to overlook
what this man said you may ill not
he insulted me too he called me
blackbirder smuggler-

  and havent you been

  the girls retort increased the cap-
tains anger had he been free at the
moment he might have struck her

  for an instant he half choked with
rage then he looked up at her and
snarled -

    if ive got to tame you girl ill
do it after this business is over he
said  but ill fix mr jack connor
first want to know why i hadguer-
rero tie me up like this eh because
about the time the cargo is landecl and
safe over the first hill the gunboat will
put in an appearance the schooner 
be seized and ill have a story to
tell

   what do you mean   she asked
with quick suspicion

   ill be found bound and helpless
ill explain how jack connor shipped
machinery with me to be landed here
-mining machinery ill say that
just before we sailed i lost my other
mate and signed on this jack connor
who told me hed go on as far as ma-
zatlan in that capacity then return to
his mines that he engaged to do this
because he was in a hurry to get the

machinery through and i couldnt find
another good mate in a hurry
well

   and ill say that just before we
got to this cove he admitted to me that
the cargo wasnt mining machinery
but arms and ammunition for the rev-
olutionists that i rebuked him and
said id go on to mazatlan hand him
over to the authorities and give them
the contraband cargo

   he bound me here left me help-
less took the bridge brought the ship
to anchor and ordered the men to dis-
charge cargo they did it because i
wasnt on deck and he was the mate
and of course theyd obey his orders
understand girl

   ill be released and well sail on
with the amingo-and the man who
slandered you and insulted me will be
shot by a firing squad the cargo will
be landed and ill have kept my word
with guerrero i win--and connor
loses i said id do it and ill keep
my word

   oh  she gasped  youd do
that youd send him to his death-
and for nothing youd blame him
for the crime you are committing

   i said id do it and i keep my
word no man can call me a black-
birder and get away with it if you
want to overlook his insult to you the
more shame to you but ill not over-
look his insult to me 

   youd not dare 

  the captain laughed unpleasantly

   i promised id let him off of
course if he tamed you before we got
the cargo landed if hed made you
love him agree to marry him but
its too late for that now itll not do
any good to say you love him just to
save him if youre willing to admit
before all the crew that this man has
tamed you-if youll admit he insult-
ed you and you loved him for it-
the captain laughed raucously again
sudden fire flashed in the eyes of
wild norene a swift movement for-
ward and she had wrenched the re-
volver from his grasp-and captain

bill adams outwitted for the first
time in his life found himself bound
and helpless in his bunk scarcely able
to move his subterfuge turned against
him

   what are you going to do  he
cried a feeling of dread in him

   im going to play fair  she an-
swered  im going to save the man
youd send to death and im going
to stop this unlawful act ill see that
the men stop unloading that cargo
that the amingo runs out to sea
again-

   girl

    if i must fight you uncle ill fight
well im wild norene you know
youve often boasted no man could
outwit me that in an emergency
aboard ship i was worth any six of
the crew and any two officers well
ill try to live up to your boasting 

   you dare-

   it is my wits against yours she
reminded him  you are helpless
but it is your own doing i didnt
bind you and tie you in your bunk
your little trick has proved a boom-
erang

   swear-nobody will pay atten-
tion call-the men will not answer
for theyre busy im fighting you
with your own sort of weapons but
im fighting for the right and youre
fighting for the wrong 

  his curses ringing in her ears she
sped from the cabin and hurried to her
own a moment and she had ex-
plained to sally wood and sally fol-
lowed her to the deck

  the men were loading the first boat
-guerrero was commanding them
connor and morgan were lashed to the
mast and helpless

  sally remained in the shadow and
norene sped across the deck and with
her knife slashed the ropes that bound
the mate and his friend there was
not time to explain and norene spoke
but few words

   we must stop them and get the
ship away from the coast there is
danger-

  already she was speeding across the
deck with connor and morgan at her
heels sally wood remained where
she had been standing watching the
scene in the dim light of the one lan-
tern that burned

  norene stepped within the circle of
light just as the last case for the first
boatload was being lowered a pretty
picture she made her eyes flashing
her hair blowing in the wind a look
of grim determination on her face the
revolver gripped in her hand

   stop  she commanded and as one
man the members of the crew turned
to look at her  bring that case on
deck again-all of them hurry
get up the anchor and put straight out
to sea 

  connor stood beside her

    lively men  he cried

  he had not forgotten how they had
handled him a short time before his
fists were clenched and the look in
his eyes promised ill for the one who
hesitated

   up with that case 

   were not takin orders from
you  one of the men growled

  connor sprang forward and that
man struck the deck felled by a single
blow guerrero who had stood to one
side astonished seemed to come to
life

   throttle him  he shrieked
 lash him to that mast again 

  the men sprang to obey the cap-
tain had told them to obey guerrero
and disregard the mate

  but norene stepped before connor
and the weapon in her hand covered
them

   do as i commanded  she or-
dered

  my dear young lady it was
guerrero speaking  there must be
some mistake this work must not
be delayed-for there is danger it
must be done as swiftly as possible

   there is no mistake  she said
you men-do as i ordered 

  one of them stepped forward and
touched his forehead
wild norene



   capns orders miss under favor
that we unload cargo and take orders
from senor guerrero

   the captains orders have been
changed  she said

   if th capn-

   the captain is ill cannot come on
deck

  guerrero cursed and stepped to-
ward her

   enough of this nonsense  he
cried to your work men you
know the skippers orders

   theyve been changed  norene
said again

    ill see 

  guerrero turned to start to the
cabin the revolver in the hands of
wild norene covered him

   youll stay here  she said

  guerrero his face purple with rage
turned toward her threateningly but
he did not speak to her-he faced the
men

   do as i ordered  he commanded
 hurry with that cargo do you
want that gunboat down on you
-want to go to a mexican prison
want to be stood against a wall and
shot  

  the men began to murmur they
could not understand the situation

  connor sensed the clash in author-
ity and he didnt trust the men he
stepped into the circle of light again

   back with that case  he ordered

   we aint takin orders from you-
capn told us not to obey you 

  again norene stepped before him
and with her weapon threatened the
crew

  you men know me she said
if youll not obey the mate because
of the capns orders youll obey me 

  the weapon spit fire a bullet
crashed into the deck at the feet of
the foremost man

  guerrero had been watching for his
chance now he sprang upon her in an
attempt to wrest the revolver from her
hand

  but guerrero did not know wild
norene a quick step she gave to one

side and the butt of the heavy
weapon struck the senor behind the
ear and felled him

   bring back those cases now  she
commanded again and the men turned
to obey

  and out of the blackness that hung
over the sea came a tiny finger of
light that flashed toward the shore
broadened and finally bathed the deck
of the amingo in its glory making it
as light as if the sunshine had played
there

  like statues they stood those on
the amingos deck-statues whose
faces expressed fear and horror and
anger and hopelessness-while the
search-light revealed to all their
guilt

a crash out there in the night a
flash  of vivid flame and a shell
shrieked over the amingos bow and
rushed on toward the shore

  the gunboat had arrived

       chapter ix
       what riney did

t moment they stood while the
gunboat crept nearer and in the
silence they could hear the slow beat-
ing of her screws the creaking of
davits as boats were prepared to be
lowered away

  that pitiless light revealed every-
thing on the amingos deck a dash
below an attempt to get arms a move-
ment even might call forth a shell that
would crash into the vessel or the rig-
ging or scatter death among those on
deck

  senor guerreros face was white as
chalk and his teeth chattered none
knew better than he what capture
meant-that there would be no red
tape about the matter

 a trip to the shore-a squad-
flashes of fire-then the hereafter

  the search-light and the whining
shell had struck fear to the hearts of
the men instinctively one of them
put up his hands as if he had been

covered with a revolver others
trembled some showed acute nervous-
ness some growled angrily

  sally wood was behind a mast
where the light did not strike her
wild norene still clutching the re-
volver turned and faced the glare of
the light her face expressed no fear
only patient resignation

  two men had been below in the
small boat and now they came scram-
bling to the deck to join their fellows

   well be shot-shot  one of
them was mumbling

   shot by greasers 

  the search-light had startled jack
connor too for a moment he had
stood silent a tumult of thoughts in
his mind he too knew what it
meant

  then he thought of noreneand of
sally wood he knew how the men
regarded norene they would hold
her equally to blame with her uncle

  for norene it probably meant
prison or death or worse no cour-
tesy would be shown her no respect

  connor looked at her where she
stood gazing into the face of the light
love for her swelled his heart -

  this was the time to make the fight
he decided even if she detested him
that did not prohibit him making a
fight for her sake true love even
when hopeless calls forth sacrifice

  now they could hear oars creaking
the boats from the gunboat were
coming in a moment men from her
would be swarming over the deck of
the amingo taking prisoners

  and that search-light held them in
thrall and behind it connor knew
were big guns ready for firing when
an officer gave the word

  yet it would do no good to stand
and wait for capture and what cap-
ture meant a fight seemed hopeless
but a fight would relieve the tension

  and always even in the most hope-
less fight there is the slim chance
that the god of battle may prove
capricious 

  arms where are they con-

nor asked in a hoarse whisper with-
out making a move

  one of the men answered him in a
similar manner

   we all have em-in th fore-
castle sir and th capn has some
if th capn was here-

  	 pay attention  connor said
 when i give the word rush for the
forecastle and arm yourselves miss
adams you go to the companionway
youd best go below and take sally
wood with you you guerrero may
do as you blamed please 

  they waited the boats from the
gunboat came nearer

  now cojinor shouted

  his shout seemed to rouse them
with cries and curses the men dashed
across the deck some of them shield-
ing their faces from the strong light
many of them expecting to hear the
crash of a shell

  norene darted to the companion-
way dragging sally wood with her
connor and morgan ran with the men
they gained the forecastle and re-
volvers and knives were torn from
bunks and from the wall

  it flashed over connor again that
this was to be a hopeless combat
even if they overcame the boarding
party there was the gunboat ready to
sink them and the amingo was
anchored

  but the men were frenzied now
prison or execution stared them in the
face and they were the sort whod
rather die fighting

  out on the deck again they grouped
near the bowsprit holding their
weapons ready trying to keep in the
shadows as much as possible

   wait until theyre on deck then
mix connor was shouting the
gunboat wont dare fire then for fear
of hitting her own men

  the small boats reached the
amingos side on the gunboat a
bugle was blowing a signal and some
officer was trying to megaphone a
warning to the boarding party

  then they came over the side in two
wild norene



places a swarm of some thirty men
two officers fn command garza him-
self was there intent on taking the
filibuster and guerrero

  and connor saw that riney was
with him

  riney had a score to settle with
captain bill adams-he had a score
to settle with connor for that beating
in the astoria resort

  a chorus of yells and shrieks a
volley of shot a fusillade from the
gunboats men and then they were at
it hand-to-hand on the deck in the
glaring illumination of the search-light

  the men of the amingo were fight-
ing for liberty and life the men from
the gunboat were urged on by their
officers

  connor found himself in the thick
of it with faithful morgan at his side
fighting like a wild man with his knife
revolvers cracked in their ears ex-
ploding powder burned their faces

  senor guerrero already was a pris-
oner for garza had attended to him
first

  amidships they fought but the men
from the gunboat by the weight of
their superior numbers were driving
the amingos men aft

  connor saw morgan slip and fall
but he was up in an instant but some
of the mexicans were between them
now and the friends were denied the
advantage of fighting back to back

  a bellow of rage assailed connors
ears-and he faced riney

  now my fine buck riney
shouted and followed it with a volley
of curses

  it was a hand-to-hand conflict
connors revolver was empty he had
but a knife riney had a revolver at
his hip but he fought with a knife
too for he was handy with the
weapon and he was a man who liked
to see his foes blood

  they clashed parted clashed again
now slipping on the slippery deck now
fighting toward one rail and now to-
ward the other but always going aft

  connor found he had no mean an-

tagonist-he knew he was fighting for
his life

   rineys knife found his side but the
wound was not deep in turn he
ripped the mans forearm save for
them the battle was at an end and
the men of the amingo had been
vanquished

  some of the mexicans rushed to-
ward them

   back this is my fight  riney
roared at them

  garza ordered them back riney
had stipulated that he was to have a
chance at connor alone he knew
connor had been shanghaied by cap-
tain adams and that was why he had
sailed with the gunboat

   riney was the sort that doesnt for-
give a beating

  again they clashed fought around
and around both tiring connor called
forth his last ounce of strength and
forced his foe again he felt the knife
bite into his side again he drew
blood on his adversary

  then a lucky stroke came for him
and rineys knife flew from his hand
and over the side

  connor too weak to follow up his
advantage too generous to take the
advantage of an unarmed antagonist
perhaps staggered backward gasping
for breath

  but riney with a cry of rage
sprang backward too his hand dived
at his hip came up holding the
revolver

   now curse you 

  two screams rang in connors ears
-for behind him at the mouth of
the companionway norene and sally
wood had been watching the combat

  a rush across the deck a body be-
fore his own- the crack of rineys
weapon and a scream of pain as its
hot messenger struck home cries of
horror from more than one throat

  on the deck at connors feet a
stricken human being who had saved
him

  it was not wild norene adams
for though she had rushed forward

another had been before her it was
sally wood

  the men were still riney still
cursing walked forward to look at his
work

   some fool woman  he muttered

  connor had knelt beside her and
was trying to lift her norene stood
beside him and the wild girl of the
sea had tears in her eyes sally
woods eyes had opened she looked
up at connor and smiled

  then she looked at riney standing
less than six feet away the smoking
revolver still in his hand

   ive-found-you  she gasped
 and this-is my-revenge per-
haps youll think-of me-the next
time you plan to desert a woman and
child-or rob-an old man

  the man was staring at her his
revolver dropped to the deck a look
of horror came into his face

   you left me-to starve she
whispered  left me-your wife-
and your baby too and you took
every cent my father had-my old
father-who suffered from hunger be-
fore he died-because of what you
did ive always said id find you-
and have my revenge and this-is
my revenge w if e-murderer 

  she screamed the last words at him
and the man staggered backward hold-
ing his hands before his face

  the mexicans realizing the drama
they were seeing enacted stood like
statues and regarded riney with
scorn and sudden hatred

  sally wood looked up at jack con-
nor again and tried to smile

   jack she said so low that he
could scarcely hear  i think-i
loved you-a little but there is-
norene-

  and with that she died

  norene was sobbing as connor got
slowly to his feet and looked at riney
the expression in the mates face was
not pretty to see

  give the cur a knife connor
cried to garza  let the wife-mur-
derer stand before me again 

  but garza knew a better way

   the man had committed a mur-
der and we are in mexican waters
he said he stepped up and clapped
a hand on rineys shoulder

   irons here  he commanded and
two of his men stepped forward and
obeyed

chapter x

when death is faced

jhe gunboat was sending a shower
of shells toward the shore where
the revolutionists had been awaiting
the landing of the cargo

  on the amingos deck another scene
was being enacted the cases that had
been lowered to the small boat were
on deck again guarded by the mexi-
cans-captain bill adams had been
 caught with the goods

  they had searched the cabins and
had found captain bill bound and
helpless in his bunk cursing at the top
of his voice in an effort to attract at-
tention

  this had puzzled garza and now
all of them were on deck and he was
trying to work out a solution to the
puzzle guerrero and riney had been
sent to the gunboat as prisoners sally
woodss body had been carried to one
side and covered

  captain adams connor wild no-
rene and the men of the xcrew stood
under guard awaiting the pleasure of
the mexican officer

  ill make him suffer for it  cap-
tain bill was shouting  mutiny on
the high seas make me a lawbreaker
will he

   calm yourself captain adams
and let us get at the straight of it
garza ordered

  the captain sputtered a bit as if
in rage and then complied darting
glances of venom at connor mean-
while

job he said in the first place

never into mexico only into little
two-by-four countries of central
america i stopped that sort of busi-
ness some years ago im an honest
skipper handling lumber principally

   i was loading lumber in portland
when i was approached by a member
of the junta he said his name was
gonzales - thats spanish for smith
i guess he made his little proposi-
tion without saying exactly where the
stuff was to be landed and i turned
him down flat-told him i was done
with that sort of thing

  garza grinned

   im telling the truth as youll
soon have reason to believe i went
on loading lumber at portland this
man jack connor by name came to
me one day and said he understood i
was going to carry lumber to mazat-
lan he said he was a sailorman but
had come into a bit of money and was
buying an interest in a mexican mine

   he had some machinery he want-
ed to ship part of it was in a lumber
camp on the columbia he said would
i carry it for him and land it here-
at this place

   i told him yes everything seemed
all right and we stopped on our way
down the river to astoria and took his
stuff aboard my papers are all right
and the packing-cases look like ma-
chinery to me

   i went on to astoria and tied up
to sail a couple of days later after id
taken on some supplies there i met
guerrero he wanted passage to ma-
zatlan and i told him i didnt carry
passengers he offered me big money
because he said he was in a hurry and
didnt want to go to frisco and wait
for a regular steamer i agreed to
take him

   i can see now how they worked it
and how they made it look guerrero
hung around me and i suppose you
spotted him and thought i was carry-
ing contraband my old mate that
fellow riney had a grudge against me
but i kept him because he was a good
man

   one day in astoria guerrero told
me my mate wasnt honest i asked
what he meant he said you were in
astoria trying to lease a small ship for
your government that you were the
whole thing in mazatlan and were a
dirty grafter he said riney was to
meet you and the two of you were to
work up some scheme to libel the
amingo at mazatlan and riney was
to have a share of the graft

   i think he said the idea was to con-
fiscate the schooner and divide the
money you would have paid out if
youd bought a ship

   wait a moment now before you
smile like that i went to the resort
with guerrero where riney was to
meet you you began talking and be-
fore youd got down to bedrock this
man jack connor pitched into riney
for some reason and beat him up ri-
ney saw me watching him and i think
he guessed i was on to him for he
sneaked away

   then this man connor told me he
would act as my mate until we got to
mazatlan then run back to this cove
on some little boat i was to deduct
regular mates wages from what i
charged him for handling his machin-
ery i was anxious to sail and i took
him up

   well

   let me get this straight now said
the captain  rineys wife was a
stowaway came aboard expecting to
find him and make things hot for him
-so that explains her presence

   we turned in toward the cove last
night and i went down to the cabin
with connor for him to pay me for
hauling his stuff that was the ar-
rangement he was to go on to ma-
zatlan though then come back i
wanted my freight money before that
cargo was put ashore of course

   when we got to the cabin and i
was looking for my papers he knocked
me down bound me and tied me in my
bunk then he came on deck and
brought the schooner here to anchor
and began getting the cargo overside


all-story cavalier weekly

he boasted to me when he tied me
that the cargo was arms and ammu-
nition that he was getting a pretty
penny for running it in and that i had
been fooled and was getting just ordi-
nary freight rates

   the men obeyed him of course
for he was the mate and they didnt
ask questions because i didnt come on
deck then the gunboat came and
you had the row connor led the
fighting didnt he because he knew
vvliat -he was up against and you
found me bound in my berth didnt
you 

   connor is the man you want hes
your filibuster punish him for it and
welcome for he made my ship a dis-
honest vessel in spite of me you can
take the rest of us to mazatlan for
trial if you want i can prove my in-
nocence question the crew if you
like

  garza grinned again

   that story doesnt sound good

   why did you find me bound then 
why wouldnt i be on deck putting up
a fight you know my history do
you think youd have taken this ship so
easily if id been running guns 

   theres something in that the
mexican officer said

  he turned and looked at connor

   what have you to say   he de-
manded

  connor had been thinking swiftly
captain bill had plotted well he
could send connor before an execution
squad

   ive nothing to say connor
growled	

   you admit it is true 

   im not talking 

  garza faced captain bill again

  if this is true i am glad for your
sake he said  but im not certain
connor was still thinking either
he would pay the penalty else captain
bill and norene would pay it he
didnt care for captain bill but no-
rene was innocent had been horrified
when she discovered what her uncle
was doing

  perhaps thered be some chance of
escape after captain bill got norene
and the amingo away

   its up to me  he told garza sud-
denly what the captain says is
true but you havent executed me
yet by a long shot-

   so  garza cried  iron him
men hes tried to run guns for the
last time 

  two of the men started toward
connor

  norene her face white stepped be-
fore him connor never forgot how
she looked just then

   wait  she cried  it isnt true
my uncle has lied to you he alone
is guilty

   wait - listen to me he shang-
haied this man in astoria-shanghaied
him and one of his friends too this
man had spoken lightly of me my uncle
swore hed punish him for it guer-
rero tied ihy uncle at his orders my
uncle admitted to me what he was go-
ing to do-that he was going to send
this man to his death and go free him-
self

   girl  the captain screeched

   its true-true you shant have
an innocent man executed you must
face your crime yourself im telling
the truth senor  she added facing
garza again  ask guerrero-he has
no reason to hate this man but he has
reason to hate my uncle now because
he failed to land the cargo go back
to the states and find who bought the
arms and cartridges 

  she was sobbing as she spoke for
she began to realize the consequences
of what she was saying

  connor realized too with horror
the girl was freeing him but con-
demning her uncle-and perhaps her-
self

  girl-girl youve just killed
me  said captain bill surprise and
horror in his voice

  garza was looking at him search-
ingly

   this matter can be investigated
and the guilt fixed he said  i
wild norene



think captain adams that your little
plot has been in vain

  captain adams cursed cursed his
niece cursed connor cursed the mexi-
can officer and his men and senor
guerrero most of all

   silence  garza commanded and
called a subordinate to him  take
charge of this schooner and follow the
gunboat to mazatlan a squad here
bind these prisoners well and have
them taken aboard the gunboat
watch the captain carefully and have
his guard a double one senor con-
nor too and the girl-

   take the girl aboard the gunboat
but keep her in irons shes as bad
as her uncle shes known in every
port shes slippery as an eel

  two of the men caught connor just
as he launched himself at the mexican
officer

   watch the girl closely  garza
went on ignoring the american  i
dont know why shes turned against
the captain but that makes no differ-
ence you all heard her testimony
here well make her repeat it-and
itll send her uncle before a firing
squad lively now 

   you dare lay hands on me 
norene had ceased her weeping
her tiny hands were clenched at her
sides her eyes blazed

  you curs she cried i ac-
cused my uncle to save an honest man
not because i hated my fathers
brother and hes a better man than
any five of you hes an american
and im an american and you can
punish us for such an offense if we
are guilty-but youll treat us decently
until were proved so

   youre going too fast my fine
mexican officer-entirely too fast
aboard an american ship we have
a right to stop here and land cargo
havent we  

   scarcely when that cargo is con-
traband of such a nature my dear
young lady garza smilingly remind-
ed her

   were lost i suppose but well

bother you as much as we can  she
went on  youll take every step in
a legal manner perhaps before you
remove us to the gunboat youd better
be sure the cargo is contraband not
all-of us will be executed-and the
man who is not you may be sure will
see that you suffer if every step is not
legal

  garza smiling bowed before her
with fine sarcasm

   very well scnorita he said  a
squad smash in those cases and well
have a look if youll pardon me
senorita i was about to do so to make
the evidence sure

  she turned toward her uncle weep-
ing but he repulsed her

  connor clasped her in his arms it
was all foolery he knew theyd be
taken aboard the gunboat there would
be a farce of a trial in mazatlan with
the country in such a state the trial
would be over and theyd be executed
before a united states consul could
even make a protest

  but he held wild norene in his arms
for the moment and that was because
she sought a refuge in her grief not
because of love even as he thought
these things she drew away from him
and stood in the circle of mexicans
watching garzas squad smash in the
tops of the cases

  she tried to explain to herself why
she had not let connor be taken to his
death while her uncle escaped what
was connor to her

  she answered herself that she had
done it because of the dread of seeing
an honest man suffer for the crime of
another-and because she had real love
for her uncle after all that he was her
ideal and she didnt want that ideal
shattered didnt want her uncle to
lower himself by putting the blame on
another

  it was over now she thought
prison perhaps death-at least for her
uncle and his crew and perhaps for
herself or if she escaped there
would be endless years to remember
that she had condemned her fathers

brother with her words-the man who
had been like a second father to her

  a cry from garza caused all to turn
toward him the lid of the first case
was off here were no rifles no
cartridges-here were chunks of scrap
iron stones packed with heavy
paper

  a smothered oath came from the
mexican

   smash them in-all of them  he
commanded in his own language

  they waited in consternation-cap-
tain bill norene connor morgan
and the crew

  case after case was opened-all
scrap iron and heavy paper and stones
some one laughed hoarsely some
one cursed

  it was a miracle almost norene
had not known she had spoken as
she did without reason on the verge
of hysteria

  garza ordered his men below-but
they found no contraband

   i scarcely think youll trouble us
further norene said to him when he
returned to the deck  by the way
you and your men in the mexican
service are on the deck of a ship flying
the united states flag youve fired
a shot across our bows attacked our
crew seized the ship the united
states government shall hear of this 

  captain bill adams coming from
his lethargy suddenly realized the
situation

   off my ship you scum  he
roared into your boats take us
to mazatlan will you not without
evidence off my ship 

  garza was an officer who knew
when he was whipped he knew as
well as any man that captain bill
adams had put into that cove to land
contraband

  he wasnt sure who was fooled-
captain bill or himself-but he had
an inkling that it was both

  with poor grace he ordered his men
into their boats after releasing the
members of the amingos crew he

the

would have to be satisfied with riney
a murderer and with guerrero who
was wanted on other charges of in-
citing rebellion

  and down in his soul he hoped he
never would hear from the incident
again

  the boats pulled away the search-
light died out captain bill adams
roared out an order and men sprang
to touch match to the lights of the
amingo

  forgetting the predicament the
certain death he had faced captain
bill was himself again

  tend to the wounded he
roared  and bless the swindlers that
sold the junta scrap iron for rifles 

  connor stretched his cramped
muscles and made his way from the
forecastle to the deck he had been
dressing a bad wound in morgans leg
the amingo was on her way again
and day had broken and the sea
danced in the sunshine

  the mexican coast was red with
poinsettias in the distance the gun-
boat steamed toward the south

  wild norene stood beside the rail
looking at the distant warship

   connor stepped up beside her

   why did you do it   he asked
softly  why didnt you let me die
let your uncle live you didnt know
when you spoke that the junta had
been fooled that it would turn out
such a farce why did you do it
norene 

   i didnt want to think my uncle
would hide behind another man put
his guilt on another man even if to
do otherwise meant his death

  and that was the only reason
he asked

   that - and because - because-
maybe - wild norene has been
tamed she whispered

  and the man at the wheel whistled
softly as she turned and went into
connors arms in token of sweet sur-
render

the air in the long local room
was thick with smoke from
brands of ten - cent tobacco
burning under forced draft twenty
typewriters mauled by a score of
earnest young men gave up a racket
reminiscent of a flock of curtis bi-
planes swooping by the grand stand
the floor was covered with a deep
layer of crumpled newspapers through
which office-boys plowed at frequent
intervals

  at the horseshoe copy-desk the
readers humped closer to their work
flattened out almost inside his huge
roll-top desk the little city editor pre-
sented the appearance of one awho
bore the responsibilities of the universe
on his shoulders

  industry-thats the word for the
scene

  at his table near the rail the assist-
ant city editor dropped a handful of
galley-proofs and groaned then with
a fierce gesture he pressed his fists
against his brows and for a moment
rested his tired eyes

   mason  he yelled swinging
around in his swivel chair to com-
mand the long room

  no response

  again he shouted-with the same
absence of results with a few warm

  	ii a-s c

words in his wake he flung open the
gate in the rail and strode to the rear
of the room

  there in a space from which the
discarded exchanges had been hurried-
ly kicked mason was slowly gyrating
locked in the close embrace of howard
nutting the imperturbable millionaire
reporter

   nah-nix chas nutting was
saying  dont hop like a flea with a
stone bruise-keep your feet on the
floor its a sort of shuffle-toe-heel
toe-heel toe-heel now relax a little
dont be so stiff-all right ta-da-da-
da tee-da-dee ti-dee-da and hum-i
ming the strains of  too much mus-
tard he backed the awkward mason
through the elementary movements of
the one-step

  with his hands on his hips his nose
wrinkled in eighteen places and a
double curl in his upper lip the as-
sistant city editor successfully depicted
supreme scorn as he watched the evo-
lutions of the two reporters

   bend your knees a little nutting
panted  dont get up on your toes
that way-youre no mordkin keep
your arm up-thats it-now try to get
into the music a little-tee-da-da-da

  then the assistant editor exploded
------  he shout-
ed  what the----

hey cut it out----

where do you guys think you are

good--- has the whole

town gone bugs over this blankety-
blank dancing

  mason and nutting parted suddenly
and turned to face the angry editor

  whats wrong joseph inquired
nutting innocently

 oh---  said the

assistant city editor and for a brief
instant was inarticulate then he
recovered and made up for lost time

   i didnt hear you yell joe said
mason-a short young man with a
very serious cast of countenance 

   no you were too busy with this
turkey-in-the-straw stuff what are
you framing up some stunt for
amateur night i dont blame you
much mason-but this skull nutting
-youre going to suffer mister
who me queried nutting
sweetly  why joseph-

   yes you snapped joe  you
put on your ear-laps and mittens and
see me right away ive got a nice
little job for you i was going to send
mason but you seem to have so much
energy-

   aw joe have a heart nutting
begged but joe walked away

  when nutting presented himself at
the rail a moment later joe handed
him a clipping from a morning paper

   i dont suppose you have read
this he said  it doesnt seem to
dawn on you that you are working for
a newspaper and ought to keep up with
the news anyhow we want pictures
of this venus person and we want em
quick hoist yoursdf over to the
family chateau and dont you show
your map in this dump again if you
come away without the pics

  nutting drew himself up very
grandly

   why dont you send some one
else   he demanded  im no pho-
tograph slooch-

   ah and joe grinned broadly
 quite right old top quite right i
realize that picture skirmishing is be-
neath you mr nutting but this case
presents - ah - ah - unusual difficul-
ties i picked you for the job because
you are husky

   it may be of interest to you to
know that the father of this young
lady is one battle - ship gorman
erstwhile middle - weight champion
pugilist now retired and living on his
income senor gorman i am in-
formed has lost none of his old time
prowess in fact hes a terror

  if you will incline your noble bean
slightly to the right you will see that
handsome young scribe pedro sulli-
van who wears a splendid black eye
presented to him this morning by herr
gorman now beat it nut - get
going 

   but joe my accident policy lapsed
yesterday- nutting started to pro-
test

   on your way said joe bending
over his desk  dont forget to ask
the girl if she stands for woman
suffrage and if you see the old man
get a few words from him on eu-
genics-

  nutting groaned and turned away

  a hurried perusal of the clipping
told him that miss isabel gorman a
member of the junior class at var-
nard had been pronounced by a world-
famous surgeon to be the best-formed
young lady in america miss gorman
so the story ran was not only perfectly
proportioned but was blessed with an
unusually beautiful face

  she attributed her exquisite figure
to her active interest in athletics a
tabulated comparison of miss gor-
mans measurements with those of the
immortal venus di milo occupied a
prominent place in the clipping

  as nutting read he straightened in-
stinctively and smiled

   wh-ee-ee he muttered  we-
this looks all right to me whos
afraid of her old man  i aint

  he stowed away the clipping then
nutting dances



brushed his coat and hat with unusual
care on his way out he paused be-
hind battered peter sullivan

   say pete-did you call on miss
gorman this morning 

  pieter looked up from his type-
writer one eye completely closed and
a sour expression on his face

   ah go to- he growled  are
you trying to kid me 

   no-im the next victim ysay
whats wrong with her father 

  peter fingered the space bar on his
typewriter

   theres nothing the matter with
his right-looka this lamp of mine
aint it a beaut  why i rang his bell
and told him that i was from the
chronicle and wanted pictures of his
daughter and an interview he tried
to close the door and when i stuck my
foot against it and tried to argue with
him he fired me down the steps he
absolutely refuses to let the papers
have pictures of his daughter says
he defies all the scribes in the world
to get under his guard j wish you
joy which do you prefer a motor
hearse or a black wagon pulled by
mustangs  

   i should worry said nutting
with an appropriate gesture

  after removing a few imaginary
lints from his coat he left the room
in the lobby of the building he con-
sulted the clipping

   what was her address  er-a
wealth of flaxen hair-one hundred
and forty pounds-forearm measure-
ment-er-er  hicks street
brooklyn-yes-yes-large blue eyes
oh i just hate this assignment he
said to himself

  hastening to the bridge station he
boarded a brooklyn subway express
as the train racketed under the river
he fell to planning a campaign he
wasnt afraid of her father-no not
he

   why if battle-ship puts up his
dukes to me ill lean on him and lean
on him hard he thought  ill tell
him  i hate to do this old scout but

you brought it on yourself now will
you be good   oh i dont anticipate
any particular trouble with gorman
pere

  howard nutting it may be ex-
plained was a tall husky blond
young man who had inherited a large
fortune after leaving college his
world seemed quite vacant and devoid
of incident

  it was in the hope of finding ad-
venture that he secured a berth on the
chrotiicle city staff where although
he did not prove an eminently brilliant
journalist his never-failing good
spirits loyalty and willingness to  try
anything once  endeared him to his
associates

  when the train stopped at borough
hall nutting jumped out and made
his way to the street a policeman
gave him sailing directions and
blithely he strode up the hill to hicks
street	

   wonder what id better say to the
old man in case he comes to the
door   he asked himself  shall i
tell him i am from the chronicle no
-he might swing on me too soon
ive got to get in and shut the door
behind me somehow once in ill take
a lot of throwing out

  as he drew near the house he was
ribt without certain misgivings for all
his bold thoughts of a few minutes
previous

  many times he had read of the ring
ability of battle-ship gorman who in
his prime was famed as a savage slug-
ger gorman had accepted every chal-
lenge fought every comer and after
fifteen years of almost unbroken suc-
cess had retired from the ring with a
large sock of money and devoted him-
self to the management of his real-
estate business

 when entreated - as he fre-
quently was-to come out of retire-
ment and defend the middle-weight
championship he had won and relin-
quished - he merely growled and
growled and pointed to his record

  he did not allow challenge sarcasm

or abuse to shake him in his purpose
never to fight professionally again
but his temper was peppery and at
least once a year an account of some
street encounter of his found its way
into the columns of the daily press
his antipathy for newspapermen based
on these unwelcome dramatizations o
his flare-ups was well known

  but experience had taught nutting
that there is no percentage in worry-
ing about things that might never
happen and ben franklins famous
anxiety-dispeller was fleeting through
his mind when he mounted the steps
at  hicks street and leaned
against the push button

  in the briefinterval between the
turning of the knob and the opening
of the door he had twice clenched his
fists and assumed defensive attitudes
and twice had abandoned the pose-
the second time with an involuntary
gasp of admiration

  obviously the girl who held open
the door and regarded him with an air
of innocent inquiry was the beautiful
miss isabel

  in one hurried glance he ratified the
famous surgeons high opinion of her
and after a more comprehensive look
he concluded that the eminent author-
ity had been too conservative in the
expression of his praise

   miss venus di milo youre out of
the running he said to himself

  snatching off his hat he bowed low

   how do you do   he began  is
mr gorman in  

   no father is out just at present
she replied in a voice that quite be-
longed with her attractive being

  nutting smiled

   can you tell me when he will re-
turn   he asked spinning his hat on
his forefinger

   why he should be back in an hour
or two i fancy is there-

  now isnt that unfortunate
he broke in grinning broadly  im
terribly disappointed i came way
over here from new york just to see
him and now-

  wont you come in she asked
smilingly

   thank you he exclaimed and
stepped quickly into the hall

  as the door closed behind him he
started involuntarily and turned half
expecting to see the sturdy mr gor-
man standing in the corner

  you are quite sure that your father
-er-er-wont return for an hour  
he asked as she led the way to the sit-
ting room 

  she gazed at him with a roguish
smile

   he may change his plans and re-
turn at any moment she replied

   uh-huh he beamed

  she took a rocker near the window
and he hauled a chair closer to the
center of the picture and seated him-
self

  if you will tell me your business
with father mr-er-mr-

   nutting - howard nutting - of
the-yes-howard nutting he said
quickly he had started to fumble for
one of his chronicle cards but on sec-
ond thought refrained

   i came to see your father about
you he continued smiling amiably

   about me  

   huh-huh-yes about-

  a new program suggested itself he
paused and eyed her intently

   why weve met before im sure 
he cried starting up  you are-
why of course-silly of me not to have
thought of it before-you are miss
isabel gorman are you not  

   yes she affirmed eagerly
 where-

   didnt i meet you at west point 
he knew very well that he had never
seen her prior to her appearance at the
door but the scheme was working

   why i dont know-did you  
miss gorman had never visited
west point but she was not immune to
the subtle flattery

   i have it  he burst out  it was
at the junior prom at princeton two
years ago dont tell me it wasnt you
were a freshman at varnard at the
nutting dances



time - a quick calculation based on
the clipping joe had given him-
 surely you havent forgotten me so
soon  	

  she blushed and eyed him shyly

  nutting as has been said was tall
blond and husky also very good-
looking all of which she noted and
her next remark proved that she was
as good at the little game as he

   i-er-one meets so many college
men- why didnt you play on the
football team  

  he smiled happily

   fullback-my last two years in
school he returned modestly

   why of course  she exclaimed

   well-well  he laughed as he
hauled his chair closed  whod a
thunk it this is luck well miss
isabel-ah-ah-tell me all about your-
self what have you been doing since
i saw you last  

  she poked carelessly at the  wealth
of flaxen hair  and replied 

   oh the usual school grind with- a
dance now and then by way of va-
riety

   how do you like the new dances  

   im just crazy about them dont
you think they are grand  

   youve spoke a parable he
affirmed

   ive just received some new dance
records she said suddenly  would
you care to hear one  

   would i - say - of course i
would  he exclaimed leaping up as
she rose to her feet

  when the phonograph had been
wound and started they stood and
listened a moment then without a
word he pushed the chairs against the
wall

  they danced

  as you know dancing is a great
little demolisher of formality

   can you do the maxixe-  she
asked as he cranked the machine for
the second record

   sure-and you

   i cant seem to learn it she said
with a bewitching little pout

   cinch he said briefly  got any
music for it 

  she produced a maxixe record and
he adjusted it on the phonograph

   now ill make a bargain with
you he said turning to her with a
winning smile  in my little role in
the thrilling life-drama  what be-
comes of our college fullbacks  i do
a turn in a newspaper office we have
learned that you have been pronounced
the most beautiful young lady in the
world which in my humble opinion
is a very mild testimonial to your
charms

  we would be honored if you would
permit us to run your picture with our
little eulogy in to-morrows edition if
you will give me a photograph of your-
self i will guarantee to teach you the
maxixe is it a go  

  she listened wonderingly a rosy
glow in her cheeks and when he con-
cluded she faltered

   why-i dont dont know-really
-father-

   now your father wouldnt need
to know how we got the pictures or
even that we got them here hesaid
confidently  how does he know but
that we swiped them from the photog-
rapher aw now miss isabel have
a heart

  she laughed gaily

   would you-could you return
them to me after-

   ill promise to get them back to
you in good condition as soon as they
have been through the engraving
room

  e all right she said  excuse me
a minute

  while she was gone nutting took
a few snappy swaggering steps about
the room and felicitated himself gener-
ously

   oh youre there howard old boy
you sure are some speed demon and
so on

  when she returned she held up three
large photographs

   which will you want  she
asked


all-story cavalier weekly

  he examined them approvingly
looking now at her and now at the
pictures

   you sure are some queen miss
isabel-you dont mind my saying so
i hope why ill take all three of
course then the boss can make his
own selection

   well-if you are sure i will get
them back soon they are the only
ones i have left

   right you are he said briskly
and placing the pictures with his hat
on a chair near the door he leaped to
the phonograph and pushed the lever

 ah-dog  he cried thrilled by
the stirring strains  just cant keep
mail feet on de flo come on lady 
she joined him laughingly and the
lesson began

   my but you are light on your
feet  she exclaimed when he paused
to wind the motor  and you so big
-why you must weigh at least-how
much do you weigh  

   huh - huh oh i dunno - a
hundred and eighty-five or ninety or
thereabouts no fat either

   a big man certainly is a graceful
dancer when-

  when he is graceful eh he
finished for her

  the lesson was continued

  at the end of an hour nutting
suddenly realized that the time for
gorman peres appearance was about
due

   pardon me if i seem to look at
my watch he said consulting his
timepiece  really miss isabel
though it breaks my heart to say it
i must tear myself away duty calls
and all that sort of silly rot

  he quickly swung the chairs back
to their proper places and caught up
his hat and the precious photographs

   you are doing fine he said at
the door  really you learn awfully
quick i figure that one more lesson
will be all you need-er-when shall
i call

  oh how about friday evening
she smiled

   fine gee but im glad weve
renewed our acquaintanceship i
think we dance rather well together
dont you  

   yes thank you so much for the
lesson she returned extending her
hand  you wont lose those photo-
graphs will you  

   only over my dead body he de-
claimed  if i dont return those pic-
tures to you in excellent condition
ill never show my face in this neigh-
borhood again well so long miss
isabel

   good-by mr nutting of west
point princeton and elsewhere she
said with a little laugh

  he turned on the steps and eyed her
quizzically then both laughed
merrily

   say he grinned  do you be-
lieve in woman suffrage  

   why what a question er-yes
and no

   i thought so well talk it over
when i see you friday he called
from the sidewalk by

  on the way to the subway station
he stepped high

  mm-mm-isnt she pretty he
said to himself  fine little dancer
too oh howard i guess you are
kinder poor when it comes to the
gentle chatter put one over on the
old man that time battle-ship gor-
man the terror-huh a slugger-
huh well it makes all the difference
in the world when the chronicle puts
a good man on the job guess joe
will be tickled when i breeze in with
these pics

  he stopped on the sidewalk and in-
spected the photographs wagged his
head admiringly then resumed his
journey at a corner news-stand he
bought a copy of a magazine with
large pages-a womans magazine-
and slipped the pictures inside to pro-
tect them

  as he clattered down the stairs into
the subway miss isabels remark
about his bulk popped into his head

   you are so big-how much do
nutting dances



you weigh   she had said and
 a big man is certainly a graceful
dancer-

   oh boy he mused  wonder
how much i do weigh  

  the opportunity to learn was at
hand there were scales beside a
bench on the platform and he had
several pennies in his change pocket

  he stepped on the scales then as
the needle flew around the dial he re-
alized that he still held the magazine
containing the photographs with his
eyes on the dial he reached behind
him and dropped the package

  at that moment a train pulled into
the station and a throng of passengers
streamed out

 when he stepped from the scales
 and turned to the bench the magazine
 photos and all-was gone

battle-ship gorman slammed the
front door and strode into the hall

  isabel  he called

 yes father she answered from
 somewhere above

 heres a book i brought ye
picked it up on a subway bench he
continued good-humojedly

 he turned the pages of the maga-
 zine

  this here book is full of pretty-
 well ill be- he concluded as the
 three photographs of his daughter fell
 to the floor

divorced

 by h m sterling

 you could not bear with me and so
 the days and years to come shall lack

 sweet privleges i used to know-

 like hooking dresses up the back

 your golden head no more shall rest
 beside me in the bower where

 i gazed on you and idly guessed

 what woman first had worn your hair

 your spoken word that once could thrill
 me even as the mellow lute

 ill hear no more in accents shrill
 ejaculating  ugh  you brute  

 and when at eve the suns retreat
 blazons the sky with molten glare

 i shall not hasten home to eat

the deadly food that you prepare

 something is gone which must have flown
 with you dear when you hurried hence 

 your absence means-i might have known-
 the absence of the fiend-expense
 heart to heart talks

             by the editor

    this is an age of queries an age of research we are of an investi-
    gating turn of mind the toddling child begins to ask questions that
    no human being can answer it is an age of why and because and
    the simple things are quite as important as those that are involved

         for example

        why do some plants droop and turn to the earth after sunset
    because when the warmth of the suns rays is withdrawn they turn down-
    ward to receive the warmth of the earth by radiation

        why do pawnbrokers display three balls in front of their shops
    because three balls constituted the device of the medici family of flor-
    ence they were primarily physicians and the three balls indicated pills
    finally they became money-lenders and their seals appeared on so many docu-
    ments that had to do with the pledging of personal property as security for
    loans that the device lost its original significance and became the emblem of
    money-lenders

        why does lightning sometimes take a zigzag course because
    electricity seeks the earth by the path of least resistance the lightning flies
    from side to side to find the easiest path

         why do people lost in the darkness or in a jungle walk in circles
     because ninety per cent of the human race have one leg longer than the
     other and at each step take a longer stride with the longest leg this leads
     them to the right or left in the form of a circle

         why are three hundred thousand people waiting for the july  all-
     story cavalier because they know it carries the best fiction of any
     all-fiction publication in anv language

      thats why

                   jt

       just to prove that he can write more derful jewel to his friends at a house-
     than one kind of a story fred jackson has party at the same time announcing his

ters a very popular serial which con-
cluded not long ago

hoo city he hasnt any money or any
influence only the gray matter under his
ragged cap and two sizable fists but
after a while he manages to open a small
store and with nina wingate to help
him begins his fight for recognition and
success

  three precious grafters of the wooden
nutmeg variety block his progress to-
gether they own about everything worth

 sorrows of o-hana-san by
walter elwood is an unusual story about
an unusual girl the fact that this girl
was a little japanese maiden in no way de-
tracts from the absorbing interest of the
story as you shall see when you read it
the tale opens in the philippines in the
town of valladolid where an american
jim hillore is the supervising teacher

  at the moment the story begins o-
hana-san is riding a bicycle said bicycle
moving along on a slack wire stretched
diagonally high above the pit of the sag-
ging palm-thatched theater no wonder
jim held his breath as the beautifully pro-
portioned little lady daringly rode back
and forth balancing herself as she did so
by means of her big beflowered umbrella

  back in the states jim had a girl of his
own and her name was rose but right
then and there jim forgot rosie

  of course all this sort of thing has
happened before and no doubt always
will because men are men no matter what
their mothers were

  after you have read about little o-
hana-san you are going to tell your
friends to read about her or ill miss my
guess

 mulligans sense of hu-
mor by david a wasson is a story of
the sea and not without its redeeming
sense of comedy mr wasson knows
sailors and the sea as you know the ham-
mock on the veranda of your best girls
home

  this story has to do with a strike-a
strike among the marine brotherhood
genial patrick mulligan was the secretary
of the order the strike was aboard the
steamship colossus of which jerry horn-
beam was captain this skipper was a
relic of the halcyon days when the yankee
windjammers dotted all oceans jerrys
fist was as good as brass knuckles and his
piercing glance had made more than one
mutinous crew quail into subjection that
secretary mulligan not only had the para-
lyzing gall to call a strike but also had the
greater temerity to board captain jerrys
vessel was enough to make the master of
the ship almost explode with rage

  mind you this is only the beginning of
the tale and we leave you to find out the
rest for yourself

a birds-eye view	of the letter-bag

  naturally it is impossible for me to an-
swer all of the letters that come to my
desk many of them are more or less in
the same vein more or less laudatory set-
ting forth primarily the fact that the wri-
ters approve of the magazine that they
like certain stories and propose to con-
tinue reading the all-story cavalier re-
gardless of the high cost of living and the
enforcement of the income tax others
of my letters deal rather critically point
a moral of some sort or express opinions
that seem to me to justify the publication
of the epistles	

  on the subject of the wedding i have a
few lines from gloucester massachusetts

wed

for years i met a cavalier

  he called on me each week

a jolly fellow full of cheer

  a friend indeed to seek

i thought him clear from womans wiles
  bound to a single life

but recently with happy smiles

  he introduced his wife

m a walton

its good enough for him

to the editor

  i am enclosing my check for four dol-
lars for which send me the all-story
cavalier weekly for one year begin-
ning with the issue for june 

  i have been buying the magazine from
the drug-store here ever since i let my
subscription lapse but they have quit sell-
ing magazines and i just cant do with-
out it

  the only thing i can suggest which
would improve it for me is that you have
your novelettes longer say about fifty or
sixty pages the length of the instal-
ments of your serials is just right

you are publishing some mighty classy
stuff these days and the magazine seems
to be improving with each issue

suits better than ever

to the editor

just a few words to show my apprecia-
tion for the all-story cavalier i com-
menced reading it when it first made its
appearance as a monthly magazine and
now that it is a weekly it suits me better
than ever i have all the weekly numbers
and intend to secure the rest of them

	please publish more of zane greys
work as he is a special favorite of mine
i also like the burroughs stories and
would like to see a sequel to at the
earths core at an early date

i can find no fault with our magazine
of course every one cant be pleased and
if i find a story that i do not like i pass it
by for there are plenty that i like right in
the same magazine

i can hardly wait for friday to roll
around i am so anxious to get the next
issue of the all-story cavalier

fine

has two favorites

to the editor

i am an enthusiastic reader of the all-
story cavalier weekly i never miss it

two of your authors are favorites of
mine zane grey and edgar rice bur-
roughs mr greys  the lone star
rangers was a story worth while but
why not give us another as good with a
girl for a heroine-that is one who has
had a shady past and gone west only to
be saved by a true-blue western fellow
all girls are not saints mr grey i am
sure could picture my heroine

 tarzan of the apes  is the most en-
thralling story i have ever read some
say but its such a lie mr burroughs
makes us forget the  lie  part and tar-
son becomes real success is assured the
motion-picture actor who can enact tar-
zan on the screen

good luck to your weekly

mary flier

caledonia new york

zane grey will write a sequel

to the editor

i have been taking the all-story cava-
lier weekly only a short time and it
gives me pleasure to state that i would
not be without it it is the best all-fiction
weekly i have ever read

 the lone star rangers  is great and
i would appreciate it very much if zane
grey would give us a sequel to it with
for instance both couples in their new
home

 the beasts of tarzan  is fine also in
fact all the stories are good

i like russ and ruth best of all in zane
greys novel

i take several magazines and have only
been buying the all-story cavalier
about five weeks i would not trade it for
all the others

let us know if you can prevail upon
zane grey for a sequel

hoping you accept me for membership
in your great club of readers

written to entertain

to the editor

as a constant reader of the heart to
heart talks i feel like kicking in a few
myself

i noticed in a recent letter where some
learned gentleman had taken exception to

several errors on the part of mr bur-
roughs this savant claiming that the mar-
tian time as stated was wrong besides
finding fault with various other state-
ments i most respectfully desire to sug-
gest to this savant that if he reads stories
for the purpose of detecting possible er-
rors instead of the entertainment aiforded
by them the best thing he can do is to
transfer his attentions to other fields one
would imagine that a person with the in-
telligence which a scientist is supposed to
have would realize that all of these stories
are written to entertain and if there are
occasional errors in them they should be
excused

  furthermore unless critics can do bet-
ter than the writers they criticise i think
they had better keep quiet altogether i
find all of these stories so very entertain-
ing that i would hardly know which to se-
lect as the headliners

  naturally i am interested in learning
whether or not we will get sequels to mr
burroughss various stories

  i might add that  the great secret
wandering men and the grand get-
away appeal to me quite strongly

  with best wishes for your future suc-
cess

mr pick the undertaker stepped
briskly up to the glass and
adjusted his necktie he
turned his head from side to side
critically examined the part in his hair
and touched carefully a circular ring
on each temple

  he shook down his trouser legs
and with his lips in the position of
whistling crossed the room with sub-
dued spring in his step

  if there was anything that mr
pick particularly enjoyed it was a fu-
neral the details of which were left
to his own planning he disliked be-
reaved families having a large circle
of relatives with ideas of their own
concerning obsequies

  his professional joy was quenched
in such work in the case at hand he
had been undisturbed and just before
closing the door he surveyed with
properly depressed pride the room
that he had arranged according to his
belief in the last and best in under-
taking

  across the corner of the small room
stood the coffin

  under it a white fur rug the prop-
erty of the undertaker bristled con-
spicuously the brass standards were
shining to the last degree above the
coffin was a canopy ring from which

flowed a white lace drap also the prop-
erty of mr pick

  this was parted and drawn evenly
to head and foot displaying the still
form at one end of the fur rug was
a  gates ajar  in tortured flowers
exactly in the middle was a wreath
and in geometrical position at the other
end was a floral pillow where purple
immortelles said  alice

  the chairs were backed carefully
against the wall and a row of yellow
pine camp chairs also part of the
undertakers equipment were evenly
placed

  everything that could have made
the room look natural or as if it had
been lived in had been removed
there was a subdued light one win-
dow opened a dozen inches allowed
a fresh scent to come in from the yard
full of poppies and sweet peas other
doors and windows were properly
closed

  the undertaker finished his last
satisfied look around closed the door
gently behind him and alice darst
was alone

  it was almost the first time that she
had been alone since the burden of
life had slipped from her

  there had been so many things to
do to her such a paraphernalia of


beside his wife



custom-made grief such a coming
and going-such a curious peeping-
such an officious strain at  doing
something for her -such a shedding
of suitable tears from neighborly
eyes being newly dead had brought
nothing of repose

  when the door closed on mr picks
black frock coat and pink cheeks it
seemed almost as if the placid limbs
relaxed the more there might have
been almost a sigh of relief from lips
that had taken upon themselves a
something that was not quite a smile
but that was puzzling and unnatural
to the man who had come through the
hall door alone

  he had been ushered in ostenta-
tiously by the undertaker who had
made way for him through the crowd
of red eyed women in the hallway

   mr darst goes in alone to the
body had said the undertaker and
curious faces were turned to watch the
closing panels of the door then the
women forming the crowd found
comfortable advantageous positions
from which to view the ultimate re-
appearance of mr darst

  there was a general putting to-
gether of heads and confidential con-
versations were resumed in hushed
voices

  the man behind the door looked
about the unnatural little room in a
startled way he felt as if he had
never seen it before the armchair
at the window which alice had called
his and where he had spent the larger
part of each sunday with his papers
and the proper periodicals was no
longer there

  the familiar litter of small things
that had been his and hers he did not
see he had a feeling that he was in
the act of moving out of the house
which had been home

  he looked at the still face of his
wife in the same anxious startled way
he touched awkwardly the stiff satin
pleating that stood out fromthe pillow
where they had lain her head he
looked at her curiously impersonally

  it seemed to him as if he was trying
to recall where he had seen that wom-
an before not as if he had been sent
in to take his first look at his wife
after she was arrayed for her burial
he had to make a physical effort by
bracing his feet and setting his jaw
to keep his thoughts where they be-
longed

  they seemed ready to follow his
eyes out of the close little room
through the strip of open window and
across the fields to something else-
anything else even the most trivial
of business matters intruded them-
selves into his consciousness in ad-
vance of the things he should lie think-
ing about then

   dont you think they have frizzed
her hair too much he said to the
girl who had noiselessly appeared at
the foot of the coffin near him

  the girl did not speak and he re-
peated the question as if the answer
might be an important issue to him

   dont you think her hair is too
much frizzed mary i cant make her
seem natural or maybe its the thing
they have put around her neck there
is something about her that seems
strange do you see it  

  again the girl did not reply and the
man went on

   it isnt exactly that she is smiling
but theres a queer look about her face
-seems like that she understood or
knew something-

   she didnt spoke the girl

  the man frowned

  he rested his hands on the edge of
the coffin they were strong power-
ful hands matching the strength of
his big frame he put one of them up
and pushed back restlessly the thick
dark hair that waved over his forehead

  it was a not unhandsome head set
too far forward on shoulders that
sagged a bit one would know by
looking at him as he stood that he
would walk slouchmgly and carelessly

   it seems strange that she should
have gone off like this he went on
in a puzzled complaining sort of


all-story cavalier weekly

way  it was over so quick why
she had had those spells a hundred
times before i never knew that medi-
cine not to take right hold

   the doctor said it always would
and you know when he came at the
last he couldnt understand he said
he had tfried it out on her a dozen
times-there must have been some-
thing else set in he asked me if i
was sure she had those powders every
half hour and i said i was-that we 
had given them to her ourselves and
that when i was out-

   i left every paper under a weight
for you to count after she had taken
the powder you know interrupted
the girl

   yes i know who would have
thought that she would have gone so
quick there must have been some-
thing else-a stroke or something

   yes said the girl

   i wish she looked more like her-
self he complained  i cant seem
to make it like her alice was a good
girl she was only eighteen years old
when we came to live in this house
thats twenty-four year ago i cant
remember that she ever said a cross
word i used to think she was too
quiet sort of reserved like even
with me

   and she has that look now as
i f she understood something that i
didnt after all that look is almost
natural-for she knew more about
things than i did she was always
thinking she would sit and look out
on the hills there for hours it seemed
to me without saying a word-she
wasnt lively company but she was
good god i dont know how i shall
get along without her it makes an
awful hole mary

  the girl moved restlessly her dark
shining eyes always on the mans face

   shes been quieter than ever the
last fews years but she liked to hear
you chattering about she liked to
have you do things-she was pretty
good to you too mary

  the girl went suddenly to the open

window and barred the entrance of a
big heavy bumblebee who conscious
of the scent of hothouse flowers had
been whirling in ever narrowing cir-
cles about the window

   she pulled the lace curtains together
and pinned them closely she jerked
them a little as she did so

   im going to have her put away
with her wedding ring on the man
continued  i had thought id take it
off and keep it but i believe shed
rather have it on she was always
fond of me and of her home-poor
alice

  then after a minute  she cared
more about the home than i ever did
id have been glad to get about a little
i think ill shut up the house now for
a while i was thinking about it last
night ill go west ive always want-
ed to im free now and theres no
reason why i shouldnt get about a
bit i could hardly stay here it
would be too lonesome-poor alice-
who would have thought i should have
missed her so much and so soon

   what are you going to do with
me john asked the girl

   the man looked at her for the first
time

  he looked unseeingly and as if he
was not noting the oval face the soft
olive skin over which peach bloom
color came and went as she spoke he
looked unseeingly and then back im-
patiently to the face of the woman in
the coffin

   well of course you and me
couldnt live here together theres
been talk enough i guess as it is
youll have to go back to chester all
alices things are yours i know shed
want you to have them but i cant
stay here-ive always wanted to go
west anyhow

    will you come back for me   said
the girl

  the man frowned again  oh i
dont know when ill come back he
said  i shant be tied ill stay as
long as i like

   the color flamed into the girls face
beside his wife



she crumpled in her hands the folds
of the lace drape at her side

   then you didnt mean all the
things you said   she asked

   sh-h-h-h cried the man in a
sibilant whisper

    she isnt hearing with a scorn-
ful laugh while anger blazed in her
eyes  then you didnt mean what
you said john about loving me and
what we could do and how we could
be together if it wasnt for her-you
didnt mean it then  

   hush repeated the man  dont
you know better than to talk about such
things here  

  what difference does it make
cried the girl fiercely  i know youre
afraid of her you always were afraid
of her you were afraid of her living
and youre afraid of her dead im
not

  she rapped fiercely on the edge of
the coffin  he loves me the best he
says so he has ever since ive been
here im not afraid of you pouf
and she snapped her fingers

   the man seized her hands roughly

   you go out of here if you cant
behave yourself he said

   then the tears came

    ah john she cried clinging to
his hands you make me crazy
when you seem not to care i cant
bear that you should look at her all the
time and not at me you know what
weve been to each other

   you know ive done everything
you asked-because you said you loved
me ive taken chances and chances to
be with you because you wanted me
no i wont hush shes no better
dead than she was alive and you didnt
care for her then-youve said so a
hundred times

    youve said that if she was only
out of the way-you swore you loved
me-i tell you i wont hush-you said
those things a plenty while she was
alive and you were clever enough
making plans to get with me alone-
and now you talk- the girl broke
into wild weeping and wailing

  the door opened cautiously and the
sleek head of the obsequious mr pick
protruded

  there was curiosity i rampant in
every feature but he saw only the
husband standing stiffly by the side of
his wife and the girl who had been a
member of the family sobbing aloud
over the loss of her friend and her
home it looked like any other scene
in any other house at such times the
flame of slowly burning gossip could
not be fed by it he closed the door
again gently

  the man smothered a hard word
but he reached out and touched her
shoulder not ungently

   go on up-stairs well talk about
this later this is no time and no
place go on up-stairs mary be
reasonable you musnt carry on like
this here go on

   you come too then sobbed the
girl  oh john you come too im
so unhappy you dont want me to be
that you always said i was made to
be happy because i was sweet-youve
said a thousand times that i was sweet
john

  she had moved close to him and
raised to him her face that was like
a flower she slipped one hand up his
arm over his shoulder and tucked her
fingers over the edge of his collar
against his neck-a baby trick of hers
that he knew

   you are sweet he said slowly

  the smile that began about her
mouth and spread into her shining
eyes was radiant

   say it again she whispered and
she stood on tiptoe that her lips might
almost touch his  say again that i
am sweet that was your first love
word to me dearest say it again

  she was so close that he felt the soft
thump of her heart against him he
looked down into the alluring curves of
her neck and shoulders-he quivered
at the touch of her fingers in his neck
and bent his face to meet hers

  she flung herself upon him she
snuggled into his arms with little mur-

murs-she trailed the soft moisture of
her lips over his cheeks until he smiled
-and then in a sudden he threw her
from him and recoiled

   my god mary she is smiling he
cried in choking whisper  see her
oh my god 

  the girl turned upon him-

   coward she said and in the
word standing alone there was the red
fury of rage that could kill

  the man saw it and it touched a
something responsive in him

   now youve done enough he
said go out of here your being
here is an insult ill have nothing
more from you you are bad clear
through-you are like your mother

   dont you talk to me about my
mother fired the girl  she had
blood in her veins-she knew how to
live-and i hope im like her throw
me off if you like i dont care but
your devotion to her is a little late
too bad you couldnt have had it
earlier

  she wrenched open the door and
took a straight line roughly through
those who were waiting there her
feet barely touched the stairs in her
swift ascent

  the watchers through the open
door saw john darst draw a camp
chair from the military line of them
and sit heavily down

  it was long after dark that night
when the girl sped along the path from
the house she had come out by the
back door hearing as she tiptoed
through the kitchen the low voices of
the watchers in the living room she
had finished the tasks for the night

  on the kitchen table were the cov-
ered plates containing the sandwiches
and cakes that would be eaten for the
midnight lunch by the neighbors who
were sitting in the dim light near the
open door into the perfumed parlor

  the coffee was in the pot ready to
go on the gasoline stove it was not
strange that the girl should have come
down into the kitchen after she had
gone up to bed but she moved stealthily

and slipped out the door like a slim
shadow

  down the path like a shadow she
went and under the thick orchard trees
to the edge of the cliff

  there was a clump of lilac bushes
growing close to the edge they had
been there so many years that they
were almost like trees in their size and
strength the sprouts had spread until
there was a small jungle of foliage and
beyond this just at the edge was the
roughly put together bench that john
had made one day and had whispered
to her jji the hall to go out and see

  alice had not cared for that part of
the yard she had been afraid of the
cliff and the dashing of the waves of
the lake below had seemed cruel to her
she had said

  it was to the cliff that the girl went
her lovely face was swollen with
weeping her wonderful hair was
loose and she wore the same little
gingham frock that she had had on all
day she unbuttoned the front of the
frock fiercely as she ran

  she took from her bosom a closely
tied up handkerchief

  she held this in her hand as she sat
for a minute on the edge of the bench
the waves were lapping softly there
were moonlight beams through the
trees there was the soft sighing of the
wind as it rounded the bank of foliage
and came to her

  almost she smiled and lifted her
head to listen for cautious steps-such
a replica was the night of many others
she had spent there then she recalled
that john was sitting in the dim light
in the front room-that he had sat
there all day

  the rage of the morning had not
died it seared and distorted her face
she beat her shut hands on the rough
wood of the bench and her lips drew
back from her small teeth as the gusts
of passion came and went

  there was fear too-a fear that
made her clutch her throat even as
she laughed scornfully

   fancy me being nervous fancy
a personal problem

t

me being afraid i was not born a
coward-some people were

  she untied the corners of the
handkerchief she had taken from her
dress but her hands shook and she
glanced over her shoulder and listened

    why do i hear things every-
where   she asked aloud  im not

afraid i knew what i was doing and
i really havent done anything she
would have died anyhow it was a
stroke or something

  then she shook out the handker-
chief and from it there drifted down
a small cloud of fine white powder that
lost itself in the water of the lake

a

tll the islands up at the com-
missioners to-night - he al-
ways gets a bale of ice up
from auckland on steamer day you
were surprised to find me here eh  
 so-so the fat man wiped his
face and poured another drink youre
a damned ironic brute cranshaw
how was i to know that the john
smith our raratonga agent was your-
self you have nerve i always said
you had nerve

  the long lean man looked across the
table inspecting his guest curiously
he had looked forward to the coming
of thefirms junior partner but hob-
son did not know it

  his thin lips crisped ironically as he
squirted soda into his glass

   well what are you going to do
about it  come hobson lets not
mince words you had me driven out
 a-s c

of auckland you took over my stock
in the company you married agnes
and youve grown fat i fancy youre
punished enough-you neednt look at
me like that man avarua is good
enough for me

  hobson was indubitably nervous
he had shaven before coming ashore
but his fat jowl was dusky again he
perspired freely and as he mopped his
face he shot uneasy glances at the
other man from deep-set black eyes

  an overlarge diamond flashed on
his fat hand and another glittered in
his tie

   youre a sly dog cranshaw a sly
dog he muttered then his voice took
on vigor  what do you mean any-
way you neednt think that because
your bally bungalow- is out here at the
edge of town you can threaten me i
wont stand for it ill discharge you-


all-story cavalier weekly

ill show you up before the commis-
sioner-

   hold on man great heavens
dont you see that im in your power  
cranshaw leaned over the table his
face anxious pleading

  but behind the anxiety in his gray
eyes there was ahard coldness quickly
veiled

   im not theatening you hobson-
its the other way around im satis-
fied here in avarua im the com-
panys agent no one knows who i
used to be ive a good salary come
dont bear malice the old life is for-
gotten so let the dead bury their dead
dont be hard on me old man i know
you didnt treat me square but you
married agnes-i was beaten and
thats an end to it now im contented
and prospering here you wont give
me away will you you wont dis-
charge me send me down into hell a
second time  

  hobson took a cheroot from the
table and lit it his flash of appre-
hension had vanished altogether

   no he returned slowly judi-
cially as he was inspecting the
diamond on his finger he did not
notice the hard gray eyes across the
table  no cranshaw i didnt treat
you right ill admit but bygones are
bygones as you say youre in my
power i never quite believed you
stole that money myself

  a burst of terrible irony ripped
through the mask of cranshaws lean
face but it was gone instantly

  hobson glanced up with compla-
cent cunning frankness

   i misunderstood you i guess he
went on heavily to tell the truth
i half expected you had got me here
to-to-

  he paused licking his lips cran-
shaw broke out into a loud ringing
laugh

  nonsense man come drink up
and shake hands on it all-if you bear
no malice well cry quits eh no
things have turned out for the best
far as im concerned and so youll

not bear hard on me old man youll
just forget who i used to be 

  hobsons little leering eyes cleared
of their suspicion and something very
like a sigh of relief shook his fat chest
their glasses clinked together

   heres how 

  the personal problem it seemed
was closed finally and forever

  there followed an hour of labor
over the table since it was the junior
partners first  whirl around the cir-
cuit  of the islands previously he had
lived a cunning and contented existence
in auckland far from savages and
resident commissioners

  cranshaw however had looked
forward to his coming for some little
time

   youd better stay ashore for the
night stated the resident agent when
the reports had been cleared up and
balanced properly  theres quite a
surf running and itll be hard to get
a whale boat since all the natives are
feasting steamer days a great occa-
sion here you know

   im not fond of insects and as
hobson reached for the siphon his
eyes flitted around uneasily  ive
heard stories about these islands

   you look apoplectic too mused
cranshaw for an instant that odd
bitterly cruel light shot through his
gray eyes  nonsense man thats
all talk of course there are a few
cockroaches and such but theres
nothing dangerous absolutely no
scorpions and the centipeds dont kill
thats all talk see here ive two
cots laid up in my sleeping-room-
finest mosquito curtains in the island
better stop and itll save coming
ashore in the morning

  hobson glanced through the door
that his host flung open and the sight
of the wide clean sleeping-room with
its two draped beds evidently decided
him

   all right he nodded

   better finish this bottle sug-
gested granshaw easily he himself
drank little
a personal problem



   come out to the steamer to-mor-
row said hobson a half hour later
as they rose  id like to show you-
show you agness picture - an the
babys

   thanks returned cranshaw

  but his long lean face seemed to
quiver a trifle and as he ushered his
guest into the sleeping-room his gray
eyes were baleful that speech had
been sheer venom for hobson was not
drunk he had merely forgotten for
the moment his intense fear of
cranshaw

  once ensconced with their mosquito
curtains the two men exchanged a few
words before dropping off to sleep
then the darkness was broken only by
the rasping snore of hobson

  curiously enough cranshaws
breathing seemed hardly audible

  for avarua the night was a cool
one the bungalow was at the edge of
town and the roar of the surf thun-
dered dully from the outer reefs in
unbroken cadences

  suddenly and without the slightest
warning a horrible scream echoed out
from the veranda-shrilled up and
off and seemed to die softly in the
distance

   my god  hobsons voice rang
out whats that

   mor kiri-kiri returned cranshaw
sleepily

  whats that

   a flying fox-for heavens -sake
shut up and go to sleep 

  cranshaw did not sleep himself
however for he lay motionless with
his hand on an electric torch and
chuckled slightly as he listened to the
irregular panting breathing of the
other man

  slowly through the surf-mutter
there pierced other sounds-slight
thin bird-like sounds as though in-
numerable watches were ticking in the
room hobsons breathing sounded
rather flurried and cranshaws thin
lips parted in a grim smile as he stared
up into the darkness

  peculiar though the ticking sounds

were they were presently overborne by
a still more peculiar sound-one which
no human brain could define without
experience

  it was a ghostly tapping tapping
tapping that seemed to come from the
floor a clicking irregular netallic
tapping it seased with uncanny sud-
denness 	

   i say are you awake 

  hobsons voice  sounded stifled
hoarse

   cranshaw wake up 

  eh whats the matter
cranshaw spoke very sleepily and
smiled to himself

   theres something on my cur-
tains  

   shake it off and go to sleep

  a soft flurry of mosquito curtains
a subdued crash and then a scuttling
and tapping that once more ended
abruptly a gasp from hobson

  i say the bally things back he
cried  for gods sake help me out
cranshaw 

   its only a hermit crab wandered
in you fool wait-now take a look
and give him a good fling off

  cranshaws arm protruded from his
curtains and he snapped the electric
torch he hadmo need where to look
for he had been expecting this visit
from the junior partner for some time

  hobson gripped his curtains in des-
perate haste and again shook off the
thing that was climbing he looked
out saw the hideous bristly object
clatter away on its spider-legs and
fell back with a subdued groan

   damn this place 

  again silence and darkness fell
upon the room and again the noises
of the night slowly seeped through the
surf-thunder

  outside the veranda the crabs were
scuttling and clicking and rustling
scavenging with resistless vigor and
great enthusiasm a thin far burst of
song came from the government ac-
commodation house where the bulk
of the steamers passengers were
gathered in jovial celebration


all-story cavalier weekly

  then through all the muffled night
there again began to pierce that in-
sistent watch-like ticking not as of
one watch but as of a thousand it was
steady and irregular and very thin
occasionally a quite distinct crunch
would echo through as though some
one had stepped on a beetle only
there was no one to step

  once or twice there came a soft
 flop  on the floor whatever had
fallen must have fallen from the ceil-
ing

  the sounds were not exactly pleas-
ant especially to a fevered imagina-
tion they might mean anything from
ghosts to dragons

  and over all slurring the staccato
harmony of the ticking was an almost
inaudible soft scurrying-like innum-
erable feathers or hairy legs running
about

  it was a weird symphony a sym-
phony of lesser noises of louder si-
lences a symphony whose eldritch
orchestration produced hideousness

  there was no discord over the
crescendo and diminuendo of the tick-
ing swept that soft horror of nearly
inaudible sound shot through by the
louder crunches there were other
sounds also that could not be defined
by human ears but all blended into a
terrible harmony the more terrible
because produced by darkness and rife
with suggestion

   i say old man hobsons voice
rose in a thick discord that ruined the
symphonic whispers utterly  whats
all this bally rustling eh  

  cranshaw waited a little smiling
into the blackness inscrutable

   i say cranshaw lets have a
drink old man 

  you wake again cranshaws
voice bubbled out sleepily  whats
the matter  

   i want a drink thats all came
the half-shamed answer

   no more whisky in the house-
we finished up the last of it to-night
go to sleep and quit your infernal
nonsense

   youre sure therere no poisonous
things around  

  cranshaw did not answer the
other repeated the question his voice
beginning insensibly to climb with the
last words

  this time cranshaw replied but
took no immediate heed of the ques-
tion itself

   say hobson ive just been think-
ing about something you remember
that mess i got into down at aukland 
i heard the other day that it was you
who stole that money yourself thats
true isnt it  

  the other held silence for a mo-
ment until the ghastly symphony
protruded into his brain

   i-i wanted agnes came the
hoarse words

  cranshaw smiled to himself

   thank god you got her hobson
-since she wanted money it seems
by the way you were quite right in
thinking that i got you here to-night
in order to pay you out

   eh whats that

  hobsons voice leaped from the
darkness vivid with a horrible fear
pulsating and lingering under the roof
weirdly

  cranshaw spoke after a moment
his words were cold and sharp and
quite impersonal

   hobson you were a fool to im-
agine that i would ever forget or for-
give you had me snared for your
own crime you broke me you got the
girl i wanted you became the junior
partner in my place i became john
smith came to raratonga settled here
and waited i knew you would come
sooner or later

  he paused smiling inscrutably at
the darkness

  hobson was breathing stertorously
and there was another and queerer
sound-like a fat man licking his lips
in fear the darkness intensified
everything

   i was in two minds hobson i
had a notion to take you out to the
reefs for a swim you dont know it
a personal problem



but there are interesting things out
there in the warm water-bubbly eels
spiny leper-fishes with every spine
deadly poison sting-rays devil-fish
plenty plenty snake and shark but i
decided against that for i knew you
had imagination so i brought you
here instead

  cranshaw still smiled into the black-
ness above him lying motionless as he
talked he had no need to switch on
the light to guess at the shaking
mosquito curtains of the other bed the
pasty-faced man who clutched at them
the horrible fascination with which
hobson followed his every word

   now my dear fellow he went
on his voice acridly smooth  i want
you to take a little look around
then-

   for gods sake cranshaw  burst
forth the frenzied tones of the other
man shrill and smitten with hysteria
 ill give up everything-ill sign a
confession and give you agnes-ill
make it all right if you-

 shut your mouth-and look
snapped cranshaw and the words
fairly crackled through the room as he
shoved his arm and swept the place
with light

  the light was blinding merciless
leaving every inch of the room clean-
cut and distinct dislosing the whole
fearful secret of the hidden orchestra-
tion

  about the floor and walls and ceil-
ing were poised cockroaches-south
sea cockroaches as large as mice or
larger with great waving feather-
feelers they flitted hither and
thither by the hundred-moving mass-
es of hideousness making as they
went that ticking which furnished
forth the body of the nights sym-
phony

  and here and there flashing away
from the light more quickly than the
light could follow or flopping from
ceiling to floor as the light swept up
were things that looked like sausages
only when they moved when the fear-
some hidden red legs flashed out in all

their horror could one recognize
centipeds

  yet these were not the most horrible
nor the swiftest

  for heedless of the light the occa-
sional crunches swept up above the
body of the symphony as the electric
ray disclosed the hordes of cock-
roaches to their enemies great brown
shapes darted here and there back and
forth by the dozen huge brown hairy
things as large as a plate-hunting
spiders-leaping on their pray crunch-
ing once and leaping forward anew

  the room was a wriggling horror
in that moment and when cranshaw
clicked off the light that triumphant
 crunch - crunch - crunch  was
rising in a finale that drowned out the
rest of the symphony-and shattered
suddenly at his voice

   better not step out on the floor
hobson - i saw a couple of those
spiders on your curtains ill take my
chances but youll stay here if they
get under your curtains youre gone
remember-any one of those things
means certain death as i say ill take
my chances because im going to leave
you here

  he calmly threw aside his curtains
reached out for his slippers dumped
the wriggling things out of them and
rose seizing a spray at hand he sent
a shower of boracic acid over the floor
and calmly went to the door

  there he paused with a cold laugh
to listen to the frenzied cries and
promises and curses and prayers of the
man who dared not leave his cot-and
with that cranshaw slammed the door
 damned coward  he muttered
opening the tantalus on the veranda
and pouring himself a drink  hell
be fool enough to believe me and be
afraid to try rushing from the room-
the damned coward and precisely at
two oclock apoplexy or heart-failure
will take him off and agnes collects
the insurance well im satisfied to
call quits

  and the soda shot hissing into the
glass

bradley hamm had no use
for a mollycoddle one didnt
need to be told that after a
glance at the powerful frame the
pugnacious bald head and chin the
prominent uneven teeth that rimmed
his capacious smile the big-jointed
full - bearded hands the ungainly
slouch and the baggy appearance of
the well-worn gray business suit that
looked as if it had been cut with a
knife and fork

  his success had been attained in
the school of hard knocks the very
nature of his business-he was the
owner of the extensive brick-yards
on the outskirts of clintondale-went
a long way toward explaining the
absence of velvet in his make-up

  at the same time he was honest
companionable and generous-charac-
teristics which prompted his neighbors
to overlook his lack of polish

  with these facts in mind it is
easier to understand the anguish with
which he faced the probability that
within the hour he would be called

j a fitzgerald

upon to decide whether he wanted
ferdy rollins for a son-in-law it
was a decision fraught with the great-
est importance to the hamm family-
father and daughter

  yes would make his pretty
daughter virginia the happiest girl in
the world it would make him corre-
spondingly unhappy

  now ferdy was not a mollycoddle
in the strict sense of the word but he
came too near qualifying for that
classification to suit the rough-and-
ready brickmaker

  hamm liked him well enough-but
not as a relative he conceded his up-
right character and ability to provide
for his daughter and all that but he
 deplored his lack of aggressiveness
his gentle manner his willingness to
compromise his fondness for croquet
dominoes and other debrutalized pas-
times his highly perfumed and im-
maculate appearance on all occasions
ferdys pink-and-white beauty jarred
him more than anything with the ex-
ception of his wrist watch
a hard man to hit



  these were his disturbing thoughts
as he paced up and down the smoking-
room of his comfortable home  for
some time he had realized that the ro-
mance was nearing its climax but he
had clung to the hope that there might
be some way of postponing what he
regarded as a calamity

  no two ways about it he reflect-
ed  ferdys not the type of man
that can stand punishment of any
kind if he met with reverses hed
wilt like a morning-glory in cold
storage if anything should happen to
me hed have to look after -my busi-
ness the mere thought of such a
contingency started him chuckling
 ive got a birds-eye view of him
trying to run those brickyards he
went on  what those mud-handlers
would do to him would be a crime

  further reflection was interrupted
by the entrance of a servant with the
announcement that the expected vis-
itor was at the door 

   send him along ordered the boss
of the house

  he took a last deep desperate
breath flung himself into a leather
armchair and crossed his legs

  he was a study in wrinkles a
mischievous smile flashed across his
face as he heard virginia and ferdy
whispering in the hall below he lit
his blackest cigar and began puffing
for all he was worth

  the highly nervous visitor stepped
into the room and was confronted by
what appeared to be a heap of smol-
dering rags

  hello ferdy came from the
center of the conflagration a huge
hand appeared through the volume of
smoke

   goodness gracious why- ferdy
got such a fit of coughing he couldnt
finish the sentence hamm suggested
that he had a cold but he couldnt re-
ply the brickmaker was glad that
the smoke hid his joyous expression

  ferdy got permission to open a
window and then between coughs
managed to gasp that the tobacco

habit was abominable-more evidence
that he would not make a desirable
addition to the hamm family

  the smoke lifted sufficiently to en-
able him to glimpse the wrinkled
object in the armchair he shuddered
imperceptibly and averted his gaze

   i-i suppose you like to take it
easy when you get home he said
presently

  hamm said he was always glad
when the whistle blew  we all work
hard down there from-

   and its such a terrible smelly old
place interposed ferdy a look of
horror in his big blue eyes  won-
der to me you dont chuck it and enjoy
yourself youve got all the money
you will ever need

  it was all that hamm could do to
keep from telling him a few plain
truths about himself right then and
there but he managed to reply with
outward calmness that he liked the
work and intended remaining in har-
ness while he had his health

  inwardly he was saying  so this
is the guy that im about to have
wished on me smelly old place
huh

  through the corner of his eye he
caught ferdy fussing with his wing
collar an audible gulp made it plain
that the big question was already
passing through his esophagus

   i suppose you know why i wanted
to talk with you ferdy blurted right
out

  hamm guessed it was about the big
fight in madison square garden the
night before and immediately launched
into a eulogy of the principals  id
have given anything to have-

   mr hamm  came the indignant
exclamation  thats the worst guess
you ever made in your life you
know you never heard me discuss
prize-fights or vulgar things of that
sort

  the brick merchant protested that
every one was discussing it  the
papers carried columns about it he
declared


all-story cavalier weekly

  ferdy retorted that the newspapers
paid too much attention to such dis-
graceful proceedings hamm tickled
with the temporary delay gained by his
ruse disagreed with him  the cour-
age displayed by the loser- he
started to say

   courage fiddlesticks  came the
scornful interruption

   yes courage i can just see you
taking three or four smashes in the
face when you had a chance to stay
down and escape punishment not
only you but myself for that matter
 you neednt worry about what
id do ferdy said hotly  id stay
there and take my medicine ive got
just as much courage as the next
man

  his under lip quivered slightly as
he said this but he looked his host
squarely in the eye

  his show of spirit astonished the
burly brickmaker it tickled him to
see that ferdy was getting angrier
every minute

   i dont doubt your courage but-
 yes you do mr hamm you
know you do and i know you do
im no fool i know that you would
think a whole lot more of me if i was
a rough-neck

  his shrewd guess threw hamm off
his balance the latter could scarcely
believe his ears

   prize-fighters bah  ferdy re-
sumed with a sneer  i -dont call it
courage to take a few smashes in the
face when you know you are going to
get four or five thousand dollars for
doing it i call that high finance
hamm said it was all very well to
talk that way but that it took a lot
of pluck to stand up before a crowd
and take a walloping

  ferdy took a step closer and in a
voice shaking with suppressed emo-
tion said

   i tell you what ill do mr hamm
in order to prove my courage and back
up the statements i have just made
ill go in the ring with any man you
care to pick out and i dont care how

big or how clever he is ill probably
get my head knocked off but ill show
you that im not the sissy that you
have takgn me to be i-

   ferdy  came in reproachful
terms

   you know that ive guessed right
mr hamm

  the latter regarded him with amaze-
ment to say that he was overjoyed
at ferdys willingness to fight doesnt
describe his feelings

  ferdys appearance in a prize-ring
even if he never lifted his hands even
if he appeared alone would have been
sufficient to cause him to revise his
estimate of him

  it occurred to him that it might not
be a bad idea to call ferdys bluff he
went about it diplomatically

   the idea of your taking part in a
scrap is absurd he ventured with an
irritating laugh

  is it well im ready to show
you

  hamm hastened to regret that
ferdy had misunderstood him  i
wasnt questioning your courage when
i said that he lied cheerfully  the
absurdity i had in mind was the idea
of such a well-bred young fellow as
you mixing up in any such game sup-
pose you should get hurt 

   i expect to be was the brave
reply

  hamm pretended to be horrified at
this declaration  then you insist
on-

   meeting any man that you care to
pick ferdy put in  prize-fighting
has not been in my line but as that
seems to be your idea of courage im
going to show you that professional
pugilists havent got a monopoly of it

  the readiness with which ferdy
had walked into the trap tickled hamm
all over he had hard work to keep
from laughing

   all right he acquiesced with a
great show of reluctance  but if
anything happens dont forget youre
the one that suggested the bout

   i know it ill take full responsi-
a hard man to hit



bility and remember i dont care if
my opponent is as big as grants
tomb

   it was agreed that the contest should
take place at the clintondale country
club on a saturday afternoon within
the month if hamm could obtain an
opponent for ferdy by that time the
brickmaker was laughing inwardly at
his success in diverting the young
mans thoughts from the interview
that he had in mind

  but as ferdy was leaving he said
 until i can prove to your entire
satisfaction that i am not a milksop
i will refrain from broaching the sub-
ject that brought me here to-night

  ferdys voice rang with defiance as
he made this last statement but he
had not taken half a dozen steps along
the hall before it dawned upon him
that he had been exceedingly rash
that he had booked himself for a
beating at the hands of some expert
face-destroyer

  his courage had slipped back to its
normal place before he reached the
bottom of the stairway by the time
he reached the street door he was
kicking himself for having allowed his
tongue to jeopardize- his good looks

  for ferdy was extremely proud of
his face so much so that he had
hard work to keep from cheering
when he looked in the mirror

  if he could have been assured that
his opponent would confine his execu-
tion to the body he would have felt a
great deal easier

  such ring encounters as he could
recall offhand did not offer much con-
solation in that direction invariably
these contests had ended with  pow-
erful right-hand swing to the jaw  or
 crushing blow behind the ear

   in his terror he could feel the steady
thud of fists against his delicately
tinted profile unconsciously he placed
his hand on his head expecting to
find his nose up there

  virginia eyes and cheeks aglow
with anticipation met him in the path-
way leading to the house she ex-
tended both hands he muffed them

  her quick eye noted his agitated
condition she asked him if her
father had given his consent

  he didnt hear her he was think-
ing of liniment court-plaster splints
dermatologists and such unromantic
things

  after she had urged him repeatedly
to relieve her suspense he said in a
shaking voice

  a i did not ask him we - we
talked of something else

  her face took on a puzzled expres-
sion she knew that he had requested
the interview for that purpose

   you didnt ask him  she queried
doubtingly

  he said he hadnt that he hadnt
got that far then with her amaze-
ment increasing at every word he told
her all that had occurred of his de-
termination to enter the ring to prove
his courage

   ferdinand rollins  she gasped
when he had finished  have you
gone crazy 

  she had hit the nail on the head
he thought he had been temporarily
deranged when he made the rash bar-
gain

   i felt that i had to do something
of the sort virgie he protested
 ive had a feeling all along that your
father believed me to be lacking in
nerve it was for you-

   for me  she interrupted  i-i
dont believe it if you really loved
me you wouldnt want to get beaten to
a jelly if you were bent on doing
something for me you might have
chosen something besides suicide oh
my poor ferdy i know-

  virginia he remonstrated her
predictions were anything but sooth-
ing under the circumstances

  she burst into tears she patted
his soft chubby hands and said she
couldnt bear to think of their being
incased in clumsy boxing-gloves


all-story cavalier weekly

    youre not very cheerful he
 complained

    pity i wouldnt be with the pros-
 pect of your coming back to me with-
 out any teeth and two black eyes and
 your ears cn casscrole and-

   he clapped his hand over her mouth
 to shut off the rest of her pleasant
 prophecy the fear that he might ac-
 quire an illustrated optic - perhaps a
 complete set - had occurred to him
 but the possibility of being separated
 from his teeth was a contingency he
 had overlooked

   the mere thought of parting with
 one of his pearls threw him in a panic
 he experienced a sinking sensation in
 the vicinity of the rathskeller

   he tried to wiggle his toes he
 couldnt they were frozen stiff the
 frappeing process had reached his
 knees-and was spreading

   her attitude indicated only too
 plainly that in her opinion he had al-
 ready passed away tearfully she
 bade him good night and went in
 search of her father

   the latter told her all that had
 taken place forgetting however to
 supply the motive which had prompted
 him to broach the subject of prize-
 fighting

   he didnt fool her she said she
 guessed that he didnt try very hard
 to dissuade eerdy she intimated that
 he was satisfied with the way things
 had turned out

   her intuition forced him to take
 the defensive

     ill tell you frankly virginia he
 said  ferdy is not the type of man
 i prefer he hasnt got enough red
 blood to suit me

    and youre going to assist him in
 losing the little bit he has she came
 back quickly  ill admit that he pre-
 fers his meat cooked but that doesnt
 appeal to you youre a man of strong
 tastes you wont be happy until you
  see the poor boy with early closing
 signs on both eyes if anything hap-
 pens to him youll never forgive your-
 self

  her voice broke as she said this
before he could make further com-
ment she swept from the room

  he felt a bit guilty for permitting
her to go without the assurance that
ferdy was in no danger because he
had made up his mind that no harm
should come to him as a matter of
fact he thought more of his would-be
son - in - law right then than ever be-
fore

  on the way to the brickyard the
next morning he took barney his
chauffeur into his confidence telling
him about the proposed match and the
plan he had in mind

   i want you to run down to new
york to-day he said and see if
you can engage the services of some
old broken - down fighter be sure
and get a lightweight the thinner the
better one whos hard to hit but who
if he is hit will not have the strength
to hurt ferdy i dont want to take
a single chance on the boys being in-
jured ill be perfectly satisfied if he
shows pluck enough even to enter the
ring do you get me

  with one hand tied behind my
back was  barneys confident reply
he knew new york backward  east
fourteenth street near the bowery
is thick with old has - beens of the
prize-ring how much will i offer  
 could we get one for one hundred
dollars  

  what cried the chauffeur i
could get a train-load for that stake
 be sure the fellow is hard to hit
were hamms last instructions as bar-
ney boarded the train  you see if
he has a good defense ferdy will not
be able to land a blow that might
cause him to lose his temper

   ive decided to stage the bout two
weeks from next saturday at three
oclock in the afternoon the man
you engage neednt come down until
the day before tell him to phone me
at the yard at my expense if anything
occurs to prevent his making the
journey

  and while i think of it barney
a hard man to hit



you take charge of ferdys training
and give him the impression that we
have engaged a real fighter as noth-
ing can possibly happen to him we
may as well have a little fun at his
expense

  barney was back in hamms office
before the whistle blew that evening
his beaming countenance told his em-
ployer that he had been successful

   ive got the guy you had in mind
the chauffeur began enthusiastically
 hes chasing middle age is as thin
as a rail and gentle as a lamb on
top of that hes got the reputation of
being the hardest man in the world
to hit but he couldnt put a dent in a
chocolate eclair

   good  exclaimed hamm  you
are sure hes hard to hit 

  barney said that every one had as-
sured him that the fellow was in a
class by himself in this respect the
boss handed him a substantial tip

   oh by the way he added  did
you get his name  

   they call him  the professor 
said barney  i didnt worry about
finding out his real name

  hamm said it didnt matter

   some old hulk who picks up a few
pennies giving boxing lessons i sup-
pose he observed

iii

  clintondale was considerably
rocked by the announcement that
ferdy rollins the towns most fa-
mous piece of bric-a-brac had agreed
to expose his classic countenance to
the tender mercies of a professional
pugilist

  ferdys insistence that the idea
originated with him did not gain much
credence the knowing ones aware
of the disfavor with which hamm
viewed ferdys attempt to break into
the family guessed that the brickma-
ker had deliberately planned the dis-
cussion which led to the making of
the match

  in common with hamm the men of

the town had never been madly infat-
uated with ferdy they laughed im-
moderately when they heard the news
some of them were uncharitable
enough to say that there was nothing
ferdy needed so much as a good
smash on the nose

  the women thought differently
said the contest should be stopped

  most of this comment reached fer-
dys ears it didnt make him feel
any better not that he could have
felt much worse

  fifteen or twenty times a day dur-
ing the training stunts barney would
manage to let him know that his op-
ponent was extremely large that he
could hit like a pile-driver after which
ferdy would steal away and look in
the mirror first with one eye closed
then with the other then with both
ears pulled in and his mouth twisted
to one side

  he was trying to get accustomed to
the way he fully expected to look a
few minutes after three on the after-
noon of the battle

  virginia helped to raise his spirits
by weeping all over him whenever
they met

  speculation as to the size of the
professor increased as the time for
the contest drew near every new ru-
mor adding from two to six inches to
his height and circumference until the
clintondalers were fully prepared to
meet an individual constructed on the
general lines of the statue of liberty
with a waist-line like a merry-go-
round

  needless to say most of the popu-
lation was at the station to welcome
him on the eve of the disturbance
also needless to observe that miss
virginia hamm and mr ferdinand
rollins were the most eager ones in
the big crowd that awaited his coming

  ferdy wanted to see if he could de-
tect even a scintilla ofmercy in the eye
of his executioner virginia wanted to
see the heartless wretch who was ex-
pected to put ferdy on a permanent
diet of hot gruel


all-story cavalier weekly

  when the train pulled in and dis-
charged its passengers without drop-
ping off anything that met the expecta-
tions of the crowd in a professorial
sense disappointed murmurings were
heard on every hand

  the professor had backed out was
the word that passed from lip to lip

  virginia pinched ferdy with delight
when it reached them ferdy didnt
dare show how it affected him he
clung to virginia for fear of turning
an involuntary back somersault

   well i guess hes ditched us
hamm spoke up he was mad clean
through  thats the worst of rely-
ing on one of those bowery bums for
anything

  it was because all hands had their
heads in the air firmly expecting to
see the professor stooping to dodge
the clouds that they had failed to ob-
serve an individual who had left the
train on the wrong side and was now
crossing toward the station barney
worried to death because of the appar-
ent miscarriage of his arrangements
was the first to spot the man re-
ferred to

   here he comes  the chauffeur
shouted excitedly the others saw
him dart forward and extend his hand
to the weirdest-looking human being
they had ever laid eyes upon

  emaciated to the point of being
ghastly his grisly appearance was
such as to cause several women in the
crowd to shrink back with fright

  his shriveled figure rattled around
in a rusty blue suit that was many
times too large for him a high collar
that might just as well have been in
the factory so far as -it showed any
inclination to become intimate with
hisneck emphasized his appalling lack
of fatness a straw hat whose brim
looked like a portion of caviar fitted
his smooth - shaven head entirely too
soon its inability to get a grip causing
it to sway in the opposite direction
whenever he moved his body

  this action filled those about him
with an almost uncontrollable desire

to seize it and give it a twirl for the
other end of him low shoes and
trousers at half mast showed a set of
spokes on which a hive would have
looked like a door-knob

  but it was his face that fascinated
the onlookers at first glance he ap-
peared to be indulging in a broad
smile closer examination showed this
to be his permanent expression

  the meerschaum - colored skin was
drawn away from the mouth leaving
the teeth-good teeth strange to say
-entirely exposed the effect produ-
cing his damage-proof smile you
were certain that if he tried to bring
his lips together his face would tear
hamm refused to believe that he
was the fellow that barney had en-
gaged he pulled the chauffeur to one
side and whispered impatiently

   do you mean to tell me that this
apparition is a fighter  

   thats - thats what they told
me protested barney  ill admit
hes trained pretty fine for-

  trained pretty fine interposed
the boss  i think he escaped from
some medical college

  the brickmaker returned to the
new arrival  are - are you the
professor he asked tartly

   im the guy youre waiting for
came in sepulchral tones from the
depths of the smile  if the neigh-
bors have finished giving me the once
over ill beat it to my hotel i want
to hit the hay

  in response to further questioning
by hamm he said he was in condition
to put up the battle of his life that he
had never felt better that the dis-
tance six rounds suited him perfectly

  there was a titter when he told
about doing his road work in central
park

  he expressed a desire to meet his
opponent and ferdy was pushed to-
ward him

  ferdy had never dared hope he
would have such a decrepit-looking
antagonist the moment he became
convinced that this rack of bones was
a hard man to hit



the man he would have to face his
courage went up by leaps and bounds

	he drew himself up to his full
height and shoved out his pink-sweat-
ered chest until he could hardly see
over it as he strode forward to shake
hands there was a look of pity in his
eyes as he surveyed the meatless fig-
ure in front of him the contrast be-
tween the pair made ferdy look posi-
tively brutal

  in an instant as they stood with
hands clasped sympathy shifted from
ferdy to his opponent

   its nothing short of murder to
permit that big healthy boy to enter
the ring with that living skeleton 
was an exclamation that voiced the
sentiment of the throng as the pro-
fessor picked up his grip and moved
slowly in the direction of his hotel
those nearest to him swore that they
heard his joints creak

 when he had gone the crowd
pressed about ferdy and begged him
to be merciful with his opponent
even hamm was slightly worried it
was with difficulty that ferdy con-
cealed his elation after all the an-
guish he had suffered he felt that he
was entitled to do a little plain and
fancy gloating

   i give you my word fellow citi-
zens he promised  that i will not
beat him up unless it becomes abso-
lutely necessary in my opinion you
are wasting sympathy on him they
say hes greased lightning in the ring
a loud laugh greeted this statement
 i mean it insisted ferdy  hes
the hardest man in the world to hit
he didnt believe anything of the
kind but he wasnt going- to let the
crowd think so belittling his op-
ponent would minimize the measure
of his own victory he was certain
that the vindication he sought was al-
ready in his grasp for inwardly he
had determined to make short work
of the professor

  his manner as he took virginia by
the arm and led her away was ex-
tremely haughty

   a picnic he chuckled as they
turned the corner

   im-im not so sure she re-
turned  hes scandalously thin
but oh ferdy im so afraid hes
going to muss you up 

  the delicate appearance of the pro-
fessor had reassured her to some ex-
tent she admitted as much to her
father at dinner that night the lat-
ter was a bit surprised when she asked
him for fifty dollars as she was leav-
ing the house it was considerably
more than she had been in the habit
of asking for

   a little wager on ferdy ill bet
he ventured

  she smiled but made no reply the
effort to draw her out was unsuccess-
ful

iv

  saturday found clintondale eager-
ly awaiting the outcome of the con-
test ferdys faithful training as
well as his apparent willingness to
risk his good looks eventually won
the respect of those men who had
been hostile to him

  the ring was erected in the gym-
nasium of the club an hour before
the time set for the bout the place was
packed soon after noon ferdy took
his leave of virginia

   be careful not to get hit in the
face she wailed after him

  he found her father in his dress-
ing-room hamm asked him who he
wanted for referee

   thats so wed forgotten about
that detail said ferdy

  hamm said he hadnt forgotten it
that he had figured it would be an
easy matter to get one of the club
members ferdy vetoed this sugges-
tion saying that in fairness to the
professor the third man in the ring
should be an outsider

  ferdy didnt want any flaw in his
title his squareness served to in-
crease hamms steadily increasing
respect for him

the brickmaker remembered having


all-story cavalier weekly

seen a fellow tacking signs on fences
a short distance from the club a
messenger was sent after him the
fellow came toward the club-house on
the run

   how would you like to make ten
dollars for a half-hours work
hamm asked him

  his eyes started from his head at
the offer he broke into a laugh

   honest continued the brick-
maker noting his incredulous expres-
sion  we want you to referee a
fight

  instead of replying the other threw
his hammer and signs to one side and
saluted indicating that he was ex-
tremely anxious to shake hands with
the ten-spot the alacrity with which
lie took his place in the ring made it
clear that he would have been tickled
to do the job for nothing

  ferdy was the first to show clad
in a-baby-blue bathrobe with slippers
to match he took his place in the cor-
ner assigned to him to the accompani-
ment of a shower of applause

  all eyes were turned toward the
door through which his opponent must
enter there was a roar of laughter
when he burst on their vision near-
sighted members had to look twice or
three times before they were sure
what they were laughing at

  compared with his present appear-
ance he had looked excessively fat in
his street-clothes his trunks were
made of bed-ticking

  with the exception of his sneaks
and his smile this was all he had on

  his reception seemed to please him
and he bowed right- and left he sat
in his corner legs crossed and arms
folded looking more like a dish of
cracked walnuts than a fighter

  the bell brought the men to the
center of the ring he made a sweep-
ing bow to ferdy before grabbing his
outstretched hand it had the effect
of rousing ferdys ire he got the
notion that his opponent was kidding
him

  the professor showed a willingness

to mix things from the start but
ferdy proceeded with the greatest
caution

  it was not until some ribald spec-
tator suggested that they get ferdy a
bean-bag that he decided to take a
chance he let fly his right fist

  to his great surprise and the sur-
prise of the spectators it went right
through the professors guard and
landed in the middle of his smile but
it didnt impair the latter

   bully for you ferdy shouted
hamm

  thus encouraged ferdy gave the
professor a severe poke in the ribs
he pulled away his hand as he did
so and shook it as if it hurt him

  the blow didnt disturb the pro-
fessors grin the old fighter was
tapping ferdy with considerable fre-
quency but it was apparent that there
was no steam behind his blows

  as the round ended ferdy was
swatting his opponent right and left
with the crowd urging him on to
greater efforts

   great  shouted hamm as ferdy
took his seat the brickmaker was
busy telling his neighbors that they
had had ferdy wrong  hes got the
heart of a lion he kept repeating

   go right at him when the bell
rings counseled ferdys advisers
 did his blows hurt you  

  ferdy said he had scarcely felt
them  but make no mistake about
the professor he said  hes in
wonderful condition hes as hard as
nails i think i skinned my knuckles
on him when i hit him in the ribs

  the professor was in the center
beaming with good nature when hos-
tilities were resumed

  his smile was beginning to irritate
ferdy it nettled him too to think
that his blows were not more effective
the harder he hit the professor the
broader the latters smile

  hamm and most of the onlookers
were astonished at the ease with which
ferdy belted the supposedly skilful
boxer a resounding smash in the
a hard man to hit



ribs only brought a low laugh from
the bony athlete

  losing his temper at this exhibition
of indifference ferdy rushed at him
and svung with all his might the
blow caught the professor on the
side of the head he toppled to
the floor with the crowd yelling like
comanches

   take it easy boy shrieked
hamm  youve got him if you only
wait

   one shouted the referee

  ferdy quivering like stewed rhu-
barb was standing over the prostrate
figure the professors smile ap-
peared to be just as brilliant as ever
albeit his eyes were a bit glassy

  the referees failure to continue the
count brought protests from all parts
of the house he appeared to be in
distress

   two he managed to get out
 tut-tut-tut-tut-

   whistle it came derisively from
one of the open windows

  but despite the urging of the crowd
the referee never got beyond the syl-
lable tut

  a hopeless look entered ferdys
eyes as he realized that he had a stut-
tering referee to contend with he
shot a reproachful glance at hamm

   i didnt know any more about
him than you did roared the brick-
maker

  in the mean time the professor had
clambered to his feet and was once
more beaming on the man who had
knocked him down realizing that
he would have to knock him cold to
overcome the handicap of the tongue-
tied arbiter ferdy waded right in and
swung on his opponent from every
angle

  the bell found him breathless from
his exertions and feeling of his hands
in an apprehensive manner

  it was the same way for the suc-
ceeding four rounds ferdy landing
ten blows to the professors one and
growing weaker with every punch it
infuriated him to think that he didnt

have the strength to end the contest
there wasnt another swing left in
ferdy when the final bell ended the
battle

    rur - rur - rur - rollins wins on
points 

   the decision excavated from the
referees diaphragm with an effort
that came very near strangling him
was greeted with wild applause

  ferdy was too far gone to shake
hands with his adversary he was
amazed when the professor patted him
on the back and told him he had done
splendidly ferdys fellow townsmen
swamped him with congratulations

   one of the more enthusiastic ones
seized his hands an action which
brought a yell of pain from him
hamm his face bursting with pride
got him free of the crowd and into
the dressing-room

   youre there ferdy and no mis-
take exclaimed the brickmaker de-
lightedly  there isnt a mark on
you

   not on my face said ferdy
 but im afraid to look at my hands

   his fears in this respect proved to
be well founded they were black
and blue swollen out of all shape and
badly skinned in many places he had
to grit his teeth to keep from yelling
when they removed the gloves

   after they had been properly ban-
daged hamm hustled him through a
side door and into his automobile
barney had promised virginia he
would break the speed laws bringing
ferdy back and he kept his word

   you dont know how proud of
you i am ferdy declared the brick-
maker as the car shot down the road

  ferdy didnt appear to be very
jubilant

    you havent got much reason to
be he returned quietly  it makes
me ashamed to think that i havent
got enough strength to knock out an
old fossil like that i wouldnt care
but i poundedhim until i couldnt lift
my hands i think i must have hit
him a million times


all-story cavalier weekly

  hamm had been surprised at the in-
effectiveness of ferdys blows but
he didnt say so

   never mind about that he said
soothingly  you got the decision
and better than that you convinced
everybody in clintondale of your
courage

   did-did i convince you   he
put this question expectantly

   you bet you did was the prompt
reply  so much so that it wont be
necessary for you to ask me what you
had in mind that night you have
my consent

  ferdy blushed and shoved out his
damaged right hand hamm seized
it well above the wrist and shook it

  virginia ran down the stoop to
greet them her joy on beholding
ferdys face intact caused her to over-
look his upholstered haifds at her
fathers suggestion they went into the
library

  you wait here on the porch
barney and bring the professor in
when he comes directed hamm
 i told him to stop here on the way
to the train and get his money

  once inside ferdy lost no time in
acquainting virginia with her fathers
decision an announcement which
caused her to throw her arms about
the latters neck and assure him that
he was leading the daddy league by
several hundred points

  in the midst of this jubilation
barney entered followed by the pro-
fessor

   well you dont look any the
worse for your experience hamm
observed as he peeled one hundred
dollars off a roll and passed it to the
still smiling specter

   shucks no was the easy reply
 a friendly bout like that doesnt
bother me

  ferdy shot an offended look at him
a friendly bout indeed so that was
how he regarded his avalanche of
punches

   i hope everything was satisfac-
tory suggested the professor he

shoved the money in his trouser-
pocket and fastened the opening with
a three-inch safety-pin

   perfectly returned hamm  but
-but we were a bit disappointed with
your poor defense they said you
were the hardest man in the world
to hit

   and i am came with a quiet
chuckle  ill leave it to rollins
he turned to ferdy with  did you
ever hit anything harder in your
life

  ferdy shook his head in the nega-
tive  like hammering a stone
wall he agreed

  his jocular manner rather annoyed
the brickmaker  i dont mean your
condition he said sharply  i
mean-

   i know what you mean the pro-
fessor interrupted in a more respect-
ful tone  fifteen years ago when i
was prominent in the boxing game i
was regarded as the fastest man in my
class in fact for some time after
i began to ossify i-

  ossify cried ferdy jumping to
his feet

   sure was the nonchalant re-
sponse  ive been making my living
as an ossified man for the last ten
years it developed from constant
training for ring engagements i
happened to be out of a job when
your agent came into the saloon on
fourteenth street looking for a boxer
he said he wanted a has-been a par-
ticularly thin one and one who was
hard to hit as i filled the bill to
the letter the proprietor recommended

       

me

  with the others staring at him
open-mouthed he dipped into the side
pocket of his coat and pulled out a
handful of greasy-looking cards and
passed them around they read

   professor granite obrien ossi-
fied wonder goobers museum new
york

  ferdy livid with rage shook both
bandaged hands under the professors
nose  and yet you stood there and
gold fever



permitted me to break my bands on
you for six rounds knowing full
well-

   hes right added hamm with
some heat  you made no attempt
to block his blows it will be weeks
before his hands are in shape again

  instead of answering the professor
turned toward virginia with a plead-
ing look in his eyes ferdy and his
intended father-in-law surprised at
this action followed his gaze their
surprise increasing when they ob-
served that she was visibly agitated

   what does this mean   her
father demanded

  it means came from virginia
with a half-sob- it means that the
professor is not to blame it was my
fault

 your fault they chorused
sharply

   yes she went on quickly  oh
ferdy can you ever forgive me you
owe your lacerated hands to me i
paid the professor the fifty dollars
papa gave me to let you hit him as
often as you liked

with the tip of his tongue and al-

 he kept shifting his glances first this
 way then that

  he might have been expecting a
 blow from behind but he was afraid
 to take his eyes off the big heavy fig-
 ure that was striding up and down in

 stinnet 

   just over ten years mr pattison

   and your interest in the business
 has never slackened has it

  thats very kind of you mr pat-
 tison but stinnets voice was weak

   how much did we make over the
 bahama deal 

   eighty-four thousand

   how did we invest it 

  stinnet with the keenness of the
 secretary devoted to his work rattled
 off the details glibly

   and what did we drop on mica
 ore

  stinnets answer was ready

  how do we stand to-day and
 where shall we stand next settling
 day 

  stinnet figured it out before the
 great man had paced the tigerskin
 rug twice he rose from the chair
 and handed him the scrap of paper

 pattison looked at it smiled rolled
 it into a ball and flung it into the fire

   stinnet he said  ive come to
 the conclusion that youre indispensa-
 ble to me

   mr pattison-

 you have a genius for finance

   mr pattison i owe it to you

   im aware of it thats one of
 the reasons that i have sent for you
 to-night youve given up the whole
 of your life to finance havent you 

 every minute of my waking day

 and dreamed of it at night-eh 

   ah  said stinnet

   tell me why  pattison demand-
 ed gruffly

   why mr pattison i cant ex-
  plain its got hold of me i cant
  think of anything else

   thats it said pattison nodding
  his head and pressing his lips tightly
  together  thats it exactly its got
  hold of you its had hold of me for
  years and years

   thats why youre great mr pat-
  tison thats why every one speaks
  about you as though you were-

   shut up  said pattison quickly
   thats why im small you mean
  im like you ive given up the whole
  of my life to finance

   gold nothing else will satisfy
  me i too think of it every minute of
  the waking day i too dream of it
  i live for it theres nothing else worth
  while

   no mr pattison

   im a giant in the finance world
   a colossus mr pattison
  pattison shrugged

   but im not the only one

   no-o stinnet grudgingly con-
  fessed -

  youre thinking- of herkomer-
  julius herkomer

   yes mr pattison

   ever met him  

   no

   what do you think of him 

   i think hes wonderful

  pattison laughed

   hes clever he admitted  at
  least he was clever enough to engineer
  that fall in panama seconds what
  did that cost us stinnet

  stinnet wrote something on another
  scrap of paper pattison glanced at
  what he had written and nodded

   nearly ruined us he said  who
  could have told him that we were
  steeped up to the necks in the cursed
  things  

  stinnet sprang to his feet

   thats all right said pattison
   i dont suspect you youre too
  loyal a servant for that

  thank god mr pattison

   why do you say that   pattison
  asked lowering his voice  why do
gold fever



you say  thank god  when youre
talking about money  

   i dont understand

  you dont do you never read
your bible

  im afraid not mr pattison ive
no time

  again pattison nodded

   neither do i he said he paced
the floor in silence for another minute
then suddenly he dropped a heavy
hand on stinnets shoulder

   stinnet he said  its a microbe
-a fever-this gold once it gets
into your blood nothing can get it out
have you ever realized that 

  stinnet had never heard him talk
like this before he lay back in his
chair his mouth open

   yes he said falteringly  i have
thought of it in that way

   it whips your blood into an awful
heat doesnt it and the heat takes
the very breath out of your lungs
you begin to see things catch my
meaning 

   yes said stinnet more weakly
than ever

   visions i mean - distorted vi-
sions you begin to talk gold to eat
gold-everythings gold you blind
yourself to everything else you
never see anything as other people
see it

   tell me do you ever walk into the
country 

   seldom said stinnet

 youve forgotten all about it i
suppose has any one ever talked to
you about the beauty of the country 
 no admitted stinnet  i have
no time to think about such things

   neither have i said pattison  i
was happy immensely happy when i
had two thousand a year i dont
think i shall ever be happy again do
you know why im talking to you like
this

  stinnet shook his head

   itll surprise you to-day theres
been a searching of soul in this room
it commenced after i heard that her-
komer was likely to crush me

   i ran my eyes over the position
and i came to the conclusion-perhaps
thisll surprise you stinnet-i came to
the conclusion that if herkomer
wished he could crush me and i
should never be able to rise again

   supposing stinnet you were in
that position - my position - and a
blow like that came down on your
neck what do you think would be your
feelings 

  stinnets bony fingers gripped the
edge of the table

   i darent think of it he said in a
whisper

   my feelings said pattison
 were exactly the reverse of what i
should have expected them to be

   i was immeasurably relieved

   first i said to myself  it has hap-
pened rann pattison youre down
and beaten

   my idea stinnet was to meet the
trouble half-way in order to see if i
could accustom myself to the position
to see if i could stand a blow like that
and live and the more i thought of
it the more i hoped that the blow
would fall

   there that staggers you it was
the most amazing sensation id ever
experienced

   here was i a man whom the
newspapers describe as  golden patti-
son for years and years id been
blind id been stumbling along the
highways and byways of a world made
of gold

   the trees were gold the sky was
gold the mountains were gold  peo-
ple who passed me in the street were
gold everything was inanimate

   my only regret was that the very
air i sucked into my lungs wasnt
molten gold

  as i say all those years i had
been stumbling through the seven days
work of god and i never once tried
to appreciate what had been made for
me

   i used to hear people talk of the
poetry of the countryside and i used
to set them down as brainless insipid


all-story cavalier weekly

fools who hadnt the grit to get on
themselves and who were ages and
ages behind me in acumen

   people used to say to me  why
dont you travel more and see the beau-
ties of the world  and i hadnt the
patience to answer them because the
only beauty the world held for me lay
in big dividends great coups that
meant the building up of an already
mighty fortune

   but that sensation stinnet when
everything went dont get it into
your head that ive gone mad im
quite sane i assure you in fact to-
day ive taken a saner view of life
than ever before

   that sensation that came with the
belief that i was down and beaten it
was as though some one had suddenly
smashed the office windows and a rush
of wind had come in straight through
from the countryside right into my
very soul

  for the first time for twenty
thirty years i saw the sky and in
anguish positively anguish stinnet i
cried out  good luck to you herko-
mer  

  well stinnets head was nod-
ding his fingers were pressing so
tightly on the edge of the table that
the tips were bloodless

  well said pattison thats all
it was a dream-nothing more her-
komer hadnt beaten me and i woke
up to find myself where i started
ready to do battle with any man who
ever faked a balance-sheet 

   but that glimpse of a sane life
started me thinking stinnet i feel
that i have ruined my whole life ive
been giving too much time to the ac-
cumulating of money because the fe-
vers in my blood my wife-

  he took in a deep breath and looked
at stinnet steadily for a second

   my wife he repeated  i have
begun to wonder if i have done the
right thing by her

   dont speak stinnet-not yet i
know that youre amazed at this new
attitude of mine this new line of

thought but ive never been moved so
much as i have to-day

   heres a strange phase of the
whole business so far as it affects my
wife if people were to ask her sud-
denly and she were to reply without
subterfuge or evasion of any kind-if
they were to say to her  has your
marriage been a happy one   i think
she would say  no

   if they were to say  has it given
you all the love that you expected  
she would be bound to say  no

   you see stinnet ive never had
time to indulge what you and i yes-
terday might have called the sentimen-
tal side of a mans nature i dont
think ive spent more than two hours
in any week in the company of my
wife

   and heres the strange phase that
i hinted at i have stayed away from
her i havent indulged the sentimental
side of my nature i havent given
her the love that she might have ex-
pected because-because i love her so
dearly

   theres a paradox but a very easy
one to think out just go to that door
stinnet and make certain that the
cleaners are not there

  stinnet stumbled rather than
walked to the door came back for the
key opened the door looked out and
went back to his chair

   give me that key said pattison
and he placed it again in his pocket
 where was i  ah yes i said that
i loved her dearly of course i did
every cent that ive added to the pile
has been for her

   theres been no one else to prod
the ambitious spirit if it threatened to
flag ive said to myself again and
again  its all for mirabel

   i wanted every single soul in this
city to envy her i wanted them to
say  thats the wife of rann patti-
son the wealthiest man in the world
shes the wealthiest wife

   its true stinnet

   and now ive been brought to
realize that ive made her a martyr-
gold fever



for thats what it amounts to ive
neglected her

   shes been very patient but i cant
hide from myself the fact that i
havent been a devoted husband be-
cause devotedness is something greater
than signing a check to meet the house-
hold bills now i come to you
stinnet started guiltily

   to me mr pattison  

   yes to you im responsible for
spoiling your life

   ive taught you to think of gold
as i think of it ive robbed you of
interest in any other thing isnt it
so

   i love the work mr pattison

   ah there you go youve never
had time to love anything else have
you  

   no mr pattison

   youve been privy to my thoughts
for over ten years

   yes mr pattison

   you know as much about my busi-
ness as i know of it myself 

  stinnet shrugged his shoulders de-
precatingly

 you know you do stinnet
didnt i say just now that you were
indispensable to me ive taught you
to understand everything connected
with the finance market

   and im grateful to you mr pat-
tison no one can accuse me of in-
gratitude youve made a business
man of me

   ive infected your blood the mi-
crobes in it you have the fever

  a stronger light gleamed in stin-
nets eyes and he nodded eagerly

   youve never had time to think
of anything else have you stinnet
 no mr pattison

   ive shown you how by the appli-
cation of a little strategy by the as-
sumption of a little carefully thought
out bluff you can make gold positively
shower down from the ceiling on your
table

yes mr pattison he was an-
swering in sharp half-checked breaths
 in short stinnet youve given

your life up to me in order that i
might use it for my own purposes

   it has been willingly given for
what was i when i first came to you
a clerk

   yes im grateful mr pattison
my whole life is given up to the work
i think of nothing else i dont want
to think of anything else and as i say
im grateful

  pattison stopped his restless pacing
and leaned against the mantel-shelf

  stinnets face was turned up to him
the light striking down from the
shaded lamp made it appear more un-
healthy than it really was

  pattison without moving a finger
and without seeming to take a fresh
breath said

  youre grateful are you then
what the devil do you mean by ma-
king love to my wife

  even in that moment of strain pat-
tison admired what he believed to be
nerve

  stinnet had not moved an inch but
his fingers ceased the restless tapping

  he was looking up at his accuser
with a peculiar expression of defiance
on his thin face he made no attempt
to refute the calumny if calumny it
was pattisons own attitude was re-
markable in a way

  if he had been theatrical in his ac-
cusing he was the reverse in the few
moments that followed he propped
himself against the mantel-shelf and
met stinnets gaze

  his calm was laughable and yet it
was one of those calms that make thd
heart jump

   dont trouble to deny it stinnet
he said in a persuasive ridiculous tone
of voice  i can stand anything but
lies and dont get it into your head
that im going to kill you and make a
newspaper job of it

  why should i youre indis-
pensable to me in business see the
irony of it see how the fever holds
you down-ties you down

   supposing i kicked up a fuss and
you got away you could skip off in


all-story cavalier weekly

search of this herkomer and unbosom
yourself to my detriment in less than
ten minutes you could put him wise
on certain points and i should be
down and out before i had a chance
of a breather

   i do deny it stinnets voice was
stronger than ever before

  but now the gleam in his eyes had
changed color it had been red now it
was white-white because of the fear
that had come upon him he fancied
that pattison was bordering on insan-
ity

   i dont see how you can and pat-
tison shook his head despairingly  i
have had you watched so carefully for
months and months

   eh yes thats another symptom
of the fever-you cant trust anybody
-always full of suspicion youve
been writing a great many letters late-
ly stinnet

  stinnet slipped out of his chair he
seemed to be much taller and his eyes
were clearer

  what if i have he asked with
great boldness  mustnt i write a
letter to-to anybody because of this
-this fever as you call it

   sit down said pattison sharply
assuming the tone of the bully  i
want to think for a minute

   think as long as you like said
stinnet truculently

   and youve been using a little
branch post-office-leaving your letters
to be called for- musingly and as
though he were fitting all the clues
together

   the letters were addressed to a

	miss daivnish 

  what if they were

   oh now were beginning to un-
derstand each other i was going to
mention that i came across one of the
envelopes it was typewritten but
theres a faint  a  on the machine in
your room stinnet ive often no-
ticed it in your memoranda there
have been meetings too-clandestine
meetings-

   look here pattison-

   mr pattison you weasel 

   mr pattison if that suits you bet-
ter youve opened my eyes

   i guessed that

   and ive seen that all these years
ive been a-what you called me

   a weasel stinnet-a boneless
creepy weasel

   but youve helped me to get back
to-to a sense of manliness

   cut it out

   youve accused me of-i wont re-
peat it let me tell you this i have
a wife of my own

   pattison bit at his lips

   and if you like you can come
home with me now and repeat to her
what youve said to me

   if you breathe a word outside this
office of what has passed to-night
said pattison  ill put my foot on
your neck just as i would on the neck
of-of a weasel i think im big
enough to face this business steadily-
theres going to be no mock heroics no
whining

   i dont know mrs pattison i
havent been in her company

   i feel like kicking you now said
pattison grimly  if you owned up i
should have blamed myself for every-
thing

  stinnet pushed his chair back from
the table pattison said again  sit
down 

   i shall not sit down said stinnet
 havent been in her company

   by god i havent been in my own
wifes company long enough to remem-
ber her voice ive been here-here
slaving my heart out in your interests
ive given all that was best in me to
you-

 no no stinnet blame the fever
 i blame you when i came to jrou
more than ten years ago i was a clerk
with an income of two hundred a
year

   youre down on my pay-sheet to-
day for two thousand

   and that income of two hundred
was an assured income-the income of
a legacy well invested
gold fever



   fever yes you have infected
me but id give ten years of my life
to be in the old position and with the
old feelings two hundred a year and
happiness god your ingratitudes
stiffened me

  pattison took two steps forward
and his heavy hands fastened on the
bent shoulders of stinnet

   look at me-straight in the eyes
so now answer me this and if you
lie ill choke the life out of you have
you always been loyal to me  

   take your hands away 

   have you always been loyal  

   take them away-youre hurt-
ing

  yes or no

  pattison removed his hands from
the thin shoulders

   i understand your silence he said
thickly

  but he didnt in this particular case
he drew the key of the door from his
pocket and tossed it to stinnet

   get out he said curtly and stum-
bled to the chair vacated by the secre-
tary stinnet lost no time in getting
outside the building

ii

  a tall woman much younger than
her years but with an expression of
sadness always haunting her eyes

  a woman good to look upon with
clear-cut features and high temples that
spoke of intellectuality her eyes could
be soft but there was something in
them that suggested self-confidence a
strong independent spirit something
that would warn a man or a woman
not to presume on the fallacy of sex
inferiority

  at times the mouth was very hard
the lips were continually moving to the
calculations of the brain

  society knew little about her for
she cared little about society yet she
would have been a most gracious orna-
ment to it

  her figure would have attracted at-
tention in any ballroom-so slim lithe

and beautifully fashioned also she
dressed with rare taste though always
she became the gown-the gown only
added to her magnificent dignity

  she was a silent woman needing
none of the stimulus craved after by
society women in general-no gossip
no petty meaningless afternoon func-
tions nothing to help her while away
the time in her life this in spite of
the fact that pattison had never awak-
ened to a full sense of his obligations

  no matter what the spirit or ten-
dencies of a woman no matter whether
she be cold of nature or preoccupied
with thoughts and problems that are
not generally attributed to the sex
there is always a moment when the
husband may play the lover and she
will appreciate the loving

  to look at this wife of rann patti-
son one would have said that he had
never understood her or rather that
she was a misunderstood woman

  once some one remarked with
daring flippancy  mr pattison must
be a stranger in his own house-he
seems always to be working

  if the flippant one had expected this
tall beautiful woman to make an out-
burst of confidence and confess that
she was lonely and neglected the ex-
pectation was not realized

  mrs rann pattison said simply  is
it not a mans duty to work no one
-no man-ever killed himself with
overwork

  she was sitting in her own room
when pattison reached home after his
scene with stinnet she was reading
an evening newspaper but dropped it
on the floor as he came into the room

   youre early rann she said  i
didnt expect you

   i suppose not he said  do you
ever expect me  

  he wasnt looking at her nor she
at him his head was slightly inclined
forward and he was looking at all the
corners of the room as though he half-
expected secrets to come stalking out
of them

   ever expect you  perhaps not


all-story cavalier weekly

 now you come to mention it i was
 saying to some one only the other day
 that if i were a widow- 

  who was the some one  

 she turned round in the chair to find
 him standing in the middle of the
 room gazing at her scrutinizingly

never before had he spoken so
roughly so imperatively but instead
of the tears that might have come into
the eyes of a weaker woman she nar-
rowed hers and gave him back look for
look

  perhaps it was a servant she
 said coldly  perhaps it wasnt
 whats happened to you to-day 

  why do you ask that  do i look
 as though something had happened to
 me

  yes

  you have an observant eye

  so ive been told

well what should you think
could have happened to me  

  im sorry she said stooping to
 regain possession of the newspaper
  i was reading the feuilleton in this
 paper

 he smiled contemptuously

  a love story   he queried

  yes and quite interesting you
 see i want to make myself believe that
 sometimes men are-well men not
 bullies

 he came up behind her chair and
 placed a hand on her shoulder

  i beg your pardon he said  but
 is there anything that you would detest
 more than a display of sickly senti-
 ment  

  having had so little experience i
 cant say she replied  but tell me
 why should you talk to me like this to-
 night with all your faults-

 oh i have faults

  every man has i was going to
 say with all your faults you have al-
 ways tried to be courteous

 and for the second time that night
 pattison threw a bomb

  how long has this affair with stin-
 net been going on   he asked

 and for the second time that night

pattison was compelled to admire
nerve

  she waited a long time before giving
him answer and he didnt attempt to
flurry her she should have a fair op-
portunity of framing any answer that
she had to make

   about twelve months she said
with suddenness that fairly equaled
his own

  it almost took away his breath but
during the day and while fighting out
this trouble in his own mind he had
actually prepared himself for this an-
swer or for at least a confession and
he had argued against his natural in-
clinations just as he had in the case of
stinnet

  he was responsible for what had
happened

  twelve months he said then
he asked her to take her eyes off the
paper and look at him

   are you taking this seriously
mirabel   he asked

   what did you expect me to do
she said- faint 

   i dont know i suppose the ordi-
nary woman would have done some-
thing of that sort

   do you class me as an ordinary
woman  

   no he said in an unsteady voice
 i dont i have never known a wom-
an to take a blow like that so coolly

   what blow   she asked sharply
you asked me a straightforward
question and being a woman who
knows the folly of prevaricating when
she is faced by a man like yourself i
gave you a straightforward reply
pattison sat down on a chair near
her he said

   yesterday i considered myself a
strong man one fully able to combat
any old trouble that came along no
matter how suddenly it came but ill
give you best you have me beaten

   i dont understand you

   perhaps the tumbling of the mar-
ket this morning has affected my brain
-that and one or two other things-
but im not certain that im in my own
gold fever



house speaking to my own wife did
you quite get my meaning when i
asked you how long this affair with
stinnet has been going on  

   quite she answered

   do you know that i  nailed  him
in the office to-day-this evening
again she took advantage of his
comparative calmness carefully to
think out her answer then she said
 i was afraid it would come to that
i can see now that i allowed my en-
thusiasm to carry me too far stinnet
wasnt the kind of man that i should
have listened to

  pattison said  mirabel i dont
know how this affair is affecting your
mind but i swear that im not certain
whether im standing on my head or
on my heels

   do you realize what im ask-
ing you-what im questioning you
about 

   i think i do she replied  you
asked me how long my acquaintance
with your confidential secretary has
been going on i told you about twelve
months what else do you wish to
know  

   by god  said pattison  youre
the ideal strong wife-

   not of the ideal strong man
rann

   you dare to sit there and tell me
in cold blood that your acquaintance
with my hound of a secretary has ex-
tended over twelve months what
about these letters  

  she had risen from her chair and
as before was giving him look for
look

  there was no fear no trembling
no flushed cheeks nor quivering lips no
asking for quarter

  what letters

  he snapped his fingers

   youve been frank devilishly
frank up to now dont commence to
humbug letters have passed between
you

   yes i admit it

   where are they have you kept
them

  some of them

  i want to see them

  by what right do you ask   she
 demanded

 right he exclaimed the
 right of a husband 

  a husband  i was beginning to
 doubt that there was such a thing

  youve never complained

  does a man need to be complained
 to before he remembers the vows he
 took at the altar  

  dont let us get away from the
 subject these letters-i want to see
 them

  you cant

  are they in this house  or has
 your cunning-

  theres been no particular cunning
 about it she said  i admit that
 stinnet has written me letters

  and youve treasured them ill
 bet

 for a time-yes

  and how often has he been to this
 house while ive been away

  when ive been here she said
  hes never been once i dont know
 how many times he may have been
 while ive been away to tell you the
 truth ive never seen him

 pattison was rapidly losing that re-
 markable control which he had shown
 when he first entered the room he
 struck the table with his clenched fist
 and raised his voice

  how do you expect me to believe
 that

 she surveyed him calmly for a mo-
 ment then

  do you wish the servants to over-
 hear this display of temper   she
 asked coolly  did you behave like
 this when you nailed stinnet as you
 term it  

  do you mean what you say that
 youve never seen stinnet  

  not to my knowledge she said

  but you admit receiving letters
 from him  

  yes probably a dozen-no more
  and that you treasure them  
 yes grudgingly


all-story cavalier weekly

   do you admit theyre in this house
now  

   i refuse to answer

  he left her standing in the middle
of the room and in two strides was at
her private desk

  she called out to him in a thin
pained voice rann dont do it
he wrenched the lid from the desk as
though it were made of paper she
didnt look round her cheeks had
gone very pale the iron nerve might
have been deserting her

  she heard him rummaging among
the papers then came a second or
two of silence as though he were read-
ing then he cried out gasping as
though it were difficult to believe his
eyes	

  still she did not move from her posi-
tion in the center of the room he
came up behind her and thrust before
her eyes a typewritten letter

  she nodded weakly there was no
need to hide anything now

  that came from stinnet he
asked

   yes she said  it did

   then in the name of god explain
the meaning of it do you see what
hes written  

   i know it by heart her head
was held high and she was answering
him without looking at him only the
heaving of her bosom showed how
deeply she was affected

   he writes saying that for ten
thousand pounds he will give mr
herkomer the desired information con-
cerning my operations in western
pacific 

   yes

   that letter was sent to you and
picked up at the post-office for you by
miss daivnish who happens to be your
second cousin

   quite right she said and sighed

   but i dont understand it  he
stamped his foot  do you mean to
tell me that stinnet knows my wife is
acting as an agent for herkomer that
through her he can sell my business
secrets  

   stinnet is not aware of my con-
nection with the matter he has been
dealing with miss daivnish who to
him is a typist in the employ of mr
julius herkomer

  pattison was fuming in his perplex-
ity

   then where the devil do you come
in   he asked

  and she hit him with her answer
just as he had hit stinnet earlier in
the evening

   i am julius herkomer 

  pattison satisfied now that the
world was unreal and that he was
moving in a dream stumbled to the
chair that she had left a few minutes
before

  he didnt ask for any further ex-
planation she gave it without the
asking

   i am julius herkomer she re-
peated  and for twelve months i have
been using the brains that are mine

   for what purpose  

   oh just to make life possible
thats all at least that was how i
felt when i started but it began to
grow on me

   does stinnet know anything about
this

   i told you a moment ago that stin-
net knows nothing save that he was
offered ten thousand for certain in-
formation

   at the time the offer was made to
him  mr julius herkomer  was not
aware that mr rann pattison was in-
volved-

  he was trying to overcome the
effects of the blow the stunning stu-
pefying statement that his own wife
was the substance of the shadow that
had been haunting him for months

   stinnet she went on  is just
one of those small creations that are
made to be used by others i shant
tell you how i discovered that

   as a financier as a man who has
to know as much about human nature
as about the money market you will
understand this afternoon a letter
was sent to stinnet-it should have
gold fever



reached him by now at his home-ask-
ing him to call on miss daivnish as
soon as possible there was bad news
for him

  pattison was sitting with his mouth
wide open

   he was going to be told-and its
the truth-that mr julius herkomer
has shot his bolt a coup which he
believed to be as simple as cashing a
check over a bank counter failed him
only this morning in the space of
five minutes he was a wealthy financier
and a beggar

  pattison spoke but his words were
hardly audible

  beaten - herkomer what
over  

   panama seconds

   by god he  killed  me on
them

   yes i know and he was  killed 
in turn

   you  killed  me

   yes-as julius herkomer

   knowing that you were  killing 
me

   no his wife replied  i told you
just now that i didnt know that you
were involved well why dont you
do it

   why dont i do what  

   kill  julius herkomer -literal-
ly

  he was breathing loudly and the
corners of his eyes were all puckered
when he spoke again it was in a voice
that frightened her-not a rough ac-
cusatory voice but the voice of a
young man-a young man who has
suddenly awakened to life and seen a
great and glittering world unfolded
before him

   mirabel  he said  do you
realize that im ruined  

  she said are you as carelessly
as though she were answering a ques-
tion about the weather

   when ive squared my debts there
will be about fifteen hundred a year
left to us

   us 

   of course

   what do you mean by  us   i
 killed  you 

  killed me he said no
mirabel youve remade me come
here

  it was as though the blood in her
heart chilled for a time by all that he
had uttered had suddenly thawed and
was rushing to the extremities in hot
waves

   no she said not yet i am
julius herkomer-i was julius her-
komer - and im going to tell you
why

   i know i know 

   you dont-you cant

   go on then

   i was left alone too often-

   just what i told stinnet

   never mind stinnet listen i
was left alone day after day night
after night i had everything that
money could buy but there are lots of
things that money cant buy

   it cant make a house less like a
prison there was a time when you
and i were very happy - that was
when you were in the beginning of
things when your income didnt ex-
ceed three or four thousand dollars a
year

   then you commenced to make
more it came not by degrees but in
swift rushes just as though the gold-
caverns of the world had been opened
at your command and the gnomes had
thrown up to you their subterranean
treasures

   you told me a great many things
about your business how it was creep-
ing up how you meant to corner this
and corner that how easily it could be
done

   and then when you began to
leave me to myself and i began to
want for something to do i said to
myself  why not interest yourself
more in his business-why not take a
hand in it yourself 

   out of the amounts you advanced
for household expenses i saved day
after day while sitting here alone i
studied the markets of the world i


all-story cavalier weekly

approached a broker in the city-by
letter i opened an account with him
and made a few investments off my
own bat

   the man told me i was a fool but
he lived to follow every move that i
made in a very short while i real-
ized that i had a gift for finance-for
more than that

   i seemed to be able to look ahead
to sum up potentialities that the ma-
jority of women never dream about
and then it got hold of me-

  the fever mirabel

  yes you can call it the fever i
suppose the ordinary woman elated at
the success of her initial ventures
would have rushed to her husband for
congratulation

   but then you and i have lived so
far apart that i felt i shouldnt appre-
ciate any congratulations you might
have to offer

   besides this fever was on me i
wanted to go on making more and the
more i made the higher became the
temperature a fever - a lust no
one who hasnt experienced it can de-
scribe it

   i can said pattison in a low
breath

   you can has it come to you--
the awakening 

   yes he answered and went near-
er it came to-day - came in the
most wonderful way imaginable i
had been advised that herkomer was
nailing me-that i wasnt likely to get
out of the complication with a whole
skin so i sat down and argued with
myself

   i put the proposition to myself
 supposing you are done for what
then  

   and instead of the blind ungov-
ernable rage that id expected i was
happier

   ill confess mirabel that i thought
again of you as i used to think in the
old times when we had that small in-
come i realized that those were great
days

  lie paused as though expecting her

to speak but she made no movement
she was still standing with head erect
and eyes fixed as though on some dis-
tant object

  he stepped forward so that it was
easy to put his left hand round her
shoulders

  did you hear that mirabel he
asked  those were great days

  her lips moved never so slightly

   great days she repeated and
there was a world of yearning in her
voice  great days she repeated
 but now-we are beggars

   no not beggars mirabel we are
far from that stage its as though we
had passed out of the sick-room out
of the fever hospital into the cool air
do you feel like that  

  she nodded her head and as she felt
his arm closing more tightly on her
shoulders she lowered her head

   mirabel  he would have kissed
her cold cheek-cold with a beautiful
freshness-but a servant knocked at
the door and entered with a letter

  it was from stinnet they both of
them recognized it

   you open it pattison said but
she held it out to him and he tore open
the envelope stinnet had written to
miss daivnish

   please burn all the letters i have sent to
you herkomers fall means nothing to
me i dont care i dont want any ten
thousand im leaving the city to-night
and going into the country i have been
run down i am going into the country for
a cure and i dont think i shall ever come
back to the city please do not address
any further letters to me at the office i
have left mr rann pattisons employ

yours faithfully

noah stinnet

  pattison threw the letter in the fire
then he stretched out his hand and
turned the light slightly lower

  the flames in the grate leaped high-
er casting a red glow over the room
he placed his arm around mirabels
waist and led her to the divan

   lets talk mirabel he said-
 lets talk of the old days
     ralph roeder

having announced some half-
hour before that at eleven that
evening which happened to be
christmas eve he intended to marry
mile elise de aube the comic opera
star the good-looking youth in the
evening clothes had since with his
customary pleasant-humored noncha-
lance awaited the inevitable storm

  across from him in an italian-
carved chair was the pig-iron king
also in evening clothes which set off
a more powerful if less graceful
figure than the sons

 the boy was now reiterating
quietly

   i am going to marry her

   but i tell you that she is a chirp-
ing actress and i despise any one
man or woman who chirps or fiddles
for a living why there are a hun-
dred decent girls in new york who
would have you in a minute

   possibly but-well-this elise is
a thing of fire and shadows a whirl-
wind a chameleon she makes life
dance its all wrong i know but
youve brought me up on the extreme
of things you live it yourself how
do you expect me to be clammily re-
spectable when you loot and raid and
dash and dare every day in business 

  the fathers lips clamped shut but
the shadow of a tremor crossed his
straight gray eyes

   i-i- he began then stopped
abruptly  ill let dryker talk for
me

  dryker was the pig-iron kings
lawyer the father continued

   he will be here in five minutes
you will talk to him 

   certainly governor certainly
smiled the youth  anything you
say but i doubt governor whether
he knows any more about the tender
passion than you do and it will cost
a heap of money judge drykers fees
are about a hundred an hour in the
daytime arent they goodness
knows what they are at night 
confound the money havent i
offered you a hundred thousand twice
to stop this idiocy 

   no it was not the amount i ob-
jected to governor it was the use-
lessness of it

  a green-and-scarlet-liveried butler
appeared in the doorway

   mr dryker is here if you please
sir

  show him in

  hanton l dryker entered apolo-
getic capable suave composed he

 was the most successful lawyer in
 new york his mind being another of
 the perfectly disciplined type of the
 iron kings somewhat more finely
 machined perhaps as the latter
 marshaled forces to the utter elimi-
 nation of the usual human considera-
 tions so dryker marshaled ideas
 summoning the greatest number of
 them favorable or unfavorable as
 required upon any given subject in
 the least possible time and in the best
 possible language

   you know the situation dryker
 snapped the iron king briefly  this
 boy wants to marry an actress-that
 de aube woman i apologize for
 taking you from your christmas tree
 but he wants to marry her to-night

    in sixty-two minutes corrected
 the youth glancing at a bronze clock
 over the fireplace  the russian
 prince gets second choice if im not
 on deck at eleven its he and there
 is a string behind him

    she said she wouldnt marry any
 of us until the first run of the

 	dresden doll  was over and its
 over to-night i just nosed the rus-
 sian prince out she is a rare and
 clever little girl elise is but she
 doesnt have to wait a minute for any
 of us so proceed please mr dry-
 ker

   the great lawyer nodded cour-
  teously and taking a seat near the
 mahogany table-a seat so placed as
 to dexterously put him in a position
 prominent but unobtrusive-began to
 speak his voice even and regular
 having admirable adaptation to the oc-
 casion

   he touched quite apologetically
 upon the natural solicitude of a father
 of great wealth and national promi-
 nence upon his only sons marriage
  to a woman of semipublic character
 and mentioned in that connection
 quite offhand the unfortunate out-
 come of a dozen or more such mesal-
 liances of the last five years he went
 over the not openly impeachable yet
 very newspapery career of the young

lady in question giving it more in
detail and with much greater accuracy
than the young man himself knew
he terminated with a general review
of all of the evils to result from such
a marriage-balanced comprehensive
and at once inoffensively restrained
but bitingly direct

  at its conclusion both the father
and the son sat under its spell

   that was just what i wanted to
say when i broke the glass  declared
the iron king vehemently terminat-
ing the silence  cant you see the
idiocy-the utter folly of it all  

  yes i do the boys face bore
an enigmatical smile  yes but-
but is it all that you wanted to say
governor because i believe there was
more i know what the more is my-
self though i cannot say it and mr
dryker with all respect to him
couldnt say it-it is not in him but
it is in you and me that is it used
to be

   and thats at the heart of the
whole matter it is the taste for brown
bread and spring water we had that
taste but its been cloyed out it is
too late for it even to appeal to me
and yet i know it and i know you
know it i think there is just one
person who could tell it to me just
right

  he rose and walking very quietly
to the end of the long room stood in
front of an oval black-framed pic-
ture of a remarkably sweet-faced
woman

  if the dear mater was here she
could do you remember governor
the way she used to sit in the evening
after supper at the little organ we had
in the parlor while i stood just chin-
high to the keyboard and play that
old song of hers- annie lyle  it
was 

  the father winced a trifle

  annie lyle  brought to him mem-
ories of more than his wife his fid-
dling brother amos had played that
-played it into the favoritism of the
vife poor amos who with music
four string power



had wood her while the elder brother
with hard stubborn achievement had
also wooed and true to his record for
victory won

  but on evenings later when the
iron king in the bitter novitiate of his
great iron - control struggle would
come home to the cottage silent ab-
sorbed bitter and hard as the iron it-
self the lonesome little wife would
quietly seek the chapel organ in the
parlor after the silent supper and
play very softly  annie lyle and
see the moonlight on the creek and
amos with his violin and the other
boys and girls laughing

  then her craving for  the things
that dance  gratified she would rise
and smiling bravely and soothingly
minister to that strange powerful
husband of hers ease his mind of any
distraction to material things and
send him forth for the next days
fight nourished unhampered and fit

  fiddling amos had gone his vaga-
bond way scorning the increasingly
good positions offered from time to
time by his rising brother music he
loved and music only and the iron
king-they first called him that dur-
ing the years he spent in st louis be-
fore going to new york - thinking
music a worse than useless thing had
refused to give one cent toward
amoss advancement in it amos
was now in the orchestra of a moving-
picture theater out west

   yes the son was saying whim-
sically coming back and facing the
iron king again  mater could tell
and only mater 

  then his eyes took on again their
wearily gay disillusioned smile

   but she is not here and we have
to live and elise is for all her little
escapades too good for the russian
prince besides i tell you she makes
things dance it is twenty minutes
past ten i shall need fifteen minutes
to get to the theater

  he pressed a button twice

  the butler came bringing a fur-
lined overcoat and opera hat and a

walrus traveling-bag he assisted the
young man into them

   good-by mr dryker good-by
governor

  he held out his hand to the iron
king the massive lines of the
fathers face had begun to shrink and
mottle the basis of all his great im-
placable strength was oozing away
the machinelike mind which had
seemed so invulnerable and self-suffi-
cient had really been of a very sim-
ple type - the type which in fighting
for some one object becomes in its
repression of self terribly strong

  the boy his son had been that
object from the day of his birth in
the little missouri mining town
true the father had blundered almost
inconceivably imagining the boy
would somehow emerge a veteran
full fledged from the harvard gold
coast to step into his own hard-fisted
toil - won place he had raised a
highly trained business for the boy
but no highly trained boy for the
business he had forgotten too that
mothers also transmit traits

  the doorway of the room was huge
and heavy as everything else in the
mansion the boy reached it and
turned

   good-by governor he said very
softly

  in the silent moment after his words
a sound came from the street outside

  louder it sounded but still very
clear a violin played by some wan-
dering christmas waif some caroler
on strings

  clearly sweetly high the notes
crystallized into an air -  annie
lyle

   the three men stood in the huge
quiet room and listened the music
had to penetrate through a thick shell
to reach the heart of the iron king
it did not reach dryker at all but
to the mothers son it spoke the mes-
sage of the little parlor organ and of
the brown bread and spring water
the tension of his sensitive eyes gave
way in a sudden brimming of mois-

ture shamedly shrinking half an-

   its funny - its funny but that

yellow streak in me or im still only

  he set down the walrus traveling-
bag and viciously jammed a push-
button near the door

   a little scotch quick otaki  he

ordered the japanese second man who
appeared almost on the instant

  the bronze clock was pointing to
three minutes to eleven the young
man stepped back into the room smi-
