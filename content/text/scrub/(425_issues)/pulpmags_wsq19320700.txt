 pronounced this as one of the most promising
 stories we had seen from a new author and pre-

 we can remind you that when men from earth

rivals phil itself for size and you know we found
tilings there that philas doesnt have ill wager but i
say cant you come up to our rooms this evening for a
smoke i can tell you all about it then sort of get it
off my chest

  as may be guessed we accepted the invitation with
alacrity taking prof milroys arm in a paternal sort
of way hanavan led the way to the street door while
cummings and i went on into the lobby

  dr cummings and i were delighted with the opportunity
of getting acquainted with the pair lord hanavan was
internationally famous among archsologists for his work
in egypt and mesopotamia his paper on cretan hiero-
glyphics is universally regarded as the final word while
the collections of relics he has brought back from his num-
erous expeditions are unsurpassed

  prof milroy his colleague while of the second magni-
tude when compared to hanavan was a first-class anthro-
pologist himself numbering among his accomplishments a
splendid knowledge of dead languages including greek
egyptian sanskrit ancient persian and hittite as well as
most of the tongues and dialects of the orient in use today
his ability at learning foreign languages was uncanny
he seemed to grasp their complications by a kind of in-
stinct and nothing delighted him more than to study some
intricate native paiois inventing phonetic spelling and
classifying grammar as he went along

with the coming of evening and its attendant calling
of the muzieims from their slender mosque towers
dr cummings and  ascended to lord hanavans and
prof milroys rooms on the floor above it overlooked
across a narrow garden the native quarter of the city
one could in fact see into the windows of the nearer mud
brick buildings

  sitting down to our iced tea and cigars dr cummings
and i listened with rapt interest to lord hanavans story

  you see he began all my life i have had a desire
to explore the unusual the mysterious i suppose that
is why i am an archsologist in any case when i heard
peculiar native legends concerning a certain spot near
the river at phil i hastened there at once ordinary
excavating through sand is bad enough but water seepage
made our pit all but untenable in spite of the fact that
we had pumps working twenty-four hours a day and
then no sooner did we get started than the natives living
nearby became hostile they tried to set fire to timbers
in the shaft and one night we caught two devils with a
maul about to wreck the pump housing after that epi-
sode a good watch was kept either dr milroy or myself
sitting up nights in addition to a couple of native sentries

  at first the job was rather discouraging what with
river seepage and interference by man but as time went
on a number of very interesting things came to light after
having descended about nineteen feet we came upon a layer
of flat stones which turned out later to be the roof of a
building the entire structure was packcd full of fine silt
which probably helped preserve the contents by stopping
oxidation

  well after digging through about eight feet of this
we came upon a layer of rotten wood crisscrossed by
what had once been iron bands but were now only layers
of rust side digging disclosed that it was a big chest
inside mixed with the river mud we found remnants of
papyri rotted beyond all possibility of reading and u
quantity of square platinum coins stamped with strange
characters the oddest thing-they were milled around
the edges like a gold sovereign you may imagine how
excited we were by this time but as night was coming
we decided to wait the morrow before continuing just

before we climbed out for the day one of the diggers
stumbled against something under the foot of water and
mud which covered the floor picking it out we dis-
covered it to be a well-preserved baked clay tablet like
the egyptians used for writing completely covered with
fine hieroglyphics

  that night there was no sleep for anyone first we
went after the papyri but they were hopeless-the ink
had faded and the sheets of the roll were melted to-
gether into a solid cylinder the coins were better pre-
served-here    he dug in his pocket are some of
them he handed one to dr cummings and to me and
then continued

  the inscriptions upon them were quite unintelligible
even to dr milroy a thing which caused him much cha-
grin-eh sheridan he nudged his companion who
looked anything but pleased

  however the strangest thing about these coins is their
neat modern appearance most old coins are a sort of
rough oval with the very rudest of characters stamped
on their faces but these were exactly square and bore
a finely engraved design one side of which looked like a
bas-relief of the moon while the other side was covered
with very complicated characters unrelated to any known
inscriptions there is no sign of a picture writing in-
fluence for nowhere can we find even the remotest re-
semblance to natural objects you can see for yourself
how different these are from egyptian or phamician money
and then they are made of platinum-a metal hardly ever
used in the ancient world but enough for the coins
the clay tablet was easier in fact milroy translated at
sight so disgusted was he with the money later he made

a written translation	

  here lord hanavan interrupted his narrative again and
handed dr cummings a sheet of paper he read it aloud
isis speaks and the words of isis go as a thunderbolt
across the world though the power of the roman presses
sorely upon the neck of egypt and our former greatness
is as dust the gods of egypt are not gone-they live and
in battle they turn the lightnings upon the legions of their
enemies and slay

  for has it not been said by has-id the priest who
went with our oppressors to the end of the great river
and beyond until the hands of horus and ra stopped
them did he not return with the news that our gods
and the kas of our ancestors have returned to the earth
and that far to the south they do repulse the might of
rome and slay her armies even as the desert lion rends the
hyena who ventures too near

  and has has-id not returned from the south with a
great treasure of the white metal that is rarer even than
gold that the impoverished of egypt may have food
aye such is so and even now we the faithful remnant
of desecrated phi he prepare to go up the river to join
our gods beware  might of rome and beware

	ye who would venture to the promised land for the
temper of isis is short and her lightnings smite quickly

ywell exclaimed cummings as he finished this
 is interesting what else did you find
nothing replied lord hanavan we didnt go to
bed until after one and of course forgot all about setting
a guard next morning we found the pumps smashed and
the pit filled with water and half full of mud that had
slipped from the sides that was the last straw we
could not redig that shaft for weeks and as the rainy sea-
son was coming we simply had to give the job up for the
year

  well we swore about a bit and then started to pack
up when up the river shore came one of the natives he
was a particularly ugly old fellow named achmed who
beyond pluto



owned a little farm nearby and seemed rather well sup-
plied with money in contrast to the other poor wretches
after the usual courtesies this person asked us why we were
leaving i knew right away that he was responsible for
our damaged pumps but you know there was no evi-
dence so  controlled my desire for revenge and told
him that we had found everything we wanted-including
a moil important tablet

  i had expected this would disturb his smug content-
ment but by jove i never anticipated such a demon-
stration he simply went up in smoke and demanded to
ec the tablet on pain of some terrible doom but we
only laughed and told him he would land in jail if he
kepi that up at that he calmed down and said he would
bide his time but when we left we knew there was at least
one egyptian who did not bear us any love

  well we packed up and came down to cairo-that
was three days ago-and we arc resting on our oars as it
were until we can make further plans we are going to
visit the library here and see if we can locate any other
records bearing on that roman expedition they have
you know many papyri which escapcd the fire at the
alexandria library

  dr cummings fingered one of the coins you seem
to have run right into a real oriental mystery here i
wonder what there is up the river i suppose-

  at that instant his words were cut short by the crack
of a rifle and the splintering of the window pane lord
hanavan jumped to his feet and switched off the light
while prof milroy belying his pacific appearance drew
a wicked-looking automatic and leaped to the window
outside there was utter silence no light showed in any
of the windows across the court from whence the shot had
come apparently the noise had passed unnoticed

  there was a moment of silence in the room then
lord hanavan whispered achmed it must be   
to think he would go to such extremes

  as he said this dr cummings who was standing near
the door stepped quickly over to lord hanavan and
whispered to him

  some one breathing    outside the door    waiting
for you to come out   the other nodded thats
good he paused and added rotten way to treat you-
like this-when you are my guests but-

  i felt his smile through the darkness stepping over to
where cummings and  stood hanavan whispered his plan
to us

  i will wrap my coat about a pillow and push it out
the door then when whoever is there shows himself
we will both fire this to milroy who nodded silently

  then continued the archaeologist we will rush him
have cither of you a gun cummings and i shook our
heads

  hanavan went to a drawer coming back in a moment
he pressed something cold into my hand ancient nu-
bian dagger he whispered very efficient he gave
something similar to dr cummings

  a moment later he had folded his overcoat about the
pillow placed a hat upon the top and was slowly open-
ing the door

  the hall was faintly lighted from the window at one
end it seemed quite unoccupied when suddenly a bare
human arm with a wicked curved knife gripped in the
hand shot down and into the coat at the same instant
lord hanavans and dr milroys guns spoke together
we leaped into the hall halfway down toward the farther
end ran a man crouched low and holding one arm against
his body lord hanavan shouted at him stop or we
fire but the fugitive paid no attention then just as
he was at the fire-escape window prof milroy shot with

a cry of pain the man went down and lay kicking on the
floor we rushed to him where we found that beyond a
shattered wrist and a flesh wound in the calf he was un-
hurt

  as we bent over him there came a commotion from be-
hind the night clerk a native policeman and a number of
guests of the hotel surrounded us lord hanavan ex-
plained tersely what had happened the would-be assass-
in was taken to the room while an ambulance was sent for
here lord hanavan proceeded to question him

  at first the wretched native would only moan and cry
that he was dying but finally under hanavans insistent
quizzing he burst out-yes  will tell i will speak
truth as allah is my witness here i am dying for
that dog achmed who is not even a true believer he
was to pay me two pounds to stab whoever came from the
door first after he had shot one of you but he missed
and now i am to pay for it with my life allah ii al-
lah allah is the only god and mohammed is  

  the ambulance patrol sounded outside lord hanavan
shook the native why did achmed wish to kill us
because you have that tablet cried the man on the
bed i myself do not know what it means but it is price-
less to him he is    he paused and glanced about
sensing his thoughts hanavan said you are beyond his
ower now speak while you can

  writhing with the pain of his wounds and the fear of
the hereafter he replied

  he is the high priest he seeks to receive messages
from the old gods who walked the nile valley many
years ago-he is the priest of isis

  at this instant the policemen entered the room and
shortly afterward they carried the native out on a stretch-
er cursing the name of achmed and crying to allah for
mercy

chapter ii

up the river

t do not think any of us slept the rest of that night we
sat in hanavans room until near dawn consuming in-
numerable cigars and trying to figure out just what it was
nil about hanavan who was most experienced in orien-
tal ways of thinking was of the opinion that we had sim-
ply crossed with some obscure religious sect but the
peculiar tablets and the still more peculiar coins hinted
at something deeper

  finally after many hours of fruitless discussion dr
cummings and i returned downstairs to our own rooms
where we spent the rest of the night talking to each other
and thinking to ourselves

  about ten the next morning we received a note from
lord hanavan staling that he was going to the library
and wished our company rather glad to continue with
this mystery we sent word that we would be down at once
ten minutes later in a cab we were en route

  conversation languished until we had arrived at our
destination there was really nothing to say until we
had more definite information

  at the library lord hanavans name was sufficient to
gain us entrance to the innermost vault and as it turned
out it was just the place that we wanted to go the cura-
tor escorted us through the reading rooms then down into
the binding rooms in the basement past rows of dust-
laden mummy cases and unopened papyri and then down
again into the little-used sub-basement where the alex-
andrian papyri were stored it was a musty place fairly
exuding the odor of centuries the curator left his lamp

and returned to the upper floors we were alone with the
past

  prof milroy was in his element passing down the
long shelves of cylindrical papyrus cases he dusted off
and read the name on each at last he stopped with an
exclamation of pleasure and opened a crinkly roll it
was inscribed in latin which prof milroy read as easily
as english after a moment he replaced it in its recep-
tacle saying the expense account of one of the roman
satraps hunting parties in nubia    ah this looks in-
teresting report of the expedition under iulius marcus
to the land of punt 

   after reading several pages he replaced the roll noth-
ing here he scanned the next roll and similarly re-
placed it then his eyes lighted upon something of
interest unrolling the crackling paper he read silently
then his face lighted up

  this is it-as i live and breathe we have before us
the very thing holding it before the lamp he read

  after ascending to the headwaters of the river soaht
from the nile we entered into a country of many people
including egyptians who have fled from roman justice
living with them was a strange race believed to be im-
mortal but this was not so for we killed many in
battle but by the grace of an evil god who prevailed
against us in this far land we were driven back and at-
tacked by a wondrous sort of greek fire which shattered
all near it as a thunderbolt and so failing to receive
aid from the noble satrap we retired down the soaht
unto the nile and thence into egypt it is recommended
that a stronger force be sent to this land to conquer it for
they are rich in gold and jewels and the rare white metal
from the north 

  he paused this is the very thing mitchell we
have it this to lord hanavan soaht    soaht  
what river is that i wonder i seem to have heard of it
before   he folded up the roll his brows puckered
in thought then

  ah i have it it means the sobat river  a
tributary of the nile that enters well below the tenth de-
gree as far south as addis ababa if i am not mistaken
well mitchell here is our little mystery all solved a
camp of egyptians lied from roman justice ill wager
therell be something there for an archaiologist he
rubbed his hands together lord hanavan taking the roll
replaced it yes that explains everything he said ex-
cept the writing on the coins it is not egyptian

  we made our way up from the sub-basement in silence
as we passed through the relic-filled stack room prof
milroy stopped a moment to examine a particularly ghast-
ly mummy when lord hanavan seized his arm and pointed
down a long aisle where the shadows were darkest some-
thing    moved    there he whispered

  prof milroy drew his ever-present automatic leaving
the lamp on the table we slunk into the shadow and
waited after a moment there came down the dark aisle
between the book stacks a muffled shuffling sound for
an eternity it seemed that sound approached and pres-
ently  thought i detected a faint breathing i felt the
hair rising on my head and a weird tingling go up my
spine the others waited    breathless    dr cum-
mings was holding a white club-like object he had seized
from the table as he passed second by second the shuf-
fling came nearer it was evidently in the next aisle from
us stooping lord hanavan peered between the rows of
books on a shelf but evidently he saw nothing finally
the footsteps were opposite us then they stopped si-
lence tangible horrible set in the beating of my heart

seemed like a piledriver in the place not the faintest
echo came from the streets above i saw that lord hana-
van was edging toward the end of the case where he could
look down the next aisle dr cummings milroy and i
followed and now i observed with a sort of horrible
fascination that the geologist grasped a human thigh bone
in his hand

cinally hanavan reached the end of the bookcase
where he slowly extended himself around milroy
waited his fingers becoming white as he grasped the gun
then like lightning hanavan swung his own gun up and
shouted throw up your hands-i have you covered
i commenced to run toward him when from the next aisle
there came a clatter of falling objects and a voice

  colt im himmel was ist das dont shood mit
dot id might go off

  hanavan lowered his gun in amazement and the next
instant a stout bespectacled gentleman in swallowtail coat
and bowler hat appeared

  he at once produced a vast white handkerchief with
which he mopjied his forehead copiously vot kind uf
blace is dis veil beeple come around like highwaymans
mit guns

  the reaction after those few tense moments was great
milroy cummings and i leaned against the shelf while
hanavan interrogated the newcomer

  sorry old man really but we were attacked by an
assassin only last night so of course hearing steps in
what we thought a deserted cellar  

  ach veil den ids all right bud mein goll you did
giff me un scare i thoud sure dot i vas going to be
killed he hesitated my name is professor ludwig
pfeiffler university of heidelberg und whom have i
the pleasure uf meeting

  lord hanavan introduced us all and then suggested
that we ascend to the street while doing this prof pfeif-
fler explained his presence in the library

  in the university said he i hold der chair uf
biology und physiology dis trib is mein first vaca-
tion in five years i travel through france italy tur-
key palestine und i haf been spending the last few days
here in cairo before i return home in der library i
am collecting literature on ancient locust blagues effen
ven i am on a vacation der university oxbects me to do
some vork und i haff not die heart to disabboint id
veil gendlemens if i do not seem too curious may i ask
aboud yourselves und esbecially aboud dot assassin
of last night

  by this time we had passed out of the library where
hanavan after finding that prof pfeiffler had no en-
gagement suggested that we all return to the hotel for
lunch in the cab he explained all that we knew con-
cerning the mysterious coins and tablet achmeds hos-
tility and the papyrus that we had recently found in the
library

  veil said prof pfeiffler when hanavan had fin-
ished dot is inderesding i must say i subbose you
are going to go op de rifer und dry und locade dis
blace my i vish somding like dot vould liabbcn to
me so i could haff a goot reason for extending mein vaca-
tion all mein life i vant to haff at leasd one goot ad-
venture but so far de most exciding thing i haff done is
shoot at katz in de night

  for some time we rode in silence i noticed that lord
hanavan was looking at prof pfeiffler as though sizing
him up however he said nothing at the time and in a
few moments we arrived at our destination here lord
beyond pluto



hanavans first act was to bring from his room a large
map of africa while we were awaiting our lunch he
traced the path of the ancient roman expedition up the
river until he came to the end of the known the place
where the map was a blank with a single doited line run-
nre across-the surmised course of the upper sobat
h- he paused his finger resting on the blank a space
roughly four hundred miles through dense forests to the
rolling plains a place untraveled avoided by explorers
and shunned by the natives

  it seems odd mused hanavan that the egyptians
should have gone there when no one else did  

  at this moment the luncheon arrived and for a time con-
versation ceased afterwards over the ever-present iced
tea and cigars we talked prof pfeiffler listened in-
deed for some reason we already regarded him as one
of us lord hanavan was speaking

  you know he began this idea of a lost city in the
jungles rather intrigues me it has so many possibilities
i have always wanted to find such a thing now there
seems a chance and a good one of making a really val-
uable archxological discovery and at the same time hav-
ing a little adventure of our own i am in favor of going
up the nile on to the headwaters of the sobat and then
finding out just what is up there milroy and i can be
the archseologists dr cummings and mr lawrence will
attend to the geology of the region and    he hesitated
prof pfeiffler if you can we will be glad to include an
expert biologist to note the flora and fauna what do i
hear gentlemen is it agreed

  the answering chorus was enough once our minds
were made up there was no back-tracking our conver-
sation turned immediately to planning what had but a
few moments before been a group of chance acquain-
tances was now a united party all working toward the
common goal thus strangely does the mind of man rush
him into bargains whose results he cannot hope to foresee

  well it was done for better or for worse we must
see it through

ne who has never had a hand in planning an expedi-
tion of exploration cannot conceive of the amount of
thought necessary to get even a modest party like ours
under way in the first place its drain upon the ex-
chequer was tremendous money seemed to melt into noth-
ing at every meeting yet we knew that compared to some
exploring parties we were very economical to begin
with it was necessary to buy an almost complete new out-
fit for the equipment lord hanavan had used at philse
was too heavy to carry on a long trek then we had to
have food arms and ammunition clothing a portable
radio sender and receiver and a thousand other accessor-
ies small in themselves but still mounting in the aggre-
gate to many hundreds of pounds

  lord hanavan however met the financial situation
with the same sang froid with which he faced other dan-
gers and so near the end of the rainy season when the
muddy flood of the nile was beginning to subside we were
ready to start

  passage for five persons and three tons of equipment
was secured on the steamer hanavan telegraphed assuan
the end of the steamer schedule for a smaller boat to be
chartered then we were off

  the voyage up the nile remains in my memory as a
period of peace and tranquillity between the bustle of
preparation and the work and worry of the long trip on
the white nile egypt dropped behind us league by
league the broad fertile belt near the nile delta nar-

rowed into two parallel strips of irrigated farms squeezed
between the river and the bleak desert hills on either
side bluffs of red or gray rock arose parched and hot in
the day and silvery and mysterious at night we sat out
upon the deck for hours each evening watching the moon
rise and tlie land slip astern like a procession of ghosts
wrapped in a dim mantle of mist

  al last the journey ended the river was cut off from
farther navigation by the long low bulk of the assuan
dam here we must push forward on our own

  the boat for which lord hanavan had telegraphed
awaited us at the quay above the dam it was a native
craft some twenty-eight feet in length powered with sails
and a somewhat erratic gas engine and manned by five
muscular and sullen arabs

  our luggage was immediately transferred to the boat
from the steamer and then we disembarked lord hana-
van had some business of his own to attend to-getting
letters of introduction to the resident governor at khar-
toum in the sudan so the four of us after seeing our bag-
gage safely stowed away proceeded to see the sights

   assuan is not a particularly interesting place it is too
far up the river to receive any great bulk of tourist traf-
fic so here was revealed the squalor of the orient rathe
than its showy side the bazaars were filled with un-
savory-looking food and crude clothing and brassware
instead of the finely-wrought trinkets on display in cairo
mingling with the egyptians and arabs were many black
men-from ethiopia and the tropic jungles far south
it was as though the first cataract of the nile marked the
boundary between civilization and savagery here our
real voyage was to begin

  that night we all slept on the boat that being the only
sure way of knowing that our baggage would not disap-
pear ali the captain and his four odorous compan-
ions said their prayers and huddled together in the bow
we made ourselves as comfortable as possible in the tiny
cabin aft

  next morning we arose before sunrise while the mists
were still upon the river and the night-time chill kept the
boatmen in huddled torpidity under their blankets prod-
ding them into consciousness we all ate a little breakfast
and then starting the engine with two arabs rowing and
ali at the stern sweep we pushed off

  the voyage up the nile to khartoum was long and un-
interesting there were five rapids to portage over a task
which necessitated the complete unloading of the equip-
ment each time there were stretches where the current
was so swift that the four arabs had to go ashore with the
rope and haul the craft but ali the captain knew the
river so at last the low mud buildings of khartoum
appeared

  here ali was paid off and his boat went shooting down
stream to accomplish the return journey in a fifth of the
time taken to ascend

  once ashore lord hanavan and prof milroy went to
the governors residence with their letter while cummings
pfeiffler and i remained with the baggage the water-
front of khartoum was as different from that of assuan
as that city was from cairo here the arabs were in the
minority their place being taken by negroes from the
lands to the south the substantial mud houses of lower
egypt were partly replaced by the characteristic rush-
dwellings of the equatorial regions at khartoum the
nile forked its two great tributaries the bahr-el-azrak
or blue nile turning east while the bahr-el-abiad the
white nile continued southwest it was on this latter
stream that our course lay

into the unknown

we had been waiting at the quay for perhaps half an
   hour when prof pfeiffler spoke to me

  look over there behind dose barrels vol an awful
oxbrcssion

  i peered where he indicated just in time to see a dark
egyptian face twisted into an expression of mingled horror
and rage vanish behind a heap of goods dr cummings
who had seen the apparition too smiled

  he doesnt appear to bear us any love does he i
wonder who he is

  at this instant lord hanavan and prof milroy returned
accompanicd by a man whom they introduced as the gov-
ernor himself

  the governor of khartoum lias left the most pleasant
impression in my memory he was so tanned from
residence in the tropics that were it not for his clothing
one might mistake him for an arab instead of an eng-
lishman he was much interested in our expedition and
contributed some information about our objective

  when you speak of it i do seem to recall something
about a lost colony of egyptians a sort ol legend
passed around among the blacks here they talk of a
country of enchantment and evil spirits in the south
they placed it rather definitely in the region northwest
of lake rudolph a place by the way quite unexplored
and from what i hear a wild mountainous waste where
even the savages cannot exist

  you know i have heard some of the oddest yarns
about the district when an army plane came up from
assuau some time ago a lot of the blacks came running
to me crying that one of the evil spirits from the south
was after them they speak about moving stars on
cloudy nights and of parties of hunters that ventured
over the cliffs that surround the place and never returned
lord hanavan seemed impressed i wonder he
asked why no while men have gone to find just what
base these rumors have

  oh there have been expeditions like that replied
the governor his face clouding two both came
through khartoum the first was in the summer of 
a surveying party of eight-they never came back in
 a search party was sent out they carried a wireless
set and we received from them for several weeks then
then messages stopped-we have never heard another
word of ihcm in  ihc excitement of the war pre-
vented another search party and after that everyone seems
to have just forgotten

  this was rather ominous news but after our weeks of
anticipation all it did was to send a thrill of excitement
through us lord hanavan assured the governor that
our radio would send messages each night and if we were
overtaken by some unknown danger the outside world
would at least know what to prepare for

  final preparations consisted in procuring three long
native canoes each with four rowers the governors as-
sistance greatly facilitated matters here with the result
that two days later we were being propelled swiftly up-
stream by twelve muscular and taciturn ethiopians

  as we continued south the rocky barren bluffs of the
river gave way to trcc-cuvcred hills while far to the smith-
east the bluish mountains of ethiopia appeared dr cum-
mings mentioned the face we had seen at khartoum to lord
hanavan the latter seemed rather perturbed and or-
dered that two of our rowers should stand guard every
night wc proceeded onward thus for some days when
one evening one of the negroes anchoring a canoe some

distance downstream to fish discerned about eight miles
below and around a point of land a campfire he said
it lasted only about twenty minutes as though whoever
was camping did not wish to be conspicuous longer than
necessary to cook a meal as the lire was on the same
side of the river that we were lord hanavan ordered an
immediate transfer to the other bank next morning be-
fore proceeding on we returned to our former encamp-
ment and found it was well that we had moved the
soft mud was covered with the tracks of sandaled feet

  that night we stayed on an island and prof milroy
a rifle on his knee sat all night on a mass of brush jutting
into the stream however he saw nothing but crocodiles

  four days later we tied up at the little station of ko-
dok sixty miles farther was the mouth of the sobat
river

  three days after leaving kodok our sturdy oarsmen
turned the prows of the three ranoes into the current of
the sobat river now indeed we were entering die un-
known white men had been up and down this stream
but upon either bank the jungle was haunted only by
savage beasts and tile no less savage blacks we camped
on islands whenever we could and at other times at the
extremity of a bar where the boatmen drove herds of
crocodiles away to make room for us our pursuers did not
show themselves and after one of the canoes had drifted
some seven miles down stream with lord hanavan watch-
ing the shore through his night glasses we decided that
they had given up the chase

txtr ing the days wo sal under improvised awnings
 rilles across our knee watching the dark jungle slip
by occasionally we glimpsed forms regarding us from
the trees gorillas said lord hanavan

  one hundred and twenty miles up the sobat was the
village of nasser where swarming dogs gave us a magni-
ficent ovation from the moment we hove in sight there
were no white men in the town but we were told that at
akobo post forty miles up the pibor river a tributary
of the sobat we might find one

  at first there was some argument about deserting the
sobat finally one of the old natives said he remem-
bered that several white men had journeyed up the sobat
many moons ago and that they had turned at the pibor
that decided us two days iater we arrived at akobo
post

  the lone englishman who resided there remembered the
two expeditions distinctly their radio was the first he
had seen and he had arranged to keep their heavier equip-
ment until they returned he had it yet the english-
men he told us had turned off the pibor river into a
small unnamed stream which led due south for an un-
known distance

  asked about the peculiar moving stars by lord hana-
van the man replied that though he had never seen such
he had heard many tales from the natives some he said
swore that they had seen the moonlight reflected from
something shiny in the air like a big fish

  well we rested at akobo four days-the guests of the
englishman our canoes were given a thorough going-
over and the rowers feasted heavily then early in the
morning we started out

  the stream into which the canoes turned was so narrow
that the towering trees touched together overhead making
a sort of green tunnel the banks were in places less
than thirty feet apart while through the coffee-colored
water wc could see crocodiles and many strange and fero-
cious-appearing fish

  on the first night after leaving akobo prof pfeiffler
commenced to function as a biologist we had stopped
beyond pluto



early so that gentleman fashioning himself a net of mos-
quito netting went down a jungle trail in search of insect
life he had not been gone ten minutes when we were
startled on hearing his voice calling lustily for help
seizin rifles we all rushed down the trail fully expecting
to find our poor friends mangled remains in the clutches
of a lion however when we at last came in sight of
h what should we see but the professor rolling about
ii the grass his arms fast around a tiny furry brown
r-ature which had torn his coat to ribbons in its efforts
 escape wc pounced upon the animal and tied it while
prof ffei flier was recovering his feet and breath

  what is it we asked

  vrsidae-a dwarf bear-a most rare specimen

  two days later the stream became so shallow that the
rowers had to spend half iheir time overboard the cur-
rent had increased considerably and the more open char-
acter of the forests warned us that we were nearing the
mountains finally around a bend we herd the roar of
water and a few moments later we found the way blocked
by a beautiful cascade

  at a word from lord hanavan the boats were drawn
to shore and we all disembarked hanavan cummings
and two natives climbed at once to the top of the cliffs
over which the stream poured after a half hour they re-
turned with thenews that beyond the land sloped upwards
through open woods and grassy glades and that the river
became a mere babbling brook we had reached the
limit of water travel that night we completely unloaded
the canoes and pitched the tent inside a boma of thorn-
bushes we cooked and ate our supper in silence and
were about to retire when the leader of the blacks appeared
from the place where they had been sitting saluting he
spoke to lord hanavan

  we indicating the group around the fire behind him
want to know what you going to do our women are
waiting for us in khartoum

  hanavan sensing that there might be some difficulty
replied

  we are going on south but we do not ask you to go
if you dont wish to you can camp here with our sup-
plies and the canoes while we go

  we will go for five days march and then come back
you wait here fifteen days and then if we do not return
go back and tell the governor at khartoum to send aid
understand

  the native nodded and bowed again as he turned to
leave us there suddenly resounded a cry of fright from
the other fire one of the rowers was pointing upward
through a rift in the trees and crying in his tongue fly-
ing devil flying devil

  springing to our feet we rushed to where we could see
and there in the sky above we clearly saw a speck of
light like a brilliant star moving swiftly and silently
across the heavens

  lord hanavan at once seized his glasses and peered
at the strange object until it was out of sight but he
discovered nothing dr cummings suggested it might
be a meteor but it left no luminous trail and it was
going upwards

the visitation left the blacks in a pitiable state and
it was with great difficulty that hanavan persuaded
them to promise to stay the fifteen days a little later
we set the radio up and around ten pm got in touch with
khartoum lord hanavan sent a message for the gov-
ernor telling our location the character of the land ahead
and of the strange sight we had just witnessed we con-
versed in code with the operator at khartoum for some

time and promised to send another message as soon as
we returned-ten days hence

  then accompanied by the roars and howls of the my-
riad forms of jungle life about us we made our beds

  the first glimmering of dawn found the five of us up
and packing wc could carry only the most ncccssary
tilings-rilles ammunition blankets food and cooking
utensils compass and field glasses a first aid kit and a
sept camera made up our total equipment ours was to
be a survey trip a dash over the mountains and back to
determine further action at about seven am we tramped
away rifles slung on our backs leaving the boatmen eat-
ing their breakfast of fish and monkey meat over a smud-
gy fire

  duiing the course of the day we ascendcd ateacjily
through a park-like forest of majestic trees twice we
sighted small deer a sure sign that we had left the
swampy jungle definitely behind the air became cooler
and in the little open prairies we felt breezes in the
evening we camped at the foot of a gigantic tree in whose
hollow bole we all huddled lord hanavana barometer
indicated  feet elevation

  about noon the next day the forest suddenly ended and
wc found ourselves on the edge of a narrow rocky plain
whose other side was bounded by a towering rampart of
rock east and west as far as the eye could reach this
imposing cliff extended trees occasionally waving over
its top and little cascades spurting out from its surface
at intervals not a rift not a crevice could be seen dr
cummings the geologist expressed his amazement at such
a formation it is either a remarkable fault or an im-
mense sill cried he wait a minute while i photograph
it

  whatever the cliff was geologically it nevertheless pre-
sented to us an impassable barrier unless we could find
a way of scaling it the lands to the south would have to
remain unexplored as we had some three and a half
days left of our five lord hanavan suggested that we
search along its base for a break prof milroy flipped
a coin to decide the way and then we all turned and
marched due west

  all during that day the precipice presented no break
its base was piled high with great chunks of rock broken
off from the top while the bleached skeletons of animals
attested the presence of life above lord hanavan esti-
mated that nowhere was the cfiff lower than  feet while
in many places the crest was a good  feet above us

  as the fourth day drew to a close we had about decided
that our quest was hopeless when prof pfeiffler with the
glasses disccrncd a dark streak running up the facade of
the rampart

  we hurried on half expecting to find only an outcrop-
ping of dark rock but arriving abreast of it we found a
crevasse scarccly four feet wide extending up and back
through the solid rock for an unknown distance it sloped
at an angle of some sixty degrees and led right to the sum-
mit boulders wedged here and there would make easy
the task of climbing at last after weeks of delay for-
tune favored us that night camp was made at the foot
of the crack up which a draft of cold air continually
poured and at daybreak on the fifth day we began the
ascent

  climbing proved much more arduous than we had
thought for the rock a smooth basalt made necessary
the use of ropes at times we stopped near noon atop
a giant boulder wedged between the walls and ate some
lunch prof pfeiffler at that time discovered a small
orange-colored snake in a crevasse and almost slid down
the shaft in an endeavor to catch it

  at one pm we siarted again and at four exhausted
wonder stories quarterly



by the labor we hauled each other out on the top of the
cliff

  from our position over a thousand feet above the for-
est a wonderful view could be had of the trail north-
ward through the evening mists one could make out
the silvery ribbon of the sobat river-more than sixty
miles away-winding out of sight we could see no

sign of the boatmens camp because of the haze and dense
foliage

  after a few moments rest at the top of the chimney
the five of us turned our faces south again and started on
upwards in the three and a half hours of day that re-
mained we ascended more than three thousand feet at
last near sunset the slope leveled oft and pressing on
through the last ranks of trees we came upon the top

    we were upon the balcony peering off into space we were overlooking an enorm-
ous amphitheater miles long and wide
beyond

of the ridge there we stopped in sheer amazement at
the wonder of what was spread before us

  directly beneath our feet the mountain descended pos-
sibly a thousand feet to a wide plain covered with mist
aad on the other side of this-some forty-five miles from
here we were-there reared up the most impressive
mdtain i have ever seen a wide base of blue forest-
eorered foothills pyramided themselves upward through
hanks of clouds made scarlet by the sun until the whole
buss culminated in a single summit shimmering white
in the sunset arising majestically to a perfect cone in the
still air after our hot struggles during the day and the
weeks of viewing only hemmed-in jungle flats the sheer
beauty of the peak held us spellbound dr cummings
camera lay unnoticed in its case and even prof pfeiffler
was silent then even as we watched the vast clouds
massed themselves together and in a whirl of colored
vapors covered the mountain from our sight leaving only
a towering cumulus cloud

  for some minutes we said nothing then we all dis-
tinctly saw a strange thing at the very foot of the moun-
tain in the midst of the evening mists there suddenly ap-
peared a number of brilliant specks of light like sunlight
reflected from windows they shone for a moment and
then one by one vanished

  five minutes later the suns enlarged disk disappeared
behind the westefn hills and the tropic night set in with-
out warning blotting all from view

chapter iv
prisoner

tn spite of the fact that we were going over our time
limit lord hanavan determined to push on to the base
of the mountain in the first dim rays of dawn when the
valley was still covered by a thin blanket of fog we ate
our cold breakfast and started down the mountain within
a half hour we found a dry creek bed whose bare rocks
presented a much better road than the tangled thickets on
either side once off the mountain summit the more dis-
tant view became invisible indeed we caught no glimpse
of the great peak until we were well into the valley

  for some hours we proceeded down the little canyon
without seeming to near the valley then utterly without
wamiug we came upon the amazing the unbelievable
the trees that had hemmed in the gulch suddenly ended
and a cleared space perhaps a hundred yards wide cut
across the creek but it was not this break in the trees
not even the fact that they were cleanly sawed that we
noticed it was what was evidently a steel railroad tres-
tle spanning the canyon

    think we all stopped dead for an instant at the sight
then lord hanavan ran forward to the nearer pier we
following the column of steel rested upon a massive
block of concrete beams and braces radiated from it
their joints welded together the column was triangular
and apparently hollow for it resounded when struck

  lord hanavan was the first to recover his voice a
bridge of this sort-here it can mean only one thing-
white men-civilization a railroad   

  prof pfeiffler interrupted pointing upwards look
there iss only one rail

  dr cummings pounded on the column look at its
construction those beams would require a foundry to
make and the welds  i never heard of such a thing
those lights cried prof milroy suddenly ttiose
moving lights    what connection have they an air-
ship

  but at this instant our conversation wa cut short by

pluto	

a metallic rumble from above turning in common ap-
prehension we raced for the shelter of the trees and then
waited in a moment it came the car that ran on the
strange track a long low steel structure with a pointed
prow and many round windows underneath were two
metal shoes upon which it slid a cog wheel between
the runners revolved rapidly carrying the machine for-
ward i caught a glimpse of two men in the front
through the windows and then it was gone

  for fully five minutes we remained under the trees too
stunned to say a word

  what kind of a country is this gasped prof mil-
roy a train  on runners    airships    such a
mountain    are we dreaming

  lord hanavan cut him short we are not dream-
ing this unknown mountain is easily explained by its
perpetual covering of clouds    the airships are only
hypothetical the train    well lets go on and see
what it means

  after listening for the possible return of the car we
scurried across the clearing like scared rabbits and start-
ed down the creek bed

  we had proceeded perhaps three miles when wonder
number two presented itself to our eyes it was in the
form of a huge mass of twisted rusty metal overgrown
by creepers and evidently very old roughly it resem-
bled the car we had just seen for in some of the side
plates there were round windows but there was no
track or bridge near and closer observation showed that
it had no sliders underneath or indeed any sign of trac-
tion device prof milroy said he thought it had fallen
from the skies as the trees above showed old scars the
top of the car was neatly cut open as with an acetylene
torch and evidently much had been taken out from inside
but where it had been carried or how there was not a
sign up- and downstream huge rocks made even foot
travel difficult while the steep brush-tangled canyon
walls were quite impassable

  we did not tarry long at this mysterious wreck but
hurried down towards the valley which somehow we all
felt held the key to the whole thing

  i dont suppose the dry creek bed was more than ten
or twelve miles in length at the most but to us it seemed
endless we proceeded with great caution-a needless
thing as the dense woods were screen enough but our
imaginations were running wide open by this time and
every tree was a potential abode for some monster

  about noon the ridges on either side dropped away
and the rocky stream lost itself in an open forest of semi-
tropical trees we made our way through this more care-
fully for perhaps an hour and a half when the forest
abruptly ended beyond lay broad cultivated fields
roads buildings the monorail track while southward the
towering white buildings of a city shone in the sun we
all stopped but somehow we were not very surprised
the steel trestle had prepared us for such a sight

  lord hanavan looked long with his binoculars and
then passed them to the rest of us we each had a look
the city through the lenses could be seen quite plainly-
a dark mass of residences measuring a good fifteen miles
wide lay in the foreground while beyond arose a series of
flat-roofed structures some with tall spires which appeared
to be of immense height a slight haze hung over the
buildings and the faint echo of human life reached us

a fter some moments we brought our attention to the
    present again lord hanavan was speaking

  by jove he exclaimed but wont the people back
home at the academy be surprised when they find a place
like this in british territory a forgotten colony of exiled


wonder stories quarterly

egyptians building up a city in the wilderness unknown
to anyone and  suppose forgetting that there is an out-
side world what a story milroy old boy you will
have to brush up on your latin and greek if we are to
talk to them what a tale we will have to tell when we
go back

  prof milroy interrupted him if we go back what
became of those other expeditions that came down here
years ago and never returned these people may not
be so willing to be discovered

  after some consultation we decided to remain within
the forest until nightfall and then make a rush for what
appeared to be an orchard some ten miles closer to he
city during the rest of the day we cleaned our rifles
prof milroy wrote in his diary and cummings with the
camera climbed to the top of a tree and took several
pictures

   after the seemingly endless afternoon was at last over
and the sunset colors were fading from the snowy pin-
nacle beyond the city we shouldered our equipment and
started across the fields a half mile out was a flat-roofed
house which we avoided whatever crop was grown in
the fields had not yet sprouted so we soon found our-
selves absolutely without shelter the roads one of which
we crossed were of some kind of bluish concrete with
gutters at either side and not the slightest trace of the
roadside weeds so common in europe and america
everywhere we saw signs of the most intense cultivation
whatever kind of people lived here were evidently cul-
tured about one am we reached the copse which was
our destination the moon was dark and the presence
of occasional clouds made the terrain almost invisible
the city shone with a blaze of light which could mean
only one thing-electricity far to the southwest low-
hanging clouds glowed as though another city lay in that
direction

  our excitement which had been growing all the time
was now near a bursting point as  pressed close to
dr cummings for a moment i felt him shivering and
doubtless  was in the same nervous state lord hana-
van was more calm after examining the trees for a mo-
ment he said we are in some kind of an orchard

   grapefruit furnished prof pfeiffler a leaf in his
hand a grapefruit grove which is evidently part of a
farm if ve are here ven daylight comes some one will
be sure to discofer us den    remember the expedition
uf  de only vay iss i tink to go to de nearest
house und either secrede ourselves vere ve can see und
overhear de inhabitants or seize a building und moke ids
beobles prisoners

   hanavan nodded and added action in any case is im-
perative

  prof milroy stared about through the glasses i
think we might try that building he pointed

   picking up our rifles and packs the five of us left the
grovo and proceeded at a brisk walk toward the city
none spoke we crossed another smoothly-surfaced road
and then the outlines of the house loomed before us it
was low and flat-roofed and with what appeared to be an
oval dome of glass in the center the windows small
and high up on the wall were all dark

   with infinite caution we approached the wall stepping
over the ornamental shrubbery in the front and treading
softly on the cement-like walk which led to the door the
modern appearance of everything struck me oddly some-
how wp	more likpt five hnrglars on n iswn in the
united states than a party of explorers stalking the dwell-
ing of a bloodthirsty savage in africa

  but now lord hanavan was at the door a solid panel
of blue color without knob or keyhole hanavans hands
slipped over it an instant and then discovered a small
countersunk ring he tugged but the door held quit-
ting the porch we essayed a window climbing upon
hanavans back prof milroy poked and pulled then he
signaled to be lowered no good absolutely burglar-
proof let us try the back we turned past the front
door toward the rear of the house when without warning
the panel swung open and a blaze of light fell upon us

  a tall man wearing a blue tunic-like garment stepped off
the porch peering at us he carried a curious little
metal instrument in his right hand walking toward
him hand on holster milroy spoke in latin

  we are weary travelers from a far land seeking the
hospitality  

  the man appeared suddenly galvanized he raised
the metal device toward us and poured out a torrent of
words in some strange language lord hanavan ap-
proached him but the man moved his hand toward him
and spoke one or two words in a threatening tone hana-
van stopped he has some kind of a weapon gun
maybe he paused cummings see if you can get
behind him and grab his arm   

  prof milroy now stepped into the circle of radiance
beside lord hanavan and began to address the man in
the blue robe in egyptian at the same time dr cum-
mings began to fade out into the shadows pfeiffler and
i stood motionless at a loss as to what to do several
tense moments passed while milroy ran on with his con-
versation the other appeared nervous and impatient
his attention wandered and twice he started to speak only
to be cut short by milroy then out of the corner of
my eye i detected dr cummings gliding among the
shrubs behind the man step by step he advunced with
a sort of fascination i noted him gather himself together
and then silently rush forward one hand seized the
mans right arm jerking it downward while the other
closed about his throat stifling any outcry in a second
they were rolling about the lawn and then cummingg
opponent went limp the geologist regained his feet
hurt demanded lord hanavan

  no hasnt any strength at all he just caved in

suddenly we became conscious of an imminent danger
from the light dragging the senseless man after us
we entered the house hanavan closing the door there
seemed to be no switch to extinguish the floodlights out-
side

  the interior was dimly lit with a blue-green radiance
which seemed to emanate from the upper building han-
avan and milroy carrying their burden we entered a large
room-the one under the glass dome it was plainly fur-
nished the space under the high windows being filled with
built-in bcnchcs desks and shelves the floor was of a
soft yielding substance like a thick sheet of rubber and
of a dark blue color

  but we had no time to examine details no sooner had
we entered than our prisoner recovered consciousness we
expected a struggle but the man in the blue robe made
none prof milroy covering him with an automatic he
was suffered to arise then lord hanavan again ad-
dressed him in latin the man replied apparently in-
telligently to hanavuii aflerwaid ilanavan told us what
the conversation was about he asked the man if he was
an egyptian

  no   zongainian

  how many people live here
beyond pluto

 many you arc from europe

  yes

  hanavan tried to conceal his amazement we have
come to deliver an important message to your king

  at this the one in the blue robe laughed and then ap-
parently overcome by a dizziness caused by hanavans
attack staggered barely catching himself upon the wall
he remained there for a moment leaning upon one of
the panels and then walked toward us addressing him-
self to lord hanavan he spoke in a clear loud voice
people from europe explorers from the outer world
who have made me a prisoner listen to ver vilot it
has been many years since any of your race has pene-
trated through the jungles over the great barrier cliffs
to zongainia they who enter zongainia cannot leave
for if they did the whole outer world would enter our
happy land the curious the dishonest the diseased-
and soon our cities would be desolate our culture de-
stroyed and our beautiful country as wretched as europe
itself

  for twenty long centuries we have lived isolated
and happy protected by the barriers of nature and our
own vigilance once we did have commerce with your
people and persians egyptians and phoenicians rubbed
shoulders in our cities but they brought vice and cor-
ruption and el zoia forbade their coming any more so
the highways to the sea were closed a river was diverted
to turn the only route to zongainia into a swamp and the
men of the outer world remembered it only as a legend
called i think in europe-ophir

  he paused and appeared to listen then he broke
out afresh in a very loud voice men of the outer
world you have penetrated beyond the forbidden bar-
riers you have passed the point where you may re-
turn you have made me prisoner again he hesi-
tated but soon it will be different and you will be 
he stopped and at that instant the door burst open
and a dozen men attired in short robes and carrying the
little metal weapons rushed into the room we grabbed
at our guns but there was no chance in a moment
they had surrounded us and with a surprising thorough-
ness stripped us of guns and knives

  the man who had but a moment before been in our
power addressed a few words to the leader of the new-
comers who nodded in answer we looked to prof
milroy but he only shook his head then the one called
ver vilot walked to the door while our captors indicated
that we should do likewise outside were perhaps a
score more men standing in front of a large boat-like
metallic structure which had not been there before sounds
of conversation stopped as we appeared they crowded
forward to view us near the door we paused for a mo-
ment while blue robe and the leader of the new party
conversed a moment when lord hanavan called ver
vilot that person instantly turned toward him

  what arc they going to do with us

  you are going  to andorks

  then   

  you will find out he turned away one thing
more how did you summon these people the other
paused and then stumbling on the unusual use of the an-
cient latin tongue said the long-distance talk-by-light-
ning on the wall i turned it on when i seemed to be
taint

  the next instant our captor shoved us toward the metal
car where a doorway gaped ver vilot disappeared
among the other figures and then with a sickening rush
the cylinder shot up into the night sky and the earth
dropped out of sight below



            chapter v
            at andorks

the disappearance of the earth as our captors strange
airship arose into the midnight sky marked a divid-
ing point in our adventures heretofore we had made
our way forward against natural obstacles progressing
through our own efforts but now we were in the hands
of fate as it were and our actions were almost alto-
gether directed by others but i digress

  for perhaps fifteen minutes the airship-i continue to
call it that although subsequent experiences showed it
to be-utterly different from what we ordinarily consider
such-shot dizzily through the sky at a high velo-
city our captors who numbered about twenty spoke
no word to us they sat in seats around the sides of the
cabin and talked among themselves we stood or rath-
er huddled in one corner not even daring to look out
the portholes the cabin was quite dark save for a dim
glow over what were evidently navigating instruments

  after a quarter of an hour or thereabouts the ship be-
gan to drop earthward like a plummet there was no
gliding about it our bodies literally arose from the
floor as the car fell from under us  seized prof pfeif-
fler desperately and then the machine came to a stop
tumbling in a heap on the floor we lay for some mo-
ments afraid to move lest we find all our limbs shat-
tered however the zongainians did not seem incon-
venienced for they arose and helping my companions
and myself to our feet quite kindly filed out of the now
open door we followed

  the airship rested upon a series of metal rods and
rollers on what appeared to be a large paved field a
pair of floodlights at some distance threw everything into
sharp relief making long grotesque shadows a pul-
sating rumble like a vast buried machine was faintly
audible

  still surrounded by the zongainians we were marched
across the illuminated area under the lights and along
one side of a wall from the other side of this came an
odd confusion of sounds thumpings musical gong-like
tones and a prolonged hissin not unlike the noise made
by certain kinds of automobile tires on a wet pavement

 suddenly we came to a stairs feeling clumsily in the
dark we ascended to the top of the wall involuntarily
i looked over and then recoiled we were on the roof
of a gigantic building of which the wall was but the
cornice down down the eye dropped into a canyon-
like street whose bottom was lost in a maze of moving
lights and a confusion of strange shapes on the other
side loomed the facade of another building its thou-
sands of windows glowing with a pearly light

  i looked downward again and then the guard behind
gave me a shove and  was forced to stumble down an-
other stairs my head whirling with the brief glimpse
into that glowing immensity  walked mechanically down
a ramp underneath the roof level and shortly after en-
tered a lighted hallway it was bare of carpet or other
ornamentation the illumination of a soft bluish-white
color emanated from behind the mouldings i heard
lord hanavan murmur something about a geissler tube

  fifty feet down the hall we were halted in one wall
was a round opening some four feet across and about a
yard from the floor on a rack to one side hung a num-
ber of metal objects somewhat like overgrown plasterers
trowels taking one of these the leader of the party fitted
its blade into a groove in the bottom of the hole and leap-
ing lightly astride of it vanished without a word the
other did the same i stepped nearer peering it was

ping down at an angle of  degrees a narrow groove
lay in its bottom involuntarily i drew back when one
of the zongainians grabbed my arm and putting one of the
trowels in my hand shoved me towards the orifice i
struggled no i cried no no  i cant

  the man seemed surprised and started to explain shov-
ing the blade of the thing into the slot with the aid of
another he forced me to sit on the lip of the chute feet
pointing downward and grasping the handle between my
legs making a gesture illustrative of hanging on the
zongainian gave a push and off i went

  for ten seconds  experienced as real a terror as i ever
hope to feel in this life down i shot at an incredible
velocity clinging desperately to the handle of the guide
all was black and the wind whistled past effectively pre-
venting any outcry i rocked dimly back and forth and
finally turned completely around and rushed down head-
first

  then suddenly i shot out of the tube near the ceiling
of a vast lighted room    dropped down a long trough
and as the gujder began to slow down because of some
automatic braking force i let go completely and slid across
a flat table into the arms of a dozen zongainians not
even bothering to pick me up they hauled me from the
slide they were not a moment too soon for the next
instant prof pfeiffler came out of the hole in the ceiling
down the chute and squarely into the reception com-
mittee which he knocked to the floor with the violence
of his impact twenty feet behind came the handle of
the guider pitching my poor friend out of the danger
zone they gathered themselves for the next arrival it
was lord hanavan who with drawn and pallid feature
clung manfully to the handle of the guide and conse-
quently decelerated smoothly within fifteen feet of the
end of the slide cummings and prof milroy came next
both sliding freely many feet in advance of the guide

a s soon as they were safely picked up by the recep-
tion committee who suffered many black and blue
spots the remainder of our party descended gripping the
guides easily and stopping with an enviable grace it
was our first experience with the zongainian chutes which
so we found were used universally for descending in the
big buildings

  the chamber in which the chute ended was roughly
sixty feet square and half as high perhaps twenty doors
opened onto it from all four sides and in and out of
these people were constantly passing by the side of
each door was a shiny black panel covered with rows of
lettering in white-a lettering which i quickly recognized
to be similar to that of the platinum coins

  the floor was of the same dark blue yielding sub-
stance that we had found in the house walls and ceil-
ings were of polished metal plates inlaid with black ena-
mel in a remarkably beautiful geometric design

  we had however little time to examine the architec-
tural beauties of the place for our captors hurriedly
escorted us through one of the doors and down a long
passage once or twice we passed people-tall slender
men and women dressed alike in a short tunic and wear-
ing flexible sandals many of them turned and stared
at us but at a word from one of our party they laughed
and went on their way prof milroy listened intently
to everything that was said and he told us that he caught
many words related to latin persian and egyptian

  but the grammar he confided in a whisper the
grammar is beyond me-absolutely beyond me

  during this time we were conducted along a scries of

passages more or less filled with people until finally v
arrived at a place very suggestive of the booking offii
of a prison a man dressed in a blue tunic with a lig
orange cape over his shoulders sat behind a counter mat
of what appeared to be blue bakelite several compl
cated instruments were arranged before him to whit
he gave much attention

  upon our arrival however he arose to his feet and a
dressed the leader of the party in an excited voice th
person responded at some length making frequent ge
tures toward us and using the words europe englam
deutschland when he was done the other addrcssc
us in latin

  i am sorry that you made the mistake of coming her
we of zongainia wish to remain unknown so it beconn
necessary-unfortunately necessary-to confine by fon
all who cros our borders you will not be ill-treatc
but for the best interests of the country you will not i
allowed to return have you anything you wish to say

  the last phrase sounded unpleasantly like the wore
spoken to a condemned man before sentence is passe
lord hanavan now took our case as spokesman

  yes  have a great deal to say we are a scientili
expedition exploring for the interests of civilization w
cannot understand your desire for seclusion your countr
would be benefitted immensely by commerce with th
civilized countries of the world you must still imagii
that roman legions hold mankind in subjection tl
world has changed a great deal since that day peopl
outside of zongainia fly through the air they have coi
quered the oceans the poles 

  the man in the cape interrupted him a list of th
virtues of your race is unnecessary if you wish to sa
anything relative to your confinement here  

  well replied lord hanavan with dignity all  ea
do is to protest against the uncivilized manner in whic
we have been seized and imprisoned for no offense sa
that of unwittingly entering your country

  i wonder said the other musingly what punishmei
your country metes out to housebreakers if yo
feel disposed to argue the case you will have ample oj
portunity to do so when el zoia sees you as he doub
less will as for now  

  he relapsed into liis native tongue evidently givin
some sort of instructions a few moments later we wci
escorted out by another door up a ramp and into a sma
room where we were bidden good-night

  the instant the door had closed we all began to scan
for some way out but the place was proof against u
save for the door the walls were unbroken by any ape
ture their surfaces of a bronze sheet-mctal sound
solid when pounded a number of built-in benches u
holstered with a thick rubbery mat of dark blue const
tutcd the furniture illumination came from a singl
long glowing glass tube in a groove above the mouldin
after much wall-tapping prof pfeiffler located a strca
of warm air entering from a number of small openin
hidden in a design near the floor at least we would n
suffocate but there our search ended sitting in a d
jectcd group on the benches in the corner we eyed oi
another

  well here is the end of this expedition remarki
prof milroy finally tomorrow our bearers may sta
back with the same old story-walked off into the jung
and never came back just like the expedition of 
   i wonder where they are

t ithfr here  or dead replied hanavan i su
  - pose they will send out a search party

  maybe but if they do find the crevasse up the cli
beyond pluto



they will be captured as soon as they arrive it is against
human nature to turn back after only a sight of a land
like this

  but interposed lord hanavan in a more cheerful
tone dont you think it is worth the little inconvenience
to find a country like this zongainia it is the archao-
logical find of the age even if we never escape we will
finish our lives in such a place as man never dreamed
existed did you see that street and the airship i be-
lieve they are ahead of us in some respects

   neffcr saw buildings like dot oudside of noo york
added pfeiffler und dot slide he shuddered i won-
der how long dis coundry hass been here

  since roman times at least two thousand years-
maybe three    cant tell murmured hanavan i
say he yawned did you notice if that airship had
wings folded up    perhaps   

  there was a pause i felt very drowsy somehow our
conversation seemed to run out although there was plenty
to talk about i observed with a sort of mild surprise
that prof pfeiffler was slumped backward snoring

  who is this el zoia they were talking about a king
or something  yawned    feel sleepy  

  i wonder what the population is    started dr cum-
mings and then i slipped backward onto the couch for
an instant my eyes remained open i glimpsed hanavan
rubbing his eyes hard and milroy leaning heavily on prof
pfeiffler and ihen the world went black i sank into a
deep and dreamless slumber

  consciousness returned to me through the violent shak-
ing of my person by dr cummings

  wake up he cried its morning

  is it i replied sleepily looking about the room
was cxactly as it had been before the soft glow of thq
geissler tubes filling it

  it is eight-thirty if our watches are correct added
lord hanavan we must have been drugged last night
through the ventilator

  milroy commenced to speak when without warning the
door opened and three men entered two carried cov-
ered dishes

  be ready to leave within one-fourth of an hour said
one of them leaving the dishes they departed

  breakfast announced cummings looking into a cov-
ered platter

  the meal consisted of a sort of jelly tasting somewhat
like bouillon and a cold liquid with an invigorating ef-
fect whose flavor resembled that of sauerkraut juice how-
ever odd the food was we fell to and by the time the
quarter-hour was up were ready for whatever was to come

  at precisely the fifteenth minute the door opened and
we were bidden to march wc were escortcd through the
office where we had been the night before into an elevator
which ascended a great distance and finally out onto the
roof again

  by day the city was an imposing sight great flat-
roofed buildings covering many acres each and rising
sixty stories from the ground stretched miles in every
direction tall trees grew on the roofs and we could see
people walking about on shaded lawns

  on top of our building there were no roof gardens
the space was taken by a number of great steel cradles
like the ways of a shipyard in one of these rested the
airship of last night by daylight we could examine it
more closely

  imagine a submarine without the conning tower some
eighty feet long imagine it lined with portholes and with
big square windows in front-of a light grayish color and
with stout runners underneath-and you have a picture
of a zongainian airship or prolo as they are called there

of wings or propellers we saw not a sign their method
of propulsion is based upon an entirely dilterent principle
that of the little known action of high frequency current
upon certain kinds of crystals

  later we were to learn much more about these wonder-
ful prolos but just now time pressed-at least it pressed
our conductors for they hustled us into the open door of
the craft at once followed us in and made it fast

  one took his place in a seat at the front windows made
a number of adjustments with dials and levers and the
next instant we silently left the steel ways and sailed into
the morning air

  if the city had been impressive from the ground it was
marvelous from above through the crystal-dear atmos-
phere we could see its streets extending mile after mile
up to the very foot of the mountain now hidden in mist
to the north the range we had crossed yesterday blocked
the view but southwest another wonder was unfolding
itself

  as we arose i glimpsed over a buttress of the mountain
a wide expanse of blue water a lake and on its west edge
directly opposite the peak another city

  but such a city seen through the haze of some sev-
enty miles we did not at first grasp its full immensity
we could not realize that that dark mass of buildings
extended thirty miles along the lake and the buildings in
the center-how could we know that their spires soared
a half mile into the sky

chapter vi
an astonishing fact

tvjtdgixg one of the crew i pointed in mute question-

   ing at the vast scene now lying eight thousand feet
below his eyes lighted with something like pride and
he replied imperium

  for some twenty minutes the flying machine steadily
approached the city it did not descend at all until al-
most directly above the first ranks of tall buildings then
with a hair-raising swoop the car shot vertically down-
ward our destination seemed to be an immense tower
rising far above the other roofs into the air

  for miles in every direction the ground was covered
with giant buildings separated by long glass roofs like a
green house under these as we learned later lay the
streets beyond the business section straight avenues
radiated in all directions lined with smaller houses whose
individual construction could not be discerned in the
aggregate they suggested a green plain strewn with col-
ored pebbles

  but now our descent brought the tower and its sur-
roundings to the center of attention it was situated on
a wide half-circle of park possibly a half-mile across and
about two miles from the lake the tower was of an al-
most pure white stone artificial we found whose top
ended in a series of green rounded domes and roofs

  to the very tip of this structure went the prolo what
appeared to be the end of a spire turned out to be a roof
space roughly a hundred feet square and partly occupied
by another of the landing ways the airship landed
without a bump and the next instant we were all piling
out a dozen or so people hurried out from the enclosed
upper end of a ramp to greet us or rather to greet our
captors much conversation ensued plainly about us
for many looks and gestures were made in our direction
prof milroy listened intently and in the pause before
we were taken down into the building gave a report on
what he understood

  i could almost believe said he that they peak two

and such creatures they were looking at
them one had a sensation of flabby bonelessness

wide arch and through a sort of reception hall to another
high-ceilinged room here a man behind a dark bluo
counter was addressed whereupon he turned to an instru-
ment and spoke at some length prof milroy listened
hut appeared by his general expression to comprehend
little

  our guide listened respectfully and then ordered us to
the side wall where a low bench lay beneath the win-
dows seating ourselves we waited milroy without be-
ing asked translated for us

  he-the one who brought us-wants to know if some-
body called ver menisto is occupied the gentleman at
the desk who so i gather is a kind of secretary telephones

as we afterwards discovered the stairway is hardly ever
found in zongainia

languages part of the time i can follow quite well and
then they will break into a patois which has not a fami-
liar word but here is what they just said our escort
wants to know is el zoia here answer yes he
has been told about us i suppose yes and he
will do something to us this afternoon used a verb i
couldnt gel all the rest was a curious mixture of latin
and other tongues then our escort wanted to know
where we were to be kept here until they have seen el
zoia-then take them to the kont-se-el-heligz whatever
that may be until further orders so unless the kont-
se-el-heligz is the morgue we seem to have no cause for
worry

  at this juncture further conversation was stopped by
the zongainians who by various gestures and words in
their tongue indicated that we were to go below

  the interior of the immense tower was quite similar to
the various apartments and halls we had been through
i looked forward with a quaking sensation lo another
chute and resolved to die rather than descend the im-
mense distance to the earth

  however though we passed a number of these ominous
round apertures in the walls nothing more dangerous
occured than the descent of about four floors by gently
sloping ramps

  at the bottom of the last incline we were led under a

in that other dialect and then tells our friend to wait
some length of time he said a deck-whatever that
may be

  lord hanavan occupied himself in staring out of the
window we had a marvelous view towards the east over
the lake some forly-fivc miles away the mountains
uprose on its farther shore through rifls in the clouds
 could make out buildings of no mean size upon their
flanks the near view was obstructed by the wide sill of
the window down by the lake shore the ranks of sky-
beyond pluto



scrapers made a solid cliff overlooking a long park

  dr cummings glancing nervously about unslung his
ldiucia which he had been allowed to keep after tho
search for weapons

  i wonder he murmured if they would object   
he started to sight through the under when we were start-
led by a deep melodious voice speaking english

  dont waste films on that  will give you a photo-
graph

turning toward the voice we beheld standing in the
now open door to the inner room a tall dark-haired
man in a brilliant blue cape amazed as we were by his
command of english  could not fail to note a peculiar
distinction a sort of nobility of appearance that set him
apart at once from every other person we had seen his
smooth-shaven face had the stamp of character upon it
that cannot be described in terms of features his eyes
of a steely gray bore the command of an imperator and
the understanding of a philosopher instinctively i knew
that he was the ruler of the country the el zoia we had
heard mentioned so often lord hanavan and the others
must have realized this also for we all arose to our feet
with one accord for an instant we stood thus then
our conductor much embarassed addressed himself to
the man at the door

  el zoia listened and then dismissed him addressing
himself to us he spoke come into the other room
we did so the door closed of its own accord behind prof
pfeifrcr who was last the other seated himself behind
one of the desks and indicated that we do likewise then
he began

  may i ask your names gentlemen

  he iistened quietly to the introductions saying after
they were done i have your paper on the cretan inscrip-
tions lord hanavan you are to be congratulated upon
its accuracy then well gentlemen you are i sup-
pose searching for a trace of the lloyd-turnbull expe-
dition of 

  his manner was so casual so utterly unbecoming to
our position and the adventures we had been through that
it was difficult to think we were not back in some club
room in london

  lord hanavan as the spokesman of our party entered
into a detailed account of his discoveries at phila the
manuscript we had found in cairo and the journey up
the river he left out of course any mention of the re-
turning bearers

  the man in the blue cape somehow the title king
seemed too plebeian for him listened with great interest
until our friend was through then he spoke

   isnt it too bad that people have such a curiosity com-
plex if you had written another paper on those coins
and that sherd instead of coming up the river you might
now be back receiving honors at the royal society but
well you english live on adventure so perhaps it is well
he paused leaning back in his chair

  i suppose you have had something told you about this
country-zongainia and of course you have drawn
plenty of conclusions i wont enter into our history or
anything else concerning the land now save to say that
zongainia has existed here in the state more or less as
you see it now for almost two thousand years since
that roman expedition you read about not a rumor of
our country has reached the rest of the world natural
barriers augmented by our own construction have for
eighteen centuries prevented traders and explorers from
carrying tales we keep track of things outside of
course he paused one of the most fashionable men-
about-london is our ambassador to england he sends

newspapers weekly all the most interesting books maga-
zines and music everything to keep me up with the
world i lie smiled havo been in london several
times

  lord hanavan put in a question we have been told
said he that we are not to be allowed to return is this
true

  el zoia shook his bend sympathetically unfortun-
ately it is once you enter zongainia the policy of our
country demands that you never leave the expedition
of  and its relief party are both living and well
but they shall never go back we have one old man a
french explorer who entered zongainia from the west
forty years ago i talked with him in this room an-
other a spaniard who died a decade ago came up from
lake rudolph through the swamps in  a well-
educated young man he taught me a great deal of span-
ish

  the ruler appeared so genuinely sorry that lord hana-
van seemed to see some ray of hope arising to his feet
he cried

  but why do you want to keep this seclusion why
must this country remain hidden these cities inactive
when you could by a word have the commerce of all
the planet pouring in you could become a world pow-
er inn could share your scientific achievements with
the other nations instead of selfishly concealing them
why do your people hide in this little valley wlien the
whole wide earth would welcome them   

  the man in the blue cape interrupted he appeared
bored as though reciting an oft-repeated formula

  zongainia could not exist that way if we made our-
selves known lmperium would soon swarm with tourists
with criminals with sick people we would become in-
volved in diplomatic squabbles wars-you forget lord
hanavan that zongainia lies mostly oil british soil
our money standard is platinum the cheapness of gold
here would precipitate a financial disaster our people
are not the same as yours our food is utterly different
a banquet such as you would sit down to with enjoyment
would kill me your vice and corruption would seem to
us like the filth and squalor of a bushman family we
have abolished pests stamped out disease if your world
were turned loose in zongainia plagues would sweep the
land and the city of lmperium would become but a place
of mourning pausing for an instant he stepped to the
window and threw it open

  you speak of commerce lord hanavan you speak of
the wide horizons of world trade you deplore our iso-
lation-look

  crowding forward we peered skyward to where he

eointed for a moment i was blinded then i made out
igh in the blue the shape of a flying machine at first it
seemed tiny but as it dropped i saw rows upon rows of
windows windows whose smallness brought out the crafts
huge proportions lower it swept now it paused above
the roof tops hanavan gave a gasp of awe its-its a
half-mile long gently the immense bulk of the vessel
vanished behind the buildings when it was gone el zoia
turned to us and said that is the alj-lvueri-it is bring-
ing twenty thousand passengers from the star you call al-
pha centauri you see we are not very confined

chapter vii
exiled

c vents have a habit of coming so thick and fast that
- one cannot react fully to them until hours later after
our interview with the ruler-his title so we learned was


wonder stories quarterly

presonio meaning first judge-the five of us were con-
ducted to the kont-se-el-heligz it was located so i
believe in a building removed a mile or so from the great
tower we were conducted thither by an underground
pneumatic tube at a great velocity

  i recall an ascent of some length in an elevator and a
walk down a long hall terminating in another living
chamber our guide said something in zongainian
closed the door and we were once again alone then our
pent-up feelings burst out like a flood

  for fifteen minutes we fired wild unanswered questions
at each other we were completely carried away upon a
spate of new ideas and new conceptions we had come
prepared to find a semi-civilized race of exiles living in
ignorant isolation we found-

  it seems cried lord hanavan that we are the iso-
lated ones man theyve solved the problem of inter-
stellar travel-alpha centauri why they must be hav-
ing commerce with the whole universe they are a part
of a cosmic league while we are still limited to our own
little earthly horizons to think of finding this in the
twentieth century

  how long have they been doing it interrupted mil-
roy the romans said nothing about flying ships or
moving stars   

  and the size of this city    imperium do they call
it there must be millions living here    scores of
millions added cummings

  exterminated insects    disease mein colt dey
must be subermens put in prof pfeiffler

  now our conversation swung to the subject of the man
we had so recently talked with somehow he seemed to
be the center of everything here the network of streets
radiating from his tower the easily comprehended title
of el zoia apparently unofficial for he was not addressed
thus all pointed to him as the commanding genius at the
controls his personality would have impressed us any-
where but here it was actually awe-inspiring prof
milroy who had conversed somewhat with our guide on
the way explained that his real name was ver zanaos
menisto

  the ver part he added seems a sort of title like
esquire or mister-i was trying to associate it with some
egyptian name roots but i cant place it at all i dont
believe he is of egyptian descent even his frame ap-
pears decidedly nordic and his gray eyes arent roman
or egyptian    he rambled off as was his habit when
against a blank wall conversation dragged repeated
itself oddly enough no one thought of escaping i be-
lieve that if the walls had been cleft for us to walk out
free we would have remained our curiosity complex
was too strong

  well we passed the night and a good part of the next
day in the little room two meals were brought-of gela-
tine a sort of salad made of fruit chopped line and the
bitter yellow drink then along toward night according
to our watches the door opened to admit two men bearing
between them a complicated-looking machine another
zongainian a woman followed them and proceeded to
make some adjustments upon the machine then the first
two left and the woman addressed us in english

  i have been sent from the bureau of instruction to
give you a general plan of our country its history and
of the universe which surrounds us

  turning again tn the apparatus she started a small
motor put out the lights of the room and the next instant
upon a panel in front of the device a picture colorful
moving and stereoscopic appeared the lady proceeded
to explain in a matter-of-fact voice as the pictures changed

while we five representatives of the outer world sat
hunched in the dark and listened like little children

  it is impossible to go into that history in detail for
much of it has slipped my mind and it has little bearing
upon our subsequent adventures little talk was neces-
sary from our instructor the moving pictures some of
them twelve thousand years old told the story bettei than
any words

  many years ago-thousands of years-the moon satel-
lite of the earth had had an atmosphere seas and rivers
life people its chemical composition explained the
lady being identical with that of the earth produced the
same forms of life while their environment influenced
by the same sun and atmosphere directed the long pro-
cesses of evolution even as they were being directed a
quarter-million miles away upon the earth a great race
of men grew upon the moon who called themselves mctyrs

  their cities of massive stone housed untold millions of
people for centuries they lived in peace and security
enjoying the fruits of a hundred-thousand-year-old cul-
ture but then came disaster it struck first fifteen thou-
sand years ago in the form of a great swarm of meteors
which pierced the moons thin atmosphere easily one
entire hemisphere of metyr was laid waste and nine-
tenths of her people killed

  as time passed the survivors gradually built up another
civilization-this time on the other side of the planet but
in the year  bc the inoon was shaken by frightful
earthquakes immense underground caverns containing
a partial vacuum were opened and into these the atmos-
phere commenced to pour the doomed metyrs made
desperate attempts to save themselves and in a year man-
aged to send a hundred and twenty thousand people to
the earth in a huge winged rocket ship which glided to
a safe landing when it touched the earths atmosphere

hpwelve ships left the moon and then fresh earth-
quakes took the last vestige of air leaving the planet
what it is now frigid by night and torrid by day

  on the earth the refugees gathered at a lake in cen-
tral africa where the altitude thinned the air to an amount
bearable to their lungs and there they built up again the
culture of their fathers and kept alive the ancient ideals
of the metyrs

  at first the other peoples of the world were courted
but their crudity and barbarism soon turned the cultured
metyrs against them in the year  ad a battle was
fought in which the metyrs drove back the legions of
persia and rome and destroyed the highway to the sea
a river was diverted that its waters might turn the route
into an impassable swamp in the year  ad a last
attempt was made b the romans to conquer zongainia
but the use of explosives drove the enemy back

  the metyrs now set about the immense task of civilizing
the six million egyptians romans and phoenicians in
their midst it was a task for generations but the sup-
erior culture of the metyrs ultimately won the centur-
ies passed gradually zongainia grew and gradually the
need for commerce with other nations increased it was
then in the year  ad that the first electric hying
machines were made and by their magical agency a mar-
ket vaster than a thousand worlds was opened up-the
universe

  and since concluded our teacher you see the re-
sults

  we were given opportunity to ooh questions after this
and through them we learned a number of other rather
astounding facts which our lady had taken so much for

granted as lo forget piuf miliuys suspicion uf u sec-
ond tongue was confirmed
beyond pluto	

  you see she said the metyrs had a tongue of their
own but it was much too complicated for the savage peo-
ples of the earth and as a result a second simple language
was developed partly from the metyr but mostly from
latin and egyptian it is this language which has puzzled
you so much by its use of familiar words

  in answering a question of dr cummings she casually
mentioned that in the year  our calender el zoia
landed the first space ship upon the planet venus

  whats that cried lord hanavan what do you
mean

  why el zoia-ver zanaos menisto of course you
jaw him yesterday

  but -thats over seven hundred years ago-how
could  

  suddenly a light seemed to dawn upon her she
laughed and then explained el zoia is not a voyian-
an earthman he is a pure-blood metyr the life span
of a metyr is much greater than that of one of you
they sometimes live as long as  years-i am four
hundred and sixty years old now we think it was
caused by the lesser gravity of the moon or the admit-
tance of some ray that voyas-pardon me the earths-
atmosphere is too thick to pass there are many people
alive now who were born long before your christian era
began it is that longevity that has enabled them to as-
similate the vast horde of barbarians that was thrown
upon them

  how old said lord hanavan is el zoia

  he was two thousand and thirty-three years old on-
she paused as though making some mental computa-
tion on the first of july-he was born you see she
added in one hundred and two bc

  after answering a few more questions the young lady
who was four hundred and sixty years old packed up her
machine and went leaving us to cogitate upon all that
we had seen and heard

  with the coming of the next day we were all escorted
from our rooms into the presence of a business-like per-
son who spoke english with a peculiar accent-more like
an irish brogue than anything else and who handled us
as impersonally as though we were pieces of freight

  you are he informed us to be sent to dunsaan im-
mediately you will find comforts and fcllow-country
men there you will leave this evening in the mean-
time you may go to the roof gardens if you wish
guards stepped up and before we could put in a word
we were in an elevator bound upward well it was a
relief to know that we were to see the sunshine again

  the afternoon was spent in a tropical garden with the
great city spread about on three sides and the magnificent
panorama of lake and mountain on the other a mile to
the north the white shaft of the tower shot skyward we
attempted to count its floors but as all got different re-
sults we gave it up

  then we fell to discussing our case and wondering
where we were going for lack of a better explanation
we concluded that dunsaan must be another city or a
prison we leaned toward the former supposition main-
ly because of a repugnance to finishing our days in the
latter wc wondered if they had prisons in zongainia it
seemed so utopian so like dreams of the future of our
own civilization lord hanavan became reminiscent
and compared the splendor of imperium to london he
seemed much impressed by the absence of smoke or
dust   

i tpon a suggestion from cummings we climbed over
the edge of the garden to where the glass roof of the
street curved fifty feet upwards there we spent a fas-

cinated hour watching the traffic a thousand feet below
with hanavans glasses we could make out multitudes of
enclosed three-wheeled vehicles their drivers sitting where
the engine is found in autos whirring along like big dis-
torted insects prof pfeiffler conducted a careful exam-
ination of the cultivated palms and grasses of the garden
furtively pocketing numerous specimens when he thought
we were unobserved   

  early in the afternoon we were brought food and drink
by an attendant who refused to say a word we ate in
silence    lord hanavan and milroy went off together
later to seek a way out but were soon sent back cum-
mings took pictures   

  and then before we knew it it was sunset the vapors
about the snowy peak parted for a brief fifteen minutes
while the perpetual heaps of cumulus turned blood-red
it was so like the first sunset we had seen on the moun-
tain    and then with tropical suddenness it was
night from the glass cover of the avenue there streamed
a white luminescence throwing odd black shadows ath-
wart the garden lights glowed here and there upon the
mountains flank while the white tower like a condensed
constellation reared into the evening mists

  wc were given a short time to view imperium by night
however attendants came immediately and we were
gently but firmly impelled below our guides then tried
to make us enter another chute but the frenzied protests
of prof pfeiffler whom they had singled out to go first
deterred them we descended by an elevator to the pneu-
matic tube the guide said nothing even when prof mil-
roy tried out his version of their tongue he gave up
his efforts when the car stopped and we were conducted
to another elevator

  up again and out onto a long blue-floored corridor
i had lost all sense of direction by then the hall along
which we walked ended in a wide balcony which from
our brightly-lighted position seemed to look out over a
black infinity as we neared it metallic sounds of clank-
ing and thumping became audible the next instant we
were upon the balcony peering off into space

  as our eyes became accustomed to the obscurity we
realized what lay before us we were overlooking an en-
ormous amphitheater miles long and wide the floor lay
some three hundred feet below lighted at intervals by
flood-lamps which only served to accentuate the weirdness
of the place on the floor were immense steel frames upon
several of which the black forms of resting airships lay
across i caught a vague glimpse of derricks working over
something overhead the stars twinkled brightly while
occasionally passing clouds shone with reflected light from
the city

  the next second we were prodded into activity and hur-
ried along the gallery dockyards for their space ships
murmured lord hanavan what a place from behind
 heard a muttered exclamation in german

  a few minutes walk brought us alongside one of the
quiescent monsters a sort of gangway led to a door in
its side and up this we were escorted here it was that
the first inkling of the truth flashed upon us as we
stepped into the ship lord hanavan seized the zongainian
by the shoulder and said where are you takiug us
where does this ship go

  dunsaan replied the other wincing

  where is dunsaan cricd hanavan is it-

  dunsaan is-planet of-you call alpha ccntauri-all
voyians sent there-please release my shoulder- hana-
vans hand dropped

  we would like to see el zoia-ver menisto he
spoke evenly as though trying to control himself

  very sorry but el zoia cannot see you he is gone

to palata out of the city besides these are his orders
the man started to descend the gangway lord hana-
van paused a moment and then hissed under his breath
if we dont make a break now we never can-knock
that one over milroy-now with this he seized the
nearest man by the neck and sent him spinning down the
gangplank then with us close at his heels he started
racing toward the balcony for an instant it seemed
that our mad attempt might be successful for the gal-
lery appeared empty but before hanavan was halfway
down a score of men armed with their little guns raced
out and pointing these toward us ordered us to halt
hanavans rage departed as suddenly as it had come
stopping he pivoted and marched stiffly back to the door
we followed in silence we were defeated

  once aboard the craft things proceeded exactly as
though nothing unwonted had occurred we were es-
corted to a small windowlcss room and locked in after
a time we heard the faint sound of machinery and a few
moments later a series of gentle jerks after that the
ship might have been resting on solid granite for all the
motion it gave but we knew it was not we were hy-
ing-perhaps already beyond the earths atmosphere to-
ward dunsaan beyond the solar system

chapter viii

en route to alpha centauri

cor more than two hours we remained in our little
cell without receiving a word from outside we lis-
tened hearing nothing but gradually an odd feeling be-
came apparent we seemed to be gaining weight lord
hanavan reasoned that this might be caused by extreme
acceleration in an upward direction that is to say to-
ward the roof of the car we soon found that even sit-
ting up was rather tiring-so we stretched full length
upon the couches at eleven pm by milroys watch the
door to the room suddenly opened and an oflicer stepped
in

  you may come to the control room said he in fair
english follow me

  five minutes after we ascended a short ramp into the
pilot house of the great space ship

  the room was of an oval shape with walls and roof of
metal-ribbed glass panes it measured some thirty by
twenty feet upon the walls and the tables on the floor
were dials levers instruments outside-

  it is beyond the power of man to describe the spectacle
that lay beyond the windows above to all sides be-
low a sky of velvety blackness blazing with stars of
every hue of the rainbow-millions of fiery points of
light hanging magically in a tenuous web-work of nebula
invisible from earth we could fairly feci the immensity
we were looking into i was overcome by dizziness at
the thought of the distances below we appeared to be
suspended motionless in the center of infinity i became
conscious that hanavan was pointing to one side and
speaking

  look there  its mars

  it was like a small full moon of a bright orange
color faintly mottled with dark lines the planet hung
even as we watched it dropped appreciably downward
as the space flyer shot up from the sun

  our conductor was at our elbow soon he said it
will commence to show phases like the moon we are
still between it and the sun look he pointed down
there is voya

   we peered expecting to see the hypothetical blue-green
disc but only a thin crescent greeted the eye we were

already far beyond the earths orbit the moon some-
where on the other side of our planet was quite invisible

  our guide then proceeded to explain something about
the navigation of the ship itself  fear none of us com-
prehended much at the time later we were to become
familiar with these wonderful craft but in a much different
way

   it seems that the navigation of zongainian prolos across
the voids of the universe is a most complex process a
line is made between two stars its exact length computed
with extreme accuracy and the ship directed with a con-
tinuous acceleration for just half the distance the craft
is then turned around and after a short glide at peak
velocity it begins to slow down reaching a speed of zero
relative to the destination within a few thousand miles
of it

  the amount of acceleration is determined by the dis-
tance and is limited by the extra strain it puts upon the
human system if a prolo so we were informed-turned
off its power while out in space everything inside it would
be weightless this produced excessive nausea and might
result in the death of passengers so the plan was adopted
of letting the acceleration maintain a continual inertia
force and consequently an artificial weight on long
trips this acceleration was much increased to save time
the officcr said that we would cover the distance to dun-
saan in about eight weeks this is a very fast ship he
explained it is not a passenger craft but what you
would call a battleship-we have international difficulties
here too he added in answer to our questioning looks
the prolo is carrying supplies to the zongainian dock-
yards on dunsaan-you are the only passengers

  what is our velocity now asked prof milroy

  we have gone roughly fifty millions of miles from
voya he explained this has taken three hours at a
mean velocity of about moo miles per second since
our acceleration is constant the velocity relative to the
earth is now  miles per second we are going very
slowly now as soon as jupiter and the asteroids are
passed the acceleration rate will be great increased in
five or six days the ship will be traveling several times
faster than light

  dr cummings looked surprised and asked our physi-
cists have always held that it is impossible to travel faster
than light-doesnt one experience some peculiar pheno-
mena at  miles per second

  possibly your physicists never experimented to prove
their theories replied the officer but we do sec a num-
ber of interesting things what your scientists called dop-
plers effect causes ail the stars ahead to become purple
and ultimately vanish while those behind redden into in-
visibility also as the prolos velocity from the oncoming
light separates the waves when the prolo reaches the speed
of light it will be impossible to see anything save in a
thin ring at right angles to the direction of light because
the light from in front has been changed to extreme ultra-
violet as we plunge into it and the light from behind travel-
ing at the same speed goes along with the ship

  then as the ship approaches twice the speed of light
it begins to catch up on the light from behind and when
we cut into it at the right velocity we see ahead of us what
really lies behind it is very like one of your ocean ships
cutting into water waves from the windward when it is
traveling at full speed as the velocity increases however
all light vanishes save for a ring-shaped rainbow around
the ship which becomes thinner as we race faster

vvte listened to this explanation comprehending very
w little i am not a scientist and so the best i can
do is to leave it to some more highly-trained mind to dis-
beyond

cover the reasons suffice it lo say however in the en-
suing weeks the very phenomena described by the officer
occurred exactly as he had predicted

  the rest of the journey through the solar system was
accomplished in some twenty hours the great outer
planets passed us one by one but in general after our
iirst surprise we were rather disappointed jupiter was
only a tiny colored disk but saturn proved more inter-
esting for hours it loomed in the sky softly pastel-
shaded surrounded by its delicately spun tracery of
rings which we could see extended much farther out than
can be seen through the earths atmosphere then it
dropped downward changed to a crescent and disap-
peared now the prolos velocity began to increase in
earnest everyone reclined on padded couches in-
cluding the man doing the navigating a bell rang
stridently and then a giant hand seemed to press down
upon us crushing our bodies suffocatingly into the cush-
ions i lifted my arm it fell back as though made of
lead from his position on a near divan the officer
spoke without raising his head

  you weigh about eight times normal as soon as it
becomes uncomfortable we will slack up a little   
ships dont usually do this but we are hurried

  we lay still for some twenty minutes when the dead-
ening weight of inertia was lifted-weighing but twice
normal we were again able to walk about

  at four am by our watches the prolo passed the or-
bit of neptune the solar system now lay below pro-
pelled by its mighty engines the space ship shot upward
at an ever-increasing velocity

  the doppler effect was now quite noticeable the stars
and nebula above glowed violet while the sun which we
were so fast leaving behind was only a small ruddy
disk against a background of dim orange stars   

  at five am the signal bell announced the hour of sleep
much fatigued by our increased weight we were led back
to the room the officer gave us all sleeping potions
explaining that as the prolo increased its acceleration
greatly when everybody was reclining we must have an
artificial agent to sleep with the increased weight

  we keep no watches he explained at the rest time
everyone sleeps-navigation is wholly automatic

  so we drank down our potions and spreading on the
couches as directed by the officer sank into a deep and
dreamless slumber while the space ship raced across the
universe at a hundred thousand miles a second

  morning which in the little world of the space flyer
came at three pm found us far beyond the orbit of nep-
tune from the control room where we repaired after
breakfast the sky appeared dead black the velocity
reading when translated into english units indicated a
speed of two hundred and seventy thousand miles per sec-
ond our guide the officer explained that in an hour or
so we would be moving at twice the speed of light and
that as we cut into the light from the sun we would behold
ahead what the ship was leaving behind

  at lunch time the navigating crew numbering some fif-
teen men and women-the captain of the craft was a wo-
man-computed the path of the flyer and corrected some
slight error in direction the change was exceedingly
minute less than a thousandths of a second of arc but
the lateral jerk caused by our immense forward velocity
threw everyone sideways shortly after eight pm a little
less than twenty-four hours after our start the sky above
glowed with the stars we were leaving behind at first
red they slowly changed through the colors of the spec-
trum and at one am next morning vanished for the
rest of the trip-so we understood-the heavens would be
a solid intense black unrelieved by a single star

pluto	

  at five am we were again put to sleep and the prolq
increased its acceleration for another ten hours

  slowly day followed day and week succeeded week our
velocity gradually mounted into figures beyond all hu-
man conception each forenoon by some method wo
could not comprehend the direction of the prolo was
checked then we would cat the weak-flavored jelly and
the bitter drink our officer friend-bis name was ver
vlygar moti-would patiently teach us zongainian the
simpler common language made up of latin and
egyptian words was easy to understand but the classic
tongue of the ancient metyrs presented great difficultiea
in the first place a good speaking vocabulary required
some six hundred thousand words at the least while edu-
cated people had at their command as many as a million
and a half for once in his life prof milroy was up
against something but that person evidently realizing
that the honor of the party was at stake stuck manfully
to the job and before the end of the trip had mastered
the grammar and a good hundred and fifty thousand words

  as for the rest of us we did the best we could with the
conversational tongue acquiring by much practice with
the crew a fair fluency in its eight thousand common
words

cometimes when he was not on duty ver moti would
tell us stories of the universe and its countless worlds
many of them he said were inhabited by weird forms of
life utterly different from anything on the earth he told
tales of his marvelous experiences on a zongainian stellar
patrol cruiser of battles with creatures of the metallic ele-
ments of flights over intelligent animals weighing mil-
lions of tons and of communication with civilized bac-
teria  great cold worlds of the outer nebula

  on a few planets in all the universe he said live crea-
tures in the forms of men most were barbaric but a
dozen planets or more were inhabited by peoples with
whom trade could be established to these scattered
worlds the far-flung fabric of the zongainian prolo trans-
port system reached

  near the end of the fourth week the navigating crew
announced that we had covered half of the distance to
dunsaan everyone became more interested at this and
seemed to consider it a special occasion upon inquiry
ver moti explained as follows

  when half a voyage is accomplished the motors are
turned off and the prolo turning about presents its crystal
propulsion plates forward ttien after a short time of
free gliding the motors are turned on this time slow-
ing the ship the deceleration takes as long as the accel-
eration the period of free gliding however was what the
crew looked forward to as everything on board would
lose weight different people explained ver moti were
affected in various ways some become frightfully nau-
seated others have fits while many are wholly unaffected
by their weightlessness crews are picked for immunity
from gravity-sickness as prolos by gliding at peak
velocity can cover much distance using a minimum of
fuel usually our ship glided for an hour or so when
the crew put on a sort of acrobatic circus trying all kinds
of tricks of floating

  late that afternoon the captain announced that the
motors would be stopped the next day at noon no one
was to breakfast-as a preventive measure

  next morning as may well be imagined we five pas-
sengers shared the excitement of the crew for the forth-
coming experience lord hanavan who had read the
physiological aspects of the case hoped that we would
not be sickened we counted minutes until noon

  the navigating crew worked all morning over their in-
	wonder stories quarterly

comprehensible mathematics gave their verdict and then
the alarm bell rang the crew slopped everything they
were doing-and waited its coming cried ver moti

  suddenly i sensed my weight going it felt like the
lifting of burdens from my back    lighter    lighter
and then without warning we seemed to be falling there
was no motion of the prolo but over my body came that
horrible feeling of dropping    down    down   
illimitable distances the nearest approach lo it i know
is the sudden swoop of a roller-coaster car but this was
continual

  i made a wild leap for a stanchion when the cabin ap-
parently began turning and twisting around me while i
hung suspended in the center of the room all my in-
ternal organs were rising upwards    then i glimpsed
the officer upside down his cape lloaling weirdly above
come drifting toward me he bumped me with a slight
shock and his momentum carried us to the farther wall
there i clung my feet resting upon the ceiling while the
crew now all assembled in the control room began going
through the strangest performances

  clothing inanimate objects round globules of liquid
all revolved and slipped and drifted back and forlh up
and down through the room after a few moments my
brain cleared and emboldened by hanavan who was
floundering about and having the time of his life i pushed
out

  through all our subsequent adventures that first swim
without weight remained in my memory as one of the
oddest of experiences it is impossible to describe the
sensation of turning head over heels in mid air colliding
with drifting chairs pieces of clothing balls of the sour
drink made spherical by surface tension and all of the
time filled with that most terrible sense of falling

   we glided for about twenty minutes then the ship having
been turned about by some more sober member of the
crew the alarm bells signaled that weight was about to
be resumed all floundered floorward hastily and then
without warning we became solid material beings again
and decidedly dizzy ones at that prof milroy and  led
each other to the nearest couch where we rested re-
markable    remarkable he kept repeating rub-
bing a bruised spot prof pfeiffler sat heavily across the
room blinking at us in a not wholly displeased manner
finally he found his voice

chapter ix

on duntaan

half of our voyage was now finished for another
four and a half weeks the prolo would be slowing
down as it raced toward its destination in spite of the
fact that it was likely to be our prison for the rest of our
natural lives we all began to feel a growing curiosity
regarding the planet dunsaan accordingly one morn-
ing at four am we repaired to the room of our friend
ver vylgar moti here we gleaned considerable informa-
tion regarding our future home

  dunsaan so ver moti explained had a circumference
a little short of forty thousand english miles but its
density being somewhat less than that of the earth its
gravity was only slightly greater the surface of the plan-
et was going through a geologic age very like that of the
earths early paleozoic-that is it was mostly swamp and
shallow seas covered with a profusion of low orders of
plant and animal life

  there was a transported population of thirty odd mil-
lions from the neighboring planet of duranko a large

sphere inhabited by a somewhat manlike race and a few
hundred zongainians who maintained a dockyard for bat-
tle protos in addition there were about thirty exiles
from mother earth who had had the ill luck to stumble
upon zongainia

  the principal industry was mining under the beds of
ooze for the partly decayed bodies of a species of small
reptile much prized by the people of duranko

  of course we were much interested in our fellow pri-
soners but ver moti could offer little data in regard to
them they are i think said he in the majority
prospectors professional elephant hunters boers some
have been here thirty years there are the two exploring
expeditions of course the lloyd-tumbull party of
 and the relief expedition they number i believe
six   not sure though

  the four weeks passed like centuries every day data
collected corrections made came dinner then for us a
movie entertainment zongainian dramas of weird adven-
tures-i dont believe we saw a single play that might be
termed a love story supper followed and another half-
hour for digestion which we spent in patching our battered
clothing-bed and sleep powders next day the same
thing over again near the end of the time ver moti
finally prevailed upon us to throw away the old khaki
and wear the loose tunic the transparent composition
sandals and flowing cape of the crew we found these
surprisingly comfortable

  well all things end at last and so did our journey
once again the stars appeared in the sky changed color
and then remained but what a difference the heav-
ens blazed with unknown spheres while directly below the
prolo lay alpha centauri a magnificent twin star of
orange and green with some difficulty ver moti pointed
out a little yellow disk far below that said he is
dunsaan the two suns whose glare illuminated the
whole heavens cast strange green and orange lights upon
the wall dimming the geissler lamps with a small
telescope we could makeout the faint markings on the
fast approaching planet

  then observations were suddenly stopped by the ring-
ing of the alarm bell we were going too fast decelera-
tion must be increased i threw myself on the couch just
as the iron hand of momentum pressed down for a few
moments my very breath was squeezed out and then the
weight was released this drastic measure secured the
necessary result in a few minutes the prolo was flying
at the rate of only thirty miles per second just beyond
dunsaans atmosphere prof pfeiffler peered down with
our glasses staunching a nosebleed at the same time

  quite rapidly the surface of the new world slipped be-
low a wide flat expanse of morass interspaced with shal-
low lakes and seas over all lay a murky haze shutting
out the suns rays like a damp blanket finally an im-
mense city protected from the swamps by dikes ap-
peared in its center we made out the rectangular struc-
ture of a prolo landingway toward which the chief navi-
gator was piloting the ship moment by moment the city
rose to meet us until at last eight weeks and five days af-
ter arising from imperium zongainia the keel of the
space ship touched the steel landing cradle at dunsaan
planet of alpha centauri

   as the last propulsion plate was turned off and the full
weight of the prolo pressed the hydraulic landing rails
deep into their concretc beds the door was opened and
the gangway run out for a moment air rushed into the
space craft a peculiar pungent air its odor reminiscent
of cypress swamps and then a number of men ran up the
ramp to the door one of them evidently of some auth-
ority demanded to see the commander she was at once
beyond pluto



--nt for while the official waited impatiently in the con-
trol room we five passengers made ourselves incon-
spicuous in a corner and watched in a few moments
ver vera nadji the commander entered to be at once
fairly leaped upon by the waiting man

  thanks to all our ancestors that you are here he cried
in zongainian we thought that your ship had been
caught  he paused vera nadji seemed astounded
caught she repeated by whom

  you dont know but then you have been out of
touch for sixty-one days    we have our latest informa-
tion from the ethcro beam transmitter at waiko    two
days ago    all unconvoyed prolos are to remain in the
fortified dockyard    its war vera nadji  if el
zoia has not ordered the battle fleet together already he
will within ten days

tera nadji fell back in horror i thought they
would settle it peacefully    the interstellar com-
merce commission was in session  

  the man laughed the interstellar commerce com-
mission    bah since vera miraza was presonio it

 the four made no move-they only
 watched us with yellow glittering eyes

teries ver muot and you will have battle prolos what
if they do

  ver muot shivered replying i am more interested
in being commandant of a repair station than a dead
hero on a wrecked prolo

  the woman laughed and then turning suddenly to-
ward us cried ah yes ver muot-and i have more col-
onists for your discontented club here she beckoned
him after her may  present lord mitchell hanavan

 the commander of the prolo shook her head it will
 be terrible zongainia will win of course but for us
 it will mean scores of battleships destroyed thousands
 killed for them a planet ravaged a whole race wiped
 out they are idiots ver muot

 the official nodded do vou suppose they will come
 here

vera nadji shrugged perhaps but you have bat-

country dr g a cummings america prof herman
pfeifiler deutschland and david lawrence america

  we all bowed and smiled in turn while the official
murmured a day a few times and then added some-
thing relative to our immediate removal to the foreigners
enclosure-the kont-se-el-heligz vera nadji depu-
tized our friend ver moti to conduct us thither and at
once fell into violent discussion with the dockyard com-
mander

  our attention divided between the strange new world
we were entering and the impending war we descended
from the landingway and got our first view of dunsaan at
close quarters  confess it quite struck all thoughts of
war from our minds the city spread for miles in every
direction a heterogeneous assemblage of hat-topped white
adobe buildings none more than twenty feet high

  the walls were pierced at irregular intervals with
round screened windows and doors in and out of which
went the inhabitants and such creatures they were


wonder stories quarterly

white about four feet high two-legged like men but
there the resemblance ended the whole upper portion
of their bodies was covered with a rubbery white mantle
of skin under which a score or more flexible and retrac-
tive tentacles undulated the brain was contained in a
limp lobe at the top of the mantle the mouth as we later
found lay underneath the creatures single eye fast-
ened on the tip of one tentacle constantly swayed back
and forth as it walked looking at them one had an un-
forgettable sensation of flabby bonelessness-of a certain
softness such as is associated with polyps i think prof
pfeiffler was the only one not overcome with revulsion

  veil he remarked with gusto as we entered the first
street ve got to dissecd von uf doze this didnt im-
prove our impressions much ver moti laughed theyre
from duranko he explained sister planet of dunsaan
-same system intelligence a little below us but rather
clever in certain lines    quite deaf and dumb your
friend ver milroy will have a time learning their sign lan-
gage

  apparently there were no street cars in dunsaan the
entire three miles to the foreign settlement was made on
foot we threaded opr course along avenues crowded with
the odd white creatures who by the way displayed no
curiosity concerning us until at last another white build-
ing under the brow of one of the citys protecting dikes
appeared

  this said ver moti is the discontented club you
will find a quite nice group in there-they play cards
and smoke and drink and have all the other disgusting
little habits you like so well so i imagine it wont be
too hard

  he knocked on the front door which was opened after
some time by a huge fat man smoking an immense dutch
pipe veil said he in english vat iss id now

   prof pfeiffler his eyes lighting poured forth a stream
of fluent low dutch to which the other immensely star-
tled responded eagerly separating the two with difficul-
ty we entered the building ver moti officiated in mak-
ing the introductions and then left us bag and baggage
and not very much of that in the main room our fel-
low exiles seemed very kind and friendly showing us
rooms on the upper floor and asking us numberless ques-
tions

  the house a big bare structure once used as a ware-
house by the zongainians contained five englishmen one
frenchman and seventeen boers the englishmen were
of the two ill-fated parties that had preceded us up the
nile the frenchman the sole survivor of a detachment
of the foreign legion which had penetrated the forbidden
land from the west while the boers had wandered in by
twos and threes in the course of elephant hunts and tteks
after gold

  we noticed almost immediately a sort of separation
between the english and french and the dutchmen they
lived in different parts of the building ate apart and as
we found did not even converse unless absolutely neces-
sary our curiosity as to this state of affairs was soon
satisfied for that evening at the mess table the leader of
the englishmen arose and after introducing himself as
arry awkins made a semi-official speech that was very
illuminating

  he commenced by stating that at the time the second
party entered the wilderness in  the great war was
just beginning and that the dutchmen upon hearing the
news told in a more or less partisan manner immediately
took the side of their neighbors against england this
feeling was not mitigated by the recent to them boer
war in which several had received wounds during the
years of idleness here in dunsaan a bitter controversy

over the outcome of the war had arisen and it had be-
come one of the important topics of discussion

  both sides imagined how its course was running each
favorable to his own faction and each hopelessly convinced
of his own correctness besides this the natures of the two
nationalities tended to drive them apart the english
were forever talking and planning about escape while the
stolid boers satisfied with an easy life and naturally dis-
liking the idea of physical danger preferred to remain
where they were other things further aggravated matters
until the exiles were anything but the happy family they
might have been the frenchman had fought a duel with
a dutchman and killed him his companions complained
to the commander ver muot but the latter refused to lake
any action asserting that the quicker they killed each other
off the happier he would be at this juncture we had ar-
rived with our store of news and fresh ideas like a sea
breeze on a desert ofttimes however a sea breeze can
fan embers to a flame and as it turned out this is what
we did

tltawkins was impatient for news from the world

  --taking turns we stayed up most of the night nar-
rating the wonderful events that had transpired during the
last fifteen years the boers came in too but made little
comment hawkins nudged me as we ascended to bed
and whispered delightedly something about blimey but
our victory doesnt help their digestion

  next morning at breakfast in the english quarters haw-
kins after suddenly opening every door for listeners and
peering from each window told us all to draw near then
he began to speak in a low voice punctuating his discourse
with many suggestive gestures and mysterious glances

  it might look he commenced like we was laid by
ere for duration-an maybe it woulda been if arry
awkins adnt been along has soon has hi harrived on
this blasted planet hi thought to myself arry hi
thought hits hup to you to get hout of ere hit may
take a long time but youre a long ways from old lunnon
so dont get himpatient arry me boy well we adnt

with honly er engine gone and most of er side bashed
in sir percy said she ad been in a wrcck an hafter
they pulled hout the machinery they left er ull to rot
right away hi saw the way we couid pick up and leave
these blighters hanny time we choose by just putting in a
new hengine an patching hup er ull so we started in
swipin hiron plates and parts of a hengine and sir percy
got old of some plans-and there we was

  but blimey hit was slow there was big iron cast-
ings and hall kinds of gadjets that hi dont understand
yet to sneak in and hoften we went a fortnight without
gettin has much has a blinkin bolt but old sir percy
o was a good un e got everything there and put together
right when we found hout that we didnt ave no in-
struments to navigate with so we ad to start hall over
again but then hit was five years ago last month sir
percy died of fever hafter e was buried our luck left
us hi was the only one as ad the nerve to swipe any-
thin but none of us was sure ow to put the bloody swag
onto the boat jenkins ere was for startin hout without
the instruments but hi says weve got plenty of time
dont worry an maybe arry awkins can think hout a
way so all weve been doin for three year come next
september his to pick up hextra hinstruments and load
em into the machine

  he paused for a moment in his talk to peer out the win-
beyond pluto



dow evidently finding all satisfactory lie hunched a lit-
tle closer and almost whispered

  these dutchies the blighters dont know wot we as
up our sleeves hif they did they would tell the colonel
v what calls isself ver muot just out of spite because they
hare so mad wc won the war they want to slay ere
they do an they can until they rot for hall hi care hall
we needs is a good mechanic to read the plans and fix the
instruments and then the colonel and the dutchies can
go to ell blast em

  we listened to this picturesque discussion with immense
interest and as may well be imagined plied hawkins with
questions afterwards in this manner we learned that
the repaired prolo a sixty-foot craft was partly imbedded
in a pre-carboniferous swamp about five english miles
from the city and on its opposite side it was this dis-
tance which necessitated a long detour around the outer
slope of the dike that made the englishmens visits to
their ark so rare the zongainians however did not
watch their prisoners very closely as escape seemed highly
improbable and besides for some months they had been
taken up entirely with their bloody war as hawkins put
it

   this led the conversation to the mysterious talk between
ver muot and vera nadji on the transport hawkins
knew very little save that there was some kind of trouble
between zongainia and a place called kanan evidently an-
other planet the impending war seemed so distant from
our interests that we five newcomers soon considered it
as unimportant as did hawkins its main effect would
be to make our jailers forget us that was as far as our
thoughts went

chapter x
war

a fter a week or so of settling down to satisfy haw-
kins sense of what would appear proper to the auth-
orities we made a midnight trip to the hidden prolo
climbing out of a back window facing the dike the five
of us were joined by hawkins and the frenchman with-
out a word they led us up the embankment over the crest
of the dike-some eighty feet high-and part way down
ils other side cautioning us to be careful of our footing
hawkins proceeded ahead heavy dank odors ascended
from the morass below and now and then i heard thumps
and splashes as though some large amphibians were mov-
ing about the darkness was absolute for dunsaan was
moonless and ils thick atmosphere prevented any starlight
from filtering through if it had not been for a dim
phosphorescence which outlined the ground we could not
have gone a step

  after nearly three hours hawkins slowed down and
began peering close to the ground soon lie gave an ex-
clamation of pleasure and picked up the end of a light
woven-wire cord motioning us toward him lie whispered
watch where hi walk and keep old of the line this
swamp his bottomless then slipping the cable under
his arm he clambered down the bank to the flat hana-
van milroy cummings pfeiffler and i followed while the
frenchman brought up the rear at the bottom of the
dike hawkins with the confidence of one on familiar
ground proceeded out upon a long spit of quaking land
between black pools of water

   ahead the cord stretched rising dripping from the slime
and soon covering our hands with ill-smelling liquid no
word was spoken hawkins skilfully stepped on long
scaly logs jumped across menacing pools and occasionally
passed over a more or less solid island of rank grass

on either side i heard the scurry and splash of animals
but evidently the denizens of this dunsaanian swamp were
very timid for we never saw one

  at the end ot another hour ol exhausting travel a dark
metallic mass loomed before us and hawkins stopped
he fumbled with the door opened it and after carefully
wiping his feet climbed in we followed thanking heaven
for having a lloor underfoot again hawkins immediate-
ly made a light and showed us over the craft with pride
everywhere the work of a master mechanic was in evi-
dence steel ribs had been bent into shape or replaced
plates had been welded  the engines complicated
things as yet confusing to us were all in place oiled
their fuel lanks full they were ready to hurl the prolo
into space as soon as the instruments were in place

  while hawkins was showing us around the frenchman
brought out the all-important plans lord hanavan and
prof milroy who were the only ones familiar with the
zongainian written language pored over them saying lit-
tle the frenchman and cummings who knew french
struck up a conversation in that tongue prof pfeiffler
armed with a flashlight and a light crowbar went to the
nearest island in search of specimens while hawkins en-
tertained me with a lengthy history of his early life in the
neighborhood of billingsgate time passed quickly and
soon the green ray of the first sun struck across the swamp
to announce the coming of another day the seven-hour
night was over

  hawkins was not worried as much as three days had
often been spent at the prolo without exciting suspicion
opening a cupboard he brought out some anti-sleep pow-
ders to carry us over until we should return these ere
zongainians he remarked ave a blinkin powder for
hevery hoccasion

  the short day was spent in much the same manner as
the night hanavan and milroy were evidently getting
the plans for they took more anti-sleep powders and dis-
sected one of the spare instruments with many knowing
nods and zongainian words between the equally lengthy
anecdotes of hawkins and the frenchman i fell gradually
asleep the last thing i can remember was the french-
man saying -el quand marie ina vu elle mairnait tout
de suite comme toutes les autres  

  with the setting of dunsaans twin suns we prepared to
return lord hanavan though his mechanical experience
had been limited to motor boats and radio had succeeded
in installing the telescopic meteor-lookout and the speed-
omeler and he assured us that the plans were not half as
difficult as they appeared

  the green sun vanished and after a short period of
orange twilight the intense night of the far planet descend-
ed

  the return journey was started uneventfully hardly a
word being said by anyone through the dim radiance
of the luminous plants we trudged each occupied with his
own thoughts near midnight hawkins turned sharply
right and up the embankment some paces behind we fol-
lowed groping for the grasses of the crest looking up-
ward i discerned the cockneys sturdy form silhouetted
for an instant against the citys glow then with a whisp-
ered gasp of warning he rolled back upon us

  a crowd in front of the ouse    zongainians   
those dutchies  

our hearts scarcely beating we carefully elevated our
heads over the parapet the building was flooded
with light a hundred zongainians and a good thousand
of the weird white people surrounded it in the middle
of the group near the door were the treacherous boers
and the four other englishmen facing ver muot and his


wonder stories quarterly

guards we could not hear what was being said but it
was not difficult to guess the boers had found out our
plans-perhaps overheard where the prolo was   

  i felt hawkins tugging at my sleeve

  back to the boat hi say-has quick as we can make
hit

  i started to wriggle down the dike when he seized my
ankle- not that way-we avcnt time well ave to
chance hit across the city

  back we scrambled to the top of the dike where hidden
by the long grass we crawled a hundred yards beyond the
floodlights and then down into a dark street led by the
wonderful hawkins we scurried along ducking into the
yard-high doorways when the mantled white people passed
fortunate it was that they were deaf otherwise our loud
breathing would surely have betrayed us for a time
we seemed to have eluded any scarch party but our hopes
were soon shattered

  the frenchman suddenly shoved hawkins against the
wall hissing- gare la prolo    eeet ees there
we crouched for a moment watching the slender form
go silently by her searchlight flicking from street to
street running now we started out afresh again the
prolo passed and again we were fortunate in hiding against
the wall

  i thought we were hopelessly lost when between two
buildings  saw massive and grass-covercd the dike
faint with the reaction we struggled up its face and slipped
down until our feet were in the morass hawkins searched
frantically a few moments and then holding tight to our
life-line we started out over the swamp haste was im-
perative for a faint glow indicated that dawn would
soon be at hand for centuries so it seemed we floun-
dered through rank grass and brackish water before the
steel walls of the prolo came into view never did i see
a more welcome sight we piled in this time one may
be sure not stopping to wipe our feet

  we will ave to start hat once gasped hawkins as
soon as he had found the knob which turned on the glow
light theyll scour these swamps till they find us
thats wot theyll do we got to be gone before daylight

  hawkins and hanavan went into the engine room to
start the motors while milroy and the rest of us screwed
down the windows and door our terror of capture drove
all sane reasoning from our minds even lord hanavan
utterly forgot that half the instruments were unmounted
and that we were quite without charts of the starry void
into which we were going

  fortunately the prolo was well supplied with fuel food
and oxygen indeed the assiduous efforts of harry haw-
kins and his companions had filled every nook and cranny
of the cabin to overflowing we were not however in a
mood to throw away provisions for comfort

  thanks to the frantic efforts of hawkins and lord hana-
van the motors were started and the ship was ready to
rise some time before dawn we all assembled in the
main cabin and after a pause a sort of mental gathering
of courage hawkins turned on the propulsion plates
the craft heaved out of its muddy dockyard with a suck-
ing sound and immediately poked its steel prow into a
dense thicket of fern trees hawkins backed it out the
stern overturning a tree in the process and then realizing
that the swamp was a little dangerous for windows he
brought the prolo straight up a thousand feet there we
hesitated

  our camarades cried the frenchman our friends
who have woiked thiough all zee long years to make
zees escape are we to leave zem behind

  hawkins filled with emotion could not reply but
lord hanavan did to descend now would mean cer-

tain capture he said slowly we can do them a greater
service by returning to the world and sending help than
by giving up this ship over which they have labored   
let us go on   

  as the prolo ascended beyond the last vestige of dun-
saans thick atmosphere the twin suns arose above the
horizon their light though weird in its duality of color
had nevertheless a cheering effect upon us below lay
the dark bulk of dunsaan with its fetid swamps and its
weird inhabitants above the starry universe glowed in-
credibly distant and we seven voyagers from the world
hung between he zenith and the nadir like mohammeds
coffin in a steel space-flying machine about whose opera-
tion we knew next to nothing

  now that we had left the closeness and excitement of
the swamp we realized with awful clarity the position we
were in hawkins knew the general direction of the sun
but since everything ahead would vanish as soon as we
went faster visual navigation would never do

  hif sir percy was only ere wailed hawkins e
knew hall about ow to do hit

  but sir percy was perhaps fortunately for him beyond
care of escape

fur hopes had reached their lowest ebb when prof
 milroy who had been looking at dunsaan through
the glasses suddenly seized my arm and cried one of
their prolos  a big one    its coming toward us
hawkins looked-then i milroy was right already
the strange craft was near enough to see without the bino-
culars a liny metal spindle gleaming in the sunlight
for an instant we were seized with a terror that we had
been sighted but reason soon told us that our smallness
would prevent our being visible at this distance stead-
ily the prolo arose it was heading toward the part of the
sky where the sun lay almost simultaneously the idea
flashed upon us-the way to get back to the earth fol-
low that ship

  immediate action was necessary it was already past
us leaping to the control chair hanavan turned on the
power we were fairly throw to the floor for an in-
stant the universe reeled around us then hanavan had
the car straightened out with ever-increasing velocity
we tore after the fleeing prolo pressed flat by the vio-
lence of acceleration after a few ticklish moments we
commenced to gain on the bigger craft lowering the
acceleration rate to conform to that of the prolo ahead
we had a hort conference watches were appointed and
upon cummings suggestion a special couch was laid
beside the controls for the navigator to rest upon when
the acceleration became too great

  the hours slipped by and the twin suns of dunsaan
reddened into oblivion the weird color changes of our
speed became apparent all around us only the prolo
showing dimly ahead retained its true hue

  at the end of four hours hawkins was relieved by mil-
roy hanavan and the rest of us took sleeping potion

  when i awoke ten hours later the sky was a dead black
dr cummings at the controls was lying flat on his back
staring upward through the glass roof at the other prolo
looking around i discovered everyone else to be asleep
the ship was perfectly quiet and save for the lights 
the instruments dark for a long time i lay still my
eyes upon the dim form of our guide i noted that we
were considerably closer evidently because of the dif-
ficulty of seeing hie lights in her control room glowed
like a big tar hovering motionless in a velvety immen-
sity

   somehow i felt an interest in the occupants of the ship

i wondered who they were and what they were doing it
beyond

reminded me of watching boats pass one at night on the
ocean only here the ocean extended to infinity and that
friendly light ahead was our only link with life my
mind filled with thoughts like these i had begun to drowse
off again when a violent lurch of our prolo half threw me
from the bunk hastily regaining my feet i saw that
dr cummings was sitting up gripping the control levers
tensely and staring upwards  followed his glance to
see the ship ahead moving swiftly sidewise

  changed its course hissed cummings wake the
others   

   started to do this when cummings countermanded his
order

  all right now theyre going straight

   i relapsed into a dozing state again

  i do not remember how long we followed the prolo
across space it may have been a couple of weeks but i
am not sure after eight or nine days the other craft
began to decelerate almost crashing into her we did
likewise lord hanavan was greatly disturbed

  it took four weeks acceleration before we were half-
way to dunsaan he explained if we start to deceler-
ate after only a week or so it means that we are not going
to the earth

  beyond any hope now we followed our guiding star that
was so false through all of its many maneuvers for over
a week steadily slowing down all the time stars began
to reappear they passed through the colors of the spec-
trum and became fixed it was apparent that we were
either moving extremely slowly or were stationary but
nowhere was there a sign of a sun or a planet the prolo
before us hung motionless in the sky as if waiting for
something

  waiting but for what time only could tell we
put in the hours as best we could installing more instru-
ments and a little rapid-fire gun which sir percy had ac-
quired it was mounted in an airtight chamber built in
the control-room floor with its muzzle when ready for
action projecting into the vacuum of space hawkins en-
tertained us with stories of escapades in london during
his youth    one always watched the big prolo we
hardly noticed that our weight had dropped to nearly zero

  three days passed in this fashion and then while we
were listening to one of the frenchmans stories hawkins
on watch called out

  ahoy there theres hanother blinkin prolo ard
haport an hup a few points

  the frenchmans story was suddenly interrupted look-
ing in the direction indicated i made out the fish-like
form of another spare ship slowly approaching our guide
the latter made no movement for some moments we
watched this meeting and then milroy with his glasses
made oat two more prolos dropping slowly downward
from above and behind us sooq these were visible to
the naked eye and more had materialized out of the void
all assembled with the first ship in long lines it sug-
gested battleships arranging themselves in a convoy at
once we thought of that overheard conversation back on
dunsaan the war  

chapter xi
on kanan

in scores now the prolos silently appeared and fell into
place huge craft-one had a feeling that they were
not passenger or freight ships-and droves of smaller ones
some no larger than ours it was like a review or a par-
ade engrossed i watched the lines form and then start
slowly away now upon each ship there appeared a blaze

pluto	

of light a signal of some kind  became conscious that
milroy was speaking

   i say if we can get in with those fellows theyll think
we are in their party lets go over to that group of
small ones above and get into line

  it was a good suggestion while hanavan who was the
best navigator operated the controls the rest of us cleared
the boxes of food and fuel from the control room to make
it look shipshape in case anyone should look into our
glass roof

  the ten miles or so to the swarm of small prolos was
soon covered hanavan deftly maneuvered our craft into
line and then following the blazing light of a leader
we picked up speed weight returned with acceleration
and within three hours dopplers effect had extinguished
every star but now before and behind for thousands of
miles we could see a miniature milky way the pilot
lights of the fleet it is a wonder to me now that we were
not discovered at once in our deception our ship had
no signal lights nor ncon-tubc number outside and for
all we knew might have been crowded into another crafts
place but whether by accident or carelessness we were
not apprehended the immense fleet numbering many
thousands swung majestically across the sky our little
fugitive prolo a part of it

  for six days we accelerated then reversed and com-
menced to slow down another six days and we would
come to a stop then-

  five passed the stars reappeared magically and evi-
dently to prevent confusion the artificial stars of the fleet
commenced to blink

  ahead of us a misty glow like a dim nebula came into
being the line of lights pointed in its direction we
felt a certain tenseness    something seemed about to
happen

  something did in empty space about fifteen miles ahead
there was a terrific explosion a gigantic sheet of green-
ish flame spread soundlessly enveloping a dozen prolos
in its folds for half a minute it lay across the sky and
then faded away leaving the battleships twisted redly
glowing wrecks instantly along the line little pin points
of blue fire began to appear for five minutes this con-
tinued then ceased a pause    then far far to one
side the sky was lit with tiny green lashes of flame that
grew and faded we waited amazed then without
warning another sunburst of fire leaped up closer this
time for i distinctly saw a sixty-foot craft like ours
crumple and grow red hot a mile away now the little
blue sparks began to fly in earnest every battleship
fairly glowed with them in the distance came the an-
swering flame bursts suddenly we realized what we
were witnessing our fleet was in battle with the enemy
men were being killed by the thousands around us and
at any moment we might be engulfed by one of those
gigantic shells

   now i noticed that our fleet had divided itself into two
lines one was turning toward the invisible enemy while
the other in which we were continued in the direction
of the round nebulous patch

  not disappointed at leaving these rather dangerous
pyrotechnics behind we increased speed again lord
hanavan filled the little guns chamber with air and af-
ter going over directions again loaded it it would fire
two thousand shots before reloading would be necessary

  two hours passed the battle had vanished long ago
our half of the fleet barely moving neared the destina-
tion its luminous corona now filled half the sky while
in the center we could discern a ball about the size of a
full moon dr pfeiffler suggested that it might be the
planet kanan
	wonder stories quarterly

  now there was a change in the fleets formation the
line turned presenting its length to the planet and form-
ing a wide crescent advanced thirty minutes passed
slower and yet slower went the armada as though its
commanders were suspicious without warning every
light vanished we turned out our cabin lamps depend-
ing upon the dim glow from outside and then in front
of the crescent the sky bccame a green inferno by the
hundreds by the thousands the enemy shells burst some
prolos more advanced than others were destroyed while
right and left the ships glowed again this time with the
fleets answering fire

  the planets atmosphere bccame speckled with green
then the crescent hurled itself forward flinging him-
self upon the controls hanavan urged our little craft on
too while he shouted to hawkins to be ready at the gun

  were in it now he cried its fight or die

  there was no lime for thought or reflection though
all was silent save our own excited voices  could imagine
the roar that would sound if there was air on we
rushed sometimes surrounded and once actually touched
by a green flame ships on either side went down-but
still the thousands of the zongainian fleet poured in the
planet grew until it filled half the sky and a faintly audi-
ble whistling betrayed its outer atmosphere as we des-
cended the air grew luminous  i caught glimpses of
streaks of lightning but whether these were a natural
phenomena or part of the battle i cannot say

  near our little prolo we saw another battleship huge
shadowy slipping ghostlike through cloud banks through
the windows came the first thunderous echoes of the bat-
tle now louder as the air grew denser suddenly we saw
other space flyers below like a shoal of whales they
sprang into life the instant we sighted them spurts of
green flame came spitefully from their sides and shells
with heavy concussions burst about the zongainian ship
the air waves threw our little craft about like a chip
the zongainians still dropping returned the fire i had
the satisfaction of seeing one of the enemy turned end
upward and drop a faint crash arising from the depths
told of its end

cor five minutes the air was filled with bursting shells

  the zongainian prolo now had a gaping hole torn in
her side    her drop was becoming more pronounced
lord hanavan directed the nose of our tiny ship toward a
battleship below and i pushed the firing button the other
was immediately surrounded by a ring of fire and backed
away evidently disabled but now the ground appeared
clouds of smoke obscured the view so we got only an oc-
casional glimpse of titanic buildings grotesque twisted
masses of wreckage    shattered battleships   

  the zongainian her stern dropping lower and lower
struck against a tower with a roar the mass of masonry
fell and then the prolo giving a last burst of fire fell heav-
ily into the city leaving a dozen buildings in ruin in her
wake at the same instant there was a blinding flash of
light an ear-splitting concussion and amid a shower of
broken glass and hot metal our little craft fell into the
chaos below with this all consciousness of the battle
ceased for me

  my return to the land of the living was preceded by a
tortuous succession of nightmares in which i was pursued
across a limitless blue void by a pack of steel monsters
with gaping jaws flames darted from their mouths and
bolts of lightning like pointing fingers indicated me to
my relentless enemies after an eternity of mad chase
across space i began to hear a faint pounding a metallic

ringing lilec a blacksmiths anvil intorpoced with heavy

dull thumps strange odors were wafted to my nostrils

and as if at a great distance i heard the confused voices
of many people gradually i became conscious that i
was lying on my back on some kind of a couch and that
my limbs and head were curiously numb and heavy feel-
ing for some time i lay still not opening my eyes and
trying to remember what had happened last

  the vague meanderings of my mind were suddenly in-
terrupted by footsteps and a voice near at hand it spoke
in zongainian

  well how has time treated our six runaways have
any more died

   could not quite catch the answer but a sudden grip-
ping feeling passed over me who had died making
a desperate effort i opened my eyes and then commenced
to blink them in amazement for an instant i thought that
i was the one who had gone and that i was already in
some trans-stellar inferno i was lying on a narrow cot
along with a hundred or more similar beds upon a steel
shelf much like the gallery of a theater fifty feet over-
head a twisted metal roof curved ending abruptly in a
long jagged tear out in front of our shelf was an area
of crumpled space ships and shattered buildings heaped
in an incredible confusion and as  discovered by hard
peering covered with hundreds of tiny men who were
clambcring about hauling on ropes pounding and ham-
mering and operating machines

  now and then the light of some welding apparatus
would glow like a firefly sharply silhouetting its opera-
tor in the gray gloom this amphitheater was bounded
by a serrated scarp of immense buildings all battered
and seeming ready to fall at the least shock after star-
ing at this chaotic spectacle for some minutes i turned
my head observing that it was covered with a rubbery
bandage and looked at the speaker who had awakened
me

  he was a tall zongainian dressed in a sepia cape and
wearing a turban-like headdress seeing me move he
came over to the cot where i recognized him to be our
officer friend on the outward trip ver vylgar moti

  a day said he using the universal zongainian
greeting or rather a night for these kanan days are
hardly bright enough for such a term well you seem
to be on the way to recovery we thought you were gone
when we hauled you out of the prolo how did you ever
get here we leave you safe in dunsaan for life and in
the next fifty days you come shooting right into the midst
of the biggest war in ten centuries and alive tool
what happened i asked where is the fleet and
where are we

  in kanan replied ver moti as far as we know
the zongainians have won but our battle prolo was dis-
abled at the same time yours was it fell into the city of
kanan our ethero communication apparatus was hope-
lessly smashed so we cannot call aid the crew-about
five hundred who are alive not counting the hundred
and twenty wounded-are trying to dig out a small cruiser
and repair it but have patience your wounds will be
healed within ten days and in the meantime you need rest
if you persist in askiug questions we will have to give
you sleeping potions like we did to your friend ver
hanavan

ith a few more words delivered in a similar tone
ver moti left me with my thoughts and the con-
templation of the scene before me i wondered how ser-
ious the plight of the stranded zongainians was their
battleship which lay athwart two buildings in the back-
ground wa wrecked beyond repair and in the twisted

chaos of the amphitheater i could find no ray of hope
beyond pluto



t any moment a kananese prolo might fly overhead and
have the zongainians at its mercy

  for an hour or so i watched the scene and then after
drinking some warm milk-like fluid i fell into a sound
sleep

  and so a week passed over kanan with its eternal
misty twilight and wc lost souls in the hands of fate
darcy the frenchman had been instantly killed when
the prolo struck we others protected in a measure by the
steel roof were only cut up generally by glass and torn
metal injuries which without earthly medical science
might have proved fatal or resulted in lifelong mutila-
tions were conquered by the wonderful surgery of zon-
sainia and ver moti assured us that wc would not bear
a single scar as a memento of the mishap

  each day more of our rubbery wrappings were dis-
solved off until at the end of eight days everyone except
hawkins could leave his bed

  in response to our earnest wishes to help ver moti
finally conductcd us to the headquarters of vera nadji
one-time commander of the battleship her rooms were
located as were the quarters of the crew in one of the
least damaged buildings facing the square

  vera nadji received us warmly wanting to hear about
our escape and considering it to be a joke on command-
ant muot

  then becoming serious she told us more of the situa-
tion the city of kanan capital of the planet of the
-ame name had been completely evacuated some time be-
fore the battle just where these people were-the city
she said housed more than seven hundred millions-no
one knew the kananese land army was somewhere
about but where was a matter of conjecture the prolo
fleets of the two combatants after the first engagement
above the city had vanished into spacc and might be still
fighting

  the last word vera nadji had received was that the
zongainian first fleet had the enemy on the run since
that time eight days ago she had heard nothing the
cloudy sky remained empty the immense city deserted

  the only hope of the crew lay in a damaged hundred-
and-fifty-foot cruiser which was half buried in wreckage
across the square here the technicians and mechanics
from the zongainian battleship worked continuously
chemical blowtorches made the teel and concrete debris
flow like water while the engineers patched and replaced
the machinery inside

  as soon as we were recovered we all went to work
shoveling concrete to make a landing place we worked
almost frantically watching the foggy sky with one eye
and by a sort of mass suggestion praying patriotically for
zongainias success we were so much like ants strug-
gling there in that titanic city its thousand-mile streets
impressed me at least much more than the millions of
light years of the universe

  there is no night in kanans eternal half light and so i
cannot tell in days how long we were there it seems as
though it might have been years but lord hanavan
who alone kept his watch going is sure that this lull if
such activity might be so termed did not last over three
weeks

  at that time the small prolo had been disinterred and
placed ready for operations upon the crude landingway
fuel and other supplies were being rushed in by the crew
and vera nadji with her communication experts was busy
tinkering with the ethero receiving set the remains of
which had been recently installed on board we escaped
prisoners who in the general democracy caused by the
disaster were somewhat privileged characters were in the

lower storeroom forward of the generators and coils pack-
ing tood crates on top of the condensers

  overhead sounded a steady tramping as the crew
crossed the control room with their loads the air in
the little windowless chamber was stuffy and so after
half completing our task we sat down to rest haw-
kins said he wanted a drink and went outside to get it
the rest of us sat for about five minutes talking intermit-
tently about something or other-probably our fate when
vera nadjis crew rejoined the first fleet

   can remember that prof milroy was making some
remark about inscriptions he had found in a half-wrecked
building when utterly without warning there came a
deafening roar and a concussion that burled us and our
crates together upon the floor the prolo seemed to al-
most stand on end for an instant ana then fell back on
its bed for a moment there was utter silence and then
a bedlam of cries and shrieks broke forth we heard
footsteps running back and forth above and some one
shouting that vera nadji was wounded then all else
was blotted out by another blast at a greater distance
it was followed by the slip and thud of falling mnsnnry
and a long-drawn tinkling as of glass we lay for a
few seconds partly stunned by the first explosion and
then lord hanavan shoved a box to one side and scram-
bled to his feet

  another battleship    he started to explain when
a lurch of our craft made self-preservation of prime im-
portance this time however the prolo moved by her-
self a hum from the motor-room told that we were rising

a city of terror

picking ourselves up as quickly as our bruises would
permit we hastened to the ladder leading to the con-
trol room above was a scene of indescribable wreck-
age all of the non-breakable glass from the front
windows was lying in tattered shreds on the floor the
instrument panel was buckled against the partition while
the wind whistled through hundreds of rents in the steel
sheeting about a dozen people were in the room some
of them with blood streaming from open cuts one was
in the navigating seat while others were at work upon
some kind of a gun	

  a mile below were the towering buildings of the city and
almost directly underneath hovered a thousand-foot prolo
as soon as we appeared ver moti his face bloody from
a cut leaped toward us and shouted to bring up a power
cable he made a vague gesture toward the gun and
then below kananese    he added hastily sur-
prised us they are bombing the camp    havent dis-
covered that we are gone yet   

  at that instant another figure appeared one arm held
limply against her body it was vera nadji

  use bombs she snapped at ver moti the auxi-
liary coil is out cant spare power for the gun drop
a kanjrene on them  

  ver moti fell back a pace his face whitened but
he stammered our comrades   

they will have to take the chance if they are alive
yet answered the commander let the kananese know
wc are here we can lead them away from the square 
ver moti left on the run without another word cow-
ering back into the passageway we watched the proceed-

er moti leaning out under the broken window pointed
a small gun down and fired several times sticking my
head from a porthole i saw tiny green flashes on the


wonder stories quarterly

back of the battleship immediately our craft wheeled
and rose sharply while the enemy commenced to ascend
in response to the navigator we swung sideways to take
advantage of the floor propulsion plates and then shot
off at an angle a second after we had started the air
behind turned a brilliant green with bursting projectiles

  now the chase began in earnest the battle prolo
moving ponderously filled the air about us with shells
while it arose from the zongainian encampment the
crew of the small prolo lined up at the windows and re-
turned the fire with their hand guns but apparently
without effect while this was going on i noticed ver
moti coming up from the storeroom with a small metal
case with remarkable care he laid it upon the floor
and took from it a small black bottle

  drawing vera nadji back he handed it to her saying
belter do it soon they may get us any time

  she replied something we couldnt catch and then
began to issue commands the prolo turned sharply
about and started back ascending above the larger ship
with a feeling of horrified anticipation i kept my eyes
glued upon the tiny oval phial in vera nadjis hand
now i saw that ver moti had taken several more from
the box and was passing them out to the crew one by
one he gave each man a bottle and then came over to us

  here he said kanjrene bomb if everyone else
misses throw it wait until the last   

  at that instant the ship commenced to climb again
and vera nadji shouted now from the front win-
dow i saw her arm flash out hurling the little bottle
outward and downward breathlessly we waited as sec-
ond followed second then on the roof of a building
just below the enemy craft a volcano seemed to erupt
an immense sheet of flame leaped up completely enfold-
ing the battleship i glimpsed skyscrapers going heaven-
ward en masse and then the sound wave hit us

  just what happened to the kananese battleship i do
not know we five earthlings who possessed no sea legs
at all landed on the floor en masse too and while we
were picking ourselves up the prolo left the vicinity of
the explosion at a velocity of three thousand miles per
hour later ver moti told us that the enemy craft was
probably melted by the heat kanjrene he said was a
zongainian word meaning bad atom and its explosive
violence was due to the release of atomic energy

  after the destruction of the kananese battleship vera
nadji did not linger in that part of kanan other prolos
were sure to come and then all would not be restful to
the nerves as ver moti put it

  after an hour or so of traveling above the city our
commander ordered a descent made upon a gigantic and
partly-wrecked landing stage surrounded by thousand-
foot beacon towers it lay a plateau of metal and con-
crete a dozen miles long athwart the roofs of a hundred
buildings seen from above we could make out that one
end had sagged downward possibly from the collapse
of some structure below here and there amid the twisted
girders and crushed masonry lay a glittering pond of
mercury spilled from the shock-absorption cylinders

  under the guidance of vera nadji herself we dropped
vertically past the towers and finally more than two hun-
dred feet below the stage floor we settled to rest in one
of the larger mercury lakes it was the ideal retreat for
the repair work we had to do the thick-walled buildings
with their round windows arose on three sides while on
the fourth we were sheltered by the overhanging platform
above almost as soon as the motors were stopped we all
set to work on the little prolo

  a foraging crew was sent out to cut sheets of flexible
plaoo for the torn windows while a marvelous electric

welder did wonders patching up the crumpled side of the
roof no less efficient was the bandaging applied to the
cut and bruised crew the blood was washed off the
wounds expertly closed by the ships surgeon and a syrupy
liquid which immediately congealed to a flexible trans-
parent solid was poured on

cveryone turned to even we outsiders finding jobs
 lord hanavan was soon an expert glass fitter while
prof pfeiffler and i found work feeding flux into the hop-
per of the welder

  the scene is one which will remain long in my memory
the towering steel columns of the landing stage the black
immensity of the abysmal streets and reflected brilliantly
in its bath of mercury-that wonderful machine which
had brought us hither-the prolo over the whole scene
flickered the green lights from the welding machine while
the toiling zongainians cast hundred-foot shadows on the
building walls their low voices and the occasional
clang of metal on metal were the only sounds in all the
city all else was grey silent forbidding

  after seven hours of work vera nadji at the welding
machine gave the command to rest tired and hungry we
crowded into the control-room where food was served
here the first mention of the future was made our com-
mander finishing her gelatine hurriedly stood upon the
navigating chair and spoke her words were calm con-
fident of success

  within a day and a half she said we can return
to the pit we will take on all of our comrades who still
live and then seek the fleet let us hope that zongainia
has given these kananese a demonstration that they will
not forget

  later while most of the crew slept our old friend ver
moti explained in a low voice the cause of the trouble be-
tween zongainia and kanan

  i cannot remember all the complicated reasons he gave
but the basic cause seemed to be trade rivalry property
of the zongainian interstellar transport association had
been confiscated by the kanan government under pressure
of the kanan transport company and demands for rep-
arations met with diplomatic insults the trouble was of
long standing evidently there had been friction be-
tween kanan and zongainia since the first zongainian
space ships had landed there

  that said ver moti between yawns was around the
year  according to the christian calendar ver
moti fell asleep in the midst of a discourse on price wars
between planets but it did not bother us in the least le-
cause we were already far away from interstellar battles
dreaming of a snug little planet that lay in sunny ignor-
ance of the giant universe that lived and fought around
it

  morning brought fresh labors for all while repair-
ing the auxiliary induction coils it was discovered that the
supply of wire was exhausted this seemed a rather in-
surmountable difficulty especially as we had no wire-
drawing machine but vera nadji the resourceful had
the solution in the buildings around and below us she
said was enough wire for a million prolos after some
discussion it was decided to send lord hanavan prof
milrny and myself to get it as we were about the leot
useful members of the crew

  preparations for our departure were simple we were
given wire cutters eleetric light and some concentratd
food for lunch ver moti stopped work long enough to
tell us where to look for wires and then after solemnly
shaking hands with cummings pfeiffler and hawkins we
took our departure

  prof milroy was delighted with the opportunity to be

alone finally he cried rubbing his hands together
 can studv those inscriptions and the buildings what
wc might find inside them what contributions to anthro-
pology oh we shall have a day

  after which he almost fell into the pond of mercury
and so bccame silent for a time

  scrambling over the heaps of debris we soon entered the
nearest building lights on we walked in a line down
a vast echoing corridor which extended ever before us into
the darkness now and then shadowy halls led off to one
-ide into unknown regions but a fear of losing our way
kept us to the main passage

  the instant the prolo was out of sight and sound a cloak
f gloom seemed to settle upon all not a ray of light
penetrated the enormous structure and only the echo of
our own hushed voices disturbed the silence everywhere
the passageways extended like the vaults of a crypt decor-
ated here and there with garish murals of goblins or what-
ver deities the kananese had ahead our shadows
marched while behind the darkness crept in stealth upon
our heels

  whole rows collapsed as if a machine
gun had been loosed on them we con-
tinued whistling

  at first prof milroys scientific ardor made him obli-
vious to all save the decorations and inscriptions on eitlipr
side hut bit by bit his voice became hushed until he
only whispered an occasional monosyllable to one of us

  i tried to imagine the city when it was full of people
but somehow it was impossible the concave floor sug-
gested a sewer inhabited by rats only while the hideous
figures painted  the walls hinted of inhuman horrors
around the corner we tried to concentrate  tli search

 for wire but the eye continually wandered ahead where
 the shadows lied before our lights or behind where they
 came after us to one who has not been in the buildings
 of a deserted kanan it is impossible to describe tire form-
 less terrors which grew upon us

   it was not a fear of death or of the supernatural in-
 deed had a live ghost appeared we would have welcomed
 him as a brother in this far planet it was an unimagin-
 able thing a sort of sinister essence waiting waiting for
 us to descend beyond all reach of the zongainians when
 it would  

my reverie was broken by the voice of hanavan in the
lead a light ahead i think we have passed
through the building as ver moti said

   we hastened on and shortly were standing on a sort of
	wonder stories quarterly

balcony overlooking the street three hundred feet below
it lay tivo wide stone avenues with a canal in the center
overhead the buildings soared perhaps a thousand feet
they were massive things with enormously thick concrete
and stone walls but somehow the entire scene lacked the
mechanized the civilized appearance of zongainias streets
blocks of stone and a canal in the middle no sign of
machines or tracks or any of the appliances of science
which marked the difference between a modern street and
one of rome or babylon one felt that it was primitive
and incrcdibly old

  after spending some time on the balcony prof milroy
found a passage running parallel to the street and separated
from it by a wall pierced at intervals with windows down
this we walked the beam of hanavans light following the
upper moulding we had not gone fifty feet when out of
a side hall there came a thin ribbon of metal covered with
transparent insulation and fastened to the wall with some
kind of glue this we ripped down cut and placed in a
coil where it could be found on the way back then on
again

  the hall descended gradually until after we had pro-
gressed a half mile there appeared a large ornamental
door leading directly onlo the stone paving with a sigh
of relief we hurried into the open away from the gloomy
passage at the edge of the canal were a number of hat
slabs of stone and here we stopped to eat according to
hanavans watch we had been gone three hours and a half

  lunch of zongainian concentrated food does not take
long and so after doubtfully considering the canal wa-
ter we started out with our thirst unslaked about a mile
down the great street there was an intersection where we
could make out a heap of wreckage and a mass of twisted
wire toward this goal wc turned our steps following
the canal once milroy saw a large yellow eel-like thing
in the water but lack of lines or hooks saved it and
once we were all startled by a raucous squawking from
the upper floors of a building we never saw what kind
of a crcaturc it came from

  the distance to the pile of wreckage was much greater
than we had estimated for after an hours steady tramp-
ing it was still quite a way off prof milroy grew tired
and suggested that we try inside the building again ac-
cordingly we entered the nearest door where almost at our
feet we found a big roll of fine wire the ideal thing for
the damaged induction coil after a short rest it was
decided to go straight through the building instead of
retracing our steps the length of the street

  to a sane person this may sound foolish but our ner-
vousness had made us anything but sane our first relief
at getting into the open was now replaced by a fear of
being seen by someone or something hidden in an upper
window-by some queer twist of reasoning we thought
that by keeping to the darkest halls we might sneak through
without being found out whatever it was we could hide
from i dont know for during all the time we had been
in the city we had found nothing alive

  however we entered the structure and choosing a ramp
leading in the general direction of the space ship started
up we marched on for four solid hours thereafter with-
out catching the slightest glimpse of light the hall
now wide now narrow wandered on in a course grad-
ually more tortuous in the walls were innumerable
round locked doors hanavan said they must be the en-
trances to apartments fatigue and a growing horror of
our condition quenched any curiosity

  near the beginning of the fifth hour after leaving the
street we discarded the bundle of wire bitterly we
cursed it and the day we set out on this mad adventure
a little later we came to a halt

  physical exhaustion prevented further walking-no
matter where we were after discussing the question of
sleeping in the open hall we proceeded to batter down
one of the doors in an endeavor to find a reasonable
amount of shelter the door soon gave but when we
entered the chamber we received a terrible mental shock
standing in a group in the center of a round chamber
were four people weazened hideously yellow and all
pointing or making some kind of gesture at us we
sprang back and lord hanavan raised the wire cutter-
our only weapon

  the four made no move-they only watched us with
glittering yellow eyes for ten seconds we stood in the
doorway as motionless as those before us and then hana-
van slowly lowered his weapon we peered closer and
then milroy managed to gasp out theyre dead em-
balmed stuffed the next instant we fairly tore out
of the room and in spite of our exhaustion ran far up the
corridor before pausing avoiding the now sinister
round doors we finally huddled together in a remote cor-
ner of the passage after extinguishing all lights we
lapsed into a fitful slumber broken by nightmares of pur-
suing fiends from dusty burial chambers

chapter xiii

in the enemys camp

t was aroused some seven hours later by prof milroy
- who clapped his hand over my mouth and hissed not
a sound    somethings coming i sat up hastily to
discover by sense of touch lord hanavan on hands and
knees listening for many minutes we waited hearing
nothing milroy insisted in whispers that he had heard
footsteps and a dragging sound and hanavan once si-
lenced us to listen long for the repetition of distant
laughter it never came perhaps it was the creature
which had called in the street

  in any case it was apparent that unless we could soon
escape from these endless passages we would go insane
at first we feared to put on our lights but once it was
done we felt better the hall was empty as far as the
beams would reach

  before resuming the trek we had a short conference
lord hanavan wished to return to the street the way we
had come but milroy and i opposed him there were
too many side tunnels too many forks and besides the
thought of passing that open door and the grisly statues
inside would have deterred us

  it was finally decided that the best course was to as-
rend to the city roof where we could go in a straight
line and find the wrecked landing stage more easily but
how to get there was the question we commenced march-
ing as we talked keeping to those passages which had
some upward slope an hour or more passed this way
when around a corner appeared a light hurrying to it
we found ourselves looking out of a window far above
another street below lay the same wide double stonq
avenue with the sluggish canal in the middle but the
cheering thing was the sight of a broad flat roof less than
fifty feet overhead

  prof milroy essayed a weak cheer and we started again
less than a hundred feet brought us to the bottom of a
ramp at whose other end i could discern the grey sky
we fairly ran up that last passage abreast hanavan
and i smashed the door open and sprang out onto the
roof

  for some moments we fairly capered so great was our
joy at escaping and then we commenced to observe our
surroundings
deyond pluto



  the ramp terminated upon a platform upon which we
stood on three aides it sloped gently down to a flat
gravelly plateau extending a hundred yards lo the nearest
street across that another building roof at the same
level continued mile after mile the roofs extended a
vast plain crossed with chasm-like streets and dotted at
intervals with skeleton-frame towers far away we could
dimly make out through the mist a mass of immense
buildings hanavan pointed to these and said thats
evidently the down town section we are only in the
suburbs

  now that we were comparatively free the next job was
to find the prolo this would have been simple except
for the fact that we had not the slightest idea which way
to go and that the landing stage was nowhere to be seen
hope ran high however so choosing al random we started
along a street toward the nearest steel tower

  hanavans idea was to climb it but after less than a
half-mile we found the route blocked by a cross street
somewhat discouraged we sat down on the parapet and
ate a little more of the concentrated food it occurred
to us that it migbt be a good idea to be sparing some
ten minutes passed when prof milroy leaped to his feet
with a whoop of joy and pointing skyward commenced
a wild dance following his arm hanavan and i looked
up pat a steel tower into the haze and there cruising
slowly in our direction was the prolo crying something
about the visibility of a moving object hanavan started
running toward it in an erratic course i followed first
spitting out in great relief the unpalatable zongainian
food tablet

  the prolo evidently sighted us immediately for it ac-
celerated and dropped lower as it neared us i saw a
door open on one side and several heads appeared sud-
denly i collided violently with lord hanavan he was
standing still wildly beckoning to milroy a hundred feet
ahead out of breath he turned to me thats-thats
not the same prolo    larger    not comprehending
his words i looked more closely at the now near craft
it was larger and of a different design the next instant
it was hovering thirty feet above us and i could see the
faces peering down they were angular    yellow   
foreign looking

  swiftly the ship descended until its landing rail grated
on the roof immediately a dozen men sprang out all
armed with the tiny zongainian small gun in zongain-
ian they cried who are you from what prolo do you
come struck by a sudden fear we could not answer at
first the leader of the party appeared to become angry
and then he commenced to laugh the others joined
him giving vent to a high-pitched cackle

  oh he chuckled you are surprised to find a kan-
anese cruiser above kanan you thought they were all
wrecked or captured by your invulnerable first fleet
ha but you have much to learn the first fleet the
mighty first fleet wont be boasted of much longer and
with that he burst out anew until he fairly wept

  now indeed we knew the fulness of our misfortunes
no sooner had we found our way from the city than we
walked like very babes into the enemys arms

while the kananese were still indulging in their hi-
larious glee lord hanavan addressed milroy and
me in a low voice in english dont mention vera nadji
and the ship or theyll gel them all say that we were
marooned by a zongainian battleship make them think
were friendly  

  the commander attired in a long yellow robe ap-
proached us

  come my friends from zongainia said he you must

not keep a cruiser of the imperial kanan fiong waiting

you ore going to have a rare honor tliat of witnessing tlic

end of your countrymen you shall see the flagship el
zongainian itself crumpled to molten wreckage oh it
will not be long come

  the crew closed in about us and knowing that resis-
tance was useless we followed

  the prolo immediately arose vertically to a height of
many miles affording a wide view of the city and then
proceeded in a horizontal direction he of the yellow
robe approached

  bowing to us he spoke suavely

  may i introduce myself  am ver unkar th im-
nian in the navy of lao refi imperator of kanan owner
of all souls arbiter of life and death and future em-
peror of zongainia have you names zongainians
lord hanavan as spokesman drew himself up and re-
plied you are mistaken we are not zongainians but
unfortunate explorers from another part of their planet
who were dragged into this conflict against our will we
make no cause with them and desire only to return

  the commander ver unkar commenced to laugh
again and then stopped i would not believe you but
for your complexion and accent but you may be right
we shall see when we arrive at our citadel now to the
point we find you wandering like lost shivars on the
roofs you could not have flown there therefore the
zongainians must have left you i judge you dont like
your abductors any too well so tell us all about it
and kanan may return you to your world when its fleets
sweep the universe of zongain scum what have they
done to you

  i had known lord hanavan for an archjeologist and
explorer but i confess that during the next half-hour
he impressed me as being a first-rate actor he de-
scribed our adventures minutely and alluded to el zoia
ver moti and the others in terms that would hardly be
complimentary to them he ended by describing how
we had been ruthlessly cast away to die in order to make
more room on the prolo ver unkar listened sympathe-
tically his yellow countenance expressing a variety of
emotions from anger to fierce joy as we described the
bombing of he zongainian encampment

  when hanavan was through he asked us many ques-
tions bearing upon the size and strength of the first fleet
its system of cruising and of attack and other points all
of which hanavan answered in the fashion designed to
give about all the information on what the zongainians
did not do

  after the interview we were fed a meal more earthly
than we had tasted for many days then we were se-
curely locked in a tiny windowless chamber by ver un-
kar

  as soon as our captors retreating footsteps had died
out prof milroy spoke

  now we are in for it everything we do gets u
farther from any chance of return

  somehow answered hanavan musingly the soft
words of these kananese are more foreboding than the
open threats of zongainia

  prof milroy made an effort to cheer up

  at least we will have an excellent opportunity to
study a most interesting species at close range and
then too we shall eat-which is something you know
he continued warming to the discussion these people im-
pressed me as being mongolian-yellow skin angular fea-
tures  i would like lo study ones skull    and did
you hear them talking among themselves their lan-
guage-it was quite unlike anything i have heard-like
the chirping of birds they seemed to talk on a regular


wonder stories quarterly

musical scale if we could only get a record    my
perhaps it will all turn out well after all

  they seemed said hanavan to have some plan up
their sleeves to finish the zongain fleet there is no rea-
son to favor zongainia but  have a feeling that it wont
improve our chances to have these kananese win i won-
der what they are going to do

  he looked at prof milroy as though expecting an an-
swer but that great savant was busy with a pencil writ-
ing musical staves on the wall and singing scales softly to
himself hanavan ceased his discussing and we proceeded
to take an inventory of the room

  after the passage of nearly two hours there was a
change in the motion of the kananese cruiser it ceased
its forward movement and dropped rapidly for a time
then it decelerated started again moved horizontally
until finally a sharp jolt told us that it had landed out-
side our door were footsteps and voiccs sounding like
soft flutes running up and down arpeggios we waited
as patiently as possible until finally a hum sounded the
bolt was magnetically withdrawn and ver unkar en-
tered he was very businesslike and seemed worried

  you will be conducted to the intelligence bureau-
they will have complete charge from now on he peered
into the room suddenly at milroys musical notation his
eyes opening wide in surprise you speak kananese
he demanded suspiciously

  no milroy discovered that he did not know the
zongainian word for music so he mumbled mathema-
tical game and hurried to our escort in the hall

as we were marched into the control room of the ship
lord hanavan attempting to take a cheerful atti-
tude commenced to whistle tipperary when prof mil-
roy seized him by the arm dont do that he hissed
why

  dont ask me responded the other in the same low
tone but dont sing or whistle our lives may depend
upon it

  led by four tall blue-robed kananese sailors and fol-
lowed by a similar number we descended from the prolo
to the sccrct citadel of the city the craft lay with many
others on the floor of an immense room through whose
roof we had evidently come this chamber which must
have been fully two miles square and eight hundred feet
in height was filled with toiling kananese here and
there weird machines shot sparks into the air but save
for the voices there was none of the noise usually asso-
ciated with a repair place but the voices they were
indescribable it was like the tuning of a vast reed
orchestra or the sound of wind in the pine forest near-
by groups of workers could be distinctly heard tooting
softly up and down the scale to each other but the more
distant voices merged together into a soft rhythmless
music rising and falling in cadences like the echoes heard

in a sea-shell

  for several moments we three hesitated spellbound at
the gangway taking in the sight and sound until our
guard puzzled as to the wait indicated by gestures for
us to move on

  my recollections of the kananese citadel are exceed-
ingly vague i remember that it impressed me as being
huge barbaric and very old the rooms were built of
stone instead of composition material while the more
modem electric wires were glued along the moulding
as hough placcd much inter

  the passages through which we were conducted to the
intelligence bureau were filled with busy men and wo-
men everywhere the place buzzed with industry each
turn unfolded wider vistas of machine shops forges and

laboratories the ancient halls fairly echoed with the pip-
ing of the laborers

  we did not have to wonder to what end all this activity
was directed ver unkars words stood always before us
the first fleet    wont be boasted of much longer
after a quarter-hours walk our escort halted before
an imposing black stone doorway on each side stood
guards with whom the blue-robed ones parleyed after
a pause the door swung open and we were admitted
within was a sort of anteroom whose sole occupant was a
short stocky man in a brilliant red cape as we entered
he swung about and scrutinized us closely he seemed to
start the least bit as his eyes rested upon us and then he
spoke to the leader of the guards in kananese

  another wait the man in the red robe strode im-
patiently up and down paying utterly  attention to us
the eight guards leaned against the walls and chirped
quietly among themselves finally a small door at the
other end of the room opened and the yellow face of a
kananese protruded immediately red robe entered
and the door closed

  hanavan and i sat down on a black stone bench while
prof milroy edged nearer the guard with his ears cocked
twenty minutes passed when the door opened again to
let the man in the red robe out keeping his back to the
door he walked straight toward us as he neared the
bench he held out one hand in which i saw a folded piece
of paper then he spoke in zongainian

  the examiner will see you at once zongain dogs
see that you pay him respect after which lie swept
out the door without another glance but upon the
polished floor at our feet lay a tightly-folded bit of paper
looking sideways at the guards i stood in front of hana-
van-hiding him for an instant-and then we all entered
the door at the far end of the room 

  the interview with the examiner was short and almost
identical as to the questions with that of ver unkar
lord hanavan did all the talking and managed it quite
adroitly but for some reason or other the examiner did
not take kindly to us dressed in a bizarre uniform and
head-dress he scowled more and more darkly and finally
cut hanavan off short

  dont go any further he said you are probably ly
ing anyway so you want to be sent back to zongainia
to tell where our stronghold is you will consider your-
selves fortunate to live-if you do ill take no chances
on spies here

  he laid his fingers upon a little key whereupon the
door opened and we marched back into the arms of the
guards

  ten minutes later we were listening to their fading
footsteps through the iron doors of a small vaulted stone
chamber

chapter xiv
the mysterious message

  he instant they were gone lord hanavan dug in his
pocket for the piece of paper the man of the red robe
had dropped on it was inscribed in angular zongain
characters

  keep courage work is done here for zongainia
watch and listen

  we reread it several times and then milroy commenced
humming in a wandering tuneless way while his brow
wrinkled with thought lord hanavan carefully de-
stroyed the note making some remark about an uncom-
fortable place i contented myself with examining the
chamber minutely
beyond pluto



  the room was constructed of square blocks of grayish
lone and from the worn appearance of the floor had
been in use many years from the vaulted ceiling hung
a single glow lamp whose wiie euleied by the ventilator
dragging one of the benches under this i poked my arm
into it as far as i could reach but encountered only the
stone sides of a rectangular tunnel a gentle draft of
warmish air came steadily in

  after a bit we talked together of kanan of the zon-
painian fleet and of the mysterious man and his note
lord hanavan became reminiscent and described his
house in london his club an elephant hunt in burma
ibe unwrapping of a pharaohs mummy

  prof milroy wound up his watch

  we wondered what dr cummings pfeiffler and the lit-
tle englishman were doing and we wondered who was
going to win the war

  an hour or more passed lord hanavan was yawning-
ly suggesting that we get in some sleep when there sound-
ed a gentle scratching at the door we rose to our feet
by its very slowness the sound suggested stealth we
moved so as to be behind the door when it opened for
twenty seconds the intermittent scraping continued and
then the door soundlessly swung in a head appeared
planced at us and then as quietly the door was closed
in the center of the morn finger on lips stood the man in
the red robe

  wc waited saying nothing the other appeared to be
listening and then breaking into a smile he spoke

  it was rather risky to come here so soon but they
ire suspicious they might move you any time before i
could see you it is necessary for you to know what
to do

  hanavan started to speak but the other cut him off

  i know what you want to say i understand your
curiosity-but time presses you can tell about your-
selves later you are zongainians that is enough for
me listen carefully

  he paused stepped swiftly to the door and then re-
turned to us

  the kananese scientists have discovered a magnetic
beam which has the effect of crystallizing any steel com-
ing within its field it can turn the most highly-tempered
jteel into a mass of brittle crystals in a second un-
known to zongainia the dictator lao refi has had built
a gigantic magnet projector it is their plan as soon as
everything is ready to send a part of their fleet to attack
the first fleet out in space to retreat to the citadel and
drop to shelter behind a magnetic screen then the great
beam will be turned on our ships changing their girders
and steel plates to crystals the prolos will simply col-
lapse

  the mightiest guns the thickest armor will not save
them from destruction not only will the entire first
fleet be lost but el zoia who has come on board the flag-
ship zongainia will he killed the projector is above
the repair shops-it is   

  he stopped suddenly and then opened the door a crack
he turned to the room for an instant whispering

  guards coming the fleet must he warned if i am
raptured    he broke off and darted into the hall with
a soft click the metal door closed

  we had no time to cogitate upon this rather surpris-
ing interview for within less than thirty seconds five
kananese soldiers and an official-looking person with a
black kimona-like costume entered

  i have been sent by the examiner said he sitting down
upon the bench wien our great emperor lao refi
crushes zongainia he will open to your world the boon
of kananese civilization no longer will your countries

remain in the ignorance zongainia has cast upon you
your warring nations will be united under a kanan gov-
ernment we will manage all now the mighty lao refi
does not wish to act without due consideration of his sub-
jects so i have come to learn of the customs of this little
planet that our governor may know whither he goes
after this radier elegant but suspicious introduction he
of the black robe rubbed his fingers together glanced at
the five guards lined before the door and then com-
menced

 you ver hanavan are from the empire of england
 i am from england

 it is the mightiest nation of voya is it not

 one of the mightiest

 and you i understand are among its greatest

 no my title is hereditary

 the other paused regarding the ceiling then   

  would be interested in securing a cross section of
 life in england for statistical purposes may i ask what
 is your average day

 lord hanavan looked annoyed

 i dont understand you he replied

 what do you do when you awaken

 i arise the other glanced sharply at him

 dont be facetious you dress and then order your
 palanquin-

  i he word had to be defined hanavan explained care-
 fully that palanquins were not used in england

 i beg your pardon what does one use in england
 hanavan paused a moment seeking a translation and
 then replied with the name of the small zongainian land
 vehicle-the lokeg the man in the black robe raised his
 eyebrows as though noting something and then visibly
 masking his thoughts he proceeded

 possibly before you order your lokeg you send mes-
 sages across the city by runners to friends or business
 associates

 this time our friend knew the word no i would use
 a telephone

 again the kananese raised his eyebrows his voice be-
 came softer and he leaned forward as he asked the next
 question

 and if perchance the day is foggy your servants light
 candles-	

 no they would turn on the electric lights may i
 ask to what purpose is this interview

 its purpose murmured the other is almost ful-
 filled

 one more he smiled at us in an oily way as though
 pleased with himself

 should you wish to hurry across the waters to france
 you would bargain with some worthy fisherman for your
 passage-

 your question is senseless   started hanavan and
 then at another steely glance from our inquisitor he
 shrugged his shoulders i would buy a ticket on a   
 a motor glider

 at this hastily compounded zongainian phrase the kan-
 anese abruptly stood up

 that is all he snapped come with me

 vaguely alarmed over this odd visit we followed the
 guards down the great hall

 it was soon apparent where we were going for less
 than ten minutes later we found ourselves face to face with
 the now glowering examiner a few words were ex-
 changed in kananese between the black robe and the
 examiner and then the latter turned upon us

 spies liars zongainian snakes he spat out
 you hope to fool us ver iod was too clever for you


wonder stories quarterly

he has been to voya to england only forty years ago
he questions you and suggests things that were done there
two hundred of your years before but you who think
you are wary reply with tales of what may uot be in eng-
land for another hundred years know careless fabri-
cators that there are no lokegs nor motor gliders outside
of zongainia

  know you that the brave iod saw naught but wagons
pulled by animals in england know you that the voy-
ians use mineral oil for lights and not electricity if
you are the best spies el zoia can send then zongainia is
verily a nation of imbeciles

  we listened dumfounded to this tirade it was soon
clear what mistake had been made the kananese had
endeavored to trap hanavan into an ignorance of his sup-
posed native land but because we were forty years ahead
of the england ver iod knew we were suspected of lying
it was no use denying for the examiners crowing
might easily be turned into wrath and in the present cir-
cumstances that was not to be desired lord hanavan
shrugged his shoulders and replied that he depended upon
the righteousness of our cause and the examiners justice

  that person was somewhat mollified by this and in-
formed us that the justice of the noble lao refi and his
administrators was infallible

  no more questions were asked and no information as to
our disposal was volunteered our curiosity did not cover
that topic to the extent of asking possibly provoking ques-
tions so the three of us were marched out of the office
without further ado

  we met the escort in the antechamber they formed be-
fore and behind and out the door we went in the hall
the front half of the escort paused their backs toward us
while tho rear scction was getting out of the door at this
instant i felt someone bump agaist me and a hard cold
object was forced into my hand startled i turned in
time to see a man attired in a dull gray cape vanish into
a nearby doorway without looking at the strange pack-
age i jammed it into my tunic and came into step

  we were taken this lime in a different direction and
to judge from the steady climb somewhere near the roofs
finally we entered a corridor above which sounded the
subdued hum of some sort of electrical machinery odd-
ly one of the guards offered information transformers
for welding machines he said i did not believe him

  the march soon ended in a tiny metal-walled room with
a thick iron door the solid thud of its closing carried
away any hope of escape we were here for keeps

by this time we had become so used to mysterious liap-
penings or rather our senses so blunted that  showed
hanavan and milroy my package with little excitement
it consisted of a curious-looking revolver-like instrument
and the usual roll of paper but this time the message
was of interest

      zongainians whether you are el zoias
    agents or not  do not know but in your hands
    now rests our victory or ruin you are in the
    strongest prison room in all kanan the walls
    and door are of tempered steel guards will
    come with food within one dek then is your
    chance make your tvay to the projector as i
    direct this weapon if you know not its opera-
    tion will throw projectiles twenty to the second
    when the thumb button is pressed i can do no
    more my capture will occur within a ijuartcr
    day at the most  give you my equipment and
    the blessings of meta

  there followed some directions for finding the magnetic

beam apparatus and a roughly-drawn diagram that

was all hanavan examined the weapon for several min-
utes and then placed it on the bench

  its worth the attempt he remarked at least wc
will end up doing something

  at this prof milroy who had been paying little atten-
tion during the last few minutes came to life

  i dont think we will die said he keep that thing
concealed when the guards come  i do believe philo-
logy will have a practical use after all

  our attempts lo get some explanation were met with
an assured if somewhat cryptic shake of the head fin-
ally wc sat side by side on the bench while our colleague
drew staves upon the wall and whistled and hummed in-
termittently

  for two hours we experienced one of those maddening
waits which seem always to occur just before action mil-
roys whistling degenerated to the repetition of an un-
melodious succession of notes while his face bore an ever-
widening smile finally he spoke

  well gentlemen i have it when our friends enter
if you will allow me to  

  there sounded a sharp click wc faccd the door watch-
ing a pause and it swung open

  two kananese entered while three others armed waited
outside evidently the examiner was taking no chances
those who had come bore several covered jars which they
proceeded to deposit on the table without comment this
done both turned toward the door when prof milroy
walked slowly toward them and commenced to whistle
that inane melody instantly the two stopped and wheeled
about milroy continued to the end and after a pause
repeated it with a variation the effect upon the kanan-
ese was amazing their repulsive features bearing what
was very evidently the strongest of emotions all five
crowded into our cell and surrounded milroy he not in
the least embarrassed continued to whistle speaking to
us between breaths in english

  out the door    while they are under the effects   
slam it   when i come  

  realization of what was happening began to come as we
followed his directions the guards stood in a half-circle
about him staring with glassy eyes

mesmerized murmured hanavan by those tones
there was little timo for reflection however for hardly
were we out of the room when milroy joined us he
stopped his solo in mid-note and seized the door quick
before they recover  so

  the massive panel was closed while from within came
the click of some hidden locking device we were free 
in the citadel of kanan

  as we hastened down the hall i confess i was more in-
terested in the way in which our friend had hypnotized
the soldiers than in our predicament hanavan shared my
curiosity though he glimpsed more of the truth than  but
prof milroy gave but the briefest of explanations be-
tween hurried steps he told us

  musical scales and progressions seemed to be the basis
of their language and from the fact that a solitary person
would make these sounds i inferred that their entire tem-
perament was based upon tonal sensations in a word
that their thoughts were made up of sound instead of the
pictures that cross our minds and that emotions are to
them simply tonal progressions    did you notice how
the examiner chirruped when he was angry

  so i concluded that any desired emotional state could
be induced merely by the right tune as it were the prob-
lem became one of determining that tune fortunately i
have had plenty of time to listen and observe the rest
was only a matter of working out their psychological
scalc tho progression i used upon those guards con-
beyond

sisted in alternate dominant sevenths and parallel minors
and induced the condition of surprised immobility a state
vciy convenient to us

  thats your masterpiece sheridan exclaimed hana-
van the last word in interpreting foreign languages its
too bad the royal society cannot hear about it

  suddenly prof milroy in the fore halted finger on
lips we were at the end of the straight corridor ahead
it turned sharply to the right and ended within fifty feet
in a tall metal door

  listening a confused patter of feet and a distant piping
of voices was heard evidently beyond the panel lay one
of the busy streets of the citadel after vainly trying
to locate a keyhole through which to peep we held a
council of war

           chapter xv
           milroys music

a ccording to the chart which we now studied closely
for the first time it was necessary to traverse that pas-
sage for nearly five hundred feet our course marked by
a red line now branched left through a series of cham-
bers each marked with a small red triangle surrounded
by three dots  the zongain symbol for danger at the
end of the third chamber was the representation of a spiral
staircase and the word unalt-up here was another of
diose little triangles-what they meant we could not
guess but that caution was intended we felt no doubt
beyond the stair was a short passage marked pass con-
tact - - - and above that a circle with the
word magnet

  the directions seem complete enough i ventured
but how did he expect us to pass this hall

  shoot our way through replied hanavan or per-
haps overpower and change clothes with three kananese
excepting that it is rather doubtful if fate will present
us with three alone   too bad we locked those guards
in

  suddenly milroy sprang up

  i have it he cried delightedly why use force when
there is an easier way dont forget their achilles heel
all that is necessary is to induce a state of catalepsy and
kanan is ours

  by jove mass hypnotism  

  exactly i have been thinking  the effect of a
single note might be much increased if we could contrive
to sound a chord  

  an hour and a half later after about the oddest prep-
aration for a battle that i can think of we opened the
metal door to the hall for an hour prof milroy had
covered the walls with musical notations and had whistled
and hummed and perspired finally he wrote on three
staves an eight-measure harmonization and we like a bar-
ber-shop trio put our heads together and whistled until
each part was memorized

  weve got them now chuckled milroy in triumph as
the door opened

  however hanavan kept the gun ready

  the view that met our eyes as we stepped out was a
familiar one the passage some eighty feet wide and half
as high was crowded with hurrying kananese their
ceaseless piping ran like the gurgling of a brook at first
we stood unnoticed on the threshold of the corridor and
then a man stopped peered at us intently and began to
back away his voice raised in a quavering siren-like call
instantly all other sounds stopped the rolling current

pluto	

of humanity abruptly halted and a thousand faces were
turned upon the causc of the disturbance

  there was a moment of utter silence while their eyes
sought us out now was the chance like the leader
of a church choir milroy waved his hand-one two and
we began during the first measure there was no re-
sponse and an odd tingling sensation went wandering
down my vertebra forming my lips with difficulty i
continued another measure passed i saw that the ex-
pression of those nearest the door had changed their
eyes seemed glazed one rocked slightly on we went
into the first variation then results some one in the
front row sagged limped to the floor another raised
hands to face staggered back a yard and toppled at
once they began to fall everywhere whole rows col-
lapsed as if a machine gun had been loosed upon them
before we had half finished our piece the entire audience
was unconscious with a sign prof milroy ceased

  old sayings illustrated he remarked stepping care-
fully over the recumbent bodies  behold the audience
after the musicale 

  as may be imagined it did not take us long to cover
the distance to the side turn around the next bend
could be heard a mounting volume of reedy voices raised
in excitement as the ceaseless traffic came upon the van-
guard of the unconscious with a fearful backward
glance we hastened into the first of the small chambers
marked with the danger sign

  hanavan ahead pushed open the narrow door and
stopped he whistled in surprise and entered my
word just look at this

  we crowded after him and then halted too before
us was what was evidently a guardroom for there were
stacks of weapons against the wall but the guard lay
every man jack of them in sweet repose upon the floor

  prof milroy was gleeful danger number one dis-
posed of eh if we only had a public address system the
war would be won

  stopping only to pick up an assortment of small weap-
ons we hastened on toward the second room from which we
could already hear a powerful hum it was separated
from the first by a similar door but the instant we opened
it we realized that trouble was at hand

  pausing together at the entrance we peered into a long
chamber filled from end to end vtith electrical apparatus
glittering coils of a greenish metal great cubes of crystal
and sheet silver and a maze of switches electrodes and
circuit-breakers turned the place to a veritable steinmetz
nightmare from the farther end came the flickering blue
glow of a mercury-vapor rectifier while seated beside it
was an elderly-appearing kananese the hum of the
transformers had evidently drowned out our psycholo-
gical trio for the instant we stepped into the room the
old man was on his feet and reaching up to a switch

  ready queried milroy he raised one hand to stait
the music when the kananese acted

  down came the big switch and at the same instant with
a crackling roar a curtain of flaming electricity descended
before us shrinking back against the wall we soon found
the origin of this display along floor and ceiling were
rows of ball electrodes from which leaped hundreds of
arcs interlacing joining and breaking until they formed
a lacy sheet of electricity completely across the room to
even approach it meant sure death while as we suddenly
realized the continual roar prevented the thin sound of
our whistle from being audible to the little man beyond

  for a moment we seemed defeated we could not use
the gun for even if the guardian were killed his fiery cur-
tain would remain

 a minute passed and then before our eyes the
 craft commenced to crumble it was weird

will be at our backs wilhin a few minutes and in a half
hour the first fleet will be in the range of the projectors
we might try to sing very loudly suggested milroy
one can hear the whine of the transformers plainly
through the screen

  hanavan shook his head no he said they are
much louder    absently he twirled a dial im-
mediately the tone of the transformer changed pitch
rising to a high whistle like a siren startled he spun
the little wheel in another direction and was rewarded
by a prolonged howl from the apparatus across the room

  frequency control he muttered and was about to
leave it when prof milroy sprang forward

  frequency control lo them but our salvation
  what what do you mean

  controlled pitch play our notes on the transform-
er as effective as whistling give me five minutes
and this barrier will be gone

  it was considerably less than- five minutes when prof
milroy was ready paying no attention to the clamor
of voices from the guard room behind us he seized the
dial and after a few preliminary howls from the coil he
commenced to broadcast

  the little old man at once began to take interest i
watched-my heart in my mouth-waiting for him to
collapse but he did no such thing instead he stared
at us for a moment nodded his head with vigor and
reaching up shoved the big switch back into place in-
stantly the electric wall vanished our path was clear to
the end of the room making sure that his hand was
far enough from the swilch hanavan and i hastened
across the chamber where the kananese was smiling at
us in the friendliest manner

  grab him commanded milroy we did so encoun-
tering no resistance milroy at once left his dial and
hastened across the danger line he had hardly reached
us when the whole demeanor of the kananese changed
the smile on his yellow face turned to a snarl and he
commenced to struggle

our colleague regarded him a second then pursing

his lips he whistled softly the prisoner relaxed gave
a soft squeak and tumbled from our grasp onto the
floor

  come reminded milroy time presses

  at the farther wall of the instrument room was a nar-
row portal beyond which lay the spiral staircase leav-
ing the unconscious guardian heaped in his chair we
began to climb and milroy explained

  it would have been of no use to hypnotize him so i
tried another tune it merely caused the feeling of ex-
treme affection for the universe in general and us in
particular a sort of love song as it were of course
the effect ceased with the music hence the lullaby
from above came a vibrant hum its intensity increas-
ing with each turn of the spiral it suddenly occured
lo me that the sound came from the magnet projector
that that machine was already in operation against the
fleet we increased our pace

  we had ascended some five hundred steps when the
top appeared it consisted of a small chamber less than
six feet in diameter roofed over with a spherical dome
on one side was a two-foot panel of blue stone in which
were imbedded a hundred or more copper disks other-
wise the walls were of seamless metal we stood for a
moment staring blankly when hanavan the sheet of
paper in his hand peered more closely at the metal but-
tons

  there is a character cut on each one he cried he
looked at the paper speaking his thoughts aloud pass
contact - - -   

  now i noticed fastened to the wall above the plate two
metal spikes connected by three feet of shining copper
cable for some reason in this emergency our minds
worked more rapidly hanavan seized the pins and
cable while prof milroy pencil in hand studied the
panel in a moment he checked two of the disks after
a pause he found another pair and marked them and
almost immediately located the last two numbers given
in our directions hanavan following them up pressed
his two spikes firmly against the contacts there was a
	wonder stories quarterly

snap of sparks while overhead i heard a click next
he connected the sccond pair of disks with the same re-
sult now the last two the steel points were jammed
into the copper we waited a second when silently half
of the circular wall commenced to rise through the
opening crack beneath came a hood of bluish light while
the hum of electric machinery became overpowering
moment by moment i caught a widening glimpse of glit-
tering steel of dials and switches of coils and insulators

now the door was fully open gripping the little
zongainian gun lord hanavan led the way into the
chamber beyond

  we entered a room more than two hundred feet square
its walls were composed of vertical columns and plates
while a hundred feet overhead was a cylindrical roof
resting on wheels we gave but the briefest of glances
to the room for our attention was immediately focused
upon the towering mechanism that occupicd its center
that we were looking upon the great magnetic projector
itself there was no doubt mounted upon a massive
crystalline stand it resembled nothing more than a huge
earthly telescope  save that the core was built of thou-
sands of laminated iron plates and coils of wire

  standing before the switchboard at the base of the in-
strument were a dozen men with their backs to us even
as we looked one of these pulled out a switch a hollow
rumble sounded above we glanced up to see the whole
ceiling sliding sideways beyond was revealed the dull
gray sky of kanan but in it were prolos-hundreds of
them-dropping slowly past us far above its remote
crescents passing out of our field of view was a gigantic
armada of space ships thousands upon thousands   
sweeping magnificently down upon the last stronghold
of kanan

  involuntarily we thrilled at the sight and then our
attention was attracted to the group at the switchboard
one was talking in zongainian

  will they not be surprised    whats left of them
he laughed and their fool spies i would that they
might be standing here now so they could see what hap-
pens to those who oppose   the kananese had
turned around and now he was facing us his eyes wide
in amazement and fright his yellow face slowly whiten-

e others swung about at his silence instantly one
made a motion with his hands there was a sharp crack
and a dim vision of a bluish spark lord hanavan in
the lead gave a sharp cry and staggered back raising his
gun at the same time again the kananese fired and
then hanavan found the trigger button there was a
crackling rattle and the group of kananese seemed to
literally explode before him in a cloud of smoke and
flying bits of metal they ran a few steps only to fall in
that merciless hail explosive bullets-the zongainian
gun fired explosive bullets suddenly the barrage
stopped hanavan was leaning against the nearer wall
his face white and drawn he held out the gun take
it    make them    turn magnet    upon kananese
he closed his eyes as i took the weapon

  but now our attention was focused upon two who had
escaped the general slaughter these poor cowering
wretches were on their hands and knees wailing what were
evidently pleas for mercy in their own tongue prof
milroy without pausing whistled a few notes and pointed
through the roof to the kananese battle prolos now di-
rectly overhead i backed him up with a suggestive
shake of the gun

  i do not know which was the more potent but under
the combined influence of the gun and milroys hypno-

tism the kananese returned to the control and focussed
their dreadful telescope until it was bearing squarely on
the center of the nearer fleet milroy inflexible gave
the command the power was turned on a score of
huge tubes flickered with a blue radiance white six-foot
coiis on the magnet glowed red a strange thrill passed
across my body  the magnetism or was it but a ner-
vous state

  tensely we waited eyes glued upon the gray fish shapes
above a minute passed and then before our eyes the
craft commenced to crumble it was weird the slowness
with which those giant living monsters turned to shapeless
clouds of wreckage one by one they changed lost
form and merged into one mighty rain girders armor
plates guns and liny specks that might have been men
fluttered endlessly down down to the roofs minute fol-
lowed long minute until we discovered that the sky was
empty again save for the distant crescent of the zongain-
ians we blinked unable to realize that the kananese
imperial fleet was gone    wiped out in a dozen min-
utes by their own weapon

  for hours it seemed i remained staring through the
roof at the empty gray sky and the swarm of the first
fleet moving infinitely slowly toward the citadel i do
not know how long  would have remained thus had not
i caught the image of a shadow moving swiftly in front
of a dully-radiating coil the next instant i looked down
and my eye met that of one of the kananese who was glar-
ing with a deadly malevolence at me and slowly raising a
slender metal rod

  milroy must have seen him at the same instant for he
gave a sharp cry of warning automatically my thumb
found the button of the barrel of the gun the kananese
threw himself forward and up and vanished into a haze
of smoke now i saw the other man running crouched
low toward the instrument panel i started to shift my
aim when with a last great leap he reached his objective
the next second a glare like a lightning bolt flashed out
instantaneously i saw the kananese silhouetted against
the coils one hand grasping a shattered tube his body
completely encased in a gauze of sparks then dark-
ness punctured by leaping blue flames  a crashing
roar of loosed fury  a dim vision of arcs playing up
and down the length of the magnet and then with a
splintering sound it toppled ponderously majestically

   shattering girders and lesser pieces of apparatus it fell
crushing into ruin half the chamber and bringing down
with it the hopes of imperial kanan

chapter xvi

homeward bound

cor a moment we stood motionless in semi-darkness
and then without a sound lord hanavan collapsed
to the floor we ran to his side when from the still open
doors came voices running footsteps the stairway we
had forgotten the stairway

  prof milroy with rare presence of mind seized the
gun and ran to the door after hauling hanavan out of
the zone of fire i returned to his side as i arrived the
voices rose to a sharp crescendo flinging the door wide
prof milroy turned his weapon downward from be-
low there sounded a sharp strangled cry followed by a

ernlonged and horrible sereaminjr his face ashen and
is body rigid milroy held the weapon until the metal
steps collapsed for thirty feel then he snapped it off
and closed the door

  he gestured toward hanavan

  dead
beyond pluto



  without waiting for an answer he listened for a heart
beat he arose in relief still going  no sign of a
wound   he shook his head as though trying to
clear his mind and then walked unsteadily in a metal
bench where he slumped down

  for several seconds i remained standing at hanavans
side attempting to collect myself beforo i remembered
the fleet

  half fearing to find it gone  looked up through the
open roof it was stttl there so near that only its cen-
ter could be seen it drove downward silently ominously
hank after rank of thousand-foot battle prolos endless
columns of smaller cruisers myriads of gnat-sizc bomb
droppers all drawing together upon the exposed en-
trance to the kananese workshops and citadel

  even now the magnetic ray should have been at work
destroying the armor and steel beams of those ships
somewhere the kananese commanders the examiner and
the emperor were waiting and wondering at the silence
perhaps not knowing yet what had happened

  suddenly i realized what it meant zongainia would
bo victorious  we would he rescued  we could
return   

  all thoughts were stopped at this instant for with a
blaze of colored lighting and a shattering blast of thun-
der the first rank of the attackers opened fire

  prof milroy leaped up at the sound without with-
drawing my gaze from the roof i noted a light blinking
rapidly upon a side switchboard that was the kanan
military staff calling for help

  now the very floor was shaking with the impact of
shells and bombs the zongain fleet had changed di-
rections it seemed to me circling and dropping grad-
ually lower green bursts of flame in the sky showed
that kanan could still retaliate but as the minutes passed
these became rarer and rarer

  ship after ship passed over now they were scarcely
a mile away a bursting shell threw a shower of cement
and glass through the roof as we scurried for the alcove
where hanavan lay milroy shouted in my ear one of
those is coming here any minute if we dont leave
soon   

  i gestured toward the unconscious archaeologist but
milroy was busy across the room with a little oval door
he shouted something over his shoulder inaudible in the
din and the door opened revealing a tiny round chamber
returning to me he cried elevator  to the roof   
at my look of dismay he returned stairs gone must
signal    only way   help me with hanavan   

  another avalanche of debris decided us half carry-
ing half dragging our friend over the crumpled remains
of the projector we managed to enter the elevator where
milroy by some marvelous intuition pressed the right
starting button the door clicked shut bringing the
thunder of the battle to an abrupt stop and the car rose
swiftly milroy sat heavily on the floor and held his
head in his hands his whole body physically exhausted
was giving in spite of his heroic will

  we have about one chance in it that they will see or
recognize a signal he murmured but we    with
a jolt the elevator halted another door opened and the
tumult of the attack drowned further human words

  we were on the roof in the shadow of one of the steel
towers and overlooking the entrance to the kananese
stronghold but what a change had taken place the
entire roof had fallen in the camouflage was off while
a half dozen kananese prolos cornered in their own pit
were fighting their last battle

  the first fleet had gathered in a circle about the place
where it hovered motionless from each prolo there

poured a veritable stream of projectiles undei nhuse re-
lentless impact the structures of the city crumbled like
eggshells flames licked the edge amid billowing mass-
es of smoke while ever and anon a whole building quiv-
ered and uprose with some internal blast the work-
shop floor where we had landed was buried many feet
deep by the wreckcd roof and the riddled hulks of prolos
there seemed to be hardly a dozen kananese ships left
and some of these even lay disabled on the floor still fir-
ing tighter yet grew the ring of the first fleet that
the end was near was apparent

  i became aware that milroy was shouting inaudibly at
me i took a step back when without warning the roar
ceased

  a crowd of echoes yelped for a moment and then si-
lence    utter deafening by its very intensity descended
a line of red flames flickered quietly across the pit some
masonry fell with a light clatter i looked at milroy
what is it     he did not reply again i turned
my eyes upon the pit

  i hf kananese prolos were rising silently each toward
a zongainian craft dimly i made out lines of minute
things that were men filing out of the buildings into the
open for a moment smoke blotted out the scene mil-
roys voice small and distant and bell-like broke the still-
ness

  they arc surrendering    giving up  it is all done
abruptly he sat down tried to speak and then crumpled
in a heap on the steps

  suddenly i realized that we were invisible here that we
must signal i shouted and waved my arms then seeing
the futility of such signs seized the gun and turned it upon
the pit again and again it crackled until i saw a prolo
turn toward us in a moment it was overhead faces
looked out not the sickly yellow masks of the kananese
but the round tanned features of zongainians i attempted
to shout to point but the effort was too much the uni-
verse leaped in circlcs about me and then blackened i
felt myself falling arms about me    voices    move-
ment    darkness

  meta ela meta in this word there is no defeat
meta ela meta these words uttered in zongainian by
a resonant bass voice heralded my return to the land of
the living to my opened cyrs there was disclosed a low
steel room its floor covered with pneumatic beds and
prone men a faint hum came from somewhere  en-
gines i raised my head to look for the speaker when
the voice came again    from a small black box at one
end of the room

  word has just been received from the flag ship that
lao refi emperor of all kanan has surrendered person-
ally and is now aboard the zongainian  

  at this there arose a babel of conversation from the
other occupants of the room now i noticed that all wore
the molded bandages here and there on arms and legs
another glance about the room convinced me the steel
walls and floor the faint vibration of electrical machin-
ery all pointed to one conclusion we were in the hos-
pital room of a zongainian battleship

  the patient on my left turned on his side and said to
me he thought he was going to retire on a pension after
making a mess of the job of emperor but el zoia had him
by the neck when tlie people and the army found they
had to choose between losing an emperor or having the
city bombed they rendered him up in a hurry ha but
this is the day for el zoia

  seizing upon the first thing that came into my mind i
asked what prolo is this

  brought in unconscious    this is the zongainian


wonder stories quarterly

  where are we

  i cant tell within a half light year but we arc some-
where on the route to zongainia

  my heart gave a sudden leap zongainia the
earth we were going back

  i lay back on the pneumatic bed and listened to the
voice from the loud speaker it evidently came from
zongainia broadcasted across the universe by a ray a
thousand times faster than light as i listened a sense
of unutterable repose and comfort came over me the
voice continued

       the country is waiting only for the coming of the
flagship zongainian and the fleet to celebrate the victory
the people are already swarming about the government
ethero station for a first television glimpse of their be-
loved el zoia ver menisto has crowned his career as
statesman and scientist by a military achievement of the
highest order   

  is he on the ship i asked el zoia i mean

  yes

  i lay back again i wondered why no one approached
my bed why this wounded soldier spoke as though i were
but a comrade whywe had not been sent to the com-
mander-and then suddenly the truth dawned upon me
picked up in the turmoil after the fight dressed in zon-
gainian garb tanned by the sun of egypt to a betel brown
we had been placed unrecognized among the thousands of
wounded to be returned home my breath came faster as
new hope grew within me glancing about i soon made
out the forms of prof milroy and lord hanavan turn-
ing again to the man beside me i atlempted to make con-
versation

  which prolo were you on i asked

  the voya v he replied i was carrying ammuni-
tion when we got it    tore the whole side out of the old
voya i thought we were all through but the city roof
broke our fall i was conscious all the time one of the
first landing parties from the ahtz  believe picked us
up

  he scratched his bandage and then looked at his
wounds through its transparency

  those landing expeditions were all failures he re-
marked before we went down  saw the munitm-
drop three thousand in a street i dont believe half of
them ever returned

   he regarded the ceiling meditatively but at that instant
a number of men and women evidently doctors entered

i lay back on my couch again wondering if i would be
recognized shortly after i fell asleep

  more than a week measured by earths time passed be-
fore hanavan milroy and i could le called well our
illness was nervous rather than physical and such i gath-
ered could not be treated so speedily however we were
given every comfort and recuperation came rapidly to-
ward the end of the week the ward was almost empty of
patients and wc had all the privacy we could desire for
planning

both lord hanavan and his friend had had the same
idea as i if we could mix with the  odd mem-
bers of the crew there was a possibility-the barest pos-
sibility-that tic might make our way north out of the
country to the sobat thence on a raft to civilization
if cummings and pfeifller and the englishman were pri-
soners on board we might contrive to free them too
otherwise all we could do would be to bring back a res-
cue party from england an army division if liecesaaiy
and force the zongainian dictator to give them up oddly
we still thought of zongainia as a beautiful but half bar-
baric cuunlry even after what we had seen of its

strength lord hanavan who had once been a colonel
in india never thought of the military strength of zon-
gainia in terms of a prolo fleet over london

  after the passage of a week more or less we were pro-
nounced ready for duty prepared beforehand we
duly told that we were members of the landing party
from the muniun- lost on the roofs after being reg-
istered under names made up beforehand we were as-
signed places as inductor-men in the engine room
and as far as the zongainian stafl was concerned we were
cared for

  owing to our position in the center of the prolo we did
not for a long time comprehend just how huge the zon-
gainian was naturally we avoided asking suspicious
questions but while off duty prof milroy rummaging in
the engineers ollice found some rather astounding data
the zongainian had a beam of eight hundred feet a length
of  feet and weighed on earth some seven million five
hundred thousand tons its normal crew was  it
had  -inch rapid-fire guns and  five-inch guns
its armor plating was four feet thick and its engines de-
veloped a horsepower of three hundred millions

  our job during the fifteen or more weeks of the return
voyage was that of caring for two of the immense induc-
tion coils that supplied high-tension current to some motor
the coils were more than thirty feet in length and by
their proximity to our sleeping quarters kept us con-
tinually charged with electricity within the first five
minutes hanavans watch became magnetized and stopped
milroys long fine hair stood out like an aura about him
making a really excellent electroscope

  our quarters consisted of three trough-like berths one
above the other in what might be termed the starboard
dormitory five thousand men slept there occupying
the berths in rotation and it was necessary to be out im-
mediately the first gong sounded to make room for an-
other finishing his six-hour shift food was rationed out
at the beginning of each shift and we ate on duty when-
ever we were hungry consuming both the gelatine and
the package in which it was issued

  upon several occasions we caught glimpses into the
main power room of the craft but a limited scientific
knowledge prevented any comprehension the place was
vast hundreds of feet square and high and filled with
titanic electrical apparatus-coils-condensers-fifty-
foot vacuum tubes whose glow cast weird reflections on
the ceiling

  as nearly as wc could understand the purpose of all
this apparatus was to generate electric current of a certain
frequency and wave form which when sent through ranks
of mineral crystals caused electromagnetic impulses creat-
ing a sort of interference phenomenon with gravity   

  we ate and slept within a five hundred-foot area and
not once during the whole trip did we catch a glimpse
outside

  all things must end however-even this interminable
voyage day by day the bulletin board in our sleeping
room announced a smaller velocity and a shorter distance
to cover before we should reach the earth our fellow-
workers talked now of the coming landing of friends par-
ents wives nr husbands of homes we three in our
turn became animated by a great excitement which leaped
higher as the news came that we were inside neptunes
orbit-a n r it was termed on the bulletin board after
the suns astronomical name alf nueri

  uranus and saturns paths were crossed during the
next day without sighting them jupiters orbit was
passed at a distance of two hundred million miles from
that planet then we decelerated five days among the
natcroids at marc fifty million miles from tho earth
beyond pluto



an escort of some thousands of prolos the asteroid pa-
trol met the first fleet in common with a number of
the other engineers we went to the windows for our lirst
 iew of the sun

  it was very disappointing the sun dull in comparison
to the other giants of the universe glowed beneath
cher to one side a tiny ruddy full moon gleamed-
mars and far below a silvery blue star of intense bril-
liancy attended by a dimmer companion lay the earth
we looked at it too filled with emotion to speak about
us the crew shouting to each other danced and laughed
with joy

  after we had returned to the sleeping room lord hana-
van drew milroy and myself toward him

  landing in zongainia he said in a low voice
wont automatically mean walking up the steps of the
royal society once we leave the ship we will be on
our own in a city and country almost as unknown as
kanan one slip may mean capture that every one
will be rejoicing will aid us somewhat but we must be
careful    our immediate course can be decided by
where we land if it is in the city of imperium it will
be very difficult if we descend in the northern city-
andorks-we will have only a short distance to travel to
the valley    the basalt cliffs    the nile  

  others of the crew entered the room at this instant
and all conversation ceased

  it was now only a matter of hours until we should
land weight increased abruptly as deceleration was
raised up tfib great hallway toward the control sound-
ed voices    running steps orders to stand by our
coils and switchboards came from above vague shift-
ings and movements betrayed the maneuvering of the
prolo as it approachcd its landing place we waited   

  then deceleration increased once more a faint whist-
ling echoed from outside the atmosphere then our
motion seemed to slackcn we moved forward stopped
again a long pause ensued and then a sharp tremor a
metallic thump orders appeared on the ground-glass
signal screen shut down power

  the hum of the generators slowed like the descend-
ing whine of a score of sirens the massive motors were
turned off voices sound up the hall the sharp hiss of
air and a breath faint but unmistakable came down to
the engine room we sniffed long and then laughed
idiotically at each other it was the fresh tangy breeze
from the lake we had landed the voyage was over

chapter xvii

the mysterious stranger

and now i come to what is one of the strangest parts
of our whole adventure a half-hour after the zon-
gainian had docked we with about four thousand more
refugees from other ships were disembarked and told to
report to the prolo shops at andorks next day we
marched down an enclosed gangway and onto a balcony
we paused for a moment confused and then remembrance
flashed upon us we were overlooking the imperium
landingway from the very walk where a half-year ago
we had been led to our prison ship but what a differ-
ence there was now

  then we had been helpless prisoners confused com-
prehending nothing of the language not knowing whether
we would see another day dawn now we stood attired in
the uniform of the zongainian navy masters of the tongue
and as it turned out heroes in the eyes of everyone with
m crowd of some two hundred others we marched down
the hall and into the main lobby of the great interstellar

depot in this immense room which measured more than
seven hundred feet square milled a vast crowd of people
colorful in their light costumes cheering wildly and
throwing zongainian confetti in the form of iridescent
bubbles of some sort upon the column of returning sol-
diers

  through a lane in the crowd we went and so out upon
the street

  here also were uncounted thousands of people extend-
ing between the towering buildings as far as the eye could
reach dazzling beams of colored lights flickered back
and forth from spotlights on the balconies and music
strange throbbingly triumphant and beautiful floated
down from nowhere from the steps of the depot we
caught a momentary view of the whole spectacle and then
still with the main body of soldiers we descended and
were swallowed up in the mob it was not difficult to
make our way down the street for unlike european crowds
the zongainians were courteous in their excitement

  one by one our comrades dropped off going to their
respective homes before reporting at andoiks until finally
we three found ourselves late in the evening on the out-
kirts of the zone of celebration about us the buildings
were lower while the glass ceiling had ended some blocks
back overhead it was cloudy the colored lights of the
city were reflected back like an aurora once we caught a
glimpse down a long avenue of the white tower arising
an incredible distance and bathed in rainbow hues and
ouce in the midst of a turmoil of music from a square we
were startled by a familiar piece of earthly music-liszts
second hungarian rhapsody

  there were fewer people here and they seemed intent
upon getting to the central area as soon as possible step-
ping into the arcade of a building we took a moment to
discuss further movements now that we were actually
back all our former assurance departed the city of im-
perium which had seemed so unimportant when die uni-
verse lay between us and the world now assumed vast pro-
portions we suddenly realized that we had a hundred-
mile hike ahead of us before we could even leave the in-
habited area of the country and then without sufficient
clothing or shoes and with only the little zongainian
rapid-fire gun which was hardly suitable for game we
would have to make a four thousand-mile journey down
the nile

  we might go on to andorks with the rest suggested
prof milroy and have a seventy-mile start

  unfortunately we had no idea as to the point of embark-
ation indeed i doubt if we could have found our way
back to the landing-way we dared not ask questions and
feared that an attempt to walk the streets all night might
result in arrest or whatever was done to vagrants in zon-
gainia

  rapidly now courage oozed out we were as lost in im-
perium as a hottentot would be alone in new york city

  as conversation lagged i noticed a man standing at the
sidewalk railing which overlooked the street proper and
who was regarding us steadily i nudged hanavan and
indicated the watcher for a moment we looked in si-
lence and then hanavan murmured we must not let him
know we see him we may be suspected  we may be
breaking some law    he stopped abruptly and i turned
about the man had left the railing and was walking
toward us in a leisurely manner we crouched back
into the doorway horrified my heart leaped i looked
up and down the street but escape was impossible the
other doubtless had weapons 

  hanavan whispered bluff it out we have a chance
yet i essayed to brace myself up with sorry results
luckily the shadows hid our faces
wonder stories quarterly



  in a moment the strange zongainian was at our side
  from the fleet he asked pleasantly

  hanavan nodded adding the zongainian

  the other was agreeably surprised

  has anyone invited you for the evening he inquired
next

  hanavan paused uncertain as to the answer finally
he said no

   well that will be fine replied the other apparently
well pleased with twenty million families looking for
one of you returning heroes as a guest at the celebration
you are rather at a premium he paused i have
apartments in the sixteen meriot building my private
car is on the street below if you will   

  wc would i was cold and damp with perspiration
from the reaction as we descended to the street and
climbed into the orange-colored vehicle

  without a sound the stranger started his machine and
we were soon moving at a rapid pace toward the white
zongainian tower

  as soon as we were under way the driver turned to us
my name is ver anul 

yute hastened to introduce ourselves by the dames
   given on board the zongainian

  ver anul then proceeded to ask many questions about
the war about the seige of kanan and the ease with which
it had fallen

  it is a matter of much wonder to the government i
hear that the emperor allowed-literally invited-the
first fleet to defeat him and therfc have been reports
that some strange accident overtook the greater part of
their fleet however a commission has been appointed
to investigate the matter their findings may be an-
nounced tonight

  a pause followed and then hanavan very carefully
began asking about the celebration ver anul however
did not appear surprised and talked all the rest of the
way we gathered that there would be a ceremony in
the largest auditorium in the city which broadcasted
through telephone wires would reach everyone in the
country as well as the three hundred thousand in the hall
ship commanders and soldiers were to receive decora-
tions the terms of the treaty were to be read and ver
menisto the all-conquering el zoia was to make a speech
before the ceremony we were to have lunch in ver an-
uls apartment further explanations were cut off by the
arrival at the apartment building

  ver anul shared his suite with another man and three
women all unattached business people who lived together
like a happy family sharing parlor bedroom and bath
each had a soldier guest for the evening who kept us in
the background by their conversation about the war din-
ner the usual jellies and thin wafers and sour liquid
was soon over ver anul with profuse politeness es-
corted us to a chute and handed us the little metal guides
it was no time to back out so with averted faces we
dropped off one by one the chute ended in a sort of
station where one could enter the cars of the pneumatic
subway our host indicated a car and entered after us
twenty or more people were already there reclining on
tiers of bunks that made the place suggestive of an amer-
ican pullman car

  we were in the car scarcely five minutes when it halted
and everybody hastened out we found ourselves in a
vast square under the open sky and facing the facade of
a great building glowing windows three hundred feet
high stretched for two miles on either side while a glimpse
of moonlit water beyond showed that we were near the
lake the square was covered by an immense crowd

  which must have numbered hundreds of thousands but
ver anul knew his way for he pushed through to a small
door near the main entrance showing a round ticket of
some kind to the doorman he pushed in

   reserved he explained in the first row of seats

  he must be important whispered prof milroy in
english i wonder why he picked us up hanavan
shrugged

  the next second we passed through a short corridor
into the auditorium i was prepared for something huge
but the size of this room was simply overwhelming its
ceiling hung with heavy curtains was more than six hun-
dred feet overhead while the floor extended over two
miles back seated upon the floor and the mile-wide
balcony was the audience-three hundred thousand peo-
ple

  at the nearer end of the hall was a large platform oc-
cupied by a number of seats and by a device we surmised
to be amplifying apparatus for the speakers directly
behind this hung a white screen almost four hundred feet
square whose purpose we could not guess

  ver anul went at once to a vacant bench where we all
sat he spoke to a number of other men and women
nearby and they i noticed glanced at us with interest

  the first few rows of seats in front were separated
from the rest by a light fence in this space gathered a
thousand or more people all evidently officials of the
government or officers of the fleet several hundred other
soldiers in their tunic-uniforms and light capes took seats
across the room

  after a short wait all the lights dimmed and went out
save those on the platform a spotlight from the micro-
phone stand illuminated the speakers seat a few mo-
ments passed during which the vast assemblage became
quiet and then a figure whicli i immediately recognized
as el zoia ascended to the platform as he stepped be-
fore the microphones a brilliant light wrs projected on
the mammoth screen and standing more than three hun-
dred feet high a clear colored picture of him appeared

  every movement every feature must have been visible
from the farthest end of the hall a murmur arising from
the audience died down the tiny figure on the platform
inclined his head followed exactly by the image above
and then his voice amplified a million-fold sounded from
behind the screen

  his talk was short and concerned itself with anecdotes
and descriptions of the campaign in spite of our limited
knowledge of the zongainian literary tongue we could see
that he was a born narrator within five minutes we had
completely forgotten our situation and were entirely en-
grossed in his charming talcs

  after an hour of this he introduced a short bearded
man the first such we had seen in zongainia who was the
commander of the first fleet this man whose name i
believe was ver loxus throm complimented the officers
and personnel of the fleet and introduced another-nat-
ional secretary is the nearest english translation of his
title who discussed the economic results of the war then
the dictator took the platform and called up a dozen or
more prolo commanders to be decorated with a silvery
cloth headdress not unlike those worn by modern arabs
murmurs of approval from the audience greeted each
decoration next some fifty officers were awarded scarlet
hoods for exceptional bravery and one spoke into the
microphone and televisor ver anul leaned over and
whispered in my ear

  the big event of the evening has not eomo yet it will
be a   surprise

i made little of that remark and attributing it to my
ignorance continued to watch the proceedings for per-
beyond pluto



haps an hour these decorations were given out and then
li zoia took the stand

  we now conic to llic presentation of the hood of elu
meta the highest honor possible to a zongainian soldier
which tonight will be given to three of the crew of the a if
sueri for bravery in the face of danger unvarying tena-
city of purpose and devotion to their country their
names will be engraven for all time in the memory of
zongainia for having saved her fleet from destruction
their names are lord mitchell hanavan of england
prof sheridan milroy england david lawrence united
states

  the murmurs of the audience broke into a roar of ap-
plause which drowned out even the loud-speakers we
lay back upon the bench amazed stunned ver anul
seized milroy and me by the arms and cried

  is up go up to the platform hes waiting   

  we staggered forward unable to think and blinked into
the lenses of the televisor i became conscious that el
zoia was speaking to us of gigantic figures upon the
screen that were our own of a continual thunder of voices
from the hall and of a gold-colored hood being placed
over my head and then our minds reeling we were liter-
ally carried off the platforrn and out of the side entrance
while three hundred thousand people yelled madly for
three escaped prisoners who had just been recaptured

           chapter xviii
           homeward bound

the mental reaction from the events of the past few
hours kept us in bed until noon of the next day i
doubt if we could have slept at all save for the gaseous
sleeping potion blown in through the ventilator as it
was however we got a good dose of slumber-the best
thing possible after what we had passed through

  i awoke first quite without memory of what had hap-
pened i was lying under a glass panel frame like a
counter in an american store this enclosed bed for
such it was was one of six in a big square room flooded
with sunshine from windows and a skylight

  outside lay a wide formal garden a small lake and be-
yond a mounting range of forest-covered hills my mind
still groping i sat up and nearly cracked my skull  the
ceiling of the sleeping compartment at this jolt recol-
lection came in a flood the landing at imperium   
the strange man who had picked us up in the street   
the auditorium  i held my head between my hands for
a moment suddenly my attention was attracted by a
muffled shouting and thumping startled  looked into
the next bed in which lay prof milroy tangled in the cape
he still wore shoving and pushing at his enclosure

  seeing that  was awake he made motions indicative of
escape and gestured toward the other bed-cases i now
observed that each contained a slumbering figure who-
ever they were they had not awakened at this moment
prof milroy found the mechanism opening his bed and
the top rose like a jackknife bridge allowing my comrade
to roll out on the floor his first act was to direct me by
many gestures and shouted phrases to pull down a lever
inside causing the glass case to open the next instant i
stood beside him

  his first words were an exact echo of my own thoughts

  in heavens name what has happened where are
we

  i	shook my head on earth thats sure in zongainia
awaiting deportation probably

  milroy walked to the window at least he murmured
we can get another glimpse of the old world look a
butterfly

  i	ran to his side to see a wave of feeling swept over
me as i looked out trees grass clouds birds and in-
sects the golden light of our own sun for minutes we
stood silently at the window absorbing through every
pore the warm sunlight and the familiar earthly beauty
of the scene

  finally milroy turning away with an effort pointed
to the other beds

  who are they he asked of the empty air hana-
van   

  we hurried to the nearest inside was a short stout
figure lying on his back and gividg vent to snores audi-
ble even through the sound-proof case-prof pfeiffler

i	rushed to the next case-yes there lay cummings sleep-
ing quietly his face somewhat tired-looking milroy
ahead of me cried out that he had found the little cock-
ney hawkins and in the farther bed lord hanavan
was just in the act of awakening it can be well imag-
ined with what impatience we three waited the awakening
of our companions

  what had happened to them after we had left the dis-
abled prolo  our ill-fated search for wire had they
been transported here on board the zongainian did
they know how we had been tricked into coming to the
celebration that tiia mysterious ver anul was an
agent of el zoia we had no doubt now how long we
had been watched could not be guessed hanavan tried
to open dr cummings bed but could find no fastening
outside we must wait

  lord hanavan went to the window where he remained
for several minutes before turning to us

  no escape there he mused theyre watching we
can be sure of that our fate i guess is in the lap of the
gods

  el zoia you mean muttered milroy the gods
havent a chance here

  well in any case we arc going to see dunsaan again
or a more distant place he paused to watch a hum-
ming bird outside you know  cannot understand yet
his reason for last night el zoias  mean he was so
utterly unemotional such an action seemed contradictory
to his nature he may have a love of the dramatic a
sort of grand gesture before the execution to impress his
subjects

  from behind there sounded heavy footsteps a voice
deeply melodious never-to-be-forgotten rang out in eng-
lish

  i may have to deport you yet gentlemen you seem to
know too much about me

  we spun around in front of the now opened door he
stood attired in a white tunic and cape hands on hips
and beaming on us as if immensely pleased we re-
mained silent

  in your land he continued stories usually end hap-
pily i trust this one has

  hanavan found his voice it has ended

  first installment replied ver menisto to be con
tinued

  prof milroy now spoke you seem to know about
the magnet projector in kanan

  nothing mysterious there prof milroy my agent
whom you saw told all about it

  so you allowed us to work our way back on the zon-
gainia thinking we were unknown  

  precisely he pointed to one of the beds i be-
lieve our learned deutscher has awakened    prof
pfeiffler we spent many a delightful hour on the return
trip his zongainian  he speaks with such an odd
accent but i learned a great deal of zoology


wonder stories quarterly

pfeiffler sat up blinking and then raised the glass
    case

guten lag mein herr menisto veil und here iss all
der rest uf der oxbedition he stood up stretching
dot vass a vine bardy ve had last nighd vasnt id
now cummings was awake he climbed out said good
morning to el zoia and laughed at our stupefaction

  your friends explained el zoia shared my suite on
the zongainia we became quite well acquainted

  for some twenty minutes we talked thus telling exper-
iences describing impressions for all the world as though
in hanavans london drawing-room we were complete-
ly carried away by el zoias informal manner

  we walked out upon a white stone porch overlooking
the garden the wide valley and in the remote distance
the city of lmperium which lay far below and to the
south about us lay a magnificent villa-palace rather-
of white stone-like material six floors high and covering
acres

  this explained ver menisto is my regular home-
when i am at home we are in the province of palata-
recognize the latin in palata and lmperium milroy and
those mountains mark the northern border of the country
he paused hanavan filled the breach we have
been wondering for some time as to the-the disposal
which will be made of us we   

  of course he replied and i have my mind quite
made up on the subject your greatest desire is i imag-
ine to return to your world

  we did not answer hanavan stood at the railing
looking at the slender spire of the white tower in the dis-
tance some small birds of an iridescent green fluttered
on the balcony

  i have been studying you carefully continued el zoia
you are scientists semi-civilized men of konor i und-
erstand your thoughts of returning to dunsaan or even
of remaining under compulsion here and so perhaps
because i am not utterly unemotional or because you
might escape anyway i am going to send you back your
word of silence will be enough you have worked well
for zongainia and as soldiers of zongainia you are re-
warded

  he stopped for a long moment we all remained in
silence then lord hanavan spoke

  we give our word that was all

  ver menisto hesitated for an instant then his entire
manner changing he cried cheerfully

  well now that that matter is settled we might spend
the rest of the day seeing a little more of zongainia i
have a small prolo here and we ought to cover most of
tfie country before sunset

  i can remember little of the afternoon we soared for
hours in the tiny open flyer sometimes high sometimes
skimming the surface of the lake now that our minds
were no longer occupied with worry the beauties of the
country were more apparent a wide basin containing
the capital and the lake and flanked by three rich valleys
constituted with the magnificent mountain mass the main
topographic features of the region

  here and there the plain was colored by cities while
silvery roads ran in geometric lines in the extreme clar-
ify of the air on the plateau every detail could be made
out buildings streets the odd streamline ground vehicles
aid the monorail trains like the one we had first seen on
that dv so long ago el zoia navigated the machine him-
elf pointed out cities and rivers like a veteran tourist
guid

  finally late m the afternoon we descended to the roof
of the tower    the same landing crew helped us out

and in the office below the same secretary bowed and
ushered us in

  ver menisto now telephoned using instruments quite
out of sight and made arrangements for a ship to carry
us away

  no use to send you on a three thousand-mile trip
he explained we can land you in london in an hour

  as sunset approached we supped in the office of the
delicately flavored gelatine and the bitter drink for
some reason the food seemed better than before possibly
because it was the last meal we would eat of it there
was little conversation el zoia in a corner confined
himself to brief answers to questions the rest of us
overlooking the lake and the mountain watched the sun-
set-so like that on the eve of our coming

  finally the meal was through in response to some
orders given without our knowledge an attendant en-
tered bearing six complete suits of clothes secured i can-
not imagine where it is difficult to describe the effect
these heavy dark things had on us i had a disagreeable
sensation of putting on a straitjackat as i struggled
with the shirt and collar after twenty minutes to ef-
fect this change a voice on the telephone announced that
the prolo was waiting ver menisto ascended with us
to the roof

  i believe i will go with you he remarked if it is
foggy at london we can drop you at hyde park

  we climbed aboard the engines hummed a higher note
and the prolo arose effortlessly from the roof the last
gleam of light had vanished from the mountain and the
yellow afterglow of the sun was fading over the western
hills overhead the sky glowed a deep blue while in its
depth an occasional star shone steadily el zoia saw
us watching and pointed

  a n     venus you would be interested    an
unique world  

  as the velocity increased the city slid ever more swift-
ly beneath us its luminous streets gathered together un-
til they took on the semblance of a giant spider web the
mountain a dull white now fell away on the right
ahead a sombre dark plain extended north the jungle
the desert egypt    england 

  somehow as the lights of zongainia vanished one by
one i felt a regret a vague wish to stay longer to see more
of this land in the darkness of the cabin visions of the
world the old familiar world of houses and street cars
and noise and rush became clearer i began to recon-
struct mentally the broken thread of my existence cut
so suddenly    was it only six months ago cum-
mings and i would go back to new york and write up
our paper on metaphom rock deposits of north africa
there would be questions to evade curious acquaintances
to avoid inconsistencies to cover up about those six
months

  it was now completely dark only the thin wail of the
upper atmosphere told that we were traveling more than
eight thousand miles per hour above glittering in a
velvety black sky lay the universe were these stars
real yes they were real enough for beneath our feet
the steel floor of the prolo vibrated with the powerful
motors real now but i felt that they would soon van-
ish into nothingness with the prolo after we had landed

  the hour passed quickly a reflected gleam from the
crescent moon told of the mediterranean miles below
and then the prolo dove downward into the thicker air
the whistle of the wind increased and gradually a dim
orange glow appeared in the mists ahead

  thats old london all right said milroy in a shaky
attempt at humor look at the fog

  suddenly we decelerated out of the vapors came the
beyond pluto



outlines of buildings towers and a vague confusion of
traffic arose the spectral shape of the parliament build-
ing passed close dull and squatty beside the white zon-
gain tower and then branches scraped against our run-
ners leaves whipped past the window and we had landed
some one opened the door and extended the ladder gang-
way

  hurry dont want to be caught by a bobby whisp-
ered el zoia

  we descended to the damp grass a gentle rain was
falling we waited in the doorway above el zoia stood

his white garment shining in the glow from a distant street
light

remember he cried softly when you want to come
back zongainia will welcome you   

the prolo swiftly arose and    good-bye he
raised his arm to wave and then the trees blott- d him out
a slight breeze rustled the foliage and the mist wet our
stiffly pressed suits for many minutes we stood as men
in a trance and then pfeiffler said

      the end

some day the moon

     by robert friend

 some day the moon with wings of fire
 will dart into the sun

 and there will be no smouldering pyre
 to mark its spot when gone

 the years will roll by one by one
 into the shrivelled past

 and suns and moons their travels done
 will sink to rest at last

 oh puny man may ask the why

 and ponder time away

 but still the moons and suns will die
 and still the man will say

 from out the darkness of the years
 the stars and worlds were bom
 from out behind the trillion spheres
 a light came that is dawn

 and time will come when dawn will fade
 into the glooms of night   

 the why  god-i am afraid  

 the dawn-oh give me light

epilog to the rubaiyat

         by j z howard

at least one solemn moment every eye
has gazed into the tantalizing sky

and marveled vainly at those twinkling points
whence unseen eyes fling back the futile why

if one could leave this little earth and soar
at will along the vasts mysterious shore
should he the riddle of the world resolve
nay but return more baffled than before

upon the farthest spheres should he not find
quaint living things perturbed by dawning mind
peering and puzzling on the universe
as helplessly as those he left behind

    plea to science fiction

             by don fernando

 	take me away from the humdrum of life
 away from the toil of man

 for i would roam the universe
 to learn whaleer  can

 for i would solve the mystery
 of sun and moon and star

 of comet and of meteor

 and learn just what they are

 and i would ken the myth of time

 and far-flung future scan

 and steamy past when lizards huge
 ruled all where now is man

 and id go back a billion years
 to view earths primal stuff-

 vast glowing clouds of flaming gas-

 a cosmos in the rough

 and too id play with forces huge
 that god alone should know

 the universe would all be mine

 and planets homage show

 until at last when gone quite mad
 id have a devils fun

 id seize the planets one by one
 and feed them to the sun

 and i would peer with musing gaze
 as world-stuff fed the flames

 and all that man had loved or feared
 lay molten in the blaze

 and when all of this was neatly done
 the magazine id drop

 and view with sharp dismay my watch-
 good lord its twelve oclock

exiles of mars

 the radium world etc

the sun sank slowly down beneath the crest oi razor-
backed hills is last long rays spilling out over the
desert in a golden flood of light great piled dunes
of scarlet sand took up the faint crimson beams and cast
them back and forth in flashing cascades of eery bright-
ness    they faded vanished night sudden and com-
plete dropped with soundless speed over the desert over
the edge of the distant hills the rac-
ing moons of mars swiftly rose
spilled pale light down over the
sand a faint wind came and
brushed along the dunes with light
fingers whispering   

  armiston made a savage motion
of despair and tore his eyes away
from the bleak scene his hands
clenched hard at his sides whitened
knuckles showing through brown
skin he turned walked away
from the huge lassite dome-port set
like a great round eye in the smooth
black metal of the tower wall

  his glance swung over the stark
bareness of the tower room the lit-
tle stellite-glazed table the five
stiff-backed metal-bound chairs
the narrow record-cases ranged
along one wall stacks of film-spools
faintly glimmering in the dim light

all of it sterile and

dead as the desert out-
side typical of the
grim reality of the
tower station sole
supply of the eca-ra-
dium that was mans
greatest weapon in the
never-ending fight
against cancer four

 armistons eyes
caught the straight
taut figure still stand-
ing befcide the great
dome-port and tight-
ened with sudden bit-
ter anger

  good god r gl
quit standing there
with that accursed grin
of yours you cant
-like this i cant
stand much more of it
myself oh damn it

its driving me-com-
pletely mad a little
more and ill-

 the older man
turned sharply from
the lookout port sud-
den concern in straight grey eyes the little smile of fas-
cination that had crinkled up his long firm lips vanished
into a half-frown he came over to where armiston was
sitting slumped in a chair head on folded arms his
hand caught armistons shoulder in a grip that made the
younger man wince

  cut that bob come out of it youve got to be a

 af all the solar planets mars is perhaps the
 most intriguing the pictures we have of it
 -as a great desert alternating with spells of tor-
 rid heat and frigid cold-make of it a place where
 stirring adventures may take place

   the climate of mars may give rise to strange
 forms of vegetation and stranger animal life and
 when we come in contact with such life much fur
 will fly

   the present story is original for it pictures no
 interplanetary war and no attempts at world or
 even planetary conquests it deals in fact with
 the brute struggle with nature with such elemen-
 tal things as thirst and disease and back of this
 struggle in which a handful of men represent civ-
 ilization we find all of the best qualities in man
 his bravery his fighting will his willingness to
 sacrifice himself for his race such qualities are
 those that have always been developed in pioneers
 as mr kelly points out in this absorbing story



man  think i know how you feci-but its too late now
old fellow you should never have come here i realize
that it was a mistake all around why did you
armiston raised his head slowly met the grave eyes
he shrugged shoved back drooping shoulders

  i was a damned fool r g a fool it was a woman
of course in korna i thought i loved her- thought
there was nothing left for me after
she-tired of things  nothing ex-
cept this so i volunteered they
wanted one man they took me
weber nodded gravity masking
pity in his eyes a queer pale-
white scar along the line of his jaw
throbbed a little as at a vague dis-
tant memory  he said quietly
his hand on armistons shoulder
i see im sorry bob i wish
there was some way i could-send
you back but i suppose you know
that once here  always here
the bitterness and despair came
back behind armistons eyes i
know thats the hell of it good
god the things monstrous to
let us sit here-rotting why do
they condemn us to this its in-
human

  no weber said unwaveringly
his voice like a bared
sword

  it is very human
bob it is for all hu-
manity-on whatever
world it may be you
know why we are
here  have you ever
seen a case of cancer
four then you
know what im talk-
ing about eca-ra-
dium sealed in cap
sules of entonium-iso-
tope is the only hope
once youve got-it
somehow the radiation
of the eca counteracts
the slow destruction of
tissue caused by the in-
fection    with eca-
radium you live with-
out it you die-an
undescribable death

  thats why were
here bob just four
of us the council
would condemn no
more to certain death
and no more arc need-
ed with the equipment here and the guards to help us   
you understand bob

  yes armiston said slowly his eyes queer yes   
what happened to the man before me

  weber looked at him he lost his grip tried to get
away they caught him before hed gone half a mile 
do you want me to tell you any more


wonder stories quarterly

  no arraiston said quietly no i understand
what you mean-perfectly

  weber looked at him eyes grave and direct i hoped
you did i wouldnt want anything to happen his voice
died

  armiston straightened made as if to speak again but at
that instant a bell tinkled musically in the wall behind
them and a panel slid back into smooth metal revealing
a square of smooth vibra-screen a mans face sprang
with startling suddenness out of the vague shadows-a
narrow acquiline face with grave luminous dark eyes
queerly outlined against a strange-shaped head covering
of crimson metal fabric the man spoke his voice husky
greetings r g you twore on come down on car
v- number s cut off for a while council orders
they want everything we give them-and more i think
somethings up

vvteber nodded slowly his face grave a sudden un-
 easiness rose behind his eyes at a brief thought and
was crushed down what have you been running ta
the other glanced at a narrow strip of metal fabric tape
in one black-gloved hand ninety tubes ac- per min-
ute other stuff running all the way up to two hundred
things must be bad-back in korna

  yes they must be

  weber nodded again the tense lines in his face deep-
ening he shuddered remembering the carnage of the
epidemic of cancer four three years in the past i
see cut off well be right down

  the other waved a hand in an affirmative motion cast a
single hard searching glance at armistons white face
and cut off the screen darkened the panel slid down
into the wall again

  armiston forced a tight smile i saw that too r g
you neednt worry im not going to crack up-for a
while yet

  weber grinned his face underwent a queer change in
the process breaking up into little fine lines and furrows
the white scar dissolving in a luminous glow he looked
queerly human

  thats the talk i like to hear from you bob lets
go while theres life theres hope

  yes armiston said with a queer twitching of his
mouth yes except here

  weber said nothing more they crossed the room to-
gether pressed a stud in the polished metal of the wall
a panel opened soundlessly before them revealed the soft-
ly lighted interior of the lift car

  they stepped in together something mechanical made
a soft purr and the panel closed the car slid into silent
motion they sank swiftly downward

  at the bottom a second panel opened from the smooth
wall of the lift shaft-opened into a narrow air-tight
box of a room lined with doubly-lhick coatings of black
insulating-metal ungainly metal fabric suits lay on

ac- the tubes of ocn-raillum were in varying sizes ranging
from one hundredth of a cram up to nine-tenths ac- then
indicated tlmt the tube contained nlne-tcnths of a gram of
eca-radium ac was the chemical symbol adopted for eca-
radium

cancer four-the disease was so called because it was be-
lieved to have originated on mars fourth planet of the solar
system infection by it meant a slow inexorable tearing-down
of the body tissues resulting in a lingering death terres-
trials wero especially affected

insulating-metal an alloy of metal isotopes of lead and zinc
the suits worn by weber and armiston also were made of
this material which was the best-known protection against the
deadly short rays released in the process of breaking down
tho atoms of element  into eca-radium the red color of
the head coverings was caused by the addition of another
metal which rendering the masks translucent was adapted
to the face no known metal completely shut out the in-
cessant torrent of short waves

narrow benches against one wall beside them perfectly
fitting masks of dull crimson huddled shapelessly

  armiston and weber climbed into the suits in silence
slid the scarlet masks down over their heads buckled con-
nections fast-then surveyed each other through the trans-
lucent substance of the red metal fabric they looked like
a pair of weird metal monsters hooded over with the scar-
let masks

  weber went to the vibra-tooth inset into the opposite
wall and angled for visual connection with ta-rigo the
man who had summoned them from above presently he
answered from a dim-lit booth in the cavernous vastness
of the generating room he showed long teeth in a white
smile he made a motion brought his sister ona into
view for a flashing instant then waved gaily at weber

  all well r g come out

  inexplicably but as always armistons body was shak-
ing a sudden revulsion swept over him o god how ho
hated all this and now-to go out into that hell of
monstrous industry for another gruelling age of dull un-
ceasing torment he couldnt stand it-he couldnt

  beads of cold sweat broke out on his face coursed in
little rivulets down past his chin    then suddenly he
glimpsed just for an instant the bravely smiling oval of
the girl onas face-and fear left him was crowded into
the dark corners of his mind if this little martian girl
could stand it he could

  weber pressed a stud in the thick metal wall of the
room a great panel opened before them disclosed a nar-
row box-like chamber triply reinforced by layers of the
black metal-the entrance-lock together weber and
armiston stepped into the lock the panel closed silently
after them

  after a brief instant the wall before them seemed to
fade away and the two men crossed swiftly over the
threshold of the lock and found themselves standing on a
narrow cat-walk staring down into the room of rays  

  armiston stared as always with a fascinated wonder
already his body trembled to the dull aching impact of
swirling vibrations his eyes swept over the dim tower-
ing masses of whirring clicking machinery they ran on
to banked rows of super-photocells silently storing in vast
reserves of energy from the sun-mirrors spread in mighty
network on the desert above they leaped along coiled lines
of condensers and gently whirling drums and clicking
motor switchboards-and found at last the things upon
which all this vast activity was centered the ray tubes

  great towering masses of fused quartz ranged in two
great ordered circlcs about the central generating chamber
the tubes lanced upward giant-like into the dimness of the
huge rooms roof constant flame the white coruscation
of  volts bridged the gap between the glowing
hot points of huge stellanium electrodes leaped out in
narrow while fingers toward the thin metal shield guard-
ing the tubes farther edge they poured a scintillating
cascade of power over into the central chamber of the
whole vast system-whirling electronic streams bombard-
ing with terrific force the heavy atoms of the cctoranium
in the center of the chamber

a ll that vast outpouring of energy gathered from the
sun-mirrors on the desert above into the photocells
intensified by the battering action of the tubes pouring out
upon the great block of dully gleaming blue-green metal
that lay in the middle of the central-chamber-pure cctor-
anium element  broken down by the titanic action of
the electron stream into precious pools of eca-radium most
valuable derivative of radium

  slowly trickles of glowing white liquid dropped down
from the great block of metal flowed sluggishly out
exiles of mars



through narrow vents of triply-braced zinconium into
narrow tubes of crimson metal

  laboring robot arms came down from the dim bulk of
nearby machines they caught the tubes sealed them
white-hot thrust them swiftly into the openings of repul-
ion-tunnel to be caught up into the never-ceasing stream
of tiny projectiles hurtling half across mars to the re-
ceiving depots of korna there they would be shipped
by tube and helicopter and rocket-liner to the massed cities
of the federated worlds-strong allies in the incessant
war on cancer  dreaded scourge of the solar system

  a sudden thrill rocked armistons soul for one delirious
instant no man gave better service to the worlds than
these four bitter exiles who labored here in the subter-
ranean pits of the rays submitting uncomplainingly to
the slow rotting death of ray-infection weber the chief
-ta-rigo-ona-and now armiston four names
known and revered the system over

  in a sudden glow of vicarious martyrdom he swung
down the catwalk by webers side took his place beside
the older man at the great central-control towers that
looked out over the vast room he was even able to wave
gaily at ona as she passed him tired and pale going
down to the entrance lock    the girl smiled back tremu-
lously and armistons heart was suddenly warm then
she was gone   

  monoton   dull aching monotony throbbing with
the intangible creeping menace of fingering short rays-
sitting before the complex winking vastness of a huge
switchboard strapped to the hard metal of a seat-held
down helpless    only able to reach out tired metal-
gloved fingers and fling a switch over at the warning of a
scarlet flash pull it back at the winking glow of emer-
ald green   armiston felt himself slowly going mad   

  weber sitting three feet away from him eyes fascinated
by the creeping clicking thundering sobbing rhythm of
the great mechanisms scattered over the room each one a
smoothly-working cog in a vast hole    weber brain
afire with a queer sensation of uncanny ecstacy realized
that the rays were conquering him that slowly inexor-
ably they were eating through the thinner protective cov-
ering of crimson metal over his head fingering down sav-
agely into his brain sending him an unmistakable warn-
ing of-death   

  he wondered if after all these years of this he was
going mad    what did the martians call this vast bleak
desert whose heart held the room of rays en-o-dah-
en-o-dah the desert of lingering death   

  he glanced across once at armiston and sat up sharply
deep alarm behind his eyes

  armiston was slowly cracking-breaking up under the
constant onslaught of the rays even though his time here
was measured in days and webers was in years   
something-hed have to do something about that   
why was it so hard to think why did his brain feel
weighted with lead barely able to move with creeping
thoughts he knew and fought frantically to keep from
succumbing to the insidious madness that lived in him
more depended on him and on armiston than saving their
own lives three worlds called unceasingly to fight the
unseen uncanny menace of cancer four  if he failed
now and armiston went down in madness   

  he shook his head sharply to clear his brain reached
down and unstrapped himself from his control-board
glanced down once at the quiet surface of his switch panel
and hurried across the narrow catwalk between the con-
trol towers

  his metal gloved fingers closed hard on armistons
zinconium-the insulating metal

shoulder he shoved his face down close to the younger
mans

  come out of it you snivelling fool youve got to
stick i wont lei you go mad you dont get out of
things as easily as that if youve got an atom of guts
in your filthy body 

  thats enough r g armiston said through white
lips he waved a hand feebly go on back im-right
as rain now it-just comes on me in-waves gone
now get-back

  weber stared at him a minute eyes focused in a long
searching glance then gave his shoulder a fierce grip and
was gone nothing else happened on their shift after
that   

  a bell rang in deep sonorous tones suddenly its throb-
bing sound reaching even through the hollow thunder of
the machines in the great room

chapter ii
the coming of the vandal

  a rmiston started forced moist lips to split into a
thankful tight-lined smile shift over hours and
hours now of rest and comfort and thinking    that
was the worst-thinking   

  he rose stiffly stared out over the room eyes fastened
on the narrow platform jutting out from the outward face
of the entrance-lock the panel opened two black-clad
crimson-hooded figures came toward them laboring up
spidery lengths of metal ladder clambering close   
ta rigo and ona stood presently beside them panting a
little ta rigo waved a gay hand nothing seemed to
affect this tough-skinned keen-witted little martian but
the girl looked tired

  how goes it my friends   still-ninety r g
weber nodded gravely he was himself again-master
of the insidious fear that lived in all of them

  still ninety im afraid somethings up in korna
ona you look tired let me take the first half of this
watch you go on up with bob

  the girl flushed indignantly forced stiff lips to move
in protest no no i am not tired at all-really i
cannot let you do this for me-r g

  it had been long weber reflected queerly since she had
called him that-never after armiston had come he
smiled at her gave armiston a little push

  get on-both of you its not the first time ive taken
double watch-is it ta old friend

  the lithe martian grinned looking at him affectionately
indeed not i am afraid r g that you and i are a bit
too tough to kill it will take more than-this to do
that i tnink go on ona

  the girl glanced from one to the other of them hesi-
tating

  armiston moved forward a little glance pleading
please ona

  the girl shrugged laughed a little shakily three
against one-what can i do i will go

  armiston caught her hand the two of them climbed
past weber and the silent martian vanished down the nar-
row ladder reappeared again below weber and the mar-
tian watched until the panel of the entrance lock had closed
behind them

  then a single silent glance of understanding passed
between the two men and both turned as one to their
switchboards-from which neither had really relaxed his
vigilance while watching armiston and ona

  armiston said in a low flat voice ona i am afraid
i think i am going mad  
	wonder stories quarterly

  he did not look at her they were in the tower room
again sitting opposite each other at the little metal table
the girl looked at him with wide softly luminous eyes
her thin hand came out and touched his fingers pressed
them in a warm soft grip

  i know bob i am afraid myself-always who is
not-here even r g is a little afraid i think   the
brave man bob overcomes fear

  armiston raised his head and looked at her for the
firt time he really saw her as she was saw the slim proud
litheness of the small body the acquiline intelligent little
face the luminous eyes the glorious crown of sea-green
hair 

  thats so he said slowly dully thats so youre
brave ona more than brave    beautiful have you
ever heard that word before it is an old word in earths
language but i like it it fits you

  she looked at him queerly met his straight glance with
fascinated half-troubled eyes am i really-beautiful
bob

  you are he aid softly and closed his big hand over
her small one you are-really  i love you ona
she drew back from him abruptly sudden livid terror
in her eyes you should not have said that you must
not say it there is no room for love-here bob   
there is room for love-everywhere armiston said
and came around the table he caught her in his arms
a long moment was given them of close satisfying em-
brace an ecstatic breath of happiness in a place of sor-
rows-the first bit of happiness that austere room of
metal had ever looked indifferently upon and the last

  the soft tinkle of a warning bell separated them ar-
miston frowned impatiently and would have swept her
back into his arms but the girl shook her head slipped
away she went to the wall where a panel was swiftly
opening

  the vagueness of the vibra-screen cleared away van-
ished slowly the image of the caller showed on the little
glowing square    there was no face there was sim-
ply a half sphere of glinting white glassite through which
was dimly visible a gently throbbing mass of grey jelly-
like substance the whole mounted on an ungainly
tripod-shaped metal mechanism capable of swift move-
ment upon the flexible metal tentacles it called legs a
metal man one of the increasing thousands beginning to
throng mars-once a being of flesh and blood now a great
brain mounted on metal it was the last desperate re-
source of a dying race a brain lives very long and
consumes very little food and moisture   

there was a bright-glinling object inset into the
stark whiteness of the head dome and armiston
suddenly recognized the thing as m- commander of
the guard of metal men that surrounded the tower sta-
tion-for protection against the hordes of desert van-
dals the grey mass of the exposed brain quivered
and the vibra-screen blurred and shook armiston had
the uncanny sensation of a voice speaking in his brain
m commanding th guard squadron reporting
will you give me audience i have-news

  the girl pushed armiston aside a thin line of worry
growing between her pale brows of course use lift
v- commander at once we will await you cut
off

  cutting off the brain echoed mechanically and the
screen went dark the girl swung and faced armiston

  somethings up i can tell by what was in m-s mind
theres trouble-somewhere  

  a bell rang warningly slowly a long panel slid back
into the metal wall and the metal guard untangled his

grotesque body from the crowded little lift car and came
into the room stood swaying gently before them the
girl snapped a question

  what is it there is-trouble

  the brain in the glassite case quivered again armiston
felt that curious mental shock yes high one trouble
a little way above us a raiding party of desert savages
attacked the guard station at zee-boma they carried it-
but not before warning had been sent out the warning
was caught in the signal-room here the vandals have
taken a course directly across the fire mountains above
us no danger for-here but the th squadron may be
ordered to pursue i thought i would warn you

  you did right the girl said slowly nodding she
stood a moment in silence thinking curiously armiston
did not question her right to command she slipped into
it naturally

  we will go with you to the signal-room the girl said
suddenly making a swift decision come bob

  armiston nodded followed without question the queer
ungainly thing before them swayed on its flexible tenta-
cles made an odd mechanical bow a tentacle whipped
out and pressed a stud in the wall summoning the lift

  armiston could not keep his eyes off the unblinking
impassiveness of the captive brain in the case strange to
think that this metal monster had once been a martian
as human as ona or himself it was a grim prophecy
of the future of the martian old race every year more
and more of them desperate with thirst for water that
could not be had were joining the ranks of the metal
men-or swelling the numbers of the savage maddened
hordes that scourged the deserts of the planet soon the
human races of mars would be gone swept away wiped
out by an inexorable nature how long before the thin
ranks of the metal squadrons battled against thirst-mad-
dened desert hordes for the possession of dying cities   
ghastly to think of ona lovely and desirable chained cap-
tive in an ungainly body of metal

  the girl caught at his arr impatiently the panel had
opened in the wall before them the metal guard was mo-
tioning with a great tentacle that they were to go down
first

  he stepped forward with the girl crowded close to her
in the little metal car the car sank downward

  below a panel opened again into a metal wall and he
and ona came out into the dimness of the signal-room
there were two of the metal guards here working silently
at giant vibra-screens and audio-detectors sending and re-
ceiving forming a link in the world-girdling chain of
guard stations in one corner the helio apparatus was
silent and unmoving it was not often used except in
cases of extreme emergency

  the panel clicked behind them armiston jumped ner-
vously at the gentle forward shove of a metal tentacle he
swung half-angrily on the guard but the girl caught his
arm urged him forward

  they stood near the helio apparatus staring out through
the round opening of a small glassite port watching again
the lambent crimson mystery of a martian sunset for
the first time armiston found the bleak cruelty of the
desert subtly beautiful

  night sudden and complete had fallen over the desert
in here dim and muted by distance they could hear the
soft whisper of a rising wind-a thin high wind howling
the dirge of dying mars  a queer shock stabbed sud-
denly through armistons brain there in the distance-
had he seen that pin-point of sudden white light cutting
the velvet blackness-or was he going mad

  he was not mad the girl had stiffened suddenly be-
side him slim body taut eyes intense upon something in
exiles of mars



the distance she turned flung a stream of words at the
metal guard commander he came closer hoved ar-
miston impatiently aside tood with that ghastly naked
brain held slightly forward-toward the dark blot of the
distant mountains    the grey substance of the brain
was palpitating stirring-suddenly armiston was very
sick the room whirling before him

defore his gaze the thing had turned twisted-and
projected out of the quivering protoplasm of the
brain an eye armiston met the cold piercing glance
of that eye for a shuddering instant and turned away
sickened    the brain was throbbing again

  yes high one you are right there is someone
something out there   signalling   using guard code
i can read parts of the message i can get all of it now
the girl gripped armistons shoulder with painful force
he felt her body quivering beside him what does it
say

  the brain shook made a mighty effort it says
guard station aie-tau to all guard commanders
sector v- south attacked by raiding party of desert
savages leaders maddened by thirst    great num-
bers    more coming from hills    afraid-cant hold
out much longer usinj last charged-v-tubes-now
all guard squadrons emergency call aid requested
urgent    the message ends high one

  the girl forced quivering lips to move that is
all

  that is all

  armiston met the girls eyes there was fear in them
he looked at her in surprise you arc afraid ona
why what could be worse than-this

  she looked at him queerly i am not afraid for
myself bob but there are so many-depending on us
so many-who will die horribly without the tubes three
worlds-depending on us bob if anything happens-
and suddenly he understood-and for the first time
uneasiness seized him they were almost defenseless-
and if the guards left   

  what could happen

  the girl shrugged eyes uneasy and worried i dont
know nothing i suppose but if the guards go-
armiston remembered the metal man standing silently
between them he looked across at the queer ungainly
metal thing and felt a sudden respect and unreasonable
confidence surge through him at the sight of it he asked
quietly

  you will have to go

  the brain quivered again armiston felt the shock of a
small soundless voice speaking in his mind yes it is
the code of the guard high one  i do not like it
but i must obey i will leave two here to guard you
you will be safe

  of course we will be armiston said looking at the
girl of course   

  the girl nodded slowly her eyes troubled i hope
so bob but if you are wrong-

  the metal guard commander was giving swift orders
the helio apparatus began to swing and flicker swing
again flicker again back and forth    and out on the
vast reaches of the desert small points of white light
flickered in answer from night patrols leaped up sharply
under the pale glow of the racing moons swinging across
the dark sky    slowly in ones and twos and threes
the patrols trickled in from the desert formed in taut
ordered rows below at the ground-entrance of the tower

  the guard commander topped giving orders suddenly
napped terse commands at the two guards in the signal-

room he turned and stood before armiston and the
girl the brain quivered

  i must go now high one

  the girl nodded her straight eyes facing the ungainly
metal bulk yes we will be safe until you get back
m- good hunting

  the brain shook queerly ai

  the guard commander turned walked slowly to the
opposite wall extended a flexible tentacle to press the
stud for the lift car a panel slid silently open the metal
thing stepped into the waiting car dropped downward out
of sight the panel closed slowly

  armiston and the girl stood a long time at the lookout
port watching the burnished metal forms of lithe-swinging
squadrons dwindle into nothingness against the dark back-
ground of the distant hills   

  they were silent and abstracted going up to the tower
room in the lift neither thought of sleep some inde-
finable sense of impending danger drove them from the
tower room downward again to the entrance lock of the
room of the rays swiftly armiston donned heavy metal
armor slipped the crimson mask down over his face
waited in silence until the girl stood beside him at the
outer edge of the lock somehow annistons fear was
gone

  they stepped out together onto the catwalk leading down
into the vast room clambered past the jutting bulk of
clamoring machinery moved upward slowly into the con-
trol towers-and presently stood panting beside weber
and the martian

  weber flung them a quick searching glance as they
came up his hands played swiftly over a narrow key-
board inset into one corner of the giant switch panel
locking home the automatic controls ta rigo did the
same and presently stood beside them

  what is it weber demanded lines of anxiety deep-
ening in his face somethings up

yes the girl answered the guards have been called
away theres been an attack to the north of us-desert
vandals m- left us two guards   r g-im afraid
weber looked at her flashed a quick worried glance
from armiston to ta rigo he said slowly softly

  so am i somethings doing in korna and if that
wasnt enough to worry us we get this

  what are you running the girl asked eyes suddenly
widened weber answered tersely

  ninety-five ac- every minute well leave control
to the automats for awhile    well have to ive got
to talk to korna theyll be trying to get us likely
enough lets go

  armiston and the martian nodded followed swiftly in
the path of the older man who was moving side by side
with the girl and talking rapidly they reached the
lock stripped off the cumbersome ungainly insulation-
suits threw them aside with the heavy crimson masks

chapter iii

the great sacrifice

together they crowded into the lift car rode up-
ward swiftly to the signal-room    the panel closed
behind them weber shot a quick keen glance over the
dim outlines of the great room took in the steady certain
movements of the two metal guards in one corner rested
on the huge bulk of the darkened center vibra-screen

  he swung on the three behind him stay here   
no youd better stand by the lookout port there might
be something to see    ona you have keen eyes use
them im calling korna
	wonder stories quarterly

  he strode forward flung himself impatiently into the
narrow control-seat of the great screen worked rapidly
at banked rows of control studs the screen glowed
swirled steadied into focus a great brightly-lit room
crowded with whirring machinery came into view a red
light flashed insistent warning that both visual and audi-
ble connection was wanted with korna

  the exchange-room vanished weber met the keen black
eyes of travisgane councillor in charge of communica-
tions worried lines were carved deep into the coun-
cillors high white forehead a kind of horror burning
behind his eyes 

  weber thank god its you ive been trying to
get you for hours your center-screens been dark any-
thing wrong

  weber hesitated shook his head slowly his eyes
never left the others tired harassed face no i sup-
pose not nothing definite but m-s been called away
a raiding partys struck across the fire mountains all
guard squadrons in this sector have been called out
i suppose well be safe enough

  the councillor did not look as if he were even listen-
ing

  he nodded and suddenly the half-mask of impassive
restraint dropped away from him and weber saw
through to the despair and weariness beneath

  theres trouble enough here weber gods of space-
the horrors ive seen this last hour weber its up to
you-and ta rigo well go under if you cant keep up
that flow of  ac- per minute even that just barely
covers the situation  if it gets any worse   

  good god man the words burst from weber in a
short quick gasp of dazed amazement his eyes bored
into the other with a fiery intensity you dont mean-
you cant mean-another wave of cancer four

  the councillors shoulders slumped a little he nodded
wearily something of despair in the gesture his eyes
looked dazed

  but i do look

  he made a swift impatient motion of command the
screen blurred swung flickered and weber stared with
sickened eyes at a scene of unthinkable horror section
after section ward after ward of the great hospitaliza-
tion centres in korna packed to overflowing with warped
travesties of the human form utter suffering mirrored on
unending ranks of cratered flesh-thin faces   

  the screen blurred again and before webers eyes the
ethereally beautiful unearthly spires of brez and tela
twin polar cities of mars grew into view covered the
screen they showed streets packed with a queerly hope-
less despairing multitude dying by inches toppling for-
ward in twisted attitudes of death    and above the
airlanes crowded with spinning driverless rockettes plung-
ing down from the heights in screaming wreaths of flame
loaded with cargoes of the dead

  enough for gods sake weber cried and put his
hand up to shut out the sight the screen blurred again
and presently the councillor was back eyes grim and
tortured

  its come again youve got to keep supplying us
with ac-  i wont think of what would happen if
you fail-even for an hour it would be hell thats all
if this could be worse

  i see weber said in a choked hushed voice i
see we wont fail councillor i promise you that i
swear it we wont fail cut off

  cutting off the other echoed the shadow of relief
coming into his strained features weber had a last
short vision of a weary travesty of a smile twisting the
grim lips

  he cut off the last of the screen controls with im-
patient hands and swung out of the operators seat stood
up turned the girl was standing beside him face pale
as death eyes dazed

  you saw he asked gently touching her shoulder
she nodded dully something of unutterable despair in
the movement i saw yes oh r g-

  she swayed toppled faintness rising between her eyes
he caught her in a strong steady grip put her on her
feet again

  steady on ona youve got to grin and bear it my
dear we cant fail-now

  no the girl whispered softly no she made a
sudden short jerky gesture toward the lookout port
where armiston and the martian stood frozen staring
out over the desert

  out there-rg we saw-something

yvteber caught her arm in a sudden fierce grip you
 saw something he shoved her roughly aside
hurried to the port in short quick steps stared out

  far distant yet just topping the crest of scarlet and
dunes silvered by the light of the racing moons a vague
dark rippling mass was flowing rapidly over the desert
sweeping down upon the tower weber strained his eyes
leaned forward-and suddenly felt despair crush him in
an unrelenting grip vandals a raiding party of des-
ert savages maddened by thirst coming to attack them

  he swung suddenly away from the port shook his spin-
ning head in a dazed effort to think then he caught
armiston and the martian in a savage grip

  come out of it you two we cant let them take us
i promised  

  armiston stared at him helplessly but what will
we do what can we do weve got nothing to fight
with-except that old projector by the helio there theyll
outrange us even with that what can we do

  webers face was a granite mask of determination he
kept seeing row after row of suffering distorted crea-
tures calling in vain for the thing that would save them
and the tower gutted and overthrown its mighty mech-
anisms silent strewn over the desert in twisted wreck-
age burning in ato-fumaces to furnish fire-light for howl-
ing hordes of thirst-maddened things that had once been
members of a proud age-old civilization

   well fight he said fiercely

  well fight with what weve got-and beat them
weve got to

  the girl moved suddenly spoke an idea r g
why not use our insulation-armor when we-go out there
to meet them theyll find it hard to reach us through
inches of entonium and we can use the projector
youve struck it weber cried exultantly a faint
glimmer of hope coming into his voice bravo ona
and weve got our two guards here to help us

  he swung faced the two metal men who stood impas-
sively waiting in one corner of the room their brain cases
held slightly forward he pointed out through the port
to the advancing dark mass now swiftly growing larger
like an ominous storm-cloud about to burst and over-
whelm them

  were going to fight my friends out there we
four will handle the projector and you have your hand
weapons use them what more could anyone want
and be reasonable

  the brain of the nearest rippled in sardonic approval
of the others grim humor ai may we find-good
hunting

  weber laughed then a little queerly the first time he
had laughed in long years since a certain one of far-
exiles of mars	

off earth had told him that there could no longer be any-
thing between them and bitterness had bitten deep into
his brain  he was filled suddenly with a heady wine
of recklessness come what might they would give the
devils a fight

  a little band of six figures crawled across a molten sea
of rippling desert in the lead four metal-armored
heavy-moving beings in human form taut with a certain
fiery eagerness for battle strong with desperate deter-
mination fingering the multiple controls of the glimmer-
ing sharp-nosed ionic projector following on swift
lithe tentacles of metal-two ungainly monstrous things
topped by glassite cases in which rested two naked throb-
bing brains

  awaiting them on the crest of the dunes was the enemy
a silent huddled horde of savage creatures begirt with
fragments of metal armor blunt-featured heavy-browed
fingering crude flame-belching weapons of earths iron
and steel here and there among them a squai com-
pact little heat-gun taken by battle prowess from some
guard station it was a deadly complacent little weap-
on capable of throwing one hundred hissing shells of
incandescent flame every minute in fiery flight and all
in the great horde with bodies and faces once cultured
and clean-lined but now marked by the ravages of heat
and sand and the bitter cold of long nights under the
stars-and parched with an overwhelming thirst

  savages armiston thought queerly climbing up to
battle at the side of the tight-faced girl-savages of a
strange planet warring with madmen gone berserk in
defense of their beloved science fighting to uphold a dy-
ing civilization surely the strangest battle ever wit-
nessed by the impassive cold-white racing moons above

  a heat-gun chuckled suddenly on the crest of the sand-
hills and sent a sobbing stream of incandescent fire pour-
ing down over the dunes the six metal-armored figures
walked on with contemptuous strides ignoring the ting-
ling red glow beginning to spread along tortured metal
the heat-gun stopped and died as suddenly as it had
begun firing and one of the metal guards halted with
grim purpose in the sand he lifted a tiny silver cap-
sule in a lithe tentacle-hurled it full into the heart of
the crouching horde on the hills above  an atomic
bomb

 i he capsule burst silver-and-green fire seemed to
- mushroom up out of the billowing waves of sand
and brush away with hungry fingers a dozen ranks of
savage figures a great gap opened in the lines of the
raiders they fell back a little dazed and stunned by
that awful concussion

  webers face glowed with an unholy light he chuck
led queerly the sound a dry rasping rattle in the dark-
ness    armiston his face dazed and horror-stricken
looked at him unbelieving eyes strange things battle
did to men

  slowly the gap in the dark mass above was filled
and suddenly with an utter abruptness that shattered
pregnant stillness pandemonium burst over the desert
the horde broke up into a billowing howling mass of
madmen they poured down in incessant streams upon
the six who stood back to back in the center of the mael-
strom and fought with frantic deadly coolness

  three times the hungry waves swept over and half en-
gulfed the six and three times they were hurled back
again in dismembered bloody fragments-impaled on the
spitting electron stream of the projector

  the third time was the last the horde was afraid
and uncertain suddenly-and as suddenly retreated in

wild rout weber and armiston knew that it was vic-
tory

  victory-but at a price and what a price almost
greater than weber had been willing to pay ta rigo
was gone and armiston was standing dazed beside a
great gaping crater in the sand looking down at the
fused mass of what had been two metal men once throb-
bing with tenacious life   

  ona was crumpled up on the sand sobbing over the
tortured fragments of a mans metal armor weber
leaned down slowly and brought her to her feet shook
her gently

  carry on ona its what he would have wanted you
to do

  yes the girl said dazedly the light gone from behind
her eyes yes i wont crack up again r g you
can count on that ill-carry oil

  good girl weber said huskily and turned away to
hide the sudden moisture in his eyes armiston stood
watching them both in a strange abstraction his mind
caught in a maze of horror    queer how hard they
had fought for life-those three condemned queer-
how bitterly they had struggled to keep from giving it up
queerer still that he and ona and weber still wanted to
live-still ached to keep the feeble spark within them
burning    the primal instinct of protoplasm

  while theres life theres hope how long ago had
weber said that ages ago certainly in some other
life not here he laughed suddenly with a wild note
in the dry rasping sound weber looked at him sharp
ly came over beside him

  you were great bob weve won    pull out of it
weve got to carry on for the sake of others help
me take ona back to the tower i dont think they will
try again but there is a chance   

  armiston nodded fought off a mad desire to scream
laugh do anything to relieve his insufferable tension   
he caught the girls arm on the other side from weber
and together with the girl between them they made it
slowly back to the tower ona walked unaided through
the ground-lock moving like an automaton her dazed eyes
staring straight ahead

  they took the lift up to the signal-room stepped across
the threshold of the dim chamber in silence and in silence
took places by the lookout port staring out over the des-
ert out there the shattered rinks of the savages had al-
ready begun to trickle together again to reform slowly
very gradually thirst armiston thought suddenly is a
mighty welder

  weber made a little inarticulate sound suddenly moved
toward armiston staggered and toppled forward on his
face armiston cold horror chilling his brain caught
him up and laid him out carefully on a narrow bench
he felt under the light tunic there was a raw charred
gash under his left armpit cutting across the heart a
heat-beam had pierced his armor and the wound had gone
unnoticed in the fever of the battle the girl came over
slowly met armistons eyes

  bad

  armiston looked at her for a long moment very bad
ona i hate to say it-but hes through we can make
him comfortable  

  the girl brought bandages and a liltle of their precious
water together they cleansed and covered the gaping
wound chafed webers pale cheeks with cold nervous
hands he came around opened his eyes slowly there
was a terrible burning intensity in them he caught ar-
mistons wrist

  tell me bob-and dont be a sentimental fool how
bad is it


wonder stories quarterly

  armiston looked at him with unwavering eyes slowly
nodded you asked for it im afraid-youre through

  weber fell back on the bench a queer despair coming
behind his fine eyes good god and i promised-
armiston are they coming back

a rmiston was hardly listening his eyes had gone
past the other were staring with a tight strained
glance through the thin glassite of the lookout port   
out on the desert a white pinpoint of light was beginning
to wink sardonically a sending helio

  ona-look anniston said suddenly tensely over
to the right a little more    there do you see it a
helio sending can you-read the message

  the girl stiffened beside him strained forward eyes
tense upon the distance yes it is coming through
clearly now it says commander the tower we would
have you know that there is no escape for you there
is no help coming m--was victim of a hoax it was
our signals he caught he is too far away to return in
time to save you    we are merciful we offer you a
chance to live we know you have much water give
it to us-and you live refuse-and we take it    an-
swer at once message ends grot leader the freed-
men that is all r g

  a sudden silence fell over the three of them the
girls mirrored an inward struggle fierce but silent the
instinct of life was strong in them all-and korna was
far away   

  webers eyes opened by a supreme effort of will he
brought himself erect on the bench met armistons eyes
in a long grave glance armiston can you handle the
helio

  armiston hesitated an instant the girl was watching
him with almost pleading eyes  he nodded yes

  send this message-as our answer you are wrong
we have only a little water barely enough for our-
selves and there are many who will die-if we die
we have nothing for you go away and leave us   
message ends send it

  his eyes met armistons still hesitant glance he nod-
ded imperiously hurry armiston they will be
waiting

  armiston shrugged looked across a long moment at
the girl and went blowly to the helio the great mirrors
began to swing and flicker swing and flicker catch up
and condense the narrow beams of light released from
crowded photo-storage cells send pulsing lances of white
glow out over the sand   

  far out on the desert the white point of answering
light leaped up again came and went came and went   

  armiston very white said slowly they refuse they
give us five hours to-reconsider after that-they at-
tack

  and then the girl spoke the last spark of light gone
from her eyes her voice a dry whisper but we will
stop them r g listen i have a plan it will work-
i hope 

  webers eyes opened again by a tremendous effort of
will that brought sweat in huge beads to bis forehead he
sat up on the bench fixed the girl with a hot impatient
glance

   

  quick then ona i-have not long but i can work
while-i can i will try hard to live until you no longer
need me    what is your plan

  this the girl said slowly and she did not meet ar-
mistons eyes one of us will take that suit of insula-
tion-armor there put it on we will charge the projector
directly from the storage cells of the generating room in

the tower it is dangerous i know but it is-the one
way left to us charged with the power those greet cells
will give it it can destroy all of the enemy    one of us
will take the projector and go out to meet them that is
my plan

  no armiston cried in horror no youre mad
ona

  weber swung on him fiercely quiet armiston she
is right it is-the one way out i will take it of course
get the suit

  armistons lips opened to protest and closed before the
terrible intensity in the others face silent he helped the
girl pick up the heavy suit bring it near the bench mus-
cle cords bunched and throbbed under the skin of his
throat slowly he rose stood swaying on unsteady feet
armiston extended a quick arm

  weber struck it down fiercely no man cant you
see i must-do it alone

  he gasped suddenly the breath rattling in his throat
he took a single long wavering step toward armiston
and the girl-and toppled face downward to the floor   

  the girl was the first to reach him she straightened
up slowly as armiston caught her shoulder met his glance

  hes gone the man asked and read the answer in
her eyes

  yes hes gone  he said carry on you two
i promised- 

a rmiston spoke fiercely his brain throbbing we
will r g we will i think you know that where-
ever you are now  it means of course ona that ive
got to take his place we cant fail-now weve got to
go through    the projectors ready

  yes the girl said slowly we have an hour before
they attack    the projector is ready

  i will go then armiston said looking at her for a
long moment drinking the vision of her loveliness in as
if imprinting it forever upon his mind we have an
hour before theyll expect our answer theyll get one-
but not what they think you know what you have to do
when i-wipe them out    youre certain about it all
i am the girl said in a flat dead voice i am to
call korna and have them send relief at once then i am
to lock tlie automats and hold out until the relief-comes
is that right

  yes armiston said very close to her yes  

he caught her for a long instant in a close embrace
brushed his lips along a stray tendril of hair

  and thats goodbye ona remember-i loved you
the girl choked back a dry sob good-bye-bob re-
member i said there was no room for love-here i was
right  

  no armiston returned slowly a glorious vision ris-
ing in his brain you are wrong there is room for
love-everywhere

  he pressed the stud in the wall that summoned the lift
the panel opened slowly before him he went in sank
swiftly downward the panel closed softly-closed upon
the dry choked sobs of the girl standing alone   

  armiston strode rapidly over the desert the heavy little
projector held easily before him a curious lightness and
freedom filled his brain rocked his soul-blotted out even
the knowledge that the tremendous power now held leashed
in the squat bulk of the projector that was shortly to be
released to destroy both the enemy and himself   
at last he was free from fear and that was all that
mattered

  he topped the crest of a sandhill and came slowly to
a stop almost upon him gathered in compact close-
ranked masses the hordes of the freedmen crouched
exiles of mars



silently watching him with many eager eyes  he
was so close that he could see the leader a splendid sav-
age brute panting in great gasp for breath the parched
tongue lolling in the half-open mouth    without a
sound the hordes charged

  calmly as if he were viewing a record-film of some
long-dead happening armiston crouchcd for an instant
against the faint glow of the racing moons above his
cool grip tightening about the squat bulk of the quiver-
ing projector

  he pressed the studs great bursts of searing white
light leaped out all around him swept out in a vast half-
circle that engulfed the horde in an instant dissolution
of flaring force rebounded with a thunderous concus-
sion upon armistons metal armor-and exploded in a
searing wave of white flame    armiston was gone

  behind high up in the towering silver bulk of a great
tower the girl watched with fascinated horror-stricken
eyes her facc pressed hard again the glassite of the
lookout plate    and slowly she turned away a queer
hard determination written in the set lines of her face

  moving like an automaton she crossed the floor of
the signal-room sat down at the controls of the vibra-
screen and began to build up visual and audible con-
nection with korna    presently the exchange gave it
the face of travisgane the councillor of communica-
tions looked out at her with questioning eyes

  ona what is it nothing is-wrong

  the girl looked at him dully they are all gone
except me they are all gone all gone   

  the councillor said frantically ona ona lis-
ten to me tell me what has happened weber and
armiston-

  dead the girl said in a flat voice dead havent
i told you theyre all dead-except me ta rigo and
r g and-armiston    send relief as quickly as you
can i am locking the automats youve nothing to fear
they will supply you until you can send out some-fools
to take our places but hurry automats arent safe after
eleven hours  they cant hold dead center you under-
stand

  yes the councillor said in a stricken voice yes all
dead my god what happened

  a trick the girl muttered a trick    trick to get
m- away and then attack here they didnt win though
couldnt beat r g-and armiston armiston killed them
all before he died   

  they were brave men the councillor said softly a
little brokenly but you are brave too ona  we are
winning the fight here if you can keep up the supply of
ac- carry on girl

  the girl looked at him a little stupidly yes  thats
what r g said before- youll send the relief

  the councillor nodded of course in five hours
you can hold out till then

  yes i am locking the automats they will last longer
than that ill wait until the relief comes but-hurry
yes the councillor said yes    cut off

  the screen went dead slowly the girl got up from
the control-seat and went to the lookout port stared out at
the bleak hard cruelty of the desert bitterness and hate in
her eyes the desert had won the desert always won

  after a long time a sound invaded the soft silence of the
room distant muted but still the rising thunder of a fleet
of rocket-ships slanting down over the hills   the relief

  the girl watched until the roaring ships were dimly
visible silvery blobs on the horizon then she rose slowly
and went down to the ground lock settbis automatic con-
trols to open in three minutes   

  and after that she went up in the lift to the entrancc-
lock of the room of the rays-and entered without armor

  slowly every movement a queer torture under the un-
checked impact of swirling short-rays she moved down
the narrow catwalk reached the control towers she
passed them by unheeding and walked grimly doggedly
into the nimbus of white flame that lived and grew about
the surface of the tubes

  slowly very slowly her body wavered and grew vague
of outline slowly very slowly it vanished into the cold
embrace of the white flame

  outside a thin wind rose over the desert whispering   

the end

  our sun  as others see it

      our own favorite star is so bright that it is almost impossible for us to imagine a universe
where it is not the dominant luminary

     yet travel a few light-years away and our sun becomes invisible to the eye while other
stars of apparently feeble light are shining with apparently undiminished lustre

      if the majority of the stars we see on a clear night are circled by inhabited worlds which
astronomers now doubt there are very few of these from which our sun is a conspicuous

rebellion on venus

based on the  prize winning plot of the interplanetary plot contest won by
edward morris  w monroe st chicago iii

midnight was nearing long grates of metal upon
metal sounded in the bowels of the giant craft it
was hung on high runways over new york bay
all outside apertures were closing lush with the stream-
lined hull out of the thick rail of the jut deck there
pushed a double screen of clarsteel the latest sensation
of applied physical science a metal as transparent as
glass the sheets went up to lock into slots at top of the
ship dovetailed sec-
tions were fastened in
bow and stern and
soon the meteor crack
interplanetary liner of
the vcnusian radium
company was a
locked-in world

  it was a momen-
tous occasion the
holds of the great liner
were full of armored
cars soldiers in var-
ied uniforms of the
nations of the western
league strolled in
groups through the
salons the jut deck
was crowded with
them keeping aloof
from the main body of
soldiery were maroon-
clad company men

in and out of the en-
trance to the control
room on the lower
deck passed blue uni-
formed engineers for-
ty feet to one side two
soldiers in khaki stood
guard by a closed door

  one deck above

captain bell stocky
heavy set sat in his
cabin a black phone
receiver at his ear his
right elbow on the sur-
face of a table there
was a strange expres-
sion on the captains
face couldnt we
delay he spoke into
the transmitter on the
table

  the reply was con-
clusive slowly the
captain put down the
phone heavily h e
arose and passed from
his cabin into the
charting rooms his orders came in a dull voice

  all persons into the starting couches- that order
went through the ship called into every quarter by amp-
lifiers

  down on the lower deck at rear of the ship a girl
opened the door of her cabin ran out a few yards along
the corridor and entered the room of albert harrington

at the moment of her entrance the physicist was standing
on a chair examining a metallic knob set in the ceiling of
his room

  sheila he said gravely as he stepped down please
reconsider your decision to come along

  the girl shook her head its too late now dad be-
sides what would i do alone in chicago she smiled
still worried about that rumored meteor swarm dont

you think the officials
in charge of depart-
ure know whether there
is danger they
wouldnt give orders to
take off

  harrington shook
his head the famous
physicist was a rangy
man with slightly
bowed shoulders but
carrying his age well
a daub of greyish mus-
tache adorned his up-
per lip he put his
arm around his daugh-
ter child he said
there are some things
you dont know be-
cause of them i didnt
want you to come
what is it father
she asked swiftly and
now her face was ser-
ious why didnt
you tell me for
years now something
has changed you
something ha been
on your mind she
came closer to him
why did you accept
this offer of work for
t h e venusian com-
pany dad

  it is an honor he
answered evasively
the company is the
greatest corporate pow-
er ever built by man-
it has a planet at its
disposal

  you hate it she
said swiftly i know
it

   sheila replied her
father the company
is soulless its power
is unlimited he mo-
tioned his daughter
toward a divan at one end of the room wed better sit
there goes the first bell

  that deeply-cushioned divan was the take-off apparatus
with oil chambers at its back fronting this on one wall
of harringtons room was hung a periscopic screen show-
ing the whole outside of the ship from the top small
aircraft were skimming over and ahead of the waiting

 edward morris john bertin
 who furnished the plot who wrote the story

kyfany people are today frightened at the

   a growth of large corporations and the grip
 that they have upon the necessities of life and
 often-upon our governing bodies dreamers
 look out to the apparently uninhabited mars or
 venus and visualize on those virgin worlds places
 for utopian communities freed from the evils of
 earthly civilization

   but even h g wells was not fooled by that
 prospect of paradise in his first men in the
 moon his explorer refuses to let the people of
 earth know of the lunar civilization shall we
 let the moon become a battleground as the earth
 has   no let them wait a thousand years  

   mr bertin in this story deals realistically with
 what may happen when men open up new worlds
 his picture is not optimistic but it is stirring it is
 brave and from first to last it is intensely exciting

apace giant

  the physicist and his daughter sat in the divan and
waited the girl held on to her fathers arm im
frightened she admitted but i wouldnt have missed
this for the world

  time passed slowly dad the girl said have you
any reason to fear the company do you regret accept-
ing allens offer

  lines of worry deepened in harringtons face sheila
he said suddenly im going to ask for delay-to put
you off

  a bell tolled solemn warning its too late now
dad the girl whispered the fear died out of her eyes
they wouldnt dare hurt albert harrington she said
proudly whatever the trouble between you and the
allens they cant use high-handed methods

  a long hoarse whistle vibrated the structure of the
ship it was answered by a great chorus of lesser toots
accompanying the sound on the periscopic screen could
be seen the scudding of small aircraft from the path of the
giant liner again the bell tolled and on the top border
of the screen appeared a word ready-

  there was a swift jjlt which threw them back they
felt the pressure of the cushioned seat it grew for
a few moments the girls vision blurred-she felt crushed
it was impossible to move gradually the weight lifted
from them-she saw again the periscopic screen showed
nothing but wisps of vapor growing whipping past-a
blackness beneath well muttered harrington a
strange look of regret in his eyes were off

aptain bell explained some hours later when the
-harringtons had joined the group around him rich-
ard allen a well-groomed dark young man with eyes
too close together had greeted them with a bow allen
was the son of the most powerful individual in two worlds
-director allen of the venusian company it was young
allen himself who had securcd harringtons services for
the central laboratory on venus he stood regarding
father and daughter a slight smile on his face the girl
felt uncomfortable

  at times the pressure is worse mostly it is far less
the captain was saying ships of the meteor type can
take off as slowly and smoothly as one of the intercontin-
ental airliners he went on but there is the mechanics
of a proper directional start off the whirling earth to be
considered

  a company of officers and technicians was gathered
around him on the upper jut deck which owing to the
narrowing prow of the ship was here some ten feet wide
outside and down beyond the clarsteel screens was total
darkness above them was a black sky heavy splashed
with stars there was no question of sleeping that night

  we are still moving in the shadow of the earth that
great cone which reaches into space beyond the moons
orbit in a few hours below us as well as above stars
will shine then the un a wonderful sight worth
a lifetime of ordinary experience and sheila listening
gazing with wide eyes into that vast blackness believed

  what speed can you attain captain asked harring-
ton

  well thanks to your own principle of thorium disin-
tegration this particular liner can reach close very close
to one hundred thousand miles an hour that is of
course the maximum and attainable only when well be-
yond thp full attraction of the rarth we arc not gning
one twentieth of that now though constantly and smooth-
ly accelerating theres atmospheric friction to be con-
sidered you know

  mr harrington ooked ono of the tcchniciano san-

ders an earnest-faced man with thinning hair is it
true that the principle of rapid disintegration the new
generation of power which you have made possible in
thorium holds the clue to full disruption of the atomic
nucleus

  so the conversation took a turn and the girl at the
covered rail listened to opinions sometimes heated con-
cerning the nature of matter and force daughter of a
world-famous experimenter she had a strong interest in
the subjects and surprising knowledge for a young and
formally educated girl still her usual emotions were
warped by uneasiness she found herself suddenly lis-
tening to tones rather than words richard allen had
intruded into the conversation was there a sneer in his
voice what hud gone wrong between him and her
father

  the facilities of the central laboratory on venus are
unparalleled mr harrington if you can conquer the
atom anywhere it will be there why not conclude
your experiments practically unlimited voltage is at
your disposal oh come now he laughed of
coursc  know we all know what the great harrington
is doing-in scientific matters the girl heard the sneer
plainly now she turned to watch allens face

  later in the privacy of his cabin harrington felt con-
strained to reveal a secret to his daughter

  ive sympathized with the rebels dear the earthly
humane societies interested in the case of the prisoners
we have aboard the bradfords were started by me you
were at school in california at the time he seemed to
hesitate as if deliberating whether to say more you
see the company might-

  oh no dad she dismissed it relieved what can
they do perhaps they are resentful-that is all come-
let us go on deck again

  no person slept the first night on that ship cleaving a
way into outer space in the course of the next few hours
harrington and his party visited all parts of the liner
finally coming up with the group from the holds of the
giant vessel the girl noticed the guarded door on the mid-
dle deck

  is that where the bradfords are confined she asked
aware of her fathers change of expression richard al-
len smiled

  yes he said the two chief rebels against venusian
law and order the company should have executed them
at once but due to some strange sentiment some under-
current of propaganda on earth we thought it best to let
them be tried by the league he looked at harrington
they can be seen through the floor of the charting rooms
above a clarsteel screen do you care to sec them mr
harrington

  certainly said harrington cooly

ten minutes later the group stood looking down
through a square opening in the charting room floor
at two men the room below them was a mere hole one
of the two men was seated on a bench his head in his
hands thats old franklin bradford informed allen
needlessly the girl recognized both she had seen them
on television screens the younger man larry brad-
ford was erect pacing he looked up at sounds above
him his eyes thought sheila were like those of some
splendid animal at bay

  and thats the young one sneered allen he reached
over to a clinsting d-k touched a button and an opaque
slide of wood went in place over the clarsteel

  allen watched sheilas face dont waste sympathy on
them he said after a moment its because of them that
thousands of people on venus have been killed and thou-
rebellion

sands of others will have to be hunted out of the jungles
by the soldiers of the league he looked at harring-
ton dont you think they should have been executed at
once at the first uprising three years ago mr harring-
ton

  there wa an awkward silence some of the group
drifted off sensing the strain between the two men

  they made quite a case replied harrington shortly
after all old bradford pioneered on venu-his people
started the mines he controlled himself you should
arbitrate  think he finished

  allen laughed unpleasantly

  youre not patriotic harrington he said the com-
pany is chartered by the league attacks upon its sol-
diers are tantamount to attack on the chartering federa-
tion of the western powers these people arc rebellious
dogs and will be treated as such

  he turned captain bell and colonel perry com-
mander of the league troops had approached and were
silently listening allen saw something like cold dis-
approval in perrys eyes he smiled again

  enough of rebels he said easily come let us go
back on the jut deck the sun will be appearing any
moment now

  they never forgot the sight the earth stood out a
huge ball hung in space a slowly twisting ball ellen
gazed with her very soul one semi-circular section of
that great globe was tinged with misty fire and up above
this fringe of atmosphere the suns disk protruded they
could not look at it save through special glasses procured
by the captain

  harrington stood very straight and there was a strange
light in his face as he gazed toward the receding earth
he turned once to see richard allen regarding him with
a slight smile

  every hour that world will grow smaller harring-
ton the younger man said words cant describe what
i mean youll know when you see it the size of a
beach push ball then of a barrel end then a moon with
a strange face youll know it emphatically when it will
be a star lost among the others in the sky his smile
widened

  harrington looked steadily at him from the moment
they had met that curious double meaning had sounded
in allen words what did he know had the com-

eanys offer to him harrington been a subterfuge to get
im to venus and venusian courts the physicist dis-
missed the thought it could not be

  a month it would take them to make the trip har-
rington putting off his doubts ascertained sheila would
remain in company of the technicians and set out to in-
vestigate the mood of the soldiery on board he found
most of them silent morose fighting men of undoubt-
ed courage the pick of the armies of the united states
england france and italy and central europe this first
detachment of the leagues punitive expedition apaint
the venusian rebels innured to war with all the lethal
horror of the latest weapons but they had no love for
their mission and there was the earth a ball in the
sky receding some of them cursed and talked about
the meteor swarm which by indications was more than a
rumor a glow had appeared in the sky to starboard

  day by day the earth grew smaller the meteor swarm
became a certainty the captain gave out various state-
ments which failed to quiet a growing alarm at first
the moon had swelled so that for a time it rivalled its
primary in size but after the third day both orbs shrank
back lost their breath-taking beauty became golden globes
retreating into the vastness behind them colored screens
now covered the bow of the great space liner to cut off too

chapter ii
enmity

ntonsense laughed harrington on the seventh
day out the company have some designs on
me why docs that idea persist in your mind sheila
knew that her father was hiding his real thoughts har-
rington had aged in the last seven days

  did you ask again to talk to the bradfords today
dad she inquired they were seated in harringtons
room the periscopic screen on the wall in front of both
showed a black vastness sprinkled with stars-a glow of
light on its upper extremity marked the place of the sun
who told you asked harrington abruptly

  allen he said it was with regret that company or-
ders forbade any intercourse of any kind with men con-
nected with the uprising on venus the penalty he said
was death dad-what did he mean by that
nothing replied harrington his eyes lifting to the
ceiling where the metallic knob of an oxygen distributor
showed in its niche nothing child

  the girl was troubled she left her chair and went to
her father i know its foolish dad but the feeling
persists of being trapped of being at the mercy of people
hostile to us the earth your position-our security-
it all seems a dream

  come sheila her father said abruptly rising let
us go on deck venus is growing to a perceptible disk
dad she said slowly im afraid-of allen last
night he tried to make love to me i know this sounds
old-fashioned she continued but im afraid of him
hes-cruel

  harrington stiffened he stared over his daughters
head wait for me outside he finally said and after
she had gone proccded to the small metallic dresser which
occupied one corner of the room rummaging within a
drawer he drew out an automatic pistol it was a small
thing but carried a clip of twenty cartridges it would
kill richard allen as he pocketed the weapon harring-
ton thought for one flashing moment of how completely
seven days could change all motives and circumstances

  two weeks out the earth was a golden baseball in
the sky and five inches to one side a disk of one-fourth
its diameter and duller of glow marked the position of
the moon the blinding glare sunward had grown just
outside the intense aura venus hung the size of the earth
glowing with whitish brilliance

  the rail of the meteor was always crowded with watch-
ers there was little of the chatter of earthly voyages
harrington kept studying the soldiers of the league the
commander colonel perry was an englishman he was
a taciturn man speaking little at the dinner assemblies in
the lounge room they were attended by the officers of
the ship and expedition the scientific men two of whom
had their wives along allen and the harringtons

  came the evening when a long gathering tension between
harrington and allen broke into tangible hostility con-
versation had started with the question of the meteor
swarm as usual and captain bell reassured the company
that the speed of the ship was taking it out of all danger
the matter of interplanetary speed swung the talk back to
the history of space travel allen listened that ever-pres-
ent sneering smile on his lips from time to time he drank
fifty years before a rocket had struck the moon and

the telltale flash was the greatest stimulus to invention
ever experienced by man a decade after that the first
ships had headed for venus

  it took a tremendous amount of courage to cross in
those days said harrington consider the leaking
clumsy monsters heading out on a hit-or-miss venture

  your principle of thorium disintegration changed all
that remarked captain bell you were quite a young
man at the time of that discovery were you not mr har-
rington

  not yet forty replied harrington it was in


  sheila asked wasnt franklin bradford on the first
ship that made the passage

  yes said allen at once silence fell upon the table
and in command was capt montaigne father of the
montaigne brothers awaiting execution on venus he
drank from a wine glass a sad ending for heroes
consider their subsequent history the planet venus
a treasure house of unparalleled wealth and power they
wanted to have for a home they wanted to keep old-
fashioned ways of government architecture mining
from the day the company was formed they began to
fight it he drank again and began to talk with more
animation

  harrington sat very still his mind traecd out every
distortion of truth in the others recital of the rebellion
of the miners on venus the company had taken root
in a happy land beginning to enjoy the fruit of pioneer-
ing toil it had crept like a many-armed nemesis into
control of mines transportation politics when the per-
manent settlers on venus woke to ihcir danger it was too
late all this harrington knew the last decade had
been one of blood and terror of a growing oppression
unparalleled for its unbending cruelty dispossessed ex-
ploited scorned the makers of venusia had become vir-
tually slaves in the radium pits ground in the wheels of
a remorseless commercial machine they had become
at last fugitives in the hills and in the galleries of aban-
doned mines

  the physicist sensed a purpose in the others protracted
distortion of truth it seemed as if allen was deliberate-
ly trying to betray him into some remark

  and now i hear concluded allen that another up-
rising is starting in venusia he gazed directly al har-
rington

  really asked harrington his tone icy sheila was
very quiet the two women to her right hiding their
anxiety strove to change the conversation with poor suc-
cess feminine small talk was entirely out of place for
days that enmity between the scientist and allen had
grown captain bells face was flushed

one of the technical men briggs husband of the wo-
man next to sheila remarked

  i should think the poor devils would realize the way
matters stand he flashed a glance to allen emer-
gency times are emergency times thats all

  allen smiled harrington felt a cold desire to kill rise
in him director allens son was cruel as a snake the
sense of power of the absolute ownership of a world had
made the heads of the company inhuman clearly har-
rington had come to realize the fact

  allen drank again from the wine glass he had been
drinking beyond the limits of balance as was evidenced
by the unnatural brightness of his eyes

  how long will it take you harrington to reorganize
methods of research in the central laboratory he asked

  i dont know leplicd the physicist i must be on

the ground to give an estimate

  you will of course use the facilities of the laboratory
for your atomic work asked the other harping on a
theme he had persisted in before you have practically
struck the method now-a few days and presto-mans
dream of unlimited power is realized

  harrington laid down his fork no sir he said quite
distinctly i intend to do little experimental work on
venus i am quite satisfied with the facilities of chicago
tech

  allen smiled showing white teeth

  i have heard harrington that if other scientific men
could be given the data already established by you they
could bring the matter to conclusion he leaned over
the table is that so

  the glances of the two men locked perhaps said
harrington slowly why do you ask

  allen shrugged curiosity he replied glancing
about the table he drank again and looked at sheila
idle curiosity by the way he went on amid a strained
silence were you in new york for the whole bradford
trial he sneered at harringtons reply judging by
the stir created-

  sir snapped the physicist i dont like your tone
he rose youll pardon me he said stiffly but i
think ill leave the table sheila rose and followed her
father they heard allen laugh the others sat in stony
silence

  the meteor shot on through space a great grey pro-
jectile trailing spiral plumes of smoke harrington and
his daughter on the jut deck stared out into the chasm
of emptiness the physicist reached into the side pocket
of his coat and felt the butt of an automatic revolver
there was a glint as of ice in his eyes

  an hour later a blue-uniformed officer found harring-
ton passing along the corridor on the middle deck toward
his room

  have you seen young allen he asked

  harrington stopped no he replied then asked-
what is the matter

  the officer evaded his glance radio pictures coming
in from venus director allen talking do you care to
come into the charting room mr harrington

  no replied the physicist curtly as the other turned
away he added if you pass my daughter on deck tell
her ill be up shortly he went to the door of his room
entering without a backward glance

  the officer shaking his head went on in search for al-
len

  allen had risen from the dinner table shortly after the
harringtons and made a way to his room at the stern of
the ship on the middle deck here he mixed himself an
iccd amber drink that increased the tizz in his mind his
smile fixed he left his room wandered about ship for a
while drawing curious glances and not a few scowls from
the veterans who sat in groups everywhere disgruntled
at the orders against smoking and talking of the growing
meteor swarm racing the ship toward the sun

  finally an idea came to allen he went down a flight
of stairs and on the lower deck headed toward the control
room before reaching it he veered left and stopping at
the door of a guarded chamber gave out orders he was
admitted

  five minutes later the guards whistled a shrill blast for
help and plunged into the small cubby hole which held
the bradfords they had heard allen yell a cry choked
in his throat within the cramped space the two guards
fought a swift battle to save the life of the son of the com-
panys director a push from a rifle butt threw old frank-
lin bradford against the further wall finger on trigger
the soldier threatened the old pioneer but the order of
rebellion on venus



kings did not hold for the other guard the swing of his
clubbed weapon not fairly striking young bradford
found his hands full the venusian was like a tiger
richard allen his senses reeling almost choked to death
crawlcd toward the door a half dozen soldiers broke
through the narrow entrance and overpowered young
bradford

  a bit later outside the room sergeant patrick oreilly
gave orders his hard facc was grim all right boys
company men are going to guard the prisoners from now
on

  two men in blue uniforms looked out from the door
of the control room from behind them peeped a white-
clnd mechanic soldiers in various uniforms of amer-
ica and europe who had come to the scene of disturbance
began to talk in various languages sergeant oreilly
nodded his head to a remark from one of the dismissed
guards

  i think he was baiting em sir

  it would be like him muttered oreilly his eyes
were cold as he looked toward the blue-clad control room
men these company people- he said and shook
his head then frowning he ordered-remember when
the company men come to take your places dont start
trouble we want no trouble till we hit venus-or some-
thing else he finished with a grunt thinking of the meteor
swarm passing among the men he heard various re-
marks none of that he ordered once cryptically to
an american more loudspoken than the majority re-
member were on duty-and the company is the one were
backing not the rebels but there was little sincerity in
his tone

t tp on the middle deck allen touching his throat
walked aft toward the larger cabins crossing the
center salon he met a blue-uniformed man coming from
the direction of the charting room

  youre wanted sir he was informed the tele-
visor is showing pictures of another uprising of the rebels
on venus

  to the devil with the rebels replied allen truculent-
ly shoot em down i say

  they are in earnest sir replied the officer and brief-
ly related the gist of the latest television dispatches your
father is still on the screen i believe

  ill see plenty of him later observed allen he
touched his throat how about the meteor swarm mor-
rison false alarm

  no sir replied morrison soberly its growing sir
but captain bell believes well pass well ahead of it
he looked curiously at allen as the company directors
son turned away a bit unsteadily

  in the narrow corridor beyond the third salon allen
paused by the door of the harrington rooms a faint
sneer touched his lips he went along the corridor to his
own chamber and drank more of the iced amber liquor
then sinking into the softness of the divan he slept fit-
fully his brain moiling slowly

  the dreams that passed through his drunken brain were
visions of a great city with concrete buildings that made
narrow alleys of the streets armored cars cruised a
broad boulevard at one end the entrances of mines
pockmarked the hills beyond this avenue here from
time to time rebel miners would make a sortie and in
allens dream the armored cars played a grim part he
smiled product of an education which had ruled out all
sentiment the son of the most powerful man in two worlds
felt pleasure in those dream visions of destruction

  he was awakened by slight metallic taps which seemed
to come from the oxygen distributor in the ceiling center

at once his eyes widened for he had heard those taps
before

  when allen passed the harrington cabin once again
the sneer on his lips was plain he went to the upper
outside deck he asked for miss harrington his mind
was now totally unbalanced he pictured the girls sup-
ple body her full lips he went toward the extreme bow
of the ship she might be in the lookout chamber a sort
of enclosed poop reached by a circular stairway from the
outer deck

  she was allen dismissed the man on duty he re-
peated the order with a snap when the man hesitated
then blocked the girls way as she made for the stairway
that led down to the deck

  dont worry girlie he said i wont try to kiss
you he pushed her back

  sensing his condition the girl tensed please mr al-
len-

  listen said allen hear that

  little metallic ticks came from the oxygen regulator in
the roofing above them they ceased

  you know what that was asked allen with mock
gravity why-that was albert harrington the great
physicist the honored albert harrington communicating
with convicted criminals

  yes he snapped gripping her shoulders from the
third day out and ive got witnesses more than that-
we have proof that your father engineered that he helped
to start the first great revolt on venus the bradfords
have been in radio communication in some wavelength
out of the reach of ordinary receivers with your fathers
private laboratory in chicago for years we have the
proofs he shook her your father will never leave
venusia

  the girl was rigid the metallic knocking was not re-
peated

  then the companys offer to my father was a trap

  allen laughed youre brighter than your father
girl

  you cant hurt my father she said swiftly not
albert harrington

  weve got a stranglehold on the league-the com-
pany is the greatest power on two worlds he pro-
claimed proudly

  she played for time he was in ihe mood to disclose
anything but after an interval that mood changed
he pulled her closer to him you could be of help to
your father now be good to me her resistance in-
furiated him he struck her all sense of proportion gone
from his drink-crazed mind she tried to twist away but
he overpowered her and now desire for her was like a
dark tide in his blood neither noticed a mans form as-
cending a circular slairs stepping into the room

  but down on ihe deck a maroon-clad company guard
heard an automatic erack once twice he whistled shril-
ly men came running

  the meteor shot on through space sunward ever sun-
ward to one side of the giant liner the diffused glow
of the asteroid swarm was brighter but the great pan-
orama outside was forgotten for albert harrington had
shot and wounded director allens son harrington a
prisoner was being led down from the lookout poop

disaster

 i hen the spirit of sullenness that from the start had
marked the soldiery of the league began to brew
like a ferment a day passed two a week venus
	wonder stories quarterly

was growing visibly in the sky colonel perry felt his
power to discipline his men slipping he remonstrated
with captain bell harrington could not escape-he
could not jump into space why not give him the free-
dom of the ship

   my men he stated flatly in the captains cabin have
their sympathies with harrington i dont know why
but the ideas passed among em that the rebels on venus
are justified too many americans he added they
hate the company squad i warn you captain bell if
you dont release harrington there may be trouble-
trouble i cant control the rumor is going around that
harrington is with the bradfords in a room too small for
them-that they are dying of insufficient oxygen down in
the hold

  captain bells face was haggard

  theres nothing i can do sir weve got orders di-
rect from the executive council in venus however i
can disprove the suffocation rumor harrington is with
franklin bradford they are in a room down in the rear
hold as large as this one young bradfords alone in
the brig look he said and pressed a button in his
desk revealing the transparent trap window in the floor
perry looked he hodded

   ill see the girl and set her mind at rest about that
anyway he watched bells haggard face how about
those meteors captain thats another thing thats both-
ering my men theyre convinced that this ship was or-
dered out with criminal carelessness

  captain bell swallowed he led perry through the
door which connected his cabin with the charting rooms
here blue uniformed men were working at desks one
was tuning in the televisor screen another was talking
to the control room the captain pointed to the creen
see its been a close race but were making it i
didnt want to drop behind-afraid of small stragglers
the ship is now- he stopped the colonel turned his
attention away from the screen and stiffened a veteran
of many campaigns he recognized the look on captains
bells face it was the look of a man facing death

  my god man perry said thickly shaking the officer
whats wrong

  look muttered the captain his eyes fixed on the
screen perry whirled he saw it then forming out of
the vague obscurity of space a hurtling mass of rock the
size of an apartment house

  god he choked

  an alarm clanged wildly in the salon outside captain
bell jerked into action abruptly he sprang to the phone
board yelled orders to the control room on the screen
a shaft of light from the meteors bow projector had
stabbed out it revealed the monster scudding stone that
was bearing down upon them the bell in the main salon
was sounding its incessant alarm

  then the meteor veered it was a desperate maneuver
made in a moment of frantic comprehension as the con-
trol room obeyed captain bells yelled orders the sud-
den snap of the turn made by giving full blast to the
opposite sets of dischargers at bow and stern almost broke
the giant liner in two colonel perry was thrown vio-
lently across the room crashing into a maze of wiring to
left of the phone board the shock almost robbed him
of consciousness but his drowning senses registered an-
other a greater tearing crash that tumbled everything into
chaos and as his mind sank into darkness perry knew
that the immense flying rock had struck the ship

  the catastrophe was witne<wi>h hy no outer observers
an illimitable host of stars looked with cosmic indifference
at two bulks that came together at a long tangent crashed
and went spinning along to drift apart the gap between

them widening human cries cries of terror and pain and
despair were lost in the empty immense reaches out
of the two traveling bodies things began to drop smaller
segments of it detached themselves from the broken hull
and drifted away lights flashed on and off in its in-
terior at bow and stern of the smashed liner jets of
vapor spurted at irregular intervals and the aimless
power of the propulsive forces whirled the ship awk-
wardly end over end gradually opening the immense
wound in its side

  on earth in the reception rooms of the great city sta-
tions operators went rigid as a repeated broken message
drummed into their earphones the amplifiers con-
nected blared out a call that blanched the faces of all
within hearing in half an hour the news had flashed
over the planet

  the meteor smashed and falling to pieces was drop-
ing toward the sun hundreds of passengers had been
illed outright scores of others were jammed help-
less in the compartments into which the ship had auto-
matically divided itself but there was no hope for
these for the main oxygen plant had been ripped out by
the crash and the auxiliary systems could not last over
two days the surviving operator was pinned in on the
center deck the worst position of all and already dying
from cold and air exhaustion

   from latest reports ten of the meteors two dozen life-
boats had succeeded in dropping through the emergency
door flanking the power keel but they had little chance
the asteroid swarm was scudding into the wreckage and
so that tragic message died out leaving silence in the
receiving apparatus leaving the earth stunned with the
magnitude of the disaster

nphen a few days later news was heard from venus

  the companys official statements spoke of the land-
ing of one lifeboat out of ten launched no important
personages were aboard

  presence of another meteor swarm heading for the sun
delayed interplanetary traffic for months the tragedy
was fading into the background of events when a series
of queer messages were picked up by the great receptors
the earth stirred

  the companys first report to earth of a single life-
boat surviving the disaster had been wrong of the ten
space shells which dropped from the meteors smashed
hull two survived the deadly sweep of the rock swarm
heading toward the sun two of them the first to be
launched and the last with a considerable distance be-
tween them veered in safety toward the planet which
promised sanctuary for the head of the meteor swarm
an almost solid aggregation of matter passed in that
space between tearing into the eight hulls that were
spreading fan-like in an effort to outrace doom

  from the small window of the last space shell its oc-
cupants saw the whole tremendous aftermath of the major
catastrophe-saw the meteor its vast broken shape still
distinguishable from the rock masses sail into the second
scries of collisions the whole mass faintly ruddy in the
illumination of the blinding sun swept away toward its
glare and was lost watching from the windows of the
last life shell sheila harringtons nerves gave way and
she collapsed

   with the girl in that frail boat was a curious assortment
of passengers two maroon-clad company guards a blue-
uniformed officer from the meteors control crew oper-
ating the little shell and a half dozen khaki-clad amer-
icans these were erect and apparently unhurt staring
out of the windows turning to stare dully at the girl as
she fainted
rebellion

  there was a young man dressed in venusian tunic
and breeches beside sheila who caught her as she fell
he was young bradford a free man now and no one in
the boats interior questioned his sharp orders one of
the americans helped him place the girl on the bench
which ran below the windows parallel with the length
of the boat across from her also recumbent on the
side bench by the other wall lay another form the pale
features were those of richard allen he was uncon-
scious further toward the bow sergeant rcilly was
desperately trying to sit up his face was working with
pain his left arm was queerly twisted

  bradford fetched water from a little emergency cab-
inet near the bow he passed a paper cup to oreilly
who drank avidly going back to sheila with another
bradford bathed her temples and throat gradually the
effect of the shock was lifting from the other occupants
and they crowded around oreilly came to his feet

   bradford pushed sheilas hair back from her eyes itll
be all right he reassured i think were safe theres
a chance that your father and mine are aboard the first
life shell and the last glimpse we had of it it was intact

  oreilly parted the group around bradford and the
girl using one hand theres a good chance of it miss
harrington he said hoarsely the cell your father
and bradford were in was close to that first ship theyll
make venus sure

  the girl revived for a time her dazed mind could
not comprehend reality scene after scene from the events
of the terrible hours gone played upon the screen of her
consciousness

  mr bradford she held to his arm i remember
-the crash i was talking to oreilly i remember you
pulling us out of the wreckage

  the upper deck came down on you replied bradford
his arm supporting her the sergeants arm was badly
twisted we went down into the holds

  she shuddered

   one space shell was left on the intact side of the hull
continued bradford its release doors were jammed
and everyone had deserted it in haste to reach the others
the hospital attendants left him behind indicating allen
while i worked at the release doors we were joined by
these soldiers and the three company men we finally
got the ship out by applying full power to her dischargers
and she ripped her way out through the jammed release

pays passed by the hour total of various watches

    three days that tearing escape from the meteors
side had damaged the little shells power keel and like a
ship clawing its way around a dangerous reef she barely
managed to cross the dividing line of pull which drew
them one way toward the sun edging into the smaller suc-
tion of venus gravitational field on the third day it be-
came a fight to keep off the surface of the planet till they
could make the lighted side a losing fight

  they were in a bad way the main shock or the subse-
quent one of release from the liner had damaged the oxy-
gen apparatus and by the third day the air in the boat was
choking them a little uvalde-doran combination re-
ceiver and transmitter set in the control bench in the bow
might have served them if tried in the first few hours but
when thought of communication came to the dazed crew
the source of electrical power in the keel had become
diluted the ceiling lights had dimmed and gone out
the key of the uvalde-doran set tapped futilely no
message came to them-it was evident no message was go-
ing out

sixty hours from the time of the crash they dropped
fighting every mile of the way into the shadow of venus

on venus	

great bulk with every bit of power fed to the keel they
could not keep off that black surface-could not make the
thin far line of light which marked the edge of the twi-
light zone it disappeared as the thick atmosphere of the
planet engulfed them sailing blindly the space shell
failed to clear the brow of a mountain range hidden in that
eternal venusian night the power keel scraped naked
rock the boat twisted in a long crashing slide the shell
went down a slope sailed over an empty chasm and
landed with tearing obliqueness on some growth-choked
lower slant the power jets clicked it free once twice
but finally it was neld snared by the thick growth

  painfully the party crawled out and took account of
its position oreilly came last carrying parts of a radio
set in his good hand there was but one thing to do-
try to make that twilight zone bradford gave directions

  the history of venus is a saga of daring and toil but
its most heroic passages were matched by the march of
that small company toward the light of the habitable
world they were almost dead from lack of food and
oxygen two of them were wounded one was a girl
the distance they had to cover was enormous for the lino
of light had just been visible when the space shell had
been hundreds of miles above the planet

  it was largely due to bradford that they survived the
venusian had a splendid vitality which served them all
in the first hours he had a knowledge of blind hunting
and trapping gained in his boyhood years a trap he
set by the first stream they crossed made of cord and a
springy branch snared them meat gradually they moved
along the black forest was alive with eyeless queer
creatures mostly small like earthly rodents when the
party recovered sufficiently to wonder this seemed a mir-
acle around the first campfire they built bradford ex-
plained

  the theory on earth seems to be that one side of
venus is ice the other desert they forget the winds the
shift of atmosphere also a tremendous proportion of
the crust of venus is metal with high content of radio-
active material venus is heated by its own constitu-
tion sheila had watched his face as the man spoke a
face showing in the glow of that first fire sergeant
oreilly an admirable will keeping him cheerful was
fussing with parts of the uvalde-doran radio set which
he had taken from the wrecked ship richard allen was
propped up on branches the  soldiers were mostly
silent and sat in a group apart from the two maroon-
clad company men

  in this black world the queerly assorted party passed
hours endless hours days weeks by the reckoning
of earth traps were set over stepping rocks across in-
visible gurgling brooks pits were dug in invisible
trails bradfords instinct was their sole guarantee of
direction came the time when matches began to run low
and the divergent natures of men that had united in the
climax of a great catastrophe broke into conflict allen
the bullet wound in his shoulder healed was the first to
rebel against rules it was a little matter a quarrel over
a portion of meat but bradfords curt command laid down
the law all things in the world were changed the
world was a circle of glow-or the feel of fellow creatures
as they blundered on through the stygian dark and
bradford the strongest was ruler of this world

  allen rebelled again and was backed by one of the com-
pany guards the law of the strongest worked then
with grim dispatch there was no time for niceties brad-
fords iron fist enforced his judgment sergeant oreillys
automatic pistol jammed into the neck of the second
company man halted the spread of hostilities the com-
pany men were disarmed the americans had no love
	wonder stories quarterly

for them this was largely the result of a remark by the
control room man several days after the landing as the
party was grouped around the fire he said moodily

  captain bell didnt want to sail he sent a protest
in code to venus a day before taking off saying that the
meteor swarm was appearing precisely in the orbit of the
lost haldane comet and might be a collection of bodies
scattered over a great area the reply was-we need
the league soldiers here you will take off as per sche-
dule he tried again just before sailing talking directly
to allen himself

  sergeant oreilly swore the company he growled
damn the company from that moment the two com-
pany men had felt alien to the group allen said noth-
ing his rebellions were instinctive beyond his control
thus hate moved with that group in the gloom

  and love it was inevitable the girl sheila was de-
pendent on bradford for the things of life for courage to
face that black and mysterious world of sounds and scents
the eternal laws which held venus in its orbit spilled the
rain out of its thick cloud covering and kept that strange
tiling life alive in the darkness brought the man and
woman together

             chapter iv
             allen plans

ame the time when seated around the fire they heard
-low jars far concussions different from the jungle
noises

  bombs said bradford coldly war he spoke to
oreilly when we reach the twilight take sheila in to
civilization i cant go theres a sentence of death
passed upon me besides my people are being extermin-
ated

  no the woman said swiftly i dont belong with
them my place is with you

  sergeant oreilly spoke for the americans

  listen i want to get hold of a dynamo i want to
get a radio set going no questioning in these fake courts
for me i stay in the jungles and send out calls for help
to the earth

  why asked allen are you mad oreilly the
company is part of the league

  i dont think so said oreilly ive got a hunch
the concussions in the distance grew in number and
volume a faint sickly light began to alleviate the gloom
allen and the two company guards tried to escape
oreilly shot both guards allen stopped at once and
came back one of his companions fell not twenty feet
from the top of the hill which marked the starling point
of that break for freedom the other disappeared in the
murky tangles of the jungle

  yon should have waited till we were asleep said
oreilly tie him up boys as they were binding
allen the sergeant remarked grimly well-there goes
my chance to walk into the central metropolis and be
greeted like a hero that scum will carry the news ser-
geant patrick oreilly holds allen prisoner 

  i think you hit him said bradford quietly he prob-
ably ran just a little way

   but it was impossible to verify the guess in that light
the hill slope was full of ravines they pushed on no
longer stopping to trap game when finally they met
human beings a squad of tattered venusian rebels-on a
hunt for meat their energy was almost spent but sheila
revived to a shock of news her father was alive

   on the edge of that twilight zone as the weary party re-
covered physical strength they were faced with a grim

situation ahead of them was venusia was the central
city of a planet-girdling nation a nation at crisis time
the destiny of a world hung in the balance and the mem-
bers of that lost little band were the unwitting instru-
ments of fate

  here in the grey green light the jungles were heavy
and wet into this dim land which led to the eternal
darkness beyond the rear guard of the venusian rebels
scouted for food here and there piercing the heavy
growth on a hillside was the concealed entrance to some
tunnel which connected with the mine borings further
beneath the sun no persecuted people in the history
of earth had ever been driven to greater cunning to more
desperate measures

  above the dimly visible jungles from time to time
after the arrival of bradford and his party droned squad-
rons of company bombers dropping deadly shells which
ripped ground and vegetation to bits rumors had spread
through a thousand tunnels passed from those fighting at
the mine mouths to the wounded and the sick in the jungle
settlements that allen was preparing for some decisive
move the bombers flew more frequently over the drip-
ping grey green world in the streets of the central
metropolis armored cars were gathering squat black
metallic monsters carrying sheffield heat ray projectors

  yet something had stiffened the rebels resistance in
face of those ominous preparations for some time
messages had crackled on terminal wires of patched-up
radio receivers in the tunnels at the hillsides originally
these sets had been powerful carefully constructed pieces
of apparatus fewer in number located in some worked-
out tunnel out of the range of company inspection into
these sets had been incorporated henry montaignes dis-
covery of radiant waves differing from those known to
practical science and it was by means of these sets that
the montaigne brothers and the bradfords had years be-
fore first communicated with harrington on earth draw-
ing courage from the great scientists assurance that jus-
tice would in the end prevail on venus warnings of
suspicion of a projected company raid in the mines had
resulted in the breakup of the big combination transmit-
ters and they had found their way patched into portable
sets to the outside now in the last hours of extremity
in the final rebellion they had picked out of the ether
this repeated message-

  harrington-prisoner-laboratory-

  albert harrington was alive and in venus

the finding of lorry bradford and his party seemed
another miracle to the desperate outcasts in that world
of half lights and shadows the news that the son of
director allen was in their hands ran like a ripple of
hope along interminable miles of the strangest battlefronts
in the history of the warring race of men bradford took
charge of the forces directly back of the central metro-
polis it was here that the whole trend of the venusian
movement for freedom centered-from this point the whole
rebellion had emanated and from this point it died down
in intensity the destiny of countless thousands of men
working in that broad habitable belt which girdled the
planet was dependent on that forlorn hope that somehow
the fighters in the central district would win terms from
the company

  sergeant patrick oreilly after being told the details
of the problem gave vent to some picturesque language
calming he gave orders to his squad

  rustle me up a dynamo its the earth i want i think
allens mad the leaguell have things to say about him
holding harrington

  sheila spent hours near the patched montaigne receivers
rebellion

at irregular intervals the messages came-harrington-
prison-laboratory- three words without variation to
the distraught girl this seemed a slim assurance of her
others safety she sometimes went with bradford back
into the jungle and climbed a hill which thrust its head
far up into the mits of the heavy atmosphere with dis-
tance glasses from this point the central metropolis
could be fairly distinguished-its vast blocks of concrete
jutting up amid the older smaller architecture of the pre-
corporation period

  why don t you go sheila asked bradford more than
once when they were alone oreilly will take you
there must be some protection for you at the league
headquarters in the city allen cant defy the league
his face was dark with doubt as he held her supple figure
in his arms you cant stay here its pure luck that
those bombers havent hit the camp behind the central
mine oswalds outfit the camp to right of us where
weve left allen was almost wiped out in the last bom-
bardment

  but you lorry she asked cant you see-youve
been everything to me but for you  would be dead-
all of us would be those first days in the dark-
she shuddered

  i cant go sheila the man said decisively i have
to die here with those of my people who will not sur-
render and manyof them wont he added for the
leaders surrender means death in any case for the oth-
ers it means the mine pits again-it means cancer the
slow warping of tissues the deadly poisoning of excess
radium emanation absorbed by the human body

  yet this cant go on he added and now indecision
was in his voice some great drive is under way-to
judge by the companys preparations we cant hold
out much longer and you sheila you have to think of
yourself-of your father this has been an accident
our meeting our love-a thing of the dark of blind-
ness-

  the girl-woman wept far in the distance sounded
the raucous drones of the company bombers sweeping
anew over the jungles

  then the blow came the news of it rnn to the sev-
eral encampments in the central district in the entrances
of the hidden tunnels the venusians gathered listening to
the dull booms which confirmed the story sergeant
oreilly said grimly

  im telling you allens gone mad from what we
know theres no new detachment of league soldiers in the
city and perhaps the nations have backed out of the
agreement of new york perhaps they told allen to do
as he liked but i dont believe it its too inhuman

  but why-why should he break in the mine mouths
asked sheila isnt the companys strength based on
radium output wont it take years to dig galleries again
to make anew the systems of ventilation they are destroy-
ing	-

  it means said bradford stonily that allen is going
to conclude this drawn-out affair he must have the back-
ing of the league or at least be assured that nothing more
than a protest will be filed the company practically
controls earthly politics anyway he added well its
the end

  what do you mean asked oreilly the miners were
all around them their wan faces showing deepest dejec-
tion armed with weapons handed down from pioneers
who had used them to hunt small game their one great
quality had been tenacity bradford looked around him
and abandoned the cause his father had led

  he pointed toward the darkness

  see smoke the bombers have set fire to that

on venus	

peculiar vegetation besides the capacity of existing
without sunlight that growth can burn like tinder there
goes the end of our food supply all life will leave
this section the bombers will shell every inch of the
twilight area back of the mines inside with the closing
of the openings with the cessation of ventilation gas
will form radium gas and the usual mining damp it
means extermination nothing less turning to the ser-
geant he asked evenly oreilly-is that transmitter
ready

  yes sir said oreilly with military snap i was
intending to try it now when this hullabaloo came up
i want to tell the earth that harrington is a prisoner and
other things

  later decided bradford first-contact with the
central metropolis tell the executive council that you
patrick oreilly sergeant in the american division of the
expeditionary order force are alive that you know i
bradford have richard allen here and want to talk
terms with his father

yreilly carried out orders four hours later the
answer came bradford received it without flinching
for one moment a suspicion crossed his mind and while
preparing to give reply he stiffened

  no he decided he wouldnt dare this is open-
in view of all men very well he added signal al-
len that i accept the terms ill have every man in the
central district out and into the open four of us
oreilly myself oswald and armitage will see allen
personally in the executive buildings

  sheila and a reserve group holding allen were to stay
behind for the others the word went along into the
maze of mining galleries which honeycombed the hills
nightward of the central metropolis through these
gloomy passages fleeing men had been streaming gath-
ering here and there where a lamp illuminated an old
work pit talking excitedly till the orders came being
orders direct from bradford the motley crowd obeyed
though with much questioning among themselves those
farthest in the mines stopped in their retreat and under
selected leaders moved again toward the front a years
long struggle was over the explosions at the mine
mouths had ceased

  the forces in the hills mobilized sadly and prepared
for a march of submission around the rises and down
to allen lake the raucous droning of the bombing
planes died out in the sky

  director william allen had called a sitting of the
venusian executive council he faced the members now
in company chamber an immense artificially-lighted
room semicircular rows of seats in the fashion of earth-
ly assemblies fronted a large central desk and from be-
hind this allen delivered his opinions and orders

  he was a short man but powerfully built and as he
leaned forward to occasionally strike the desk in empha-
sis of his words the flesh of his thick neck swelled in the
open collaring of a rich venusian tunic

  the faces of the assembled councillors were strained
one of them finally asked for the floor director he
said and little drops of perspiration stood out on his fore-
head-this is a big thing-a big thing certainly we
can do this to the rebels we can kill them all or ship
them back to earth but league headquarters know by
now- he swallowed they know weve got harring-
ton

  precisely why i want you all to take this decision with
me snapped allen that set by which the rebels com-
municatcd with us has since been dispatching direct to
earth as for league headquarters here he waved a


wonder stories quarterly

hand ill fix that the main thing is that the earth
knows questions will begin to pour in-sharp questions
do you know what im going to do his greenish eyes
glittered im going to cut connections

  mutters rose it was a great decision perhaps a gage of
war hung to the parent planet of the race of men allen
stood erect behind his desk his square jaw outthrust
there was no softness in the man no trace of the ordinary
human sentimentalities he bad built up a system of con-
trol and exploitation that was now a gigantic power and a
disaster in space had put a master card into his hands

  a councillor asked for audience are you sure di-
rector the question was earnest there is no possi-
bility that harrington has hoodwinked us

  alien smiled about to make a reply he was inter-
rupted by the buzzing of a desk phone set he threw the
lever listened and answered shortly very well send
him in he paused a moment is johnson still there
admit him also

  a maroon-clad orderly entered through noiseless sliding
doors set in the wall to left of allen he was followed
by johnson one of the scientists of the central labora-
tory the orderly reported

  the rebels are coming around the hills sir the four
leaders are already under guard at the square
everything arranged as  ordered asked allen sharp-
ly-

  yes sir the bombers have flown into the darkness
with directions to cruise within thirty minutes flying time
of the metropolis jeems has his trucks on the lakefront
in the square and at the city end of radium thruway
the miners will be entirely bottled up sir

  cood said allen and dismissed the man the scien-
tist johnson approached and spoke hurriedly a frown
grew on allens face then slowly cleared he rapped for
attention

  the mystery of how the rebels knew about harrington
is explained he communicated with them tell the
council how johnson

  it was through the power of that helium-cooled electro-
magnet which he uses for the atomic work we believe
baker has just found clamps which seem to have no pur-
pose save to hold terminals we had missed a uvalde
power coil some time back harrington hid it in a dry
cell casing baker is at work on the matter now gentle-
men we believe that harringtons method of transmis-
sion is based on the sub-etheric phenomena lately investi-
gated by de solgie a powerful magnetic field will dis-
tort a voltage spark harrington and montaigne the
rebel have constructed devices which are bridges be-
tween the sub-ether and the ordinary wavelengths-

chapter v
harrington wins

a llen interrupted well-the thing is done every-
 body knows that albert harrington did not die in the
meteor disaster the principle of communication we have
referred to is unimportant what is important is the fact
of harringtons atomic work because of that gentle-
men the venusian radium company  the future will
be responsible to no power national international or
planetary his head lifted i will answer your ques-
tion councillor littman concerning harrington no-
lie has not hoodwinked us

  in a few hours the secret will be out-atomic power
gentlemen will be in the hands of mankind harrington
did try to trick us ai first he played fui lime ilr has
always been hostile to the company and to place this

great knowledge at its disposal while facing the prob-
ability that he would be executed immediately after went
against the grain allen laughed

  johnson here has told me that he spent hours plot-
ting out pulses of energy doing over again the mathema-
tical work he had done in the chicago laboratories but
we soon convinccd him that our physicists here were not
amateurs a little pressure brought to bear-we threat-
ened to dispose of old bradford bradford that thorn in
the flank of the company harrington made a bargain
with us in exchange for his own life and bradfords
he would unlock the secret of the ages allen turned to
johnson how soon do you think it will be

  i think it has happened sir replied johnson his voice
strained thats why  requested an audience

  speak louder ordered allen

  well- johnson cleared his throat as he faced the
most dreaded group of men  the planet hes been
coming to it for some time radium has formed the
basis of his experiments as thorium was used in the
famous tests of  this disintegration principle he
used now to produce a terrific heat concentrated in 
disruption box through which played the force fields of
the great helium-cooled magnet and across which lie
threw increasing voltages in the last few days the poten-
tial was as high as twenty millions he insisted how-
ever  privacy and we could not check up on cvcrythiug
wc did know however that in an elaborate condensation
apparatus of clarsteel coils the original radium was be-
ginning to appear as lurid jets of gas the queerest things
ive ever looked at

  they seemed writhing alive of two separate colors
green and red each coloring as far as we could judge
from the peephole provided travelled a separate path
when harrington was out of the laboratory he removed
sections of the clarsteel but still it was patent that there
were two channels for those queer glowing residues of the
disembodied matter which issued from the disruption box

  johnson cleared his throat we had orders to leave
him alone but a few hours ago as baker and i were talk-
ing in the main room of the laboratory the explosion came
it was like nothing i ever heard in my life a great tearing
terrible sound with an undertone like a monstrous roaring
we felt the floor jar it took us some time to cross the
main lab and the passageways and the low temperature
room beyond all of which are deserted at lunch hour in
that section of the research room we partitioned off for
him we found harrington he was trying to kick debris
into a hole under his desk the bench itself of inch-
thick steel was pierced by some agency which he would
not disclose but evidently it had come there was ap-
parently nothing on the bench except a sheffield ray cart-
ridge that must have got there by mistake i left baker
to inquire further harrington is being held

  you may go johnson ordered allen report
through the televisor every development make harring-
ton talk tell him about his daughter being alive tell
him we have her prisoner too vi e can prove it by con-
necting him on the phone with young bradford brad-
ford will be in this council chamber within the next
thirty minutes after johnson had left he laughed

  gentlemen-all events are working for us are you
convinced why need wc hesitate the day albert
harrington accepted our offer to come here was the day
our supremacy became possible lie leaned forward
and his throat swelled  tell ou i would have forced
harrington to this even if he had landed publicly in the
meteor as it is we have been given time by keeping
the secret of his and franklin bradfords presence on the
space shell which landed here we have achieved to power
rebellion

on venus



while ihe earth slept wc no longer need mines or di-
plomacy and young bradford will realize that power
is ours and we will use it

  while allen was urging the council to a drastic course
of action out of the hills past allen lake the vanguard
of a ragged army was filing fronting them drawn up
on the wide lake shore were scores of ugly armored cars
with the wide muzzles of sheffield heat ray projectors pro-
truding over the hoods bigger weapons of the same type
worked automatically from the central defense station
beyond the laboratory were nested in concrete piers on
every intersection of the broad radium thruway which
led along the hill fronts toward the city squads of
drilled company guards maroon-clad and taciturn
tramped the side streets and came to rest facing the
thruway the military strength of the company
mcchanical and human gathered in frowning truculence
as the ragged legion of rebels from the lake district
marched to meet their comrades who filed out of the main
mine openings and were halted at concentration square
not two hundred yards from the fleet of trucks at end of
the thruway

in the headquarters of the western league a man in the
uniform of a french officer of staff pounded the desk
of league representative denly he cant do this he
shouted his face ptirple

  but he is doing it replied denly lifting a pen from
the letter he was writing weve tried three times each
time the officers were turned back at the gate dubois
were prisoners

  furthermore he continued his eyes cold theyve cut
off all power from the leagues premises we cant com-
municate with new york we cant get another thing
from oreillys squad we do know theyre signalling
the earth about harrington he scrawled a final word
on the paper beneath his hand folded it and placed it in
an envelope

  ill try again to get this over to allen rising he
preceded dubois out of the small office into a larger room
where several secretarial desks took up the floor space
wide open doors led to other parts of the league- head-
quarters flustered stenographers and clerks went from
one room to another to get a better view from the win-
dows a group of officers were massed in the most advan-
tageous position at the side of the room overlooking ra-
dium thruway denly giving his message and terse
orders to a clerk walked with dubois toward the mutter-
ing officers

  who would have guessed growled dubois i thought
all along that it was queer the secrecy the way that sur-
viving life boat was docked-everybody kept away the
passengers taken to the executive buildings in a closed
car but to imprison albert harrington-to send false
reports to earth and now this he shook his head allen
has lost his mind

  perhaps theres method in his madness muttered den-
ly he is evidently defying the league impossible as
it sounds do you realize what it may mean for those
poor devils out there

  what do you mean asked dubois they had pressed
into the group of officers and were looking out over the
metropolis the window was high above the streets and
gave them clear view

  i mean that allen may lake no chances of a revival
of this years long stubborn rebellion we were forced
to protest his action about blowing in the mine open-
ings for it seemed his intention was to exterminate the
rebel force in the central district without waiting for

the delayed league expedition well-he may yet do
it

  by george denly ive got the same premonition my-
self interrupted a lank englishman ive got the feel-
ing as  look at those poor devils lining up under the
rays that we may witness a wholesale massacre

  impossible  it cant be    no the ejacula-
tions came from the ofliccrs with such fervor as to show
the dread of facing the possibility they denied

  theres bradford now said denly quickly point-
ing see-that knot of men leaving the lines get me
a field glass he ordered

  five minutes later with a grunt he removed a tele-
scopic set from his eyes and passed it to dubois

  yes its bradford all right id recognize his
shoulders anywhere oreillys one of the three with
him to judge by the remains of a uniform

  dubois peered through the double lens toward the
group passing between lines of maroon-clad guards into
the courtyard of the executive buildings bradford
oreilly and two ragged venusians were going in to their
appointed conference with allen

  in that same great room company chamber where he
had addressed the council william allen delivered his
ultimatum to the four representatives of the miners he
sneered as he saw the effect of his words the room was
lit by bulbs in walls and ceiling the four men seemed
small in the center of the floor a mixture of shadows
was at their back to their right the councillors sat
facing the directors desk to left of them a television
screen hung on the wall

  allen concluded we will probably deport you all
in the event every order is obeyed instantly other-
wise- he shrugged

  lorry bradfords voice rang

  allen-you cant do this remember the earth

  wait snapped allen before you say anything
further he threw a lever on the small television set
beside him on the desk

  ill kill him-so help me god-ill kill him mut-
tered lorry bradford a slow fire in his veins oreilly
was cursing silently oswald and armitage seemed
stunned

  allen was talking into the device on the desk con-
nect me with johnson and throw the laboratory on the
televisor cct harrington into view

  he turned

  thats the mistake you made bradford he sneered
believing the company in any way subordinate to the
league youve taken your men out of their holes and
placed them under company rays on that assumption
well its worthless i tell you again if my son is not
immediately released ill burn the whole pack of you
into eternity his face had congested the momen-
tum of a great decision was working- up in him till his
whole heavy frame trembled with a strange fury

  easy lorry easy muttered oreilly his breath
blowing hard think fast boy keep your head

  the desk phone set buzzed johnsons face appeared
on the miniature screen while the larger one on the wall
to left of bradford and oreilly lit up and disclosed
the contours of an interior

  weve found out about that explosion sir said john-
sons voice it was rather hurried that voice with a
strange uncertain note to it but neither allen nor any-
one else noticed well show you presently on the tele-
visor remember my telling you of a sheffield ray shell
found on the bench harrington had made a sort of
cartridge out of it with two chambers each holding one


wonder stories quarterly

type of that radium concentrate well have harrington
in view in a moment sir

  allen turned again he pointed to the laboratory room
clearly depicted on the televisor

  in a moment you will see walking into view the man
who made it possible for the company to take this short
cut albert harrington he laughed what an ironi-
cal turn of fate

  bradford he added coldly his voice lower youd
like to jump for me youve got a splendid body brad-
ford-like your father before you too bad he mocked
your time has come yours and your fathers and har-
ringtons

lorry bradford in the space of minutes thought
of many things-of a girl that waited with a reserve
group in the hills-of his men drawn up under the shef-
field rays and as he thought the life in his body rebelled
against fate against the order of things which let a mon-
ster like allen hold the factors of victory in his hands
and as he stood there in the desk there appeared again
johnsons face his voice sounded in the big room

  ive sent baker and two men with harrington toward
the main floor director his voice sounded relieved
harrington has promised to demonstrate how the radium
cartridge works sir for a time we were worried twen-
ty-five sheffield ray shells had been reported missing but
probably they were taken by the truck squads allen
was frowning suddenly there sounded from the desk
sets a tearing indescribable noise merging into a deep-
toned roar allen swung around to face the desk john-
sons features showed stark fear

  then allen lifted his head to look at the larger tele-
vision screen a man was entering the field of vision
walking backward he came fully into view and oreilly
muttered harrington

  allen shouted sudden orders johnson had disappeared
from the desk screen for a brief moment the whole per-
sonnel of the council moved in haste its director galvan-
ized by instinctive apprehension of what was to happen
then that bent figure of albert harrington jerked to the
pull of something he held wrapped in cloth in his arms
it seemed as if the world was rent

  the sound alone froze every occupant in company
chamber allen included it was a new thing to the ears
of man that sound a monstrous tearing an undertone of
terrific rumbling bass like the pooled majesty of a million
thunderstorms the voice of power naked and unleashed
the humans stood awed as once the savage was awed
by rumblings in the sky by the deep-toned authority of
the hunting cats in the darkness of a paleolithic night
then allen broke the trance but even as he moved the
lights in the building puffed out harrington and the
laboratory vanished from the televisor in the darkness
the whole building seemed to quiver in echo to some ter-
rific catastrophe which had struck the central metropolis

  bradford tried to find allen in the gloom but his
raging purpose spent itself at thought of the greater drama
being enacted outside blundering around he found the
main doorway and called to oreilly the sergeant joined
him oswald and armitage the two venusian leaders
who had accompanied them did not respond to repeated
calls

  theyre gone muttered oreilly i lost time look-
ing for you

  follow me ordered bradford

  half an hour later they were moving in short runs
toward the laboratory an incessant crash of falling
structures filled the air but these sounds made but small
impression of their ear drums which ached to the repe-

tition of a monstrous roaring dwarfing all else that sent
them cowering to earth as they moved thus in spurts
through the debris choked streets glimpses were given
them of the last remnants of the fleeing venusians head-
ing back for the mines of a torn and tumbled and scoured
depression of ground which marked the site of radium
thruway terminus fragments of armored cars were
scattered along its rim in straight swaths making a
path back to the laboratory the concrete buildings were
no more and sometimes as the two men crouched they
could see solid structures moil in an undescribable con-
tortion as if dead matter was writhing in agony before
vanishing into nothingness the whole surface of allen
lake was heaped up into tremendous waves its waters
lashed at intervals by some terribly violent agitation

  the atom gasped oreilly hells loose lorry

  no growled bradford harringtons harnessed it
come on 

  in a gouged depression of earth they found oswald
and armitage frankly terrified the great scar in the
ground circled the laboratory buildings

  it looks as if harrington first of all drew a circle
with an awful instrument around him muttered oswald
well run out openly said bradford when the lake
starts heaving again wherever he is hell be facing the
water then and by time he turns and changes direction
of his weapon hell recognize us

  they ran out of the ravine over its edge and made
the laboratory grounds uninjured company guards were
running here and there but it was plain that there was no
fight in them fear stark fear had descended upon the
central metropolis

  the bombers breathed oreilly theyre coming
back

  hurry gritted bradford

  they found harrington he was at a window in the
main laboratory room he seemed shrunken old his arms
wrapped about a bundle he pressed to his waist resting
its front on the window sill it was a circular cartridge
wrapped in clothing operated by a tiny lever at back
part of the walls of the room were pockmarkcd with
great holes

  guns said harrington tonelessly beyond that
door- nodding sheffield ray guns ive got other
atomic release cartridges in them swing some out here
and point them at those planes this is just a make-
shift

  the staff officers of league headquarters afterward
wrote long accounts of how a mighty company air squad-
ron roaring toward the city had been blasted into noth-
ingness they had a good view from that high window

 i hus with cataclysmic suddenness victory came to
franklin bradfords cause director allen was
caught by a squad of venusians some hours later trying
to escape in an armored car toward the second metropo-
lis he was bound with much gusto by his ragged cap-
tors and taken back to judgment the news spread
more and more men came out of the hills to gaze in awe
at a torn city to take part in the activities of a new
freedom in a few hours after allens capture messages
were tapped out to every metropolis in vcnusia sur-
render or destruction

  the company rallied and fought back at first but
resistance was brief armored cars speeding at two
hundred miles an hour over the string straight inter city
roads went from metropolis to metropolis and left a new
order behind them for they were mounted with a weap-
on that made resistance futile the originnl settlers and
their descendants rose in a body throughout the nation
rebellion

throwing off the yoke which long years of diplomacy trick-
ery and armed power had fastened upon them in a
month the revolution was complete

  at the start of that tremendous social upheaval on the
giant receptor in the executive buildings a message from
earth had crackled the voice translators spoke it out

  recent dispatches concerning harrington acted upon
director allens refusal to communicate amounts to se-
dition league seized all company ships in new york
london and rome docks ten thousand men coming
across space stand by for orders signed-president
quinby

  to which after deliberation of the first venusian con-
gress hastily assembled this reply was sent

  company no longer in existence venus wants and
will have absolute independence details to follow
ten thousand men will have to parade in honor of new
republic signed president of venusian congress-
franklin bradford

  so did the old pioneer a hunted outcast for years come
into his own he was released from confinement to find
his jeqpie free and his son alive though much occu-
pied with a girl from the soul of whom a double burden
had been lifted

  harrington had wept as he held sheila in his arms

  they told me but i did not believe i thought it an-
other trick i was desperate and decided to let the wrath
of god deal with these inhuman monsters i dont know
how i nerved myself to hold that shell he admitted later
to a committee of scientists who had come over with the
earths squadron i had been collecting nuclear and
electronic concentrates for some time and using them to
form shells out of the sheffield casings but there was
no opportunity to reach the ones i had concealed in the
reserve ray guns baker and two men from whom i had
broken away were running toward me he shook his
grey head it aged me twenty years ill never meddle
with that terrible power again its all there formulae
and equipment other ways will be found of bringing
those two streams of basic electrical phenomena into con-
junction but be careful that is my admonition an
awful force is unleased when matter so annihilates itself
be careful for myself i thank god i found courage to
do what i have

  the league after negotiations parleys talks in code

the

on venus	

 talks on television screens wrangles and reservations
 granted the demand of independence came the day of
 the parade denly league representative of the execu-
 tive buildings

   i wonder dubois the explanation is that the people
 of the united states remembering their own history
 forced the league to acquiesce but i wonder he re-
 peated if the tiling in there nodding toward the lab-
 oratory buildings is not a bit responsible theres a
 terrible power in there dubois i think it means the end
 of war

   along the partially reconstructed length of radium
thruway marched the drilled forces of the league khaki
and blue and white and olive drab a platoon of venus-
ians swung into step and a cheer broke from watching
thousands salutes boomed out as a new flag green and
gold fluttered in the light venusian wind

   look at them said dubois nudging denly the
presidents party-i mean further along the porch look
at old bradford-his face- and they watched the old
erect president reviewing the march surrounded by in-
terested earth officials

   well to come out of a dungeon into the presidency
 of a great nation is something to be agitated about re-
 plied denly and the girl and boy by his side there
 with harrington-see-they are-

   happy said dubois with latin certainty young
with memories of a great adventure to hold them together
through life do you realize denly he asked that the
fate of a whole people has been decided by a drama af-
fecting just a few persons harrington would never
have unleashed that terrible power except under pressure
of desperation he thought his daughter dead himself
doomed to die for how could he any longer trust allen
word the meteor disaster had unbalanced allen com-
pletely with harrington in his hands he believed he
could cut loose from all human sanity i hear that both
he and his son are to be incarcerated for life

   fate said denly slowly watching lorry bradford and
 his wife standing in the presidential group on the wide
 porch to their left fate dubois mostly it is grim
 but this time it has brought happiness to thousands and
 freedom to a planet

   the salutes boomed again

in the july wonder stories is a new prize contest

  of late we have been hearing a good deal of com-
ment pro and con on our usual covers depicting an
incident from a story in the same issue some of
our readers have objected to these covers as being
too wild undignified and lacking aesthetic ap-
peal

  so after thinking deeply of the
subject the editor presents in the
july wonder stories a new idea
in covers and he submits it for
your consideration

  paul has executed this cover
and the effect may be termed strik-
ing if not puzzling

  there is however an idea be-
hind the cover and a good scientific
one at that see if you can de-
termine what the cover represents
and what your impressions and
thoughts are as you behold it
either in a close up view or 
feet away from it as stated the
editor had a sound scientific idea
underlying the design and it is up to you to find
out what it represents a word of caution no
story in the issue has any bearing on the cover

the voyage of the asteroid

by the author of the city of the living dead

i would have forgotten what day it was except for
mason he solemnly entered my bedroom that morn-
bearing a loaf of pound cake into which he had stuck
three dozen candles it made a sorry mess the more so
when he had lit the tapers and the
wax dripped an unwholesome pink
icing over all

  thirty-six years old he pro-
nounced brooding over his gift

you are very nicely divisible by
three and two in all their combina-
tions last year it was five and
seven and a little more unusual

but thirty-six is a very practical
number in many ways-how does
it feel

  this curse of absurd humor is
in my opinion one reason that dr

arthur finch mason is still only
an associate professor of mathema-
tics he was inordinately popular
with his students and he was very
successful in instilling in them not
only a knowledge of his subject but
a sincere liking for it as well but
he achieved his results only after
breaking half the rules
of pedagogy and his
fellow members on the
faculty observed his
progress with some dis-
trust

  we had been at col-
lege together - close
friends in fact three
years ago he had come
to me in deep distress
for his young wife had
died and he was once
more alone in the
world we had ob-
tained an apartment in
west th street and
moved in as permanent
partners living i n
new york can be a
lonely business and i
found mason an ideal
companion - sensible
and earnest beneath his
camouflage of absurd-
ity physically he was
tall and thin with pale
and rather distinguish-
ed features his de-
meanor was serious
and dignified a fact
which rendered his
drolleries all the more
remarkable and - to
some extent - incom-
prehensible

  now next year continued my friend you will have
reached a prime number-thirty-seven i wonder whether
a man is in his prime only when his age is theres an

idea the prime ages of man at one the puling infant
at three the walking talking terror

  i was not in the mood for nonsense that morning and
proceeded to the bathroom for a shower mason was
tenacious however and followed
me in over the noise of the show-
er  could hear him continuing his
witticism to its bitter end

   seven is the age of first sense
and schooling eleven and thirteen
arrive with puberty  

   i turned the water on full force
and drowned out his voice but
when i had finished bathing and
proceeded to get dressed he was still
at it

   thirty-seven he was saying is
the prime of life from then the
mainspring commences to unwind
this year bigelow is your last
year of youth

   breakfast silenced him at last
this particular morning was a sat-
urday and neither of u was com-
pelled to labor we settled down
to a day of ret i browsed
through a copy of lens
and bellows-the mag-
azine of which i am
editor - and mused
idly upon certain
changes i had in mind
for the next issue but
my mind refused to re-
main engaged upon the
print before me i
found myself i n a
sober thoughtful
mood masons mock
seriousness had had its
effect on me

   thirty-six years old
i thought rather soon
now it would be forty
then fifty then what
was i really doing the
kind of thing i wanted
to do with my life
my memory conjured
up myself at twenty-
a budding young nat-
uralist full of purpose
and courage once i
had other plans for my
career adventurous
expeditions to out-of-
the-way lands looking
for strange plants and
animals the thrill of
discovery the heady
wine of fame but here
 was and here was i
likely to remain until i died i could see the obituary
notices of my death they would be tucked away on in-
side pages of newspapers my own magazine would give

laurence manning

 tvfr manning ha here attempted and we be-
 lieve succeeded in picturing what an actual
 interplanetary journey might be like and what
 astronauts might expect to find upon other worlds

   his characters are not supermen they are not
 men who believe that a journey to another world
 might be a pleasureable picnic they are men of
 determination but men with the weaknesses all of
 us have our author has shown therefore how
 any of us might feel if tomorrow we were invited
 by a recognized scientific authority to make a trip
 to mars or venus

   the second question that occurs to readers is
 assuming it were possible to go to venus or mars
 what could one do there would there be the
 venusian or martian princess just waiting to mar-
 ry our hero and bestow unlimited wealth upon
 him or might our explorers meet dangers terrors
 discomforts so great that all attempts at explora-
 tion would completely fail and our explorers would
 be glad to get back to earth with their skins

    the editors after reading this story believe that
 by its simplicity and its sticking to realities it
 proves more exciting and more thrilling than the
 most fanciful of tales




wonder stories quarterly

a history of my life in a black-bordered page then ob-
livion

   i sighed and stirred restlessly in the comfortable lounge
chair

   whats the use of it all i exclaimed aloud

  mason looked up from his book there is an un-
written law against philosophy before noon what you
need is some exercise fresh air a glimpse of life and
motion lets go for a drive

   where to i queried listlessly

   the connecticut countryside should be worth a look
this time of year evergreens will be budding out-ma-
ples coming into leaf there are a thousand things to see

   all right ill take along a camera

   mason raised his eyebrows humorously of course
how could i have forgotten that detail

   we donned hats and coats and walked around to the
garage and started up riverside drive thus casually
commenced the series of events which led to the greatest
adventure of our lives there is an extraordinary order-
liness about life one little thing compels another to fol-
low it until the ultimate happening is inevitable

   the country was beautiful we went up through west-
chester county and inland across the state line into con-
necticut mason drove now and again we stopped while
i took a picture and a little after one oclock we had
lunch on sandwichcs and beer at a roadside stand

   i took the wheel after that and following the mood of
the moment turned into a side road and went for some
miles along it again i took an inviting branch road
and proceeded without thought or care for direction or
destination until we found ourselves bumping along par-
allel ruts in a single-track lane that wound in and about
hedges of cat-vine and alder

   tne spring sun brought out the fragrance of the leaves
and flowers and we stopped the car and climbed out i
was setting up the camera in this idyllic scene when it
happened a sudden hissing roar passed from right to
left overhead and i caught a glimpse of a round dark
thing flashing higher and higher until it disappeared in
the sky

   i turned to mason who was still staring with open
mouth

   what in heavens name was that

   mason stared without reply at the spot where it had
vanished suddenly i heard him gasp i looked up
eagerly there was an airplane descending swiftly to-
ward us its motor was evidently shut off for it made
no sound it sighed overhead not five hundred feet up
and seemed to be aiming for the ground just beyond the
hedgerow on our right we had a brief view of it and
strange enough it seemed the wings were unusually
short and stubby the fuselage was enormous in pro-
portion-perhaps fifty feet across and as much long it
was shaped like a cylinder and was dull silver in color
there did not seem to be any landing wheels

   come on mason burst excitedly through the hedge
and disappeared from view i followed tearing my
clothes on the thorns of the cat-vine but thinking nothing
of it we ran for five minutes up a slight slope of shrubs
and weeds and were stopped by a stone wall it was no
ordinary connecticut dry rubble wall but rose twelve
feet high and was well cemented trees made a thicket
which concealed its existence until we were within a few
feet of the obstruction

  now what i panted

ver it answered mason and with the agility of
a boy he commenced to climb a tree whose branches
brushed the top of the wall we managed to climb along

these branches and reach the jagged top without mishap
but our view was not better in the least beyond the wall
wc found that the ground rose heavily wooded it was
a scene of some charm and beauty but our curiosity was
too much aroused to permit our enjoying it

  there doesnt seem to be anyone in sight remarked
mason thoughtfully

  it would be trespassing i demurred

  im going down he announced determinedly

  and down we went hanging by our fingers and drop-
ping to the earth beneath we pushed our way stealthily
uphill through the woods for five minute-like school-
boys on an apple raid i began to realize the awkward-
ness of our position

  im going back mason suppose were caught here-
rather embarrassing for us dont you think it was just
an airplane anyway

  no airplane ever went as fast as that ive simply got
to see what it was come on bigelow nobody will see
us lets go to the top of this hill at least perhaps we
can see from there

  in a few moments we did indeed reach the top of the
hill and the edge of the woods at the same time the
ground dropped away before us in a slope porhqps a half
mile long rock and grass shared this incline and at the
foot a broad meadow country led the eye to wooded hills
some two miles beyond we looked down into a com-
pletely-enclosed valley

  a lake lay in the meadowland it was some miles in
length and half that in width on the far side stood a
tall building of peculiar shape partly pulled up on the
shore lay our airplane-if it was one even at that dis-
tance we could make out the figures of men around it and
presently a huge derrick swung out from the side of the
building and the strange ship began to crawl slowly farther
up the shore we were at a loss for an explanation of
anything we saw i was just going to speak to mason
when a crisp voice startled me

  put them up

  we swung around and gazed guiltily at a very large
revolver holding it was a short sturdy person very red
of face he was dressed in brown knee breeches and
leather leggings a rough khaki shirt and peaked cap
completed his attire red-faced ourselves wc put our
hands in the air

   he pointed along the crest of the hill to the left

  march lie ordered

  we obeyed a faint path was marked through the
brush and this we followed for not more than a hundred
yards when the wall came again into sight a grilled iron
gate was let into it at this point our captor commanded
us to unlatch it we did so and passed through where-
upon he closed and locked the gate behind us

  we stood on the roadway feeling for my own part
decidedly foolish our late captor eyed us phlegmati-
cally through the grill

  what is this place demanded mason

  he received no answer and i could see his cheek flush
with anger

  who owns it i queried impatiently

  youd best move  said the man in brown ive
no information to give out

  i was quite irritated my good man i said firmly
we are respectable men and have asked you civil ques-
tions whatever your orders may be they do not include
incivility to strangers i am sure

  his grin made me more annoyed than ever with a
senseless desire to impress the man i fumbled for my
card case and handed a card through the gate

  if you will be so good as to give that to your master
the voyage of the asteroid



i requested with what i hoped was biting dignity and
explain to him that we saw his airplane and followed its
course out of natural curiosity i will give you a dollar
oh all right he said curtly  twill do you no good
though

  i handed in the dollar and we walked in silence back
to the car mason drove at a vicious pace and we soon
came out upon a well-surfaced road we found ourselves
only seven miles from silverminc according to the sign-
post being so close to the seacoast wc kept our course
along various roads leading southeast until we reached
the boston post road and thence back to new york it
was evening when we reached our apartment

  what did you give that fool your card for growled
mason

  it was the proper thing to do i answered flushing
slightly at the memory  wish i knew who the brute is
mason grunted and proceeded to disrobe he entered
the bathroom and i heard the shower running  was in
no mood for sleep the events of the day had somehow
turned my mind back fifteen years a great discontent
possessed me i rooted about in the bottom of my trunk
and brought to light my notes on paleobotany i turned
the pages moodily surprised to find that my work had
been rather good some photographs of specimens were
pasted in the pages of the notebook to remind me of my
one summer of unalloyed joy collecting fossil plants in
montana

  mason came into the room clad in his bathrobe

  some people have all the luck he said think of
owning a hidden valley in connecticut and having nothing
to do but experiment with flying machines

  he sighed do you know he added im going to
take my sabbatical year starting this summer im get-
ting bored with all this

  where will you go i asked enviously

  i think i can get perkins to let me in at the mount
wilson observatory hes going to work on spectro-
scopic analyses of the planets next year it should be
fun ive always been interested in the subject

  curious you should mention your astronomy i have
just been thinking about my own hobby-looking up my
notes on paleobotany

  mason nodded soberly what we both need is some
excitement he said

tt was i believe on the next wednesday that a series of
- small mysterious events commenced i had just re-
turned to my office after lunch when jackson my assistant
told me that i had had a caller during my absence

  said he was from the mutual insurance company
offered jackson asked for you but when i told him
you were out he said it didnt matter all he wanted was
to find out if you really worked here matter of form 
took it checking up for that new policy you are taking
out with his company you know

  but jackson i am not taking out an insurance policy
with the mutual or any other company

  jackson looked surprised

must have been someone else then    but he seemed
to be certain of your name stephen bigelow he said
i inquired as to what sort of things he wanted to know
apparently he had confined his questions to my business
connections

  oh yes added jackson he asked if you kept mostly
in the office or went out-of-doors a good deal seemed to
think you were a botanist

  what did he look like

  but my assistant only remembered that he had been

rather short and slight pleasant sort of fellow you
know

  i dismissed the matter from my mind until i got back
to the apartment that evening sam the colored elevator
boy spoke to me

  dere was a man askin about you-all here today suh
suh

  what did he want sam

  oh-jess wanted to make sure you-all lived heah i
reckon said he was fum a depahment stoah mister
bigelow

  mason was in the apartment when i opened the door
i told him and he was as mystified as i

  i have no account with any department store mason
and i am taking out no insurance what do you suppose
is going on

  and the next evening when i got home after work
mason informed me that our mysterious and indefatigable
questioner had been up at the university asking about him

  you dont suppose i suggested hesitantly that it
has anything to do with my giving my name up in con-
necticut saturday

  why on earth should it besides that would be only
your name why should anyone poke his nose into my
affairs i didnt leave any fool card

  well perhaps he got your name from sam at the ele-
vator when he called yesterday i hazarded

  mason smiled come he said brightening visibly
here wc are saying perhaps to things well-perhaps
then perhaps its all a deep-laid plot of italian racket-
eers tired of robbing restaurants and fruit stands they
are going to levy tribute on all salaried men ten per-
cent of our income-or they bump us off in some unusual
and mysterious way

  for heavens sake mason cant you be serious

  perhaps you are really heir to an earldom and the
solicitors arc making prudent investigations into your
habits before  

  but i put my fingers to my ears and commenced reading
a book widi exaggerated concentration

  friday night we had a visitor mason and i were quiet-
ly reading when the doorbell rang i answered it and in
the hall outside stood a rather tall well-dressed man
his face was shrouded in black whiskers and a well-
trimmed beard tapered to his chest

  docs mr stephen bigelow live here he asked in a
deep bass voice

  i am mr bigelow i replied

  my visitor stared doubtfully in the half-light of the
vestibule why  believe you are bigelow he ex-
claimed do you remember me im haworth-used
to know you at columbia

  it was my turn to stare for his beard was a thorough
disguise certainly there was something familiar about
the man come in i invited i certainly remember
haworth -but i cant say as much for his beard

  i had completely forgotten of course you wouldnt
recognize me this way he said apologetically as he en-
tered he stared a moment at my friend why it is   
isnt this mason he exclaimed

  it is i replied and they shook hands cordially mason
had known haworth rather better than i and seemed to
recognize him in spite of changes

  haworth explained his presence happened to be in
town tonight with nothing to do i thought i remembered
that bigelow lived in new york so i looked him up in
the phone hook found his address and dropped over
im staying at the grandison just up the street a block
fancy my finding mason here as well he exclaimed
how are the mathematics
	wonder stories quarterly

  we talked for some time about other days i had to
explain that biology-while still my hobby-had not con-
tinued to be my sole work in the world

  curious that photography-a mere side line to my
original life-work-should not provide me with a living 
 said

  but haworth was much interested in photography it
appeared and nothing would do but he must see some of
my pictures

  and masons astronomical leanings were duly recol-
lected and his plans for a year at the observatory on
mount wilson outlined

  how are you on navigation mason asked haworth
suddenly

  we both looked at him in surprise he seemed embar-
rassed and muttered some words into his beard

  to tell the truth he explained i am planning a
trip to  to some out-of-the-way parts this coming year
er   ah  part of the way by air he seemed to be
choosing his words with great care i need a good navi-
gator not only that but a man i can trust as a traveling
companion as well i thought perhaps    well if you
werent absolutely settled on going to the coast next
year

   his voice trailed off ineffectually

  mason puffed quietly at his pipe

  i dont know what sort of a trip is it going to be

  scientific exploration replied haworth as a mat-
ter of fact i could use a naturalist too particularly if
he were handy with a camera he turned to me it
would be absolutely ideal if we could all three go along
now if you could drop your magazine for a year bige-
low we could  

  just a moment haworth i interrupted how did
you know i worked on a magazine

  oh damn he replied he seemed to think a minute
and then shrugged his shoulders i might have known
i couldnt carry it through never was any good at this
sort of thing ill have to make a clean breast of it

  you certainly will and i strode over to stand be-
tween him and the door by which he had entered

chapter ii

haworths proposal

he looked at me quizzically oh its notliing much
to tell he said you neednt get excited one
of my men caught you nosing around at my place last
saturday

  mason rose excitedly so youre the man what on
earth kind of flying machine have you got there why
are you so secretive about it

  and why have you been putting detectives upon us
i added

  one at a time one at a time replied our visitors
im not going to say just now what kind of a vessel ive
been building but i really am going on a trip in her
and i am really looking for two men to go with me
curiously enough you two are exactly qualified-made
to order for the job thats why i came to look you
over and make your acquaintance again i see you havent
changed much since the old days-men sometimes do
you know

  when jones brought me your card bigelow i was
just on the point of writing our old professor to see if
he could recommend anyone for the post but i remem-
bered you had been trained as a naturalist and i wrote a
detective agency to look you up as soon as i got a re-

eort from them that you were living with mason-well
ere i am

  he peered at us shrewdly come what do you say
a trip of indefinite duration plenty of excitement and
plenty of danger too i must admit but theres a chance
if we succeed to make yourselves famous from one end
of the world to the other there will be enough new
material to make a dozen scientific treatises we wont
fail for lack of capital that i can assure you my people
left me well-off-ive more money than i can spend as a
matter of fact but ill spend every cent of it if need be
thats all very well haworth i said but where
are you going you cant expect us to start off with you
like this speaking for myself at least i should want to
see your airplane and study your plans most carefully
before i pretended to make any decision whatsoever
and so you shall said haworth nodding bis head
decisively so that his beard raised and lowered itself on his
chest the ships sound enough youll find and as
for our destination i would even go so far as to take
your advice in the matter mason what i really want
to know tonight is whether all other things being satis-
factory you would consider such an adventure how
about you

  humm x eeing unknown and y not given find their
respective values replied mason thoughtfully ifs
quite a pig-in-a-poke business haworth but if it proves
interesting-of course id be interested wouldnt i id
go that is provided bigelow would go along too how
about it old man

  the whole suggestion was so unusual and irregular that
i could not master a rising irritation

  what an absurd way to propose a scientific expedi-
tion if you mean to ask us whether we could go if we
wanted to i can only say of course we could someone
else could take over my work i presume some remunera-
tion would be provided haworth

  he nodded emphatically without speaking

  why dont you tell us frankly what kind of a trip you
have in mind i burst forth i dont like this air of
mystery at all

  neither do i bigelow was the surprising rejoinder
this is  usual trip i plan i have found it does not
pay to talk about it some have seen fit to ridicule it and
so im trying to keep it quiet until plans are farther along
then too i will have certain inventions to put through the
patent office ill agree to this much however sleep
on it tonight tomorrow well have lunch together at the
grandison and if you can say that you arc honestly inter-
ested-no more than that-ill tell you the whole story
and you can make a definite decision

  and since he gathered up his hat and cane at this point
and bade us a determined good night we had to be contcnt
with that

  next morning i awoke early and lay quietly in bed i
felt for some unknown reason that i should be happy
and excited about something it was several minutes be-
fore i remembered the events of the previous evening and
i was suddenly thrilled and interested i glanced at my
bedside alarm-clock and since it read only eight oclock
i did not rise-although i was by now thoroughly awake

  saturday morning once more i thought and nothing
in particular to do our appointment with haworth was
for lunch my thoughts went back the long vista of sat-
urday mornings i had spent in this apartment and the
drab comfort of it seemed for no good reason quite un-
alluring i analyzed my feelings and came to realize just
how dulled and bored my senses had been for months
past i made up my mind then and there that if ha-
worths proposal proved in any way a sensible one that t
the voyage of the asteroid



should certainly accept it what kind of a trip i thought
would require an airplane such as we had seen last week
possibly it occurred to me some very inaccessible coun-
try like    like the country of the amazon for instance
perhaps that was where haworth proposed exploring i
was on the point of rising to suggest this to mason when
he appeared yawning in my doorway

  half past eight he announced how do you feel
about haworth this morning

  what do you know about him i countered

  mason lrowned sleepily you remember him at col-
lege well lets see now you were there that night
he left poor chap his father was haworth of the ha-
worth silk millions left it all behind him when he was
killed that night iharlin haworth was the only son i
havent heard anything about him for years so i dont
know any more than you what he has been up to but at
college he majored in physics and astronomy he had
some rather sound theories on general science and some
fairly wild ones on political economy rather a steady
chap id say and persistent obstinate in fact but lies
a good sort and should have both the necessary brains and
money to get up something real in the way of an exploring
trip

i asked mason what he thought of the possibility that
haworths goal might be the amazon river country
and we soon had an atlas out  the table measuring dis-
tances and reckoning probable courses by ten oclock
we sat down to breakfast half persuaded that we had
guessed the purpose of the voyage we need not be criti-
cized for this since there is a vast area absolutely unex-
plored and unattainable by ordinary means of travel

  time dragged slowly that morning at twelve oclock
we dressed and departed being unable to wait longer i
found myself full of overpowering curiosity and eager-
ness at the grandison haworth sent down word to wait
in the lobby and fortunately for our patience which was
fast departing he arrived a few minutes after we had re-
ceived his message

  well he asked

  mason looked at me and i nodded determinedly we
will probably go with you i said now tell us what
its all about

  but haworth seemed unwilling to do this immediately
and i found some of the annoyance and suspicion of last
night returning to me

  lt us have our lunch first he demurred im hun-
gry we will have all the rest of the day you know

  i cannot now recall anything that i ate that meal pos-
sibly i never knew somehow it way finished and our
cigarettes were alight

  you know haworth weve guessed pretty well where
you are going anyway

  he looked up startled

  mason nodded his head sagaciously its the amazon
river isnt it

  haworth colored slightly his hand fingered his beard
nervously not exactly he replied that ought to be
done sometime of course but i am planning a more in-
teresting trip than that by long odds

  he reached into his pocket and produced a photographic
print

  look this over he said and i thought he seemed em-
barrassed

  mason and i put our heads together over the photograph
it was seemingly a white ball set in a black background
the plate was foggy and the picture not a very clear one
there seemed no purpose in showing it to us

  i looked up inquiringly

  look closely at it urged haworth

  and i did the white ball was the earth there
faintly marked on its surface were the continents of
north and south america slightly obscured by patches of
vague grey

  cood lord exploded mason

  exactly observed haworth and puffed a cloud of
smoke contentedly toward the ceiling

but i was just beginning to realize the implications
do you mean to say i began that this photograph  
haworth held up his hand and i stopped that pho-
tograph was taken by me with a small kodak two months
ago

  then where were you i asked in bewilderment
  about two thousand miles above the earth

  not in the ship we saw of course of course
exclaimed mason

  the same some slight changes had been made when
you saw it but substantially the same ship replied our
host

  but man alive shouted mason forgetting our sur-
roundings entirely then our expedition  is going
to be    great heavens

  exactly nodded charles haworth great heavens
and wherever in them wc want to voyage

  wc need not have been as startled as wc were after
all professor goddard had been writing and experiment-
ing since  on vehicles for travel in airless space
there had been much discussion of its possibilities in the
daily press during  and  personally i did not
quite understand what it was all about but i recollected
one evening seeing posted on the notice board in the mus-
eum of natural history word to the affcct that the amer-
ican interplanetary society was holding a meeting i had
been slightly amazed when i had made inquiries and
learned that his society had for its object the furtherance
of plans for travel to other planets but all this was in-
sufficient to prepare me for haworths photograph

  masons clear-cut features were in profile as i turned
to him his eyes flashed eagerly and his jaw tensely
clenchcd

  you actually flew out that distance and returned
safely

  my dear mason haworth answered amusedly i did
so four times

  why be surprised he continued esnault-pelterie
and herman oberth have both published detailed scien-
tific discussions of such a possibility goddard in this
country has built and flown successful rocket vehicles-
not to any great height perhaps but distance is a mere
matter of proportion i have just gone a little further
along the road of discovery

but i interposed are we then to understand that our
proposed scientific expedition is to take us into space in
this-this rocket is it not-and our goal is to be    
but mason was on his feet and starting for the door of
the restaurant

  come along be called hurry beforethis dream
ends and wc all wake up

  and we left that place with the stares of the other diners
following us

  haworth had a car and chauffeur outside the grandi-
son wailing this visible sign of wealth gave me a sense
of the reality of things we headed for connecticut vol-
uble and excited but i had one major puzzle still to be
solved

  this car i commenced doubtfully proceeds along
the road because the wheels push it forward with great
force an airplane travels rapidly and powerfully through
the atmosphere because the propeller nas air to grip on


wonder stories quarterly

but how may i ask can any vehicle travel forward under
power if there is nothing but empty space about it on
what will the engines expend their thrust

  mason shook his head you stick to your photographs
and be a good little naturalist bigelow you dont un-
derstand physics

  but i must understand this

  very well the principle of recoil is what propels a
rocket for every action there must be an equal and op-
posite action are you satisfied

  i dont know quite what you are talking about sup-
pose  am in space  want to move to the left how shall
 proceed to do so

  haworth interrupted suppose there are two barrels
in space fastened end to end you bigelow are in one of
the barrels in the other is merely some ballast of stones
between the two barrels is a small charge of dynamite

i nodded understandingly

now my problem is to move you to the left eh

   i began to see light

  the dynamite explodes the two barrels are thrown
violently apart the ballast is thrown away to the right
but the barrel which contains mr stephen bigelow is
moved to the left quod erai demonstrandum

  thats so i cried but such an explosion would
hardly be called power flight how would you proceed
after that

  very simply instead of one barrel to throw away
i will have ten thousand one after the other i hurl them
from me each one lending the force of its recoil to my
vessel which attains huge speeds

  naturally enough i do not use real barrels-they are
purely figurative in practice the most efficient thing to
throw away is the waste gaseous product of an explosion
or of steady combustion from the tail of my vessel the
white hot gases pour at a speed of more than two miles a
second is it any wonder that after a few seconds of this
discharge the ship moves rapidly back in recoil from this
roaring exhaust

  but can that produce power enough

  wait until you have been deafened and thrilled by its
fury

  i had begun at last to understand the matter when we
turned down the lane of our adventure the week before
but this time we had the main gate opened wide for us
the red-faced keeper was eyeing us phlegmatically ha-
worth called him over to the side of the car

  jones this is mr mason and this is mr bigelow
they are going to be with me for some weeks they will
help me run the asteroid

  it was a small triumph but jones was as impassive as
ever mason leaned past me and handed him a dollar

  i think both mr bigelow and myself should start
even he remarked

   caught a twinkle of amusement in haworths eye and
wc drove on the road came suddenly around a sharp
turn and we rolled to a stop before a fine colonial man-
sion

  mason and i were intent upon an instant visit to the
ship a walk of n hundred yards through a strip of
woods brought us to the shore of the lake beside a most
unusual building we had seen this before from a dis-
tance it was huge and in shape suggested an old-fash-
ioned grain elevator painted black a small door gave
us access to the interior and we pressed eagerly inside
haworth following ns now for the first time we realized

the enormous proportions of the vessel we had seen soft
and sheer she gleamed above our heads a full hundred
feet or more until her tapering nose was lost in the dusk
of the hangar

  haworth patted the metal hull affectionately tried
and tested he said and a sweet job by and large
he stepped outside a moment and called for bill bill
proved to be a capable-looking mechanic who came up to
the door of the great shed chewing a straw and eyeing
mason and myself curiously we were introduced

  shes all finished mr haworth he said except for
fitting her into the first step i have the new liquefying
plant running now filling the main oxygen tanks over in
the cove

  haworth turned to us of course this ship here isnt
nearly large enough for an extended trip at really high
speeds this is just the paying cargo so to speak that
will fit into the nose of the actual vessel that will be
more than eight times as large well see her later on
shes completely finished and being fueled now-half a
mile down the lake

  the big ship the first step we call her-starts off into
space and takes us out until her fuel is gone then we
discard her and go the rest of the way in the asteroid here
and even the asteroid is only a second step she carries
a little eighty-ton vessel in her nose that will make the
final stages of the return light with us inside

  how big is the first step then

  about five thousand tons replied haworth and bill
nodded confirmation

  what fuel do you use

  gasoline and liquid oxygen you see bigelow there
isnt any air where wc are going so we have to take along
oxygen in order to burn the fuel and the fuel isnt
exactly gasoline-there arc one or two things added that
make a deal of difference in results you know how much
more efficient ethyl gas is than ordinary gasoline well
ethyl gas isnt the end of the story by any means weve
got a fuel several times better for our purpose than pure
gasoline ill show you the formula later on but that
is one of the things not to be made public

  each step is a complete ship it has fuel tanks and
pumps and a refrigerating system and an explosion cham-
ber for burning the fuel it has exhaust tubes and steer-
ing tubes for propelling the ship but of course only
the final eighty-ton vessel has a cabin or a control system
my experimental and test flights have all been made in the
asteroid-the second step with the little vessel in its nose
she weighs  tons  of which are the cargo this
cargo consists of the little vessel in which is placed myself
and all equipment it costs only about s to fuel
the asteroid-a two-step unit-so i have used her on all
test flights to save expense

  to save expense

  yes to fuel the entire three-step unit would cost
over  explained haworth moreover theres
no need to test the whole if two steps work properly
then so will three as a matter of fact im all through
testing were about ready now for the actual voyage

  where shot mason his eyes bright with excitement

  ilaworth looked at him a moment in silent approval
good man thats a question you must help me de-
cide he consulted his watch its five now i sug-
gest we go up to the house and have some food and spend
the entire evening determining that very point it miht
make some difference in construction and eauioment
the voyage of the asteroid	

chapter iii

final preparations

t ut i was unwilling to depart from the vicinity of the
hangar until i had been inside the asteroid haworth
led the way up a ladder of aluminum streamlined rungs
let into the hull one by one we labored up the vertical
ascent and crowded into a liny vestibule at the top ha-
worth used a key and we tumbled through a massive steel
doorway into a most peculiar room lights were set flush
with the walls in all directions the floor was a circle
some fifty feet across the ceiling was only eight feet
high except at the sides where it extended upward for full
thirty feet more it was as though a huge metal cylinder
occupied all the central part of what would otherwise have
been a circular room more than thirty feet high and fifty
across in the floor under this huge cylinder was a hole
some five feet across peering through this i observed an-
other room similarly designed but having its central space
occupied by much complicated machinery and tubing

  that is our sleeping cabin said haworth this up
here is the navigation room

  and all this asked mason pointing at the cylinder
overhead

  that is our combined pump and refrigerating plant
for liquid oxygen can only be kept under intensely low
temperatures it is placed in this cabin for the sake of
availability but the center of the room is valueless any-
way you see when we are under way with full speed
up and the engines silent we become a free-falling body
there is no gravity incidentally it is the most sickening
sensation in the world or out of it i know for i have
felt it

  so i designed this ship to revolve as it travels-like a
rifle bullet the rotation causes everything to fall toward
the outside-centrifugal force you know the faster the
ship revolves the greater is the pressure which acts as an
effective substitute for gravity but as you can figure
for yourselves that would make these walls seem to be
floors you will find yourself in a sort of gigantic revolv-
ing squirrel cage you can walk around it in a hundred
steps and be back where you started if you were here
bigelow and mason upside down on the far wall there
you would each seem to look up and see the other stand-
ing head down from the ceiling

  mason called from the hole in the floor through which
lie was peering on hands and knees and so this is where
we sleep

  haworth lay down beside him four cots were suspend-
ed from pivoting supports so as to always hang in a
horizontal position interesting-looking apparatus and
cabinets and lockers could be seen here and there on the
walls and set into the floor

  food and rest department explained haworth
everything has been boiled down to the lightest possible
weight but without undue skimping i flatter myself that
there is provision for every comfort aboard all of it is
in that room

  books asked i

  ive solved that problem with the encyclopedia brit-
annica its out of sight behind that water tank

  drinks suggested mason

  of course said haworth beer and wine take up too
much room but there are whiskey brandy and rum for
food we have a large refrigerator and can feast on fresh
meat and eggs the whole trip but plenty of canned food
is packed away just in case it is needed

the mention of food reminded us that wc were hungry

and we made our way back to the vestibule haworth
made us wait while he shut the metal door behind us

  test conditions he explained ever since she was
finished i have kept artificial atmosphere going in her in
actual operation the outer door of this air-lock entrance
would bo closed as well

  you mean that inside there we were breathing artificial
air

  certainly why do you ask

  because it was fresh and pure how long has the
cabin been hermetically sealed

  more than twelve months oh it is thoroughly tested
we shall not perish from lack of atmosphere i promise
you

  we climbed down the metal rungs in the gloom of
the hangar the vessel rose enormous-suggestive i real-
ized more and more what was portending and my enthus-
iasm mounted with every step back to haworths house

  after dinner we sat in a huge library and smoked and
drank pre-prohibition nectar if we were to go to the
moon said haworth we would have to wear diving-
-suits to walk around on the ground-because theres no
atmosphere on the moon

  even on mars said mason theres so little air that
we would have to wear an oxygen helmet

  now on venus   

  but seriously i put in theres more than a quar-
ter million miles of space between us and the moon mars
or venus are several hundred times as far why not at
least start with the moon surely that is enough of a
trip later on perhaps  

  but haworth interrupted distance makes little dif-
ference only the additional time involved in accomplish-
ing it to reach the moon the asteroid would have to
travel about seven miles a second as it left our atmos-
phere she would pick up that speed in the first ten min-
utes of travel after that we would shut off the engines
and coast along to our destination-whatever it might be
the moon would require a few days coasting-mars would
take a few months

  coast along for a few months

  why of course put in mason there is no air to
resist the motion gravity grows steadily slighter and
seven miles a second is just fast enough so that the pull
of gravity would never stop our vessel entirely on she
would go through space her progress getting slower and
slower hut never ceasing

  i was by now nodding my agreement of course the
earth itself was she not just coasting along around the
sun she had been doing so for millions of years making
a steady eighteen miles a second i simply had not thought
of it that way

  now venus mason was saying is the one planet
nearest the earth both in position and in size it has a
very dense atmosphere indeed its surface is completely
hidden behind the clouds which would temper the great
heat of the sun for the planet is closer to the sun than
is the earth in all the heavens this is the one planet
so far as we know where it is at least possible for man
to live a natural life-untrammcled by pressure suits
and cumbrous aids to breathing the moon is a barren
waste mars-just possibly mars might be barely habi-
table by a race of super-mountaineers used to the thin
air but venus is where we should first point our flight
but said haworth there arc other factors besides
atmosphere take temperature for instance some as-
tronomers say that venus keeps one face always toward
the sun and the other always toward outer space if that
were so then the former would be boiling hot and the
latter very cold


wonder stories quarterly

mason nodded as one who meets an expected ob-
stacle the latest tests show definitely that the
dark side of venus radiates heat now if this dark side
never turned itself to the rays of the sun it could not be
in the least warm for even a dense atmosphere could not
prevent it cooling in the course of ages besides if we
believe the atmosphere will prove too warm we can al-
ways land near the north or south poles of venus and
proceed from there toward the equator until or unless the
temperature becomes unbearable

  a great deal more was said on both sides but we ended
our evenings discussion with a toast to our determined
goal

  to venus

  what was more important to my peace of mind ha-
worth came out frankly and simply omitting nothing he
told us his entire story of the conception and building of
the asteroid to my mind he presented himself as a sane
and sober worker thoroughly grounded in his subject my
own knowledge of engineering was quite insufficient to de-
termine the practicability of our enterprise i was forced
to rely on haworths integrity but by the end of that
evening i had quite determined to trust my life to his ob-
vious skill and knowledge

  this is hardly the time or place for a resumfi of his life
only his extreme reticence about his affairs in public per-
suades me to mention the highlights in very brief fashion

  bereft suddenly of his parents and embarrassed with un-
wanted millions he had retired to his connecticut estate
and nursed his grief in solitude he determined to con-
tinue his studies and had a superb laboratory built for his
experiments month after month he worked methodically
and patiently making minor discoveries in several fields
of knowledge then he evolved a theory for control of
liquid fuels in rocket space ships-a subject that had it
appeared always fascinated him he applied his entire
faculties to the problem and spared neither effort nor ex-
pense no less than twelve very expensive models had
been built and rejected one after the other before the de-
sign for the asteroid was tried

  he had endeavored to maintain as much secrecy as pos-
sible-not only from policy but for fear of ridicule to
which he had thoughtlessly exposed himself once or twice
to this end such workmen and technical assistants as he
had needed had been carefully selected and employed to
reside permanently on the estate which was well guarded
as we had discovered on our first brief visit

  with the completion of the asteroid herself test flights
chiefly by night had been made at low speeds compara-
tively speaking haworth had used the lake both for start-
ing and landing his ship which indeed could not land
its great tonnage safely on any other medium than water
he told us of his first trip without emotion describing his
sensations in cold medical terms and couching his lan-
guage with so much quiet reserve that the enthusiasm he
might justly have expressed lodged itself in his hearers
here was a man i felt whom i could trust to proceed
with sanity and caution mason i could sense shared
my feelings

  whether it was the wine we drank or the heady nature
of our discussion and plans i do not know but i lay for
hours on haworths guest bed clad in his pajamas laid
out for me by his valet unable to sleep my head was in
a whirl of excitcment

  i could not help wondering as i lay reflecting upon
the happenings of the day just why three normal human
binps should be so glad of an opportunity to leave their
native planet there was no slightest question but that
we wer glad i mused upon this lure of the undiscov-
ered what was this motive of sheer curiosity that drove

men to all sorts of unexplainable actions we had per-
haps inherited it from our simian ancestors for it was as
natural as breathing

  why had columbus voyaged to the americas was it
purely an attempt to reach the indies or had the divine
urge driven him on why was marco polo not content
with his native venice why were englishmen though
professing an overpowering love for their little island
such inveterate wanderers

  on the one hand i reflected a thrilling plunge into the
abyss perhaps to end in oblivion unknown to the world
or perhaps to result in fame and glory for us all with
the fine thrill of achievement thrown in but on the other
hand the comforts and convenience of our present life
soft beds an instant satisfaction of our whims through
the mechanism of modern civilization an assurance of
safety today as i write this i cannot see but that the
latter picture was the alluring one but on that night it
seemed to me the very antithesis of everything worthwhile
drab and dull days and nights old age slowly creeping
upon me desire and zest burning out year by year until
the dried-up shell of the man loves life no longer the
prospect seemed quite insupportable change and adven-
ture liad been thrown in my path by fortunate chance now
it was here it seemed absolutely essential to existence

  what might be the results of our expedition supposing
it to be successful the effect would be enormous as
europe in the earthly sixteenth century awakened from a
long sleep and brave deeds and high adventure strutted
the stage of life-so upon our return would the whole
world wake to new possibilities and still wider vistas but
foremost of all was the thought that i stephen bigelow
was to be the naturalist on an expedition to venus the
first studies ever made of life as it might be found on an-
other planet of all the paradises which i could imagine
what could be more enticing

  fame success and above all interesting vital absorb-
ing work the risks-pshaw for such a reward what
were risks after all a trip to the gobi desert or to the
jungles of africa was not without its risks everything
worth doing entailed a hazard of some sort i fell asleep
and dreamed that i was being greeted at new york upon
my return thousands of policemen on motorcycles es-
corted me up broadway and the people all cheered and
threw confetti

  the next morning was sunday and after breakfast mason
asked for three things an astronomical almanac some
writing materials and a little privacy haworth had some
business to attend to and i wandered by myself down to
the lake i followed the shore and rounding a wooded
headland came up a scene of exceeding activity a dozen
men stood about a huge silver vessel some three hundred
feet in length and more than a hundred feet in diameter
it lay in a cradle of wooden spars and frames behind
it was a low building of brick with smoke issuing from a
tall chimney there was no noise except for a rhythmic
thump and clang which issued from the building and an
occasional voice calling for bill

  i walked around the vessel and perceived in one end a
huge circular opening evidently intended to house the
asteroid the other extremity flared out in smooth flanges
which were the exhaust tubes i peered up one of these
it was about a foot in diameter i could see only a short
distance into the dark interior of the vessel

tll came to my side isnt she a pretty job he
asked were filling her tanks with gas and liquid
oxygen now inside her the refrigerating pumps are
working away to keep the oxygen liquid but you cant
the voyage of the asteroid



hear them out here im going to test the ignition want
to see it

  i did of course bill called to the men and everyone
left the vicinity of the exhaust end of the ship bill took
me into the brick building and walked up to a series of
dials and levers against one wall

  we have everything connected up in the workshop here
wien the aneroid is fitted in her the controls will be in
the navigating cabin naturally enough now im going to
give her just enough fuel to stir her slightly

  i looked out the doorway at the ship the exhaust tubes
i noticed all faccd the lake suddenly a deafening roar
broke out like thunder a fierce blast of flame licked out
far over the lake and then vanished the huge hull moved
a few inches in her wooden cradle and was still again

   everything fine remarked bill in the startling silence
but ill have lo scrape the spark points in the lower port
sector it seemed to me they lagged just a little bit

  i left them at it and walked back toward the hangar
feeling more than a little thoughtful haworth was in the
shed when i arrived it was lunch time he announced
and we proceeded back to the house

  mason was looking for us if we want to start this
year he said we had better get busy as nearly as i
can see we should plan to leave about may th to get
the full benefit of the position of venus in her orbit
but i objected that leaves us only four weeks
fine approved haworth we wont have to wait
so long

  mason and i left after lunch haworth sent his car in
with us we reached our apartment and devoted the rest
of the day and evening to our personal preparations for
myself these consisted largely in a list of people to see
and things to do in the next few days cameras and film
compact folding specimen boxes a few indispensible
books and instruments-all of which i already possessed
the following day i had to make arrangements about
leaving the paper in charge of my quite capable assistant
jackson beyond that i reflected there was really noth-
ing absolutely essential

  i shall omit the ordinary detail of the next few days
on wednesday night we packed the last of our things and
left the apartment for the last time mason told me that
he had seen his department head that monday

  friedland took it all right the term is practically
through anyway and ive been hinting all winter that i
might take next year sabbatical but he wanted to know
where i was going  

  i nodded the owner of my paper had been curious
as well i had been forced to tell him outright that my
destination was a secret

  but mason i did tell him this much-that on my re-
turn i hoped to have some photographs that would increase
the circulation of lens and bellows more in a week than
it had grown during the last ten years what did you
tell friedland

  i said that traveling at thirty miles an hour it would
take more than one hundred years for me to arrive but
that if i lived i would go there and back in less than a
year

  i laughed and he

  threw up his hands and told me to be off

  we went out to connecticut that evening so as to be
ready the next morning to commence preparations in ear-
nest mason was already at breakfast when i went down
stairs after a good sleep he hurried his meal and rushed
off to the library there was he said an enormous amount
of calculating to be done before we would know where
to aim for and when

  if we can be ready by the th of may i can save a
great deal of calculating for it happens that bisset and
schwartz took that particular date in their book for
figuring the relative positions of venus and earth it
will save me several solid days of work and i will need
the saving

  as a matter of fact we saw little or nothing of him
from that lime on he had ordered three calculating
machines and haworth had hired him a small staff of
assistants the library hummed with activity they
even went to the length of having their noon meal brought
in to them there

  i went over my equipment with haworth and asked
about weapons he had thought of them already he
showed me the arsenal he had decided on  repeating
rifles firing both explosive and solid shells

  these plus one portable machine gun a lewis for
emergencies ought to take care of us 

  then there were hatchets knives colt automatics and
even a store of tear-gas bombs he glanced over my
cameras and told me i would find better ones already on
board in fact i could suggest nothing that he had not
already thought of and provided for i finally did add
to the equipment certain items of specimen cases jars of
formaldehyde and a powerful and compact microscope
haworth weighed this in his hand reflectively but handed
it back without comment

  armed with a detailed plan of the control cabin i
prowled about in the nose of the asteroid marveling at
the completeness and quality of her fittings i spent
several days familiarizing myself with everything

  then haworth decided the asteroid was several hundred
pounds overweight and we spent a hectic two days cut-
ting down on the equipment my microscope went into
the discard with other things chiefly these were spare
space suits he left just one suit for each of us they
were much like diving suits having a metal helmet and
heavy rubber body designed to be pumped full of air at
fifteen pounds per square inch pressure they would be
essential should we have to leave the ship when she was
not in suitable atmosphere-either on earth or on venus
and when on venus they might be needed for while there
is a dense atmosphere yet it might prove poisonous

  the last week the oxygen fuel pumps were put in opera-
tion to replenish the asteroids tanks a small mountain
of gas cylinders was brought in trucks for this purpose
and piled outside the shed then the water tank had to
be filled with fresh water and the air conditioning appara-
tus tested and refilled with new chemicals the third
step down the shore of the lake had been completely
fueled by now and its pumps seemed to be keeping the
oxygen liquid without too much loss the next problem
was to launch it and fit the asteroid in the hole designed
to accommodate her-ready for the final flight

  but as haworth pointed out if we wanted to make a
final test flight of the asteroid we would have to do it
before she was fitted to the third step mason when
routed out from his figuring said he didnt care about a
test-he would trust all that to haworth but haworth
insisted

  suppose something happened to me old man he
argued you must know every control on the ship-you
particularly for bigelow here is not mechanically-mind-
ed

  mason gave in at that another twenty-four hours he
said and his figures would be finished that would still
give us two days before the staring hour he plunged
back into the clatter and count of his computators

  mason also looked about him and gave
a great bound into the air he struck his
back against the tank overhead

chapter iv

on to venus

the test was on may th-a fine clear day as we
- walked over to the hangar i drew in deep lungsful of
air and threw my head back it was one of those days
when a few clouds drift like cotton wool in a smiling sky
but the sky had a new meaning for me now and the clouds
were intimate things we should soon meet and pass ha-
worth climbed at once up the ladder and out of sight but
mason and myself walked around the asteroid in the
gloom of the shed and i saw mason put out his hand and
pat the cool metal hull as if to reassure himself then
wc went up mason first and into the air-lock

haworth was below in the living cabin he called up
to us hurry along you chaps we start right away
but how can we start from the shed here i asked
peering over the edge of the hole at him

top swings back bills tending to that now come
on down-but seal up that air-lock first

  mason shut the vestibule door and turned the long han-
dle that sealed it hermetically we climbed down and got
into the swinging cot with some difficulty aided near the
end of our climb by haworths pointing out that there
were rungs on the water tank

just a moment haworth mason said its easy

enough to get up in the air but how do you land the

thing

  we have wings this lever here projects short stubby
wings out of the side of the asteroid didnt i show them
to you we use the wings just as an airplane does-
though we have to land pretty fast of course but the
lakes big enough i always come down facing south-
east in case anything went wrong i could always turn
on the power again and shoot over to long island sound
but i havent had to startle the natives there yet and i
hope i wont have to this time

  the water tank extended along beside the three cots and
on it were set three simple levers-duplicate controls-
and a series of dials were visible on the hull wall to indi-
cate altitude direction and speed the ship was navi-
gable of course without any reference to outside obser-
vation indeed it would have been difficult to design a
window with sufficient structural strength i will later
the voyage of the asteroid



describe among other apparatus our periscopc-tclescope
which enabled us to take observations en route

  but we were by now strapped in our cots and haworths
hand was on the starting lever he looked inquiringly
at us

  theres no shock you know the pressure isnt very
great except at full acceleration these cots are mainly
provided in case of an upset-and for sleeping in natur-
ally all set here goes

  he pulled the lever and for a second nothing appeared
to happen i had a panicky feeling that the whole thing
was a hoax in that second i realized how much  ac-
tually desired to make the trip then the ship quivered
and swayed very slightly i was pushed down in my cot
the way one is sometimes jerked back into an automobile
seat when the driver suddenly steps on the gas only i
stayed pushed down  waited breathlessly

  haworths voice startled me

  look at the altitude dial

  i blinked disbelievingly for it read  feet and the
hand was sweeping up faster and faster as i stared it
was shaped like a clock-one hand set for feet and one for
miles now we were two miles up now ten-twenty-
a hundred the air-speed indicator stood at one mile a
econd

  im going to shut off the power announced our pilot
just to show you what it feels like i wont start the ro-
tator for a few seconds hold tight now

  the speed was almost two miles a second and the height
something over two hundred miles when he pushed back
the lever then and there i lost my breakfast i have
been down a fast toboggan slide and know what it means
to leave your stomach in the air this was many times
worse my ears buzzed and my head swam there was
a sickening sensation of falling and i clutched my cot as
hard as i could trying to recover the sense of pressure
presently i felt better not altogether right but better
i felt light-headed and blown-up like a balloon haworth
was apologizing profusely

  i didnt dream it would take you that way it just
made me dizzy not sick at all how are you mason

  all right now replied my friend but dont do that
again if you value your cuticle

  and then i noticed that the water-tank was above me-
not beside me the hull wall with its instruments had
somehow turned into a floor what was happening

  your weight is now due to centrifugal force instead of
gravity said haworth who saw my puzzled glance

  mason had figured beforehand that at our speed we
would have five minutes to ourselves before the ship lost
its headway and would require our attention for a return
to earth i unstrapped myself and stood shakily on my
feet

  mason also looked about him and suddenly gave a great
bound into the air he struck his back against the tank
overhead while lie swore loudly i charily essayed a
few steps and found myself light as a feather i have since
estimated our weight at about six earthly pounds each
on the real trip later on we increased this by making
a faster rotation of the ship of course the faster the ship
spun the greater the centrifugal force and the greater our
sense of weight so exactly in fact does this force imi-
tate the observable phenomena of gravity that it might
suggest to an inquiring mind a possible clue for the solu-
tion of that enigma of nature is gravity really akin to
magnetism after all

  we walked through into what was now the adjoining
room haworth who had preceded us was staring into
the periscope glass and turning knobs eagerly

  we must be pointing away from the earth he said

i cant locate her anywhere he set in motion the
ships gyroscope and i noticed the direction pointer swing
around until it pointed straight toward the nose of the
ship

  here she is cried mason who had joined him i
came up and looked down at the glass where i saw a
great rounded section of my native land clouds ob-
scured much of virginia but i could make out cape cod
with great detail standing out into a lilliputian ocean

  our landing maneuvers now occupied our immediate
attention the speed we had acquired was less than two
miles a second and to attain this we had partially ex-
hausted the fuel contents of only one step of our ship
it had not been necessary to jettison any of the structure
as it would have been had a still higher speed been re-
quired

ttaworth now projected our wings and mason man-
--euvered the periscope to keep our objective in view
gradually the picture below grew larger and finally in-
stead of being rounded the landscape flattened out and
tbe edges seemed to curl up details appeared in the
scene beneath us and suddenly began to move sideways

  were flattening out said our leader quietly i want
you to watch the altimeter closely bigelow you mason
get located on that periscope and keep it pointed right

  i was somehow not alarmed in the least i stood lean-
ing against the water tank haworth had to turn on the
power for a moment once or twice and used the directional
rockets half a dozen times that was all i watched the
altitude indicator creep down again to a mile to a thou-
sand feet then i glanced at the periscope glass there
were the familiar connecticut hills sweeping by at a great
rate i glanced at the air-speed indicator which now
showed two hundred miles an hour

  hold tight called haworth and in the glass i saw
suddenly at close range a gleam of water there was a
blue and white splash and my knees gave way beneath me
as the ship lurched rolled a few seconds and started
turning then they gave way completely for the floor
turned up sideways and became the sidewall of our cham-
ber once again i fell heavily against the partition now
beneath me my companions had held on and as i
scrambled to my feet they asked anxiously if i had been
hurt fortunately i had not

  there was a collapsible canvas boat in the ships sup-
plies and we lowered this to the waters surface and
mason climbed down and got it opened out and afloat on
the water then we all got in and he rowed us to shore

  bill and his crew met us quick trip mr haworth
he said and i could not believe my eyes when my watch
showed ten oclock we had been gone altogether twen-
ty-five minutes

  that morning we rested up at the house but in the
afternoon mason announced that our starting hour was
 on the th and he was going to check all the figures
he had time for and as often as he could whereupon
he vanished into the library once more

  haworth and i went down to supervise the assembly
of the asteroid into the first step by the time we got there
it was nearly finished the huge step had been launched
into the waters of the lake and floated low and heavy
as we watched she settled lower still and finally disap-
peared beneath the surface

  good lord what is the matter

  wait and see

i might mention lhat from each step protrudes a rudimentary
fin from which can be pushed out short wings one set of wings
for each of the three steps in the complete ship the projecting
power is furnished by the pumps and a small wheel in the
control room regulates the whole system


wonder stories quarterly

  they were towing up the asteroid men were work-
ing over the sunken hull and i now observed several large
hose lines led from the depths up to an attending scow
on which was some pumping machinery the asteroid
was carefully placed just over the spot where the first step
had sunk and men wilh air-lines extending over the water
to the shore rowed about fastening them here and there

  when all was in place bill stood on the scow and
waved his arm twice slowly the asteroid settled just
before she in turn disappeared she halted and began
to rise slowly

  haworth and i had taken a small boat and rowed out
to the sccne of activities the work was stopped while lie
made an inspection finally he approved of everything
and the air was once more forced into containers in the
step below the water i now perceived the intent of the
operations and admired it hugely in half an hour the
step had risen above the surface half-swallowed in her
bow cavity was the asteroid the complete three-step
space ship floated on the water ready for the final fuel-
ing

  haworth had calculated it would be easier to fuel the
vessel on the lake rather than tow her to shore again the
first step and tho third step were already fully loaded
with gas and liquid oxygen and there remained only the
second step which we had nearly exhausted of fuel in
making our test trip we departed leaving this final
work in charge of the men half a dozen scows loaded
with oxygen cylinders and an emergency liquefying re-
frigerator were busily at work by the time we had rowed
to shore and turned to give the vessel a departing glance

  this work continued on the th that day seemed
made up of a thousand hours each hour some years in
length haworth was busy with a man who had come out
from the city making his will i presumed though he
never told me i could not tear myself away from the
vessel and sat by the hour watching bill make the final
arrangements the men were all leaving that morning
he said

  mr haworth thinks it just as well to have no wit-
nesses i guess

  but dont they know where we are going

  no said bill and probably wouldnt care if they
did

  but you will see us off

  bill flushed slightly he nodded in silence finally
he spoke

  im married

   he stared unseeingly across the lake

   if i werent    but i am and thats that

  i could not help reflecting that haworth carried the
secrecy of the thing to almost unnecessary lengths was
he planning to tell no one of our expedition until our re-
turn

  evening came at last and the three of us dined soberly
enough and smoked in sober meditation for a few hours
before turning in

  are you both sure you have no friends or relatives you
wish notified in case we    dont return

  i have an aunt said mason but i dont know her
address

  haworth laughed affectcdly

  we shook hands as we parted for the night

had a wretched sleep i thought of all the things that
might have happened to us the day before we had
been too lucky for words that was all the least thing
wrong and it would have been all over with us and
suppose we had been landing on venus-dense fog no
way of telling how close to land we were no assurance

that there was any water to come down on and on the
trip just suppose we hit one fair-sized meteorite traveling
at cosmic speed i thought of how a bullet made of
paper had been shot through a sheet of tin by some ex-
perimenter years ago we would be the sheet of tin

   only the thought of ridicule stopped me from backing
out altogether the next morning mason uftcrwards con-
fessed that it was much the same with him he had cal-
culated all night our chances of a successful return and
what with a nightmare or two to affect his figures the an-
swer came out exactly  chances to  haworth
apparently slept like a log

   i was not in too great a hurry that morning i fear
haworth kept trying to make me move faster but i took
my time we were really all ready by three in the after-
noon but i kept forgetting things we would be sure
to need the last time i thought of cards and a cribbage
board im glad i thought of them but he said it was
the last straw and dragged me down lo the boat where
mason was silting staring silently at the water we
rowed out to the vessel and haworth and i climbed up
the ladder leaving mason to fold up the boat when we
got to the air-lock we heard a cry from below and looked
down

  mason had fallen into the lake and was climbing up
the rungs dripping water and swearing so we pulled
the boat up as it was and folded it together in the vesti-
bule while mason stamped around shedding wet clothes
and climbed around down in the living cabin trying lo
find dry ones

  it was a few minutes past four when wc were all in
our cots our calculations had been arranged for a start
at exactly four-thirty so we had to wait twenty minutes
i had to fight myself hard every one of the twenty to
keep myself from unstrapping my legs and getting down
that ladder to solid earth again it was warm in the
cabin but not warm enough to account for the perspira-
tion that poured over me

  ready said haworth warningly

   and then for a certainty i knew i could not stick it out
but as i started to get up on one elbow and had opened
my mouth in fact to call to haworth he pulled the lever
i was forced back against the cot we had started

   our course once calculated was very simple to follow
given an exact starting time all that was necessary at first
was to aim straight for a definite portion of the skies we
aimed for the star kappa in leo it was masons job to
keep the periscope glass focussed on this point cxactly at
the start every second of travel he had to veer away
from it by fifteen seconds of arc to allow for the rotation
of the earth all other factors were taken into considera-
tion when fixing the original aiming point haworth kept
the ship lined up with the periscope direction indicator i
did what haworth told me from time to time as all our
instruments and controls even the periscope glass were
duplicated in our living quarters all this could easily be
done from our cots

   for eight minutes we lay there every little while ma-
son would exclaim there she goes and twist frantically
at his controls

   north declination two minutes of arc haworth called
out

   then it would be east by north a second and once
it was four minutes south quick five-ah there
she comes while mason swore and twisted avay

   then abruptly haworth pushed up the power lever and
pulled it back again

   there goes the first step he said grimly

   so far the power flight had been made almost in silence
but when the first step was dropped away the steady pres-
the voyage of the asteroid	

sure we felt became realized in its terrific powerful force
for the sound of the exhaust suddenly increased to very
audible proportions it filled me with its message of
vast blasting power when it in turn suddenly ceased
 glanced at haworth in surprise he was advancing the
rotating lever and i scarcely felt the dizziness our cots
swung around at ninety degrees and the walls became
our floor once more

  thats that i said and forced a painful smile

  you dont have to watch that periscope any longer
said he to mason powers off you know

  mason sat up in his cot frowning slightly

  it doesnt seem right he objected to be hurtling
through space at seven miles a second without anyone
looking to see where were going

  haworth laughed his black whiskers framing a jovial
cavern a great load seemed lifted from his mind

  no power no steering we have already steered her
now we are coasting to a stop well coast for about
three months and theres only one thing we can do about
it can any bright child tell me what that is

  but i thought i knew the answer to that and i was first
at the liquor closet whiskey straight and we all needed
it

  how calmly they take it you exclaim well i dont
know about mason and haworth but speaking for my-
self the above account leaves out a great deal to be
frank i was so nervous and alarmed during the start
that i scarcely felt my discomfort after a minute or
two the steady pressure affected my thoughts to the com-
plete exclusion of other feeling i found it difficult to
draw breath due i suppose to the increased weight of
my body which during power flight was some four times
as heavy as its normal one hundred and eighty pounds
my eyelids were almost too heavy to support themselves
and  noticed that mason and haworth were both peer-
ing at their instruments through half-closed lids

  while the throb and sound of power held the ship
there was nothing absolutely terrifying or strange about
it all that sensation came when the rocket motors
were shut off the stillness was like a blow i tood beside
my cot and contemplated the dials before me the al-
titudinometer was no longer working for we had left the
atmosphere of the earth its dial had marked only as
high as  miles and there it remained although i
knew we must be thousands of miles away from our
native land by this time

  the speedometer indicating the speed of air past our
hull had of course dropped to zero for there was no
longer any air to rush past us mason and haworth
had gone into the pump-room and were busy checking
our course with masons careful figures i was alone in
the cabin a sudden panic came upon me as i realized
our position we were lost in absolute space i real-
ized that now there could be no turning back our de-
parture was final we must go on to venus-a strange
and perhaps terrible adventure

           chapter v
           tene moments

  hen the whine of the ventilator fan broke the silence

  - one of my companions must have turned it on to
set the atmospheric conditioner in operation this dron-
ing monotony remained with us for the next three months
it frequently affected our nerves yet we all agreed that it
was preferable to the absolute silence that otherwise would
have pervaded our vessel

  it changed my train of thought entirely possibly the

stimulant i had just taken helped and i realized once
more the thrill of adventure  had not felt this so strong-
ly since haworths first announcement of the purpose of
his expedition i remember saying to myself why you
stupid oaf youre going to venus and a new exhilara-
tion came upon me and carried me into the next room to
join my companions i wanted all of a sudden to see
where we were to look out on the illimitable space in
which we traveled-to gaze longingly at our shining goal
and look back exultantly at the work-a-day world we had
left

  i rushed over to the glass to peer into the periscope
it magnified some twenty diameters and happened to be
pointed into a starry region which included a small sec-
tion of the milky way never with earthly language can
i describe what it looked like the stars were smaller
than we see them from the earth for they were not mag-
nified by two hundred miles of atmosphere but their
brightness was increased a thousand-fold like jewels
on black velvet they lay each one a pin-point of blinding
brilliance and so thick and deep did they carpet the
cosmos as to draw a gasp of delight from me

  i knew how to turn the ship and periscope from watch-
ing haworth on the test flight and i spent a solid hour
then and there bringing sight after sight into view one
of the first things i looked for wa in orion-the dark
horsehead nebula near zeta of that constellation but
i found it appeared not very different from photographs
i had seen on earth my vision was clearer of course
and i could see without any doubt that the dark spot was
no hole in space but a real- opaque object from behind
which light of distant stars streamed revealingly i called
mason over to watch it with me and he did so withdraw-
ing from the instrument at last with visible emotion

  but the sight of the receding earth was of the greatest
beauty and interest to me it was as if my heart-strings
were attached to it and almost seemed to snap with the
strain of separation tears came to my eyes the globe
was almost fully illuminated by the sun and both north
and south america lay in full view in fact not all the
surface could be seen in the field of the instrument at
once-although this was quite possible a day or two later

  well said haworth munching a biscuit and sipping a
glass of whiskey soda they will be just about getting
the news at the associated press offices by now

  at this surprising announcement both mason and my-
self turned to stare at our leader

  he had the grace to blush

  no use keeping the secret once weve started he added
in explanation let em laugh if they can now were
in space

  what did you do

  sent the associated press a dozen pictures of the aster-
oid with a brief scientific description and a signed state-
ment of the purpose of our voyage

  good lord

  rut then down there    

  i turned again to the glass as if at that distance i could
detetl the auccvs o new york as the newspapers poured
out wet from the presses with headlines four inches high
i tried to visualize chicagos loop with office workers
pouring out that evening to greet the astounding news
but in the glass the great lakes were dark blobs on a
misty globe and chicago with its millions an infinitely
microscopic phenomenon

  mason was frowning thoughtfully theyll call us
madmen of course

  then he smiled and so we are

  when-or if-we get back said haworth quietly
there will be considerable to say on that subject
	wonder stories quarterly

  we were wildly excited all of us-although haworth
did not show it mason was like a small boy and full of
spirits i was little better it was new and strange to
have the center of the cabins always up and the outside
universe in every direction always seem down in the
pump-room at the partition formerly the floor at the en-
trance there was an eight-foot alley clear of overhead
obstruction one could look up full fifty feet to the ships
hull above mason liked this spot he would run vio-
lently up the floor until he stood on what seemed to me
the ceiling and looked down at me grinning

  im an anthropophagus whose head doth grow between
his shoulders he called and youre another

  then he leaped violently down at me and weighing
about six pounds as i have said passed the intervening
center of gravity and landed laughingly with both arms
around my neck to save himself from falling to the floor

  we even tried a sort of spatial leap-frog but this did
not turn out to be a success mason made a wild leap
and struck has head hard against the pump tanks falling
heavily to the floor he was unconscious for ten min-
utes and only the head of a mathematician as i pointed
out saved him to posterity that episode occurred as it
happened in the first hour of free-falling flight it sob-
ered us considerably i suggested we give the ship a great-
er speed of rotation in order to increase the gravity
and upon haworths agreeing i turned it on until our
spring pound-scale registered seven ounces at that
speed the centrifugal force was almost half as strong as
gravity is on earth my head seemed at once clearer
and my body began to feel as if it belonged to me after
all

  haworth had done us rather well in the eating line
there was an electric stove for cooking and we had a
large refrigerator full of hundreds of pounds of fresh
meat and vegetables wc ate broiled steak and onions
our first meal-well washed down you may be sure
and as haworth mentioned proudly not a sniff of on-
ion in the ships sacred air

  i have promised to describe several other pieces of
apparatus and perhaps while i am in a descriptive
mood i might well do so here first our periscope up
in the nose of the ship is a thick glass lens set in a metal
ring whose position is changeable at will from the dials
on the periscope glass in the cabin below through a
simple system of angle lenses the light rays are brought
down a tube magnified and led by mirrors to the two ob-
servation glasses the range of observation or rather
the angle of vision is about  degrees in any direction
from the line in which the vessels nose is pointing

   during free-falling flight in space when it is necessary
to keep the ship in rotation the image seems also to rotate
in the periscope glass but a star at that distance is so
minute this does not matter for directional observations
and haworth had arranged for this when he designed the
asteroid the whole system of lenses occupied the exact
center line of the vessel and could be rotated automatically
to balance this effect occasionally the automatic device
did not function in exact time and the image would wob-
ble and blur in the glass but usually the visibility was
satisfactory in the extreme

  when in the atmosphere of the earth or of venus
the wings are protruded and terrestrial gravity is felt
rotation is then of course stopped altogether and at

u had a clever arrangement for oooklng everything inside an
airtight mica box back of the stove was a square door the
of this stove-cover it was an air-lock leading to
the ould of the hull nnd was for the disposal of garbage-
olid liquid or gaseous as outside due to our centrifugal
force u always down it was simple to operate although
muon assured us thnt offal would follow us through space and
whn we landed we had better carry ombrellas until the vade-
ffinum shower had finished

such times-landing or taking off-when accurate reliable
vision is required it is present for the lens-tiibe is then
stationary

  i was puzzled at first to determine how to make obser-
vations of the earth we were leaving i wanted some
photographs but haworth when asked said why not
turn the ships nose back toward the earth

  but we are going to venus

  well we dont have to go nose first do we

  and he solved the problem very simply by turning the
gyroscope control until the receding earth came into view
and i got some fine pictures it is really remarkable
how clearly the pictures came out in spite of the many
thicknesses of glass intervening between the camera and
the object i attribute this to the crystal-clear space in
which we fell-end-first as it happened

calling that reminds me of my first sleep on board

    it is singular how little sleep one needs in space
this is due possibly to the lessened weight i had four
meals before i felt in the least sleepy there is no night
or day as you can see for yourself if you think about it
i went to bed and dreamed of falling hours and hours i
fell in between these times i wakened and thought of
things i thought of the fallen angel in miltons poem
who fell twisting and turning in space for seven days
and nights i could not help thinking how ill i should
have been under his circumstances and then i wondered
whether he carried any food or air with him and realized
that i must be half asleep to think of such a silly idea
i dreamed some more and woke again

  i thought of jack londons story about primitive mans
racial fear of falling from trees  wondered if some fu-
ture super-human would retain in his race heritage this
super-fear of cosmic falling

  we had agreed to stand six-hour watches although there
was no real necessity and i stood five watches in a row
before i dared go to sleep again but when i did finally
climb into my cot once more i slept the sleep of one who
has mastered space travel i slept for twenty solid blessed
hours

  but to finish my descriptions air is supplied from the
oxygen fuel tanks as wo need it it is purified by a small
air-conditioner in the pump-room that sucks it in and spews
it out to the tune of a monotonous whine from a wire-
caged fan heat we have in plenty one side of the
vessel is always exposed to the fierce rays of the sun
and we must depend upon pure radiation from the dark
side to counteract it usually wc were uncomfortably
warm haworth had to keep an auxiliary refrigerator
turned on most of the time to get any comfort in the
cabins

  fortunately all this had been foreseen and as the
total power required to operate refrigerators electric
dynamo for lights and fan and the cooking stove com-
bined was insignificant compared to one second of power
flight there was nothing to worry about haworth had
figured a fifty per cent safety margin in estimating fuel
requirements

  well i seem to have covered nearly everything oh
yes no baths wc had plenty of water later on due
to our fifty per cent reserve and could wash our faces
and hands as wc liked but at the start we were con-
serving all we could and mighty grimy and filthy we
were too before we had been a month out at least
mason and haworth were-fortunately i couldnt see my-
self haworth particularly with his crop of jet black
whiskers looked uncomely mason and myself were at
least nominally shaven

  and now comes the one part of the voyage best glossed
the voyage of the asteroid



over three months i wonder if any of you have
spent three months in two rooms not even putting
your head out of a window mind it gets tiresome i
can tell you for the first week or two we were busy
enough mason in calculating our course all over again
and then in calculating our return based upon a two
weeks stay on venus after that he calculated sundry
things the mot admired was a computation of our
chances of being hit by a meteorite it came out well
into the millions i may say here in regard to this pet
bug-a-boo of critics of space travel that we sighted one
meteor during our entire trip it broke up our cribbage
tournament for two hours

  come quick haworth called from the periscope
something out there towards vega

  we crowded around the glass and watched a black dot
grow rapidly larger it passed within perhaps ten miles
of us we guessed and if that guess were accurate it
would have been about two-and-twenty feet through

  i on my part spent the first ten days busily with my
camera as official camera-man on the ship i took the
earth about once an hour i believe except while i was
sleeping i photographed mars venus saturn and jupi-
ter and would have got pluto the outermost planet but
we couldnt locate it in the glass oh yes mason fig-
ured on that too took him two days and i aimed exactly
where he pointed but could not see a sign of pluto i
snapped several films in the general direction however
and it may turn out on the plates when they can be sub-
jected to careful study

  then to further lengthen my labors all the films had
to be developed and prints made

  haworth kept busy climbing about the pumps and ma-
chinery no matter how often he had checked a gadget
he seemed always to enjoy doing it once again to make
sure

  but after the first two weeks photography palled we
were getting so far away from the earth that there seemed
little use in further pictures of the bright little globe-
less than half as large as the moon appears on earth
i had taken all the other subjects i could think of

  mason had made a final calculation bearing on the
probable percentage of error in his other calculations
the three of us gravitated mutually toward the cribbage
board

  we started a tournament at ten cents a game about
all i remember of the next two months was the fact that
i was seventy-six games ahead of mason and twenty
ahead of haworth haworth in turn had thirty-seven
games more than mason that made me champion and
 believe i was prouder of that fact than i should have
been

  while two of us were playing the other one would
read the encyclopedia britannica and it is amusing to
note the things one can find in that mine of information
when anyone came across an interesting statement he
would read it aloud to the others

  did you know that the malay race is distinct from
the whites yellows and blacks calls mason i always
thought they were almost the same as the chinese only
brown

  and from the next room came the subdued sounds of
haworth snoring for it was his rest period there it is
life on a rocket ship- thrilling journey to a new world

  this may not sound like a serious scientific expedition
but it must be remembered that we were absolutely help-
less now to change our fate we had to amuse our-
selves or-do worse perhaps men must laugh whether
on the way to the guillotine or to venus and when that
last day comes when the freezing world circles uselessly

a blackening heatless sun and the last coal has been
burned and the atmosphere freezes in a fine snowfall and
the last hope is gone-then men will probably have to be
amused just the same

  if indeed any men remain on earth by then surely
everything worth saving in the human race will be far
away and safe on a new world circling a younger sun
was it for nothing that we made our expedition

  scientific expeditions are not always amusing and
in that case trouble ensues sooner or later ask any fa-
mous explorer whether he objects to a vein of humor in
his men we three were  suppose as nearly harmon-
ious in our tastes and prejudices as would be possible to
imagine the importance of this fact cannot be stressed
too much as the long dull dayless time ticked by

t taworths genuinely interesting ideas could bet us
afire with enthusiasm and masons droll manner and
absurd wit time and again provoked us to abandoned
laughter i recollect one bad moment only

  mason had made some amusing remark at which i
laughed haworth however merely frowned impatient-
ly i could see masons cheek grow red as he turned
away and sat himself down moodily with a volume of the
encyclopedia this might have developed trouble then
and there but was interrupted violently by haworths dis-
covery of the meteor mentioned previously

  but we all of us seemed to act and talk unnaturally
a definite sense of nervous strain weighed upon us i
remember how irritated i was because haworth kept pok-
ing about in the living cabin-checking and again check-
ing supplies of food in the refrigerator and testing and
examining the cooking apparatus

  mason was still sensitive in his bearing toward ha-
worth and when the latter called out to him and asked if
he would hand him the food chart mason did not seem
to hear after a minute haworth came into the pump
room where we were sitting and got the chart himself

  getting deaf he remarked rather bitterly

  and mason rose and turned his chair about so as to
face away from him there he sat in sullen silence

  haworth had paused at masons action his face grew
almost as black as his beard

  will you be so dccent as to speak when youre spoken
to he demanded

  mason was silent

  damn you mason shouted haworth reaching out an
arm and seizing the others shoulder who do you think

          n

you are

  mason leaped to his feet tearing loose from haworths
grasp he whirled his eyes blazing i had seen mason
angry once or twice before and at such times he is usually
inarticulate and sullen he was so now and stood speech-
less glaring at haworth

  i was aghast but i was determined to let the thing
develop no further i strode between them

  the man that says another word is going to be sorry
i announced firmly for ill knock him down

   was determined to do so too i was physically mors
than a match for either one of them as they well knew
but whether this affected the course of events or whether
common sense came to them both at the same time i do
not know haworth strode off into the next room without
a word and mason sat in his chair once more and ap-
peared to have resumed his reading

  i could feel the skin tighten over my cheek-bones i
felt badly about the quarrel and more than a little irri-
tated at my companions  wandered over to the air
conditioner dials and studied them unseeingly for fully
	wonder stories quarterly

five minutes thinking deeply then i found myself ex-
amining them with casual interest

  the thermometer read  degrees fahrenheit a sort
of barometer recorded absolute air pressure another dial
indicated the moisture content of the air in our cabin
and a fourth showed the electric potential

   i stared at this latter dial in some surprise for its needle
had moved around to the very limit of its abvvuy ani a
recollected it was supposed to show only a slight elevation
above zero

  hastily  turned on die power and watched the dial
expecting lo see it record an instant lessening of the un-
desirable effect but no apparent change was visible for
more than half an hour when  perceived that the needle
had withdrawn very slightly

   after a moments hesitation i called haworths attention
to this phenomenon he came over and looked at the dial
in silence a full minute then he began to laugh the
needle had dropped quite perceptibly by this time and
haworths laughter seemed a signal ioi the tension of ray
skin to loosen it cleared the air so to speak mason
looked up doubtfully and evidently embarrassed by his
former conduct did not speak but haworth strode over
to him

  sorry lie said its not anybodys fault old man
the sun has been pouring free electrons into us for days
and we have been building up a terrific electric potential
if we were on the earth now you would see as fine an elec-
tric discharge leave this ship as ever left a thunder-cloud

  it was good to see mason and haworth sane once more

  i must say here that our vacuum tubes were not quite
powerful enough we never attained the proper condi-
tions on our whole trip and a certain nervous tension was
always present fortunately it was slight

            chapter vi
            land at last

  a bout the middle of august or  by the ship clock
 days after may th that is we began to get ac-
tively interested in venus mason started it by noticing
that you could see a little detail in the periscope i ob-
served it eagerly-a cloudy muddled kind of a circle
two inches across in the glass

  mason claimed he could see beautiful women in the
white cloud mass after looking for five minutes in mock
interest i suggested you could see anything if you stared
until you got spots on your eyes

  but after a few hours haworth who had been busy
himself at the other periscope glass straightened up and
announced that we were falling at about five mile a
second straight onto venus

  ive measured the change in degrees of arc subtended
by the planet  the glass he said i think you had
better check my figures mason i dont think we will
have to worry about reducing speed-but we have to do
more than think on that subject we must know

  actual navigation on a prc-figured course in space is
not as complicated as it might seem at first glance the
advance figuring of the course is difficult true but once
in space it is merely a matter of keeping on it on a per-
manent chart of the fixed stars are traced the positions
of the planets at various arbitrary periods if the planet
does not show in the periscope against the pattern of stars
precisely where it should then you are off your course

haworth had a most ingenious device for controlling this
factor of electric potential a series of large vacuum tubes
emitted free electrons either into the air of our cabins or in-
to outer space as the necessity might be this was not auto-
matically controlled since we had absolutely no knowledge of
probable conditions previous to our aciuttl night

it is immediately apparent how far you err and in which
direction

  the remaining dimension depending as it does upon
whether your speed is too great or too little must be
checked by the apparent diameter of the planet you ap-
proach if at a given minute it is too small then your
speed has been insufficient and you must apply power at
once cotntisiely it it is too urge at a calculated mo-
ment then you have been going too fast and must turn
your ship end to and apply power to retard your speed

  so far our course had been so nearly proper as to war-
rant practically no manipulation but our close approach
to venus made it imperative to be more accurate than we
had been as to our speed and probable time of arrival
we were slightly behind schedule and five or ten seconds
of power was required to overcome this

   it took us ten days to fall

  that was undoubtedly the worst time on the whole trip
-that falling you see the constant strain was there and
yet beyond calculating our speed every few hours nothing
could be done about it we would try to read or play
cards in the slack moments but there was always that dis-
tracting thought that we were actually falling at great
speed to the surface of a new and perhaps inhospitable
world i couldnt sleep more than a few hours at a time

  venus was by now a glorious sight sheer white she
gleamed and seemed so near in the periscope that one could
almost reach out ani seize her she was in half-phase
and the terminator line between light and darkness was
pure mother-of-pearl soft greens and blues tinged the
white side and a royal purple edged the line of night

  one or another of us was constantly at the instrument
now searching eagerly for any signs of a break in the
dense cloudy veil but in vain we thought however
that wc could detect a definite motion as though the whole
globe were turning before our eyes mason became very
excited over this and made several calculations he fin-
ally announced that the probable length of the day on
venus was sixty hours

  thirty hours solid sleep onights haworth

  i suppose they are agitating for the twenty-hour day
down there

  of course we thought of venus as being down we
were falling onto her surface you see now and again
we realized the speed and vehemence of that failing i
for one always stopped looking in the periscope when that
feeling came on me i would pick up a book or get some-
body to play cribbage with me for the thought was not
a comforting one

  we went over our apparatus a dozen times every twen-
ty-four hours i suppose i know i looked over the guns
that often i got to thinking how many things might hap-
pen if we did get safely down on venus no telling what
sort of beasts might be there perhaps there might even
be some sort of men or other kind of reasoning being

  we had three remington repeaters for -calibre shells
three colt automatics using the same sized cartridge and a
demountable machine gun for the same ammunition there
were three double bandoliers each carrying  cart-
ridges that meant six hundred rounds of hot lead for
the welcoming committee if any and there was plenty
in reserve in the lockers

  even ten days must pass if you wait long enough as
the irishman said but though wc haunted that periscope
glass the whole time we could not make out one single
detail of the planet below us nor could we see a single
thing except white and gray clouds venus was now a
huge disk filling half the heavens

  it was - when mason called out suddenly from
the glass
the voyage of the asteroid



   come here quickly were almost in the clouds
haworth happened to be in his col in the olher cabin
and he leaned over to the duplicate glass beside him and
stared a moment

   come on in you two he shouted landing man-
euvers stari at once

   we hurried through to the after cabin and climbed into
 our cots

   haworth had protruded our wings in the few seconds
interval and evidently we were already in the rarer outer
portions of the atmosphere for there was a definite pres-
sure toward the nose of the vessel that swung our cots
bottoms up that way mason was twisting away at the
periscope to keep it pointed toward the surfacc of venus
and haworth was turning the rudder lever for steering in
atmosphere i glanced at the instrument board and saw
that it was again functioning we appeared to be speeding
along at a height of  miles parallel to the surface of
the world-but at the fearful speed of six miles a second
haworth was quite cool

   that does it he said at last we should be all
right now we must circle the planet until we lose some
of this speed it will take perhaps seven hours to land
wc have to keep wide-awake every second of that time
mason you manage that periscope and keep trying
to see some detail ill handle the ship

   and what will i do

   well put in mason smiling but grim-lipped what
 do you think you ought to do about it

   so i climbed down to the locker and got out drinks for
 them both

   shes flying away a bit i warned haworth after
glancing at the altitudinometer which now read 
miles and was slowly climbing

   ive caught it already im depressing all the wing
 surfaces to hold her in the atmosphere

 nr he dial started to move down again until it readied
  where it topped then for an hour there was
 little change slowly the altitude dropped and the air-
 speed indicator with it as the outside air friction on our
 hull slowly reduced our speed

   free orbit said haworth and he turned the elevator
 controls the other way now we are navigating just the
 same as an airplane our speed will gradually reduce
 itself until the wings are required to keep us from fall-
 ing from then on it will be simple-merely glide down
 as slowly as we can and land on the surface

   the next few hours were monotonous the periscope
glass showed nothing but white swirling vapor-a world
of fog the altitude and speed slowly continued to drop

   seventy-five miles from the surface i said reading
 the indicator

   that doesnt mean a thing said mason not on
venus temperature air pressure even the gravity is
changed it was designed for the earths atmosphere
only dont bother with it any more now-were navi-
gating by direct sight

   his eyes remained while he spoke riveted on the glass
 as if his life depended upon it

   at exactly  mason gave an inarticulate cry i
leaned over and saw past his shoulder the glass of the
periscope sure enough something dark showed beneath
the thinning vapors was it land or water

   this is getting too risky said haworth tensely im
 afraid if we dont get any visibility in the next few min-
 utes well have to call the visit off and put on power
 again for the return to earth

   mason had laid out a course in case of this eventual-
 ity

   but mason and i had both seen something that time
about a hundred yards beneath us were the tossing bil-
lows of a black and sombre sea

   i glanced at the instruments

   speed  miles an hour i called out

   i looked at the glass to see the water rushing up at us
there was a sudden lurch as haworth put on our emer-
gency retarding rockets and a great splash obscured the
screen the asteroid bounced violently jerking us rough-
ly in our cots then everything seemed to turn topsy-
turvy in the cabin and we swung crazily in response
the floors became walls-the walls were now floors

   everything was still again except for a slight rolling
motion of the ship as she rode the waves we three looked
at each other in an awed manner

   were there said mason and laughed doubtfully

   my head was in a whirl of emotion-joy and curiosity
uppermost we were on venus beyond the air-lock
doors lay the wonders and mysteries of a strange planet

   i was first man out of his cot i stamped my feet
doubtfully for the full gravity of venus was pulling
now-almost the same as that of earth after many weeks
of existence at a weight of  pounds i now weighed 
mason was soon beside me and with a shout of joy fell
upon the periscope glass and tried to view the new world
outside but that proved futile nothing but steam and
spray could be seen wc had been several minutes at the
glass when we looked about us and missed haworth

   then i saw him down at the provision closet he had
set three glasses on tho lockor and beside each he was
methodically setting out bottles it was an idea to be
hailed with enthusiasm and mason literally fell on his
neck we were enormously excited and the stimulant
seemed to have no effect whatsoever upon us so we con-
tinued drinking the apparently harmless fluids until   
well speaking for myself i dont remember when we fell
asleep we had been under severe strain for many hours
our expedition had proved entirely successful here we
were landed on the surface of venus-all very strong mi-
tigating circumstances as the lawyers say

   according to the clock we slept seven hours it seemed
less than a minute when haworth awakened us with that
best of all alarm clocks-the smell of bacon and coffee
we rose and squandered some of our hoarded water in a
good wash all around and sat down to our meal

   the next thing of course said haworth i to see
if we can breathe the atmosphere outside

   i made the trip for testing samples it meant wearing
a diving suit for we dare not expose ourselves even for
an instant to what might have been poisonous gases i
had tried a suit on before leaving the earth but i was by
no means accustomed to wearing it i felt as if i were
drowning when i drew in the air contained in the helmet
panicky feeling rather but i was so impatient to rush
out that i didnt think of any discomforts this time mason
unscrewed the inner air-lock door for me and i squeezed
into the closed vestibule the door shut tightly behind
me and i opened the outer door

   through the glass of my helmet i looked over a foggy
ocean the glass was so obscured with steam and spray
that i could make out no details i had two vacuum
jars one for air and one for water i found it hard
climbing down those rungs in my clumsy dress i reached
the surface of the water and broke the neck of the first
jar beneath it the waves licking up at me as i clung
there it certainly looked like ordinary water

back in the vestibule again i knocked off the neck of
the second jar and stoppered it up with the gum ha-
worth had given mo for that purpose then i was in-
	wonder stories quarterly

  they seemed undecided as to how they would
take us they cocked their heads sideways like
a dog that has been spoken to

side and getting out of the cumbrous helmet by myself-
haworth and mason selfish brutes eagerly rushing the
jars to the little built-in laboratory in the pump-room

 by the time i got untangled and over to them they were
 talking to each other excitedly

 there passed several minutes of tense expectancy

 suddenly mason cried out and danced madly about in
 a circle

 we can breathe it he shouted

 you cant exactly call it air theres no nitrogen in

 it-at least so little as to be not easily detected

  he turned to haworth excitedly helium he ex-
plained

  haworth paused in his own analysis and looked up in-
terested

  almost three-quarters helium and the rest oxygen but
its breathable just the same-good life-giving air for all
purposes im so certain of it that i dont believe we
have to make any more tests

  eager as we were to look out and breathe the atmosphere
of this new world yet we waited for our leader to com-
plete his tests on the water finally he straightened up
rubbing his forehead with the back of his hand

something queer here it seems to be h but its
full of chlorine now why chlorine oh of course
theres not sufficient sodium on venus to combine with it
to make salt as it did on earth well have to evaporate
all water before drinking anyway smellv stuff isnt
it

but almost before his remarks were finished he was at
the door-eager as any of us we had both air-lock door
the voyage of the asteroid



open within ten seconds and looked out over the ocean
we breathed recklessly of the air the breeze was deli-
ciously fresh full of the taint of chlorine as it was we
could not see far at first for the swirling steam water in
all directions-not blue or green but black and rather de-
pressing the motion and sound of the waves were tre-
mendously exhilarating after our months of utter stillness

  if this fog would only lift perhaps we could see some-
thing

  minute after minute went by i stared with beating
heart at the seascape such of it as we could see through
the whitish vapor it was another world the feel of
the air the appearance of the waves the smell on the
breeze and even something additional perhaps the slight
increase in air pressure our instruments recorded all
bespoke the unfamiliar

  after ten minutes peering through the blinding fog
haworth cleared his throat

  suppose this fog never does clear

  a wild thought and great impatience pessessed me

  but if it doesnt then we can never see anything-
never discover anything besides why shouldnt it
clear

  but i realized then deep inside of me for centuries
the astronomers on earth had gazed at this planet and
never once could they say for certain they had seen any-
thing but clouds we knew that yet we never thought
of such a dense fog as this it was hot mist-in fact
steam our faces were wet with water and perspiration
for it was uncomfortably warm out there in spite of the
breeze

  well observed mason just what were you plan-
ning to do on venus when you did get there haworth

  and he smiled ruefully

  we went back inside and ate our meal we were all
of us bitterly disappointed our eager sense of adven-
turous discovery was dampened by too much fog it was
really a terrific let-down what was to be done

  haworth however had a plan as usual

  we must find land perhaps the mists lessen near
land certainly if we can find elevated sections of coun-
try we shall be able to climb out of these vapors we
can turn on the power and away we go over the waves
a high-powered speed boat if you understand what  mean

  well cruise about until we either find land or until our
two weeks are up-one or the other

  our feelings revived considerably mason insisted on
drinking a toast to venus and since we had finished our
meal he thought brandy appropriate we three raised
our glasses joyfully to the world of new adventure

  after all mason pointed out we are sure to strike
land soon well leave the asteroid and form a land
expedition on some mountainside or on a high plateau
we will find ourselves in clear air and can look around
upon our new domain think of it

  he sat staring blindly at his glass and speaking half
to himself

  think of it    men on venus there she lies out-
side the unknown

  he looked up at me suddenly

  what are we doing here wasting time come
lets start and he rose excitedly to his feet

  that was all very well but there were other things
to ascertain

  we must find our points of the compass i objected
or we wont know where we are going

  for answer he brought out a pocket compass

  of course it may be off true north with all the metal
there is on this ship but since theres approximately the

same metal in all directions it may be somewhere near
right theres north over there

td ut that did not help much there was nothing any-
where but oceans mason looked out through the
open air lock doors

  well he said in mock seriousness that makes it an
east wind and sure enough here comes the rain wed
better shut the door

  he suited his actions to his words and returning sat
down again

  first we will sleep and then we start haworth de-
cided

  we slept for eight hours and upon waking i noticed
in the periscope that the light was about the same as it
had been did it never grow dark on venus i wondered
i called masons attention to it

  humm doesnt prove anything if the atmosphere
is as dense as it seems to be there probably is never any
real bright day or any absolutely dark night i think a
day is about thirty hours up here

  subsequent observations tended to confirm his opinion

  after a meal we climbed into our cots and haworth
pulled the starting lever down very gently a few notches
only

  it was no motionless feeling this time the ship
bounced and jerked like any sea-borne craft and in the
glass i could see the waves sweeping past one occasionally
splashing up over the lens and obscuring all vision until
the water dripped off

  suppose we hit a rock i suggested

  haworth nodded and pushed back the lever a notch or
two the ship which had been almost horizontal straight-
ened up until the floors and walls both sloped at a -
degree angle to our swinging cots the glass remained
clear now for the nose of the vessel was well above the
waves the speed indicator stood just below thirty miles
an hour we kept steadily on a course due west if our
compasses were accurate we were proceeding on the
theory that on the earth at least the great continent
masses ran north and south and we hoped by traveling
west we would be more likely to find land

  from time to time mason went into the vestibule and
threw the lead to take a sounding but the ocean was
evidently a very deep one we proceeded with confi-
dence hour after hour went by i relieved mason at
the glass and he spent his time calculating that at this
rate we would circumnavigate the new world in some-
thing under a month the voyage became monotonous
there was one thing settled however a very apparent
change in the intensity of daylight was noticed by all of
us although it was not by any means real day or night
as we knew them on earth what might be called a slight
lessening of the gloom occurred once in about thirty hours
that made venus rotation period just what mason had
suggested-sixty hours i mourned that we had no light-
measuring instruments in our supplies with which to
cheek up on these rough observations but the figure may
be taken as probably correct

  but day or night made very little difference to us-for
the fog continually shut us in anyway we stood watches
of four hours each two of us being always on the look
out we drove the ship for nine solid days- earth-
ly miles by dead reckoning then we saw a bird

  mason saw it to be precise he called to us but it
had flown out of focus and he tried in vain to find it again
i urged that we reduce our speed to the point where one
of us could stand at the open vestibule and make actual
observations as we proceeded

   we may be getting near land that bird is a sign of it


wonder stories quarterly

  this was agreed to and i stood the first vetibule-watch
the first thing i did was to take our lead on the end of a
long thin line and make soundings for mason had not
done so in some hours i found sixty feet of water

  that gave us pause because even with our huge first step
discarded in space our total length was  feet and we
drew about  of it below the surface

  the fact is said mason that weve been absurdly
lucky we might have hit bottom any time the past week
we might have landed this ship on a hard cold moun-
tain peak to begin with lets not tempt fate any further
but take it easy for a while

  we made a bare ten miles an hour after that and it was
two hours later that i saw a bird but it was no such
bird as i had ever seen before there was something
familiar though about the long jagged beak and the
great membranous wings and then i understood

  good god its a pterodactyl

  since we later saw several of these strange flying rep-
tiles i am in a position to say here that there were certain
important ditferences between the species we observed
and those once plentiful upon our own earth in the car-
boniferous era but essentially there could be no doubt
that the relationship was extraordinarily close in fact
there were later observed no less than seven reptiles as
well as half a hundred insects and vegetable forms of
life that could unquestionably be related to current or
primitive life-forms on-earth so much so that i am con-
fident the whole theory of the origin of life will upon
closer reasoning be vastly expanded beyond its present
scope

  this is not a scientific paper however

  haworth looked up at me from the pump-room controls
as i announced my find and just at that moment the
ship gave a slight lurch and tipped lowly sideways ha-
worth grabbed the power lever and shut off the rockets
mason started to climb over toward me while i clung on-
to the walls of the vestibule and peered out

  there was a blackness a few hundred feet ahead show-
ing through the surrounding clouds of steam it could
mean only one thing we had found land

            chapter vii
            adrift in the fog

xur first concern was for our vessel and we found she
was in water a little less than  feet deep while
this was less than we required to be afloat we were not in
the least alarmed we could with a small fraction of our
rocket power readily free ourselves in fact haworth de-
cided to go still farther ashore he turned on the power
gingerly while we crept and careened along for another
fifty feet here however the water shoaled rapidly and
he shut off the rockets

  there was no question about what to do next our
cramped quarters made us long to stfetch our legs on solid
earth once again there was nothing to delay us the
collapsible boat was lowered and we climbed down into
her and pulled for the dark mass of shore showing clearly
now through the mist it was distant about two hundred
fe-t and when we pulled up alongside it proved to be a
niud-bank enormously overgrown with vegetation roots
branches and tree-trunks were tangled to the very edge of
th- water but do not think there was any familiarity in
its appearance no friendly green leaves met the eye
all nas irklv dirty pray and such leaves as there were
cemrd to it mcie rudimentary spikes and fronds

  we rowed slowly along this bank wide eyed and with

beating hearts it was not a friendly land evidently-
but it was outlandish and of exceeding interest

   it was evident from here however that higher ground
lay to the right we rowed about two hundred feet through
the fog to a shadow which proved to be a low line of
rocks which cropped out through the vegetation

  haworth pulled the nose of our boat up to them and
mason and i leaped out we were the first to set foot
on the soil of venus haworth announced that he would
stand by the boat for five minutes

  then one of you must come back he added and
give me a chance

   we both carried rifles of course at first we could
see nothing but mist and hear nothing but the splash of
the waves against the rocks these extended inland
slowly rising as far as we could see which was less than
 yards and were almost completely bare of vegeta-
tion on both sides of this stony strip lay the steaming
impassable jungle we took a few hesitant steps and
peered about us

   then i jumped something indistinct in the swirling
vapor ran quickly across from right to left it was
about three feet in height and ran on its two hind legs
there could be no doubt that it had a tail for this ap-
pendage had seemed to be as big as the rest of the animal
put together

   we threw our rifles forward and waited expectantly

  then in the jungle on our right commenced an enor-
mous splashing and crackling of branches wc turned to
stare an instant we both saw something but could not
make it out at first then i perceived that it was an enor-
mous neck huge and shadowy at the end of which was
an absurdly small head

  wc retreated hastily to the boat where haworth was
anxiously endeavoring to see what had caused the noise
we had scarcely got in the boat and pushed off a few feet
from shore when a huge beast slumped out on to the rocky
ledge and ponderously crossed it disappearing into the
vegetation on the left

  the beast closely resembled the now extinct earthly
species-dinosaur brontosaurus of course there were
differences the jaws were long and narrow almost like
a beak and the legs were longer and thicker than would
be indicated by the fossil remains of the brontosaurus liz-
ard it was a monstrous specimen-easily a hundred feet
in length

   but mere words can give no idea of the thrill of proxi-
mity to that mountain of flesh we used the oars fran-
tically to get the boat well away from possible danger
a thousand wild surmises coursed through my brain first
a pterodactyl and now a dinosaur was all this some
fantastic nightmare were three sane twentieth century
humans really set down in some grotesque revival of the
carboniferous era my heart was pounding frantically
and i noticed haworth was breathing harder than usual
when the great reptile finally splashed out of sight in the
gray-white tangle i breathed a sigh of relief

   how would you like to get stepped on by that fellow
asked mason

   he is probably too slow to be dangerous i replied
an active man could dodge him without breathing hard
and he hasnt more than a few ounccs of brain in that tiny
head either if thats the worst venus has to show we
neednt worry much

   the real danger on venus said haworth mournfully
is this damn fog i should have forseen it i think we
had better get back to the asteroid and plan out this ex-
pedition a little more

   as usual he was right this blinding atmosphere was
the one thing we had not counted on it was almost im-
the voyage of the asteroid



possible to go anywhere or do anything you can have
no idea unless you live in london perhaps what it feels
like to be always unable to see even a clear hundred
yards ahead beyond that point everything is lost in swirl-
ing mist even when a breeze is blowing occasionally
the fog blanket shuts down until it is hard to see two
steps in any direction

  just the few yards we had pulled up the shore had
taken us completely out of sight of the ship we found
her again all right by dead reckoning but as mason
pointed out

  supposing we had gone for a walk on shore and got
out of sight of the water

  what we should have brought is a bloodhound  said
then we could go where we please and let the dog lead
us back

  we sat around our meal in the living cabin and dis-
cussed the problem we had only four days remaining
before it would be necessary to start back and any de-
lay supposing we had a later course calculated which
we hadnt made the return trip more difficult and less
desirable as mason put it this was on account of the
position of the two planets earth and venus in their or-
bits

  we had our compass for direction and our guns for
protection although they might not be much use against
such a beast as we had seen and the compass was not
reliable from having been so long in the enormous metal-
lic hull of the asteroid definite aberrations were no-
ticeable in its needle

  and besides said mason conditions may be dif-
ferent hero as to magnetic fluctuations even if the com-
pass were trustworthy

  what we might do said haworth thoughtfully is to
take along a number of stakes and peg one down every
huudred feet or so of our progress then we could find
our way back by them

  one thing we all agreed upon was the desirability of
making some sort of expedition it would be too ridicu-
lous to come all this distance just to see some water and a
little jungle

  i was enormously excited at die significance of die beasts
we had seen what vast possibilities it all opened up
it has been suggested by some scientists that life may have
arrived on earth out of space in microscopic form a
dust of microbes perhaps-each capable of undergoing
evolution after all venus and earth were sisters born
of the same sun why should not some forms of life
grow in parallel directions on both planets these ques-
tions so interested me that i believe  would have cheer-
fully tramped off into the fog by myself probably i
should have regretted it bitterly enough if i had as i was
to learn

ur conference broke up with the understanding that
we would get a few hours rest and then explore along
the rock ledge as far as we could taking every precaution
possible against losing our direction

  that night was the most uncomfortable i ever spent
we had been in the custom of leaving the air-lock doors
open while traveling over the sea and we did not close
them now but close to land as we were the heat was
soon unbearable bathed in perspiration and unable to
icep i finally rose and climbed up to the pump-room
floor now above us almost vertically to shut the doors

 believe the action saved our lives

   had just turned on all the refrigerators and adjusted
the oxygen feed and artificial atmosphere controls and
was starting to descend to my cot when haworth screamed

  i glanced hastily down and saw him half risen in bed

  battling wildly with both hand while two bird likc things
poised and darted about him i could see even in that
instant a thin trickle of blood that ran from a wound in
his cheek while i stared i felt something brush my
shoulder and with an involuntary cry i loosened one
hand from its grip on the water-tank rungs and struck
at the thing that was attacking me

  none of us had weapons to hand since these were kept
above in the pump room our attackers were persistent
so that it was necessary to strike them away with our bare
hands there seemed to be dozens of them  was in an
awkward position with only one hand free and when i felt
two or three bites deep in my flesh one just missed taking
out my right eye i was desperate

  suddenly the attacks became slower and glower i
couldnt understand why in an instant i found myself no
longer menaced i felt stronger too and breathless from
the heat of the struggle as  was i realized finally that
the refrigerators must in some way have turned the trick

  below me mason and haworth were having a breathing
spell also as i looked down at them i saw haworth
slump queerly in a heap on his coat

  mason and i rushed to him and i got some water from
the tank to bathe his face for he was covered with blood
and perspiration we kept looking warily around for
the bird-like things as wc worked over him but saw no
signs of them

  haworth came to his senses after a few minutes and
smiled weakly at us

  close thing that

  we had first aid material in plenty and bandaged each
other as well as we could the wounds were curiously
even and neat a piece of flesh was taken out about one
inch long and a quarter of that in width and depth it
was the same in every case haworth had one taken out
of his chin-black whiskers and all he had eight such
wounds but mason and myself were not half as badly off
unless we had been poisoned they were nothing serious
we thought

   we must find those tilings and kill them said mason
fiercely now armed with a frying pan from the kitchen
cabinet

  but i would not let him start on the hunt until i had
turned on the emergency refrigerator full tilt and the
ship after the stifling venus temperature seemed like an
ice-box

  we found seven of them-helpless and motionless on
the floor in the lowest corner evidently the cold was
beyond their powers of adaptability they were from
nine to twelve inches long and probably insects i have
one specimen with me now and i expect the entomologists
will have some trouble deciding its classification for it
has five segments in its body the remarkable feature is
the sharp powerful beak it resembles the mandibles
of a turtle mason smashed all seven thoroughly but
the three we found on the pump-room floor above i at-
tended to myself and as i have said i kept one speci-
men intact but very thoroughly dosed with cyanide of
potassium you may be sure

  we slept like logs for the next twelve hours and when
i awoke my first thought was for my wounds for i feared
poisoning they were i was glad to find perfectly
healthy and had already started to heal

i do not know why i should have feared poison or
innoculation of harmful bacteria i have since given
some consideration to the possible bacterial life on venus
i believe a case might be made out to the effect that harm-
ful bacteria undergo evolution like all other forms of
life why not and if that be so then primitive bac-
teria such as we were likely to find here might be as

harmless in comparison to our modern species on earth
as a gibbon monkey throwing cocoanuts is compared to
a twentieth century human shooting a rifle i offer this
for what it may be worth-probably very little for we
attempted absolutely no microscopic work on venus i
have in our collections however some dozen vacuum bot-
tles filled with venus air taken at different levels and
location competent scientists will have at least some
actual data to go on

  but haworth was still weak and short as our time
was we must perforce delay our exploration as it hap-
pened it was nearly forty-eight hours before he felt
strong enough and we felt even then that he only pro-
fessed his health in order to avoid disappointing us we
wouldnt let him out for another twenty hours

  we sat in the vestibule looking over at the dark shadow
that was the shore and discussing the chances of a visit
from more of the mosquitoes as mason was pleased to
call them mason and i would have made a short trip
alone but wc had by this time begun to realize that only
with the exercise of the utmost precaution could we hope
to make any expedition successful haworth was our
natural leader and without him we seemed bereft of con-
fidence

  it was just thirty hours before our scheduled return
when he insisted we make the venture

  im perfectly all right now he said and we have to
act right away or probably never get the chance again

  he seemed strong enough although his face was paler
than usual perhaps we gathered our equipment-some
food rifles bandoliers two hatchets and the compasses-
and haworth followed us down the ladder first closing
the air-lock door and leaving the key in the slit

  we might lose the key if we took it with us he ex-
plained

  i	rowed we went as before directly to the mud-bank
and along it to the ledge of rock where we disembarked
mason had brought along a length of line and he tied one
end to a broken piece of rock the other end was fastened
to the nose of our little boat which he pushed strongly
out from the shore heaving the rock after it she swung
jauntily at her mooring about twelve feet off shore

  just so one of your giant lizard friends doesnt step
on her he grinned jit me we can easily get out to her
at that depth

  our compass was consulted and due north seemed to be
about in the direction we had left the asteroid the
opening between the jungle-swamps on either hand seemed
to lead away to the east

  first said haworth we must get some stakes to set
out as we go

  he went to the edge of the rock and hacked away mason
helping him at some of the plants in the jungles rim
they cut branches about four feet long and as the wood
was spongy and easily severed the labor was inconsider-
ble we soon had a dozen stakes apiece and haworth
drove the first one into a natural crack in the rocks

  then wc picked up our bundles of sticks and our rifles
and proceeded eagerly into the mist i was wildly ex-
cited every step might bring us into sight of something
new most certainly it would be unearthly we
alked as quietly as we could for no telling what danger
might lurk around us eager as we were i dont think
ve could have been called comfortable in our minds
from the right we could hear distant sounds of splashing
and from both sides of the jungle life was audible in faint
rutlins and indistinct sounds

  when  had gone about a hundred yards we fixed
another stake upricht with loose stones as we moved
along the ledge of rock widened until we could no longer

  see even the shadow of vegetable growth on each side
the ground sloped gently upward as we progressed

  we were adrift in a sea of fog

ason gasped and gripped my arm tensely

he was staring to the right and following his line
of vision i saw an amorphous mass loom darkly against
the gray steam we stood stock-still for a minute-scarce-
ly breathing then haworth whispered

  it doesnt move lets get a little nearer
  very cautiously we did so it was a tree

  vastly relieved we approached and found three trees
growing close together in a pocket of earth which lay like
an oasis in this fog-bound desert of rock they were cur-
ious trees about fifty feet in height and clothed with fo-
liage at the top only the trunks were faintly suggestive
of certain tropical tree-ferns i had seen in greenhouses in
new york but of course by no means the same every
foot or so the bark ended in a curious sort of protruding
knob flattened on its upper surface behind each knob
an inner layer of bark continued up the trunk to curl out-
ward a foot higher in the same sort of thing i put out
my hand and found the projections very hard and to my
surprise strong enough to bear my weight

  this would be mighty convenient to climb if we meet
any desperate characters i remarked jocularly

  hsssssh

  mason was holding his head in a strained listening at-
titude haworth was holding his finger to his lips and i
strained my cars expectantly unconsciously we drevr
together close to the trunk of one of the tree-ferns

  i	saw something move it was just a shadow at first
then i could see that it walked on two legs as it came
still closer i could distinguish arms and claw-like hands
it was about three feet high its face was mostly snout
and teeth but in one of the hands it held a tree branch
crudely broken off to form a club

  curious sliding steps it took-straight toward us at
about fifty yards distance it stopped suspiciously and stared
in our direction as if hesitating whether or not to come
further

  haworth pressed my shoulder warningly and then slow-
ly advanced out of the shelter of the trees he moved
with the utmost precaution to avoid frightening it as
he afterwards explained but he need not have worried
had he known as much about the courage of these animals
as we did a little later on

  the creature remained motionless until he had ad-
vanced twenty feet then it stirred nervously haworth
came to a halt and raised his right arm slowly over his
head there was no motion from the other and haworth
started to talk to it in a quiet tone of voice i could see
the head twitch suddenly at the sound but there wa no
other response

  then haworth took another step forward and like a
flash the creature spun about and fled in great leaping
strides

  our leader shouted at it excitedly and followed we
in turn followed haworth wc ran about a hundred
yards when we came in sight of a dense growth of trees
we were panting painfully and absolutely saturated with
sweat in that hot-house atmosphere

  did you see the club that means an opposing thumb
on the hand there isnt any doubt the beast is intelli-
gent to at least some extent

  this is the most important thing we have seen yet

  but i had seen something of a different sort when the
beast had turned to flee

  it has a tail i reminded them a real large tail
the voyage of the asteroid



almost as big as a kangaroos and that snout strongly
suggests the reptile if ever i saw one

  we walked slowly toward the dark shadow of the forest
mopping our brows and endeavoring to recover our
breath the ground here was possibly fifty feet higher
in elevation than the swamps at the waters edge and the
growth of vegetation was not nearly so rank as it was
down there openings were visible here and there be-
tween the tree-trunks

  we were within fifty feet of one opening when we all
three stopped uncertainly as though we had realized in
unison that danger might lie hidden just behind that
scrcen of foliage and as we stood there i saw a move-
ment in the shadows close to the ground out from the
woods stepped the animal we had been pursuing and beside
him stood half a dozen more of the same kind slowly
they came out into the open still more of them followed
and spread out on each side until nearly fifty of the beasts
were visible

  we all three had dropped our bundles of stakes and
had our rifles ready for action

  dont shoot until we have to whispered haworth
and stepping forward a pace he raised his rille in the
air and gestured with his free arm

  there there there he said in a soothing tone
wed like to be friends if youd let us

  they seemed undecided as to how they would take
this they cocked their heads sideways some of them
for all the world like a dog that has been spoken to two
or three of them uttered curious little croaks and shifted
uneasily on their feet i was beginning to believe we
might establish some sort of understanding with them
after all when one of the beasts began leaping up and
down and uttering wild chattering squeals at that they
all seemed to get excited and started to advance upon us

  i raised my rifle and pulled he trigger aiming at the
foremost of the creatures who slumped to the ground
and lay there thrashing his tail and biting savagely at the
rocky ground

  the shot stopped them

  it rang out like a thunderclap on the still air the
whole of venus seemed to be standing still and listening
in wonder at the strange sound but without a pause
mason and haworth stepped forward guns ready i fol-
lowed suit

  weve got to bluff them and keep em bluffed mason
whispered

  we never knew how it might have turned out there
was a brisk crashing away on our left and we swung in
that direction the sounds were approaching but we
could see nothing as yet in that brief second the whole
group of reptile-men disappeared only the dead one lay
on the ground when wc turned back what was this thing
approaching us that caused them to flee

  lets get out of here quick

chapter viii
desperate moments

we followed haworth down the slope at a trot we

   were out of breath instantly in the terrible heat
and dampness and when the clump of three trees showed
itself through the mist we paused to gather ourselves to-
gether behind us we heard the crashing now much
closer suddenly a huge coughing roar shook the very
ground we stood on

  quick i shouted we can get up these trees and
be safe
the sounds were coming nearer now with terrifying

rapidity as we all three started up the ladder like trunk
of the nearest tree fern wc climbcd as far as we could-
about forty feet-and looked down with pounding hearts

  suddenly there burst into view a huge beast running
at a terrific pace he strode gigantically on two hind
legs holding his fore feet under his chin most terrify-
ing of all were his great jaws-fully six feet in length
and massively armored with gigantic teeth

  i recognized a startling resemblance to that most fero-
cious and powerful living creature ever known to the hu-
man race-the great dinosaur cyrannus rex

  he must have winded us as he passed the tree for he
came to a grinding stop just beyond us his huge talons
making long grooves in the eroded surface of the rock
then he wheeled fiercely and bounded back to rear his
thirty-foot height up at us

  we were in the palm-like top of the tree by now as
you may imagine and hanging  for dear life the
shock of his great weight almost did for me my hold
loosened as the tree sprang back from the blow and i
slipped down half-a-dozen feet until my tearing bleeding
fingers got a grip again i scrambled back to my place
again in a panic

  the tcrrific beast seemed to realize we were beyond his
reach for he did not again make an attempt to seize u
his great slavering jaws opened to emit a huge blasting
roar and he made off back toward the woods where he
intended doubtlessly to dispose of the reptile-man i had
shot

  the last roar was accompanied by a wet scorching
stench such as i hope never again to experience i was
nearly sick at the first whiff of it and could not bear to
draw breath until the slight breeze had made the air pos-
sible once more

  we could hear the beast at its grisly meal although he
was several hundred feet distant and entirely invisible in
twenty minutes back he came and his little eyes stared
up at us coldly he stood there a few minutes and then
moved off and we could hear him grunting and snorting
as he forced jiis way through the woods up the slope

  we three were completely prostrated you have no
notion how enervating climate can be i could laugh at
our worst earthly tropics after what i have been through
even a slow walk started the perspiration running in tor-
rents and we had been running and scrambling for our
very lives our nerves were frayed too and poor ha-
worth was barely able to hold on to his branch in fact
we fixed a sort of couch up there for him and he sprawled
on it his neatly-pointed beard now in filthy disarray i
managed to slip down to the ground taking it slowly
and pick up one hatchct and two rifles the other hatch-
et had been dropped and one of the rifles had been stepped
 by our perfumed visitor with the hatchet we chopped
some of the great leaves and wove them across two branch-
es haworth fell asleep almost immediately and mason
and i tlked over things worriedly

  id judge were about five hundred yards from shore
said mason if we strike it right that would be easy
wed better start as soon as haworth can move

  we consulted the compass and decided upon the gen-
eral direction which was west naturally we had borne
almost due east when we started off from the boat but
direction meant nothing tangible in that blinding mist
we estimated we ought not to be two hundred yards from
the nearest stake

  why shouldnt one of us start down and scout around
i suggested while the other stays here with haworth

  all right ill go if you like

  but i insisted on making the trip myself i climbed
down and started off due west by compas i moved in

bolate silent pun in the crook of my arm wc had
rrfrd that in cae of alarm mason was to start calling
from the tree-top and that i could quickly find my way
back guided by his voice

  af t i had walked what i guessed to be two hundred
ards i looked carefully about me in the fog but could
see absolutely nothing like a stake anywhere i spent
ten minutes searching over the bare rock without suc-
cess and started back after all  thought to myself
we know the general direction it should be a simple
matter to find the shore again i felt that i could have
proceeded directly to it then and there

  when i had walked back a sufficient distance i was
surprised to be unable to see the clump of trees i didnt

thought came to me and stopped my course in one wild
heart-straining slither suppose i were running away
from the three trees and got out of range of mason
voice

  i tried to retrace my steps and got started at least in
the right direction walking quietly so as to hear any
noise there might be then the marks on the dripping
rock became indistinguishable and i cast around vainly
for a clue trembling now with the heat and my physical
and nervous exhaustion

  i spent another ten minutes of frantic searching over
the barren ground when i heard a sound for one ter-
rible half-second i did not recognize masons voice then
i gasped my relief and ran silently and very wetly to-

showing the wandering path taken by the explorer on venu from the ahip tho
trail led to the clump of trees from which  bigelow mads hit frantic excursion
 shows the firjt attempt of the party to return to the ship ending however in
their return to the tree  was their second and more determined attempt to
find their way to the shore through the fog  was their path taken to the vil-
lage of the reptile-men and thence back to the hip

dare to call out for god knows what frightful answer i
might receive but in what direction was  to turn

  that moment was the worst of my life i fully believe
alone on a strange and terrible planet lost

   stopped dead still and listened but either my heart
pounding like a bass drum and drowned out all lesser
- unds or else the swirling mists were without voice
i -me i thought to myself i must keep my head theres
rv uv getting into a panic and of course that made
worse than ever i tried to observe my own foot-
rrirk on the rocks and could trace my steps quite easily
  a d n feet but they were soon obliterated by the wet
 -e ird i gave that method up in despair then i started
ruaring

  dont a-k me why i didnt run far for a worse

wards the voice i climbed the tree almost as quickly
as i had done the first time and mason patted my shoulder
to steady me for i was trembling in every limb

  easy there lad why all the excitement get lost
down there

i told him presently of the extreme difficulty of find-
ing ones way about alone on venus the horror of
that moment never left me while we remained on the
planet i wished for nothing but a return to the clear
atmosphere of our own earth as a matter of fact i wa-
in a plain funk although for some reason i now find i dis-
like writing it down as that

  it is nice to think of ones self as a bold heroic figure
intrepid explorer you know but sitting here in sc-
the voyage of the asteroid	

curity as i write i wonder that i ever had courage enough
at first to set loot on the soil of venus and i realize
dearly that i am not at all a brave man apropos i won-
der how many african explorers were frightened out of
their wits by their first sight of a lion its easy to for-
get such things afterwards or rather i should say it is
hard to admit them

  haworth was stirring in his sleep by then and mut-
tering incoherently i was physically sick from ray re-
cent adventure and even mason was exhausted it was
clearly impossible to do anything at all until we had
rested we had stuffed some food in our pockets before
leaving the asteroid and made a light meal in the tree-
top for drink mason climbed down and filled his hat
with the warm steaming water which made shallow pud-
dles in every hollow of the rock it was not exactly deli-
cious but at least it was not tainted with chlorine as was
the ocean for the pools were formed by evaporation and
condensation of course after that we felt a little better

  by this i do not mean comfortable we were never
comfortable on venus our clothes were always dripping
wet with mist and perspiration water oozed from our
shoes and dripped down our backs and legs in fact
clothes were not strictly necessary at all we wore jackets
of white duck and trousers of the same tucked into high
boots the jackets gave u handy pockets the trousers
and boots gave protection we wore no hats or under-
clothing of any kind

  haworth slept on hour after hour while mason and
myself occupied our time speculating over what we had
seen and observing the life before us once a pterodactyl
flew past u-his great twenty-foot wings outspread in
motionless flight and his long-toothed beak stretched in
front of him he was almost jet black in color and
looked leathery we had a good look at him for he
passed within thirty feet of our tree and did not travel
very rapidly none of these flying reptiles that we ob-
served seemedvto flap their wings at all but depended
entirely upon soaring in fact their bodies were so
email in comparison to their huge wing-spread i doubt
that they could move their wings with sufficient force to
fly as an earthly bird does

  i had time to observe carefully the tree in which we
rested the leaves were of the compound type and
sprang from the main stem on stout three-sided branches
or possibly leaf-stalks the leaf divided in pectate
fashion on both sides growing narrower toward the tip
and ending in a short club-like growth of sticky pink
which may have been some rudimentary sort of flower
we could observe several insects on the branches and i
captured half a dozen which i placcd in a fiat tin speci-
men box i always carried in my jacket pocket two
of them were suggestive of exotic forms i had seen pic-
tured in earthly books of entomology

  one was some sort of bcetlc-likc species and the other
a kind of darning-needle about seven inches in length
the other insects if they indeed prove to be insects at
all were outlandish looking things mostly the colors
were varying hues of sickly whites and grays similar
to the foliage

  once we heard a terrific rumpus start down in the
jungle we supposed that our friend tyrannus rex had
encountered the brontosaurus we could hear some great
tail smacking the surface of the water if it were bronto-
saurus he was evidently not equipped with vocal organs
for the grunting and roaring was all onc-sidcd so was
the battle evidently it lasted about ten minutes and our
late visitor probably for once in his life had enough to
eat for a while that carcass would have fed a regiment
for a week as the noise ceased i thought i could see

one of the reptile-men moving across the open rock in the
direction of the sounds but it was just far enough away
as to be only a vague shadow in the fog possibly it was
mere imagination

  then three little running things raced past our clump
of trees and out of sight being presently followed by a
long dead-white running creature on eight flimsy legs
he was a nightmare his body was not more than six
inches through and yet was a good six feet in length
with a huge triangular head armed with jaws that kept
opening and shutting viciously as he ran he was out
of sight in a moment and we never observed another like
him during the time we spent on the planet

  the time dragged slowly mason and i occasionally
addressed a remark to each other as we watched he was
nervously consulting his watch every little while

  this may be mighty serious you know he said at
last we have only three hours left now before we will
simply have to start back for the ship we must com-
mence our return flight to the earth on time or-not at
all a delay means figuring the direction and course
out all over again that may not be possible

  what and you such a good astronomer

  oh its the time it would take that bothers me you
see i cant apply a formula to the calculation because
there are three variables and the trial and error method
means a lot of figuring

  but suppose you do figure out the course all over
again what of it suppose we are a week behind
schedule that only means arriving a week late back home
doesnt it

  mason looked uncomfortable and very serious

  im afraid not the schedule was planned to allow
the utmost possible time on venus if we are delayed
venus would get too far ahead of the earth in its course
about the sun we would have to wait over a year before
we could find it possible to return

  great heavens a year in this living hell
exactly answered mason and he bent over haworth
with an anxious air

  the full purport of masons words began to flow in on
me what would we do even supposing we got back
safely to the vessel-as of course we must sometime-
what would a whole year be like here our food sup-
plies were of course entirely inadequate for such a length
of time our fuel was not inexhaustible and even the
slight amount required to keep the refrigerators going
could not be spared for a years operation  passed my
hand over my greasy and dripping forehead and reflected
wildly on twelve solid months of unmitigated venus cli-
mate

  we might kill reptiles for food-one moderate-sized
brontosaurus would keep us going for months stay
though for a few days only come to think of it no
meat would keep a week in that climate we would have
to kill every other day hunting expeditions into that
blind blanketing fog oh how i longed for one soul
filling glimpse of an earthly landscape on a clear crisp
autumn day with miles upon miles of rolling country to
the hazy horizon

  and suppose the mosquitoes attacked us on a hunting
expedition or tyrannus rex got on our trail at a dis-
tance from the nearest tree and moreover what new
and as yet unencountered monstrosities of nature might
lie in store for us farther inland

afy vague fears and longings to get back to the ship
now amounted almost to hysteria it put out of
my mind any fear for what might menace us on the ground
below i fidgeted desperately a few minutes and then
cm

wonder stories quarterly

myrcri that we try to wake our companion and get
xarted along mason thought we should wait a little
longer but finally shook haworths shoulder and called
hi name his eyes came open vacantly and he blinked
a us weakly a few seconds

  we ought to be getting back old man i put in do
you think you can make it yet

  what time is it

  we told him and explained that there was less than
three hours grace before our scheduled start he sat up
immediately and professed himself well able to move

   feel a little dizzy he confessed but im all right
really

  we climbed down the tree in strict silence and listened
carefully and peered in all directions but there seemed no
danger we scouted about a little and i found the lost
hatchet a few dozen yards up the slope then we got out
masons compass and haworth suggested that mason start
aead  was to follow him about a hundred feet behind
wnile haworth himself would bring up the rear allowing
the same interval between himself and me

  in that way we can be sure we are at least traveling
in a straight line

  we did this and aimed our course due west but as if
to hinder us in every way possible the breeze had died
down and the fog closed on us like a ghostly pall we
found that we had to draw closer together to remain visible
to each other we walked for ten minutes in utter still-
ness and should have come in sight of either the shore or
the jungle but nothing was to be seen except the uneven
surface of the bare rock on which we walked mason
stopped a moment and we all paused to look carefully
about us then we continued our walk for ten minutes
more by this time we knew we bad definitely missed
the seemingly simple route haworth closed up towards
me and mason also started back to join us

  we examined the compass carefully and it certainly
seemed an uncertain thing to depend on for our lives
back on earth it had been a very expensive and reliable
instrument but here it wobbled and pivoted unsteadily
over forty-five degrees of the horizon just an earthly
simile for there wasnt such thing as a horizon-only
the white wall of fog shutting us in

  we can only keep walking haworth worried if
we keep spreading out this way we will go in a straight
line at least and will certainly come lo some place in
time

  we were only five hundred yards from the shore
when we left those trees complained mason we
knew the general direction it doesnt seem possible that
we have missed a simple course like this

  but we had

  in the next five minutes the ground commenced to slope
upward and i knew we were absolutely lost we kept on
however for a few minutes more until mason stopped
suddenly turned toward us and beckoned wc walked
quickly and quietly up to where he stood and found
ourselves in sight of the line of woods we moved up
i loser and came upon signs of a struggle for there was
-i good deal of blood about the ground

i looked about me and thought  recognized the spot
where we had encountered the reptile-men i told the
th-r and after some hesitation they both agreed with
we eyed the dark shadow of the trees half expect-
i-  to see a mob of the creatures pour out to attack us

 -vervthing was quiet and nothing appeared in our
of vision except the motionless trunks with their

	tf-ye fathered tops

  vm least knew where we were once more and set out
i ocxx for she clump of three trees where we had spent

so many hours these were not far away and we found
them without much trouble and flung ourselves down to
rest beside them for as i have said before and again
point out venus is cursed with an almost inconceivably
uncomfortable climate we had been walking almost
half an hour and personally i felt as if i had just fallen
into a warm lake

  it was fortunate wc had found the trees when we did
we had not been there two minutes before we heard ty-
rannus rex roaring and crashing about in the distance
heaven knows what had disturbed him for lie must have
made the worlds rccord meal off his enormous victim a
few hours ago we started up at the sounds all three
of us and were soon in no doubt that he was headed our
way we knew what to do about that by this time how-
ever up we went haworth first myself next and mason
last

  mason surveyed with comical disgust the couch we had
built in the top of the tree

  home again he said ironically

  we could hear the crashing sounds coming nearer and
then we suddenly saw several indistinct things moving
below us about two hundred feet away the breeze had
sprung up again and visibility was better than it had been
they were reptile-men and there were dozens of them i
could hardly resist crying out to warn them before it oc-
curred to me that they could hear the approaching dino-
saur as well as we could i stared in wonder at the little
creatures they were dragging three long ropes which
seemed we had a chance to examine them later made
from some kind of climbing vine half a dozen were
clustered together at the cud of each length of rope which
must have been two hundred feet although it was dif-
ficult to be ccrtain of anything in the uncertain niist

  as we watched they spread out excitedly and two of the
ropes were dragged away out of sight the third one was
stretched in a straight line the reptiles on the near end
of it coming right under our tree but without observing
us then the main body of reptiles walked forward in a
mob towards the approaching monster

  you dont suppose they can take him into camp ex-
claimed mason

  haworths eyes were shining and his face showed the
greatest excitement i heard him mutter

  true reasoning animals if they can fight that fel-
low they have conquered their environment and no mis-
take

chapter ix
lott

suddenly the great dinosaur uttered a prodigious roar
and we heard his crashing twenty-foot strides racing to-
ward us the mob of reptiles were running for their lives
now and crossed over the slackened rope just as the beast
burst into view through the fog he arrived at the rope
in three bounds and the same number of seconds as he
did so the six reptile-men beneath us heaved on the end
of it and it rose a foot or two into the air tyrannus
caught his foot hard against it and the shock pulled the
little struggling group ten feet outwards

  but as for their enemy-

  the vibration of his fall caused even the tree in which
we crouched to tremble slightly he lay there stunned
the creatures beneath us raced at high speed off into the
fog taking their rope with them then the great beast
scrambled to his feet roaring again and again as he did
so he looked uncertainly about him and shaking his
the voyage of the asteroid



head stupidly suddenly started off into the fog once more
at full speed

  in a few seconds we heard again the crash of his sec-
ond fall this time he was silent for almost two minutes
and in the silence we could distinctly hear the squealing
and grunting of his hurrying tormentors

  amazing perfectly amazing whispered haworth

  mason was grinning delightedly

  arent they the little dears he asked happily now
i know i want to make their acquaintance

  again we heard the thudding rush and the resounding
tumble but this time the dinosaur was evidently on his
feet too soon for we heard his roaring and two or three
high-pitched squeals some of the little fellows had been
caught

  but there were plenty of them to continue the game
and continue it they did for half an hour-now drawing
away from us and now approaching finally we were
sure they bad turned their trick for five minutes of silence
had followed the last crashing fall as we gazed eagerly
in the direction of the last noises we perceived the reptile-
men racing toward us out of the mist

  this time nearly twenty of them crouched beneath our
clump of trees all holding tightly to the end of their rope
and staring fixedly out in the direction from which they
had come at the other end of the rope another group
could be seen dimly through the fog

  the great coughing roar broke forth afresh and once
more the enraged dinosaur came into view he was not
traveling so fast this time however and he was covered
with blood and filth his great jaws were wide open
and blood of a startling green hue dripped from them

  the rope tightened before his step and tripped him
but this time while he was still hurtling through the air
the reptile-men rushed out abandoning their rope at
the same time the other group closed in on him and pres-
ently through the white wall that shut us in came a vast
mob of them all racing swiftly toward their now silent
foe desperately they threw their ropes over his body
and twisted them about the slowly-moving tail some of
them carried large rocks and half a dozen at once clarn-
bcrcd swiftly up on his back and commenced hammering
with the rocks on his spine it looked as though they had
won their battle for a minute but the end was not yet
suddenly the great tail swept up into the air with three
of the reptile-men clinging to it and crashed down again
on the ground the huge legs began to scramble for a
grip on the stone and the dinosaur rose unsteadily to his
feet-the creatures on his back still pounding desperately
with the heavy rocks their victim was shaky as could
readily be observed but he wa by no means finished

  frantically the ropes were tightened and those immed-
iately in his path attempted to escape but the huge jaws
rcachcd down and crunched heavily on three of them be-
fore you could snap your fingers the beast surged for-
ward dragging four ropes and a hundred of his tormenters
after him

  so far we had carefully remained in the role of ob-
servers but to do so longer was more than human flesh
and blood could stand we had two good rifles left
and as mason and haworth scrambled down the trunk

i took careful aim at my mark and fired ten shots as fast
as i could pull the trigger the efforts of the reptile-
men to break the beasts spinal column had given me my
clue i had aimed carefully for this apparently vital
spot and i am sure i must have hit at least once for
the range was not more than two hundred feet

  as i hastily refilled the cartridge chamber i saw my
two foolhardy companions start out from the foot of
the tree haworth had his revolver in hand and mason

had the rifle at his shoulder they fired as i looked
and the dinosaur wheeled about trailing his hundred
stubborn followers behind him and made straight for
us i saw my friends start back to the tree and realized
in the same instant that they could never get up out of
reach in time

  it was up to me but the great head now completely
obstructed my aim at the one vital spot my mind
raced desperately over a dozen possibilities but finally
i determined to aim for his left eye and raising my
rillc i pumped ten -calibre bullets straight into it

  he kept coming forward for half a second and it was
not until he crashed down on his breast that i realized
his forward motion had been merely falling

  we never did know exactly what killed him perhaps
ray shots in his back had not taken effect until then or
possibly a few ounces of lead in his brain had done the
trick but he did not move again my companions had
got a few feet up the tree trunk and they now descended
once more and waited until i had joined them when
we all three walked forward

  the reptile-men had drawn together in a crowd on the
other side of the carcass and they eyed us in silcnce
haworth prodded the dead dinosaur with his foot and
then held his arm in the air in salutation we raised
our arms also following his lead and we all three pro-
ceeded to make what we considered to be friendly sounds
and gestures i do not recollect what particular words
i said but i could hear mason repeating over and over
again

  you plucky little beggars you plucky little beg-
gars

  they cocked their heads at us and one of them whom
we had observed during the fight which he had several
times appeared to be directing stepped forward a few
paces and croaked or grunted it was an indescribable
sound at us haworth promptly mimicked him as well
as he could and bcckoned vaguely with his left hand
the reptile then jumped in the air several times quite
lively and stood still staring inquisitively at us

  haworth turned around to us

  im blessed if i know what to do he said can you
think of any gesture or sound that might be common to
both men and reptiles

tt struck me at once we both had to eat i opened my

  mouth to its widest and pointed with my right hand
down my throat smacking my lips loudly the creature
stared at me silently for several seconds then he turned
his head to the body lying beside us and looked back to
me again

  he evidently thinks yon ought to eat your kill said
mason tell him you want him to cut it up and bring
it to you on a silver platter

  but that gave me another idea i had a knife in the
cotton belt of my trousers quickly i pulled this out and
walked over to the huge head i stooped down and cut a
two-pound piece from the green drooling tongue this
i held in my outstretched hand and slowly advanced to-
ward the reptile chief

  that saved the day he let me come right up to him
and took the meat with his strange little claw-fingers put
the whole two pounds into his commodious mouth chewed
it twice and swallowed it-holus-bolus

  and then haworth had an inspiration he walked up
to the carcass of the late tyrannus rex and made a broad
sweeping gesture toward the gathering of reptiles then
he backed off a pace and repeated his gesture keeping
the performance up until he reached our vicinity i had
rejoined mason in the meantime that apparently set-


wonder stories quarterly

lied the doubts of our visitors there was a mad scramble
for the body and such a piece of trencher-work as they
made of it their long sharp jaws tore great pieces of
flesh out and little attempt was made at mastication they
just gulped it down in a hurry and went back for more
not even the tough hide seemed to interfere with diges-
tion

  we three humans drew off a little to one side i was
too interested to feel digustcd several quarrels started
here and there and one poor fellow got badly bitten and
had to withdraw to attend to his wounds

  but mason was nervously consulting his watch

  we have to act quickly to meet our schedule do you
suppose that you could give them the idea we want to go
back where we came from

  not much chance of that for a while yet

  and indeed the carnival was at its height we watched
in some amusement the gargantuan meal then a move-
ment of shadows beyond the feasters caught my eye i
called haworths attention to it and we peered anxiously
through the mist hastily reloading our empty guns from
our bandoliers the shadows did not seem to be ap-
proaching but merely hovered in the background and
since the feasters did not appear to be in the least alarmed
we concluded it must be the second table waiting their
turn in this surmise we were entirely correct

  the fury of the prandial onslaught waned and presently
they climbed off the raw and gruesome carcass by twos
and threes-bloody from head to foot and with noticeably
distended bellies before the last one could get out ol
the way figures emerged literally by the hundred from
the surrounding fog-many young ones among them-
and all that had happened before might be considered
polite table manners compared to the scene that now en-
sued

  women and children last and mason turned away
i felt a little squeamish

  now is our chance to try and explain to the chief that
we need a guide things are getting pretty desperate you
know an hour and a half more delay and it may mean
the end of us have you any ideas about sign lan-
guages

  it seems strange enough now that we were not more
alarmed than we were somehow the knowledge that wc
were only a quarter of a mile from our vessel kept us from
getting into a panic but on venus blinded by the swirl-
ing steamy air with an unreliable compass it might as
well have been a hundred miles we were however en-
tirely uncomfortable and weakened in nerve and body
as well as being drenched with perspiration from the stif-
ling heat in addition as i have said i myself did not
once fully recover from my complete horror and fear while
we remained on the planet

  we spent several minutes in deep thought occasion-
ally interrupted by those incoherent exclamations that
accompany the consideration of serious problems we
finally rcached an opinion that if haworth took the chief
aside and pointed in the approximate direction and then
attempted to start him along with us the meaning would
- clear enough and so it would perhaps but when
haworth approached the group of warriors it was im-
-iible to identify the chicf they were sprawled in
ill forts of attitudes upon the rocky ground licking their
 -lie with th-ir long pink tongues or blinking vacantly
j r another in surfeited delight but when haworth

   within ten feet of the nearest up he jumped and stood
r-ir-zs him uneasily he approached another step and
tbrr ill c  up and moved back before him
there we were

  so hrorth pointed in a general westerly direction

and made huge beckonings with his other arm but the
beasts just blinked stupidly and some of them backed
away a step or so more he called mason and myself
over and we came instantly rifles ready but all he
wanted us to do was to stand beside him and make the
same gestures he did we pointed and beckoned for a
minute and then he whispered

  now lets all back away in the direction we want to

go

  so we started off slowly looking over our shoulders
but if any reaction was apparent on the part of the rep-
tile-men it was one of relief we stood there uncertain
what to do next

  we havent another minute to waste announced mason
firmly looking at his watch now lets start west in
single file as we did before but this time lets keep
going until we reach the shore why the damn thing
is only a few hundred yards away

  so we took a last look at the reptile-men the war-
riors were staring silently back at us and the children
and females were too busy to pay us any attention what-
ever then we turned about and started off-haworth
in the lead myself next and mason with the compass
bringing up the rear after fifty steps i turned around
and noticed that the mists had swallowed up the scene of
the battle completely although i could readily tell the
direction in which it lay by the confused murmur of the
feasters keeping spaced out one hundred feet or so
apart we proceeded over the rocky surface in as straight
a line as we could with due alterations called out by
mason from the rear and based he afterwards confessed
half upon the compass and half upon his own good guess

  after a while the ground sloped down slightly and
through the surrounding white wall of fog on our right
a line of shadow appeared it was the jungle-swamp
i had rather expected that we would sight it if anywhere
upon our left but presumably i had been confused in the
mists presently haworth stopped and waited until we
both joined him

  we might as well keep together now we have only
to follow the edge of the jungle down to the shore

  thank god i exclaimed fervently

  but after twenty minutes march we were not so sure
and then the swamps edge curved inwards and we were
forced to bear to the left to avoid it the curve con-
tinued until we found our course absolutely cut off we
were lost again

  mason thought a moment

  we must be on a tongue of rock running out into this
sea of jungle theres no other explanation lets go
back to where we first hit the edge of this swamp

  i just followed the others blindly rifle clutched tightly
and my teeth clenched so hard together that my jaws
were sore for several days afterwards we cut across
and retraced our steps walking now more quickly than
we had done and soon came to the end of the jungle
here it bore away to our left i wanted to follow it i
wish we had but the others felt sure that our course lay
to our right

  if we turn right here said haworth and keep going
a few minutes without striking the jungle on the other
side of this clear space then well go back and try your
way

  but my panic made me obstinate and i started off and
went perhaps fifty feet along close to the jungle then
the figures of my companions dimmed slightly in the
surrounding fog and i turned and incontinently rejoined
them

  we had not been walking two minutes-keeping as
straight as we could in our single file formation-when
the voyage of the asteroid	

haworth waved to us silently when we reached him
the jungle wall was showing vaguely in the steamy air
we felt hopeful once more

  its about time too another twenty minutes and we
would have been too late to make it well have to hurry
along as it is i hope the little boat is safe where you
left her mason

  wc had been completely exhausted in the vitiating tem-
perature how haworth kept going i do not know but
we forgot our discomforts in this fresh hope in five
minutes the tall shadow of a tree swam mistily in the
middle distance at the same time we became aware of
a murmur of sound upon our left

   it was the reptile-men still at their feast

  we were back where we had started from listlessly
we turned to the sound and made our way towards it

chapter x
a strange malady

  as we approached our three familiar tree-ferns once
again everything was suddenly quiet and when the
advancing wall of mist before us disclosed the gathering
of feastera they were in compact array eyeing us very
uneasily i thought we attempted to signal them our
wishes but received no answer except the steady emotion-
less staring

  evidently they knew us for after a moment they turned
about and started off for the woods on the slope above
wo followed them you could not say wc accompanied
them for not one of the beasts would permit us to come
closer than ten or twelve feet on they kept at a rapid
pace until the woods were again in sight we three puffing
and sweating behind them and gesturing and talking like
madmen i question in fact if we were any longer en-
tirely sane

  without a pause the whole party plunged into the forest
of tree-ferns and wo perforce followed i dont believe
we had any definite plan but we were desperate it was
dark under the foliage but fairly easy walking the soil
was a mere coating over the rock and the ground was firm
to the foot several times the rcptilc-men nearest us
never nearer than ten feet turned to stare back but
whether from mere curiosity or not we did not know we
were desperately determined to stick to these creatures
until by some means or other wc succeeded in persuading
them to guide us back to the shore

  our time was up we had probably missed our sched-
uled return and the vision of masons worried and pan-
icky countcnance did not help my pcacc of mind if we
succeeded in getting back to the ship within the next few
minutes he said there was a chance for us-not much of
a chance but at least something and failing that-how
could we survive a year in this unfriendly fog

  we had been walking under the trees for perhaps a
quarter of an hour when we came to the village the
word is inaccurate since even from the short glimpse we
were permitted it could be readily seen that only the most
primitive of habitations were grouped here an opening
carpeted with a curious long and tough kind of grass in
which rude nests had been trampled out there were no
roofs although occasionally the grass walls seemed to be
woven crudely together it was as if the innate savagery
of the beasts would not brook the indignity of socializa-
tion without at least the artificial privacy of grass walls

  but we were stopped at the outskirts of the clearing
the warriors confronted us in a determined semi-circle
and we paused to observe our surroundings haworth
stepped forward a pace and made a sweeping gesture of

invitation in the direction from which we had come te
reptile-men eyed us without reply he repeated hit ges-
ture then one of the females in the rear began to hop
up and down excitedly and make high-pitched squealing
noises several others around her imitated the example

  mason and i had our rifles ready in an inslant ha-
worth looked more worried than ever and turned his pale
care-worn face toward us a if he wished to speak but
just then there was a sharp grunt from inside the closed
ranks before us out stepped our old friend the chief
he walked slowly up to haworth and placed one hand
actually on his breast then he gave a gentle push and
backed away a step why he chose haworth i cannot
say unless because of the distinction of his flowing beard

  haworth stood staring at him thinking hard mason
and i stepped forward one on each side of him things
looked dangerous

  what will we do if they advance on us

  if they do that perhaps we are saved was haworths
surprising rejoinder say nothing but do as i do
and then advance they did-the whole line slowly mov-
ing with the chief in the center of it mason grasped my
arm and we three stepped back a pace the reptiles
stepped forward another stride and we kept our distance
soon we were walking at a normal gait surrounded on
three sides by our unwitting guides in a surprisingly
short time we had reached the edge of the woods and here
the reptiles promptly turned about and started back
after them quick said haworth and we did

  in a few minutes the reptile-men halted and again faccd
us-a trifle uneasily this time i imagined again the
chief stepped right up to haworth and gave him another
push again the tribe slowly advanced and we retreated
before it this time however they seemed determined
to finish the job we were evidently unwelcomc although
not enemies right out past the woods we proceeded past
the clump of three trees and into the pathless sea of mists
in twenty minutes we sighted the shore before us and i
half-turned towards our guides feeling in an indefinite
sort of way that we could now dispense with them but
they had other ideas right down to the waters edge they
drove us and then stood there determined to see us depart

  mason was already wading out to where our canvas boat
still rode at her line-not more than twelve feet out he
reached it waist deep and towed her back to the rocks
climbing out of the water and shaking his legs then as
haworth and myself stepped into the frail craft and sat
down he made a gallant bow

  thank you if you only knew how much we wanted
to get back here you would have done this in the first
place farewell my friends and dont forget that some
day men like us will return to venus if they try to buy
your village for twenty-four dollars worth of dinosaur
meat dont be surprised

  with which reflections he took his place with us in the
boat and we pushed off from shore the reptile-men
stood quietly until the mists swallowed us up i was row-
ing and the sea was quiet with slow oily swells lifting us
and lowering us regularly along the shore we went and
then struck out toward the tall shadow we knew was our
rocket ship we had been away more than thirty hours-
how much more were our watches trustworthy with
all the speed possible to our bodies-weary to our bones
and experiencing the inevitable reaction from all our exer-
tion and strain both physical and mental-wc climbed
the rungs up the side of the asteroid leaving the little boat
tied at the bottom mason burst through the hastily
opened air-locks and stopped as though the life had been
drained out of him

  the ships clock read - we were over one
hour too late

   once inside with the doors shut and the refrigerators
on full blast we stripped off our sodden grimy clothing
washed ourselves copiously with reckless disregard now
for our water supply donned dry garments and lelt rav-
enously hungry  have noticed that many times go
through a time of danger even if it be unaccompanied
by physical exertion and the body demands nourish-
ment in silence we ate but we made a thorough meal
there was fresh meat miraculously from the refrigera-
tor crisp biscuits from the sealed tins and a long cool
drink of whiskey soda to top it off above all the blessed
cool dry air of the asteroid was delicious to our steamed
and soaked bodies we were hopeless perhaps but very
comfortable i dont remember when i fell asleep

 i hfre is one peculiar psychological result of travel
to other planets and that is that it gives one an aware-
ness of the exact appearance of the familiar upon return-

 we had leisure to make a thorough observation
 of the hidden side of earths satellite

ing i lay in my hunk when i awoke very pleasantly
aware that i was safe for the present and entirely comfort-
able my skin was bruised and my muscles were tired
but in a dreamy lethargic fashion not at all unpleasant
the details of the living-cabin were unnaturally clear and
sharp to my eyes that peculiar roundish corner where
the pump-room lloor joined the ship hull the flattened
sides of the little control levers beside me the garbage-
door above the stove with its not quite square outline-
everything seemed slightly unfamiliar and made a sharp
clean-cut impression on my senses

  this i attribute to the fact that for thirty-odd hours we
had seen absolutely nothing that was familiar every
leaf every rock every pool of water must be watched it
might represent some danger or prove a valuable discov-
ery our eyes and in fact all our senses had been
strained to examine everything with the utmost care upon
returning to the familiar scenes aboard ship this faculty
of awareness persisted for a little not since my earliest
recollections of childhood when nothing is entirely fami-
the voyage of the asteroid



liar to one had i experienced such a sensation it was
altogether agreeable i seemed to le in a new and fresh
existence it so invigorated me that i could lie still no
longer but arose briskly and wakened my companions
noisily

  mason was on his feet in a jiffy

  the minute i can get something to eal i must see if a
return course cannot still be figured

  i had forgotten all this while our desperate circum-
stances masons words plunged me into the depths of
gloom once more

  our return you will have more than a year to figure
that to your hearts content

  perhaps not

  what do you mean

  theres just a chance we can still make it i made
an exclamation just a minute its only a chance  
the trouble is it will take at least a week to figure out
oh why didnt i prepare some figures for alternate return
dates i had long months of leisure and i simply wasted
them

  but his words put new hope in me

  do you really think we have a chance to start back
in a week

  mason already busy at the stove grunted out what i
took to be i think so and went on silently with his prep-
arations for a meal

  haworth had not yet risen and being questioned de-
scribed himself as not feeling at all well i got out a
thermometer and stuck it at a rakish angle in his mouth

  you can stay there for a week i said and recover
your strength it will take mason that long to figure out
whether you can be sick for a whole year more or have
to get well suddenly

  upon removing the thermometer i was alarmed to see
that he had a temperature slightly over  degrees his
pulse was weak and generally speaking i considered his
condition rather serious mason had by this time pre-
pared boiled eggs and coffee and we tried to get haworth
to eat some but after one spoonful he refused any more

  mason and i discussed our situation out of his hearing
in the pump-room

  you nurse him said he in conclusion and ill chart
a new flight curve

  mason was to be brought his meals and left entirely
undisturbed while i was to run the ship i left him hard
at work and descended to sit beside my patient all that
day haworth lay in his cot i played cribbage with him
and read from the encyclopedia how i wished for an
amusing story and he seemed to be recovering his
strength satisfactorily after fifteen hours mason descend-
ed and we put out the lights in the living-cabin and went
to sleep

  haworth woke us he was sitting bolt upright when i
switched on the lights and reciting poetry in a loud voice
his beard wagging wildly on his chest badly mixed and
garbled verses he spouted-shakespeare milton and
rudyard kipling we would have been amused had it
not been so frightening hour after hour we worked over
him trying to quiet him but we had to strap him down
to his cot in the end and i gave him a shot of morphine
from the medicine cabinet

  we arose after a few hours of broken sleep and mason
resolutely went up above to continue his mathematical
labors i sat beside haworth and worried desperately
his temperature was  degrees i had no sort of no-
tion what was the matter possibly some sort of strange
fever he had caught from the venus jungles-indeed what
might it not have been

  he wakened after a few hours and was quite out of his

head i brewed some strong tea and squeezed lemons into
it this i forced him to sip as often as i could it would
at least allay the fever temporarily but he grew worse
all day and it was again neccssary to quiet him with drugs

  to heaven i heard him mutter to heaven in a
rockct

  i had no one to turn to in my perplexity mason knew
absolutely nothing about medicine and the encyclopedia
was not illuminating although i spent several hours
searching through it with the vague notion that it might
have somewhere in it the necessary information that would
save our friends life yes by now  was doubtful if
he would recover

  when we slept next i lay tossing in my cot rising
silently every hour or so to creep in the darkness over to
his cot and administer some cold tea i had of course
plenty of quinine but the first dose of this usually sov-
ereign remedy had caused such a violent retching that i
did not dare repeat it

  finally mason awoke and switched on the lights this
was our morning on the spacc-ship and this morning
was a sad one haworth did not waken he lay breath-
ing softly and with his eyes sunk deep in his pale cheeks
i could scarcely eat and noticed that mason had some
trouble in swallowing his food we did not exchange a
word there was nothing to say he slowly climbed
up to the room above and drowned his fears in the con-
centration of his work i had no such sedative but sat
despondently on my cot thinking soberly over all that had
happened in an effort to solve the riddle of this strange
illness

  the attack of the insects naturally came to my mind
but that had been so many days ago-surely any poison
that might have infccted their bites would have had an
instant cffcct yet i could not with reason blame any
other agency what weird things they had been mos-
quitoes mason had called them mosquitoes    what
if they were like our earthly insects in this one thing
what if the poison they carried was a disease with
which they inoculated their victim like the yellow-fever
mosquito

  why then i exclaimed aloud i would inoculate him
with immune serum from mason or myself who re-
covered

a nd i was up in an instant and over to the medicine
cabinet where i seized an aseptic syringe and plung-
ing the point carefully into my forearm drew it half full
of blood

  come i thought this is not the way to do there
must be no blood in the serum

  then i paused with the thought that this whole idea
was a tissue of imagination without any facts behind it
should i continue how should i proceed i pondered
for five minutes and had answered both questions first
i would inoculate haworth if the disease had been
caused by the huge insects or not there was neverthe-
less a probability that i had been exposed to the same ill-
ness he had wherever he had got it therefore i being
well might have immune serum in my blood and remote
as the chance might be i had absolutely no other possi-
bility of treatment

  as to the serum i had an idea i turned on the stove
and placed my left hand palm up very firmly upon the
hot metal an instant of pain was sufficient and i prompt-
ly treated my new burn with oil and dressed it carefully
in an hour i had an enormous blister on the back of my
hand and drew off a full syringe of clear serum this i
injected into my patients right arm

  all this may sound a trifle heroic as i write it here


wonder stories quarterly

the actual fact was that it hurt very badly for only the
first few minutes and during those minutes i wished very
strongly that i had not thought of this means of obtaining
clear serum once done there was of course nothing
heroic about continuing the operation

  i was restless and haworth remained unconscious so
i climbed up into the pump-room and opened the air-lock
sitting on the floor of the vestibule with my feet dangling
over after the comfortable coolness of the asteroid the
air of venus hit me like a warm wet sigh dim in the sur-
rounding mists  could make out the shore-jungle and
mud occasionally the visibility would increase as the
wind freshened and at such times i could see on he right
the line of rocks where we had landed

  i mused upon our exploration of venus in all i
thought we have covered less than one square mile of
land in that explored territory we lost ourselves three
times we had observed a few species of reptiles and
half a dozen kinds of trees-mainly cycads now we
are frantically preparing to leave if wc could i was
perhaps unjust since we certainly had traversed some
thousands of miles of water and this might be termed
exploring the planet in a sense certainly we had deter-
mined the fact that a large portion of the surface of this
planet was liquid

  i gazed down upon this water as i sat there and saw
the waves had risen considerably our ship was not af-
fected by them since she was firmly aground on the mud
beneath the breeze seemed to be increasing and as i
sat watching a furious gust came along the mist
swirled and thinned out and for two minutes there sprang
into view the entire coast before me

  i shouted for mason and he came instantly to stand
beside me in the narrow vestibule half a mile away
on the low slope of bare rock stood our three tree-ferns
and back of them the line of forest the mists cleared
still farther and we saw for an instant miles of land-
scape-great hills rising in the background dotted with
verdure the light increased more and more wc fol-
lowed the line of hills up until they lost themselves in
the mist but i distinctly saw a golden glow over them
as if the sun had sent its rays through the enveloping
atmosphere to point them out to us it lasted an in-
stant like a promise and then the mists closed out the
hills and we saw nothing but the miles of rocks and
jungle then the wind slackened still more and the fog
closed down until we could barely make out the nearby
shore

  mason gasped as though he had been holding his
breath throughout the whole revelation

  that might be a place worth visiting

  i agreed

  on the top of those hills the sun might occasionally
shine not too often for it would then be intolerably
warm but enough to let a man see where he was going

  why would it be so warm and then i answered my
own question oh of course were thirty million miles
nearer the sun than the earth is

  we sat in thought a moment then i told him my
fears for haworth and the means i had taken

  if lie shows no improvement in another hour i add-
ed i am going to inject your serum whatever disease
be may have it might have passed me by and touched
you

  suppose he was the only one to be favored

  if it affected him alone then i dont think  im
afraid   

  i left my sentence unfinished mason frowned terri-
fically and passed his hand over his forehead we went
inside and closed the doors for it bad already become un-

comfortably warm in the ship we turned on the re-
frigerators and soon were cool again he sat down once
more to his work and i descended to the living-eabin

  haworth was still unconscious and seemed weaker-
too weak his pulse was barely detectable in despera-
tion i filled a glass of whiskey and poured it between his
lips in a few minutes his pulse was stronger and then
suddenly the sweat came

  i knew what that meant the fever had broken

  i wrapped him in blankets and strapped them over his
body and called up the good news to mason whose face
promptly appeared in the hole in the ceiling he was
smiling broadly once again

chapter xi

back to earth

there is no need of detailing the steps to recovery ha-
worth was ravenously hungry when he woke and i
found my job of cook to the ship no sinecure what with
my burned hand mason left his figures long enough
for one game of cribbage with our patient and spent the
rest of his time up above in a very fury of calculation
how are you making out

  you know we have a chance-just a chance

  eight earthly days passed with the same report ha-
worth was steadily improving all the time and was more
or less up and around when we heard a shout from above
mason climbed down and joined us in high spirits

  we start home he said studying the clock which
read - in three hours and twenty-four min-
utes

    uttered a shout of relief and joy

  but how can we manage to connect with the earth this
late objected haworth venus travels so much faster
than the earth that we must be past its place in its
orbit by now

  we are retorted the mathematician but only just
past it we have to lose an excess speed of about teu
miles a second in order to land on the earth our fifty
per cent reserve of fuel will do this nicely we calcu-
lated on seven miles a second you know

  but if we plan to use all our reserves arent we tak-
ing a considerable chance

  mason shrugged his shoulders

  lets be glad we have a chance to take would you
prefer staying here a year

  god forbid

  haworth was almost recovered by then the past few
days had done wonders for him he declared himself
ready to take command of the asteroid on her return
voyage and with the words scarcely out of his mouth he
was clambering up to the pump-room where he spent the
next three hours scrambling about the machinery-testing
and checking everything was exactly as it had been but
that was his way- and not a bad way at that perhaps
it seemed so good to us to have him up and about that
he might have had i know not how many unusual habits
they would have all appeared sensible and desirable i
mention this because usually il irritates me to see some-
one take unnecessary precautions and to check and re-
check the already correct

  we spent a final five minutes at the vestibule door
looking our last on the face of venus i do not know
exactly what we had cxpected from our trip visions of
miraculous discoveries smiling fertile landscapes perhaps
gold and other precious metals lying about in abundance
but certainly we had none of us expected just what we
had found
the voyage of the asteroid



  as mason put it we could have filled madison square
garden with live steam and sat in it for three weeks to
about the same advantage not only that but we would
have known where we were all the time in that case

  but in spite of disappointments there was a feeling of
accomplishment which we all shared there were few
thrilling discoveries it is true but just the same we were
the first of the human race to visit a planet other than our
own some day these vague inhospitable shores would
be made habitable this spot where our ship lay ground-
ed in the shallows would be historic  had my camera
with me at the doorway and made a photograph a print
of which is before me now dark water and darker jungle
and the white fog over all

  we elosed the doors and scrcwcd them fast and made
our way to the cots

  ready called haworth his hand on the starting lever

  mason and i turned to our duties and felt the ship lurch
as the power was applied we were pressed deeply into
our cots and our bodies were heavy under the steady ac-
celeration the dials moved slowly and the misty surface
of the periscope glass grew brighter each moment

  suddenly the mist vanished and bright sunlight almost
blinded us

  mason twisted the controls until we had located our ob-
jective a small star in a peculiar triangle formation and
then haworth made a warning sign to us and turned on
the power to full acceleration now we felt the pressure
severely i could hardly move my arm to the controls and
lying on my back as  was it was exceeding difficult to
raise my head there was however very little to be done
so far as  was concerned my two companions had most
of the control mechanism in their charge and seemed to
manage well enough although they perspired visibly with
their efforts

  it lasted only ten minutes or so the noise of the
rocket exhaust had increased to a deafening roar when
the last section had been dropped off and the sudden
silence came like a blow haworth was not quite quick
enough in starting up the gyroscope and  was overcome
with nausea as my body was suddenly left weightless

  when i had in a measure recovered mason was stand-
ing over me with raised eyebrows

  this time you can clean it up yourself do you
good	

  i complied weakly and really felt better for the exer-
tion

  the floor was now our partition wall for the rotation
of the ship about her line of flight had again set up an
artificial gravity outwards in all directions i observed
that the speed indicator and other instruments no longer
registered for we were entirely out of the atmosphere of
venus we were coasting freely at almost ten miles a sec-
ond back to earth how eagerly we looked in the peris-
cope glass as mason brought into view our home planet
there it stood a pure white ball of minute proportions
although larger than any of the stars that glowed so much
more violently around it then he turned the ship until
venus swung into line and we saw the huge surface we
were leaving all glistening on one half where the sun
struck it slantingly and a dirty grey-black on the shad-
owed portion but white or grey it was all the same
blinding mist-the curse of the planet

  and now if i am to be kind to my readers i will spare
them the details of the next ninety days after our hard-
ships upon venus we were mentally and bodily exhausted
and quite content for some weeks to rest in complete sloth
then we felt the need of amusement and occupation and
i for one passed the time very pleasantly by working my
observations and specimens into the form of notes then

 had a number of photographs to develop and print and
additional astronomical pictures to take i did not hurry
my tasks and interspersed my working hours liberally with
less serious occupations our cribbage tournament was
revived and we even became interested in three-handed
auction bridge for a while mason and haworth were
equally well occupied we knew what to expect and
were not too impatient but hardly a single detail of
this period stands out clearly in my memory

  venus and all we had seen there had become a dream
it was difficult to believe that wc had really been there
we seemed to have been living forever in this space ship
adrift in the abyss

tt came as a distinct shock when mason announced from

  the pcriscope that the earth was growing visibly larger
but a glance at the ships clock showed - we
were due to land in less than two weeks we clustered
about the glass observing with delight our native world
she showed about three inches across like a tiny moon
and in fact her own moon was now distinctly visible a
gleaming disk three-quarters of an inch in diameter and
of exceeding interest to mason this moon was since the
hidden side was exposed to our view and brightly lighted

  it must be a new moon on earth said mason and no
remark he could have made would have brought to me
more clearly the fact that we were wanderers in strange
places

  we had the leisure to make a thorough observation of
the hidden side of the earths satellite during the next
week and mason was vastly busy making notes while i
took photographs at his direction full details of his
findings are of course available to the interested reader in
his recently published monograph on the subject and
as all the world knows by now nothing essentially different
exists on that side than on the other on the voyage out
we had been able to see a small sector of this unknown
portion but not until now had we such leisure and op-
portunity to make a detailed observation

  as the days passed the earth took on additional form
and detail it was a glorious sight to our eyes and
a last look in the other direction showed a tiny dot of soft
white light-all that could be seen of venus soon i
thought we shall gaze on her from the earth and see
not the familiar evening star hut the cold unwinking eye
f a reptile-man or the baleful orb of dinosaur tyrannus
rex

  but haworth was busy preparing for our landing man-
euvers and i was sufficiently familiar with these by now
to take an intelligent interest when we had shut off our
motors after leaing venus we had exhausted the fuel
of the second step of the asteroid and discarded it con-
tinuing our flight in the small eighty-ton third step for-
merly contained in its nose it was in this small ship
of course that the controls and cabins were centered
the fuel of this ship in turn had been almost entirely
exhausted so that it was necessary as haworth pointed
out to make a perfect landing

  for if we dont he said we have no power left to
rectify an imperfect one

  he had already turned the handle and set the pumps to
work projecting our wings this required practically no
effort while we were still in space it could har fcwra
done by hand had that been necessary

  i believe he said we will endeavor to comnarcr
our landing circles at the equator then as we slacken
speed we can verge northward consequently shortening
our circles we will have to land where we can of
course for we have no power to waste choosing a suitable
spot
wonder stories quarterly

  i suggested that we would need to land in water and
for that reason might do best to land near the equator
line for in this zone much more water occurs than land

  and i continued if any change be made from the
equatorial circle why not southward for a les proportion
of land exists in the southern hemisphere than in the
northern

  haworth agreed with me after a moments thought

  however he added i believe we can lind cither the
atlantic or the pacific ocean easily enough and on the
other hand have you ever thought what might happen if
we landed in the south atlantic thousands of miles from
the ocean traffic lanes one can be very thoroughly lost
even on our own familiar earth you know

   this was true of course but i confess that any part of
the earth whatsoever had seemed safe haven a moment
before he spoke

  the northern hemisphere in the temperate zone is
much the most civilized portion of the globe as to a
landing place we might even be lucky enough to reach
long island sound-or perhaps even our little lake in
connecticut and the great lakes have distinct possi-
bilties as well

  it may sound strange to hear a planet some eight thou-
sand miles in diameter discussed in this fashion but fol-
lowing this conversation  went to the periscope glass and
gazed for many painstaking minutes before i could be
sure i recognized the dark line that was the mediterranean
sea

  our landing maneuvers were to be the same as before
we entered the atmosphere at a high altitude about
seventy miles and the air was so rare at this height that
even our speed of almost five miles a second did not
cause sufficient friction to endanger our ship our wings
turned in a small arc so that at first they were used to
hold the asteroid down towards the earth for our terrific
speed tended to make us fly away again into space but
we used the wings to force us around the globe again and
again in a circle

  we circumnavigated the world in less than an hour and
a half at first then the friction slowly lessened our
speed and permitted gravity to affect our course down-
ward then the wings were inclined the other way so as
to support us in the air as our speed lessened we de-
scended still lower until at last we were traveling at
about two or three hundred miles an hour and ready for
a landing similar to that of a fast airplane at such a
speed a landing was difficult but if made in smooth water
our staunch metal hull would protect us from damage

  the whole maneuver went through exactly as planned
haworth and mason were at the controls as before and
the operation required some seventeen hours to perform
we entered the atmosphere of earth at - by the
ships clock

  i could observe the periscope glass from my cot except
for occasional moments when masons head was in the way
the earth had long since loomed up until it filled half
the entire sky and as we entered the atmosphere i could
see oceans and continents sweep by beneath us like a
panorama designed by a madman the strain and worry
was visible on masons frowning face and haworth clawed
nervously at his black heard half the time i myself was
without special duty for the most part although for a
five-hour stretch i relieved mason at the periscope

  it we could only make a landing somewhere near the
united states haworth was repeating over and over to
himself

  mason laughed

  it would be a fine thing if we ended up shipwrecked
in the middle of the ocean do try and land in new

york harbor old man near quarantine if you can for
i understand they are most particular down there about
vessels arriving from foreign ports

  for the last two minutes i relinquished the periscope
controls to mason we were over spain at the time and
traveling west at less than two miles a second haworth
was jubilant

  well just about make it he prophesied

  and we did we had been scudding over the atlantic
for an hour and a half at constantly lessening speed
when i noticed that the surface of the water showing in
the glass had become more detailed instead of a smooth
sheet of lead-colored matter separate ripples were now
discernible then the ripples grew into small wave lines
and these enlarged until the familiar seascape spread be-
fore us not a mile below

  hold fast warned haworth

  we all made sure of our fastenings and positions

  suddenly the waves loomed up swift and huge in the
glass and a great white splash wiped out all vision at
the same time the asteroid gave a terrific lurch and rolled
over and over several times then all was still once more
except for a strong steady heave of the vessel in the
trough of the seas our cabin was now as it had been
several times before our floors had turned into the cir-
cular hull wall for the ship floated upright none of
us had been hurt in the slightest but the cabin was a
chaos for the kitchen cabinet had burst open and the
encyclopedia britannica was indiscrimnately mingled with
pots and pans and a thoughtlessly open can of photo-
graph-developing fluid

  the ships clock read - the voyage was
over

  we climbed the three of us up the rungs on the
water tank through the opening in what was now our
ceiling and into the pump-room now above us mason
wrenched at the lever and flung open the vestibule door
i darted into the vestibule and opened the air-lock door
to the outside world the ocean breeze was full in our
faces and filled the cabin with a delicious odor it was
unbelievably invigorating after six months in artificial
atmosphere and three weeks of venus steamy air im-
pregnated with chlorine we crowded in the tiny en-
trance arms about each others shoulders and breathed
it in as if we could never have enough

he rest is history everyone within reach of a radio
or newspaper knows that captain turnbull of the
british tramp-steamer gardenia picked us up a hundred
miles east of the long island coast haworth offered him
enormous largesse if he would tow the asteroid into new
york and we even lived aboard our own little vessel dur-
ing the twenty four hours this required the wind was
quartering against him the captain good man left
the management of his own ship to his first mate when he
found out what was afoot for he was aboard our vessel
most of the short trip staring open-mouthed at one or
the other of us listening and asking questions

  the gardenia had a radio on board and it had been in
frantic use evidently for when we reached new york har-
bor the official city tug met us and we were constrained
to leave the asteroid in charge of captain turnbull and
be officially welcomed by the city of new york haworth
arranged that our rocket ship would be anchored in an
inaccessible section of the harbor and well-guarded and
that we would come back for her later on then we
went with the officials

  many of you who read this may have seen us riding
through bedlam  an automobile that day and wondered
what we were thinking about for myself i was think-
the voyage of the asteroid



ing how happy i was and how glad and good it felt to
see a million or so homan beings once again-particularly
since they seemed glad to see me we couldnt have had
too much fuss and noise to suit my taste just then-al-
though  will admit there is a limit to all pleasures as
wo have since found out

  one more scene and i am done a few nights ago dr
mason and myself dined ai the charles bascomb haworth
mansion in connecticut at mr haworths special invita-
tion

  bigelow he said your moving picture films and
photographs have been sold on a royalty basis to a well-
known syndicate

  i nodded

  do you know what the royalties have amounted to in
the single month that have elapsed since our return over
two and a half million dollars

  i suppressed an exclamation and mason looked up with
raised eyebrows

  i have estimated the entire cost of the asteroid in-
cluding all test flights and find it amounts to very little
more than that sum continued haworth it is certain
that in a few months more what with further royalties
on the pictures and the income from your book and
masons scientific writings we will have a substantial
income above all costs of the expedition this naturally
we share equally

  so the voyage to venus barren of treasure as it seemed
at first has finally resulted in modest wealth for us all
i have bought over the ownership of lens and bellows
and find i have made a very comfortable investment
mason and i still live together though he talks of starting

off for the mount wilson observatory next month to
spend at least a part of his sabbatical year as originally
intended

  haworth as the world knows has buried himself in his
connecticut estate what is not generally known is that
he is working he says he has an idea and mason and
i find it uninteresting to visit him for his time is spent
entirely in his study where he sits brooding over books
stroking his beard the while or pacing the floor in deep
concentration as mason says of course we are wel-
come to go for walks with him-the length of the study
and back but im tired of being confined to rooms

  with the enormous mass of public interest directed up-
on the subject it is not surprising that as i write no less
than three space ships are building both the ships of
the german interplanetary society and the french ir
corps are designed for voyages to the moons frozen sur-
face the american interplanetary society their mem-
bership jumped to  last week i am told plan a
vessel to visit either mars or venus for a more satisfac-
tory exploration all three of us have been invited to
take places-in fact to assume leadership-in this expe-
dition

  it would be idle to say that i am content to remain in
comfort here forever it is good to be back of course
but there is something very irritating to me about the half-
finished nature of our exploration on venus with fog-
piercing searchlights a very great deal may be possible on
that planet the general magnetic company has been
good enough to turn thedr laboratories to work on this
problem if they succeed and if a ship is available-
well i wont say what might eventually happen but that
lies in the bosom of the future

based upon the seventh prize winning plot of the interplanetary plot contest
won by john michel  new york ave brooklyn n y

clive torrence sauntered leisurely along ihe en-
closed promenade deck of the space liner tlielon
his big well-proportioned body moved forward with
a studied lazy grace clive was happy for he was free

  he had been granted a two months leave from his post
as engineer in the iridium mines of neptunes satellite
and had promptly come sunward for he was sick of the
dark and cold and loneliness of that far-flung outpost of
the solar system he
hated the owl-eyed men
who had been under
his direction and in
return they had hated
him not because he
was unnecessar-
 y cruel but because
he was a native of the
imperialistic inner
planets on two oc-
casions only the quick
use of a ray pistol and
a heavy lash had sav-
ed him from death at
their hands he could
forget that life now-
for two months-two
months

  arriving on earth he
had immediately book-
ed passage on the
thelon which was go-
ing on a sight-seeing
cruise around the sun

his decision was based
partly on impulse

clive liked to give his
impulses free rein for
this would aid him in
convincing himself
that his freedom was
real another reason
was that the thelon
was under the com-
mand of one pakofi
an odd little martian
with whom clive had
become intimate dur-
ing a year of study
spent at oktool mars

  now there was an
unmistakable feeling
of tension aboard the
thelon the passen-
gers for the most part
college students of
earth taking their first
vacation trip out into
space lined the broad quartz glass observation bays of
ihe promenade their youthful fun-loving vivacity seemed
strangely subdued only an occasional low and rather
perfunctory laugh at some light joke told of their attempts
to remain carefree their expectant attention seemed
riveted searchingly on the void true-there was nothing
unusual to see-only unwinking stars and blackness

however something definitely unusual had been seen and
it might appear again

  all that had been learned of il in the brief moment that
it was visible was that it was round and large and alien
and moved with darting flitting movements its aspect
seemed definitely sinister but this might be only because
it was a mystery and there was a rumor around that
certain radio messages had been received by the ship

  clive torrence did
not share the fears of
his young fellow pas-
sengers for not with-
out reason he looked
uon himself as a
hardened and exper-
ienced adventurer

 his apparently
pointless stroll had a
definite objective
without haste he
threaded his way
through the modernist-
ically dressed throng
now and then nodding
and smiling to an in-
dividual with whom
he was already slight-
ly acquainted he came
at last to a short spiral
stairway at the foot of
which stood an officer
clad in a white uni-
form this man an
earthpian as were most
of the crew already
knew of clives rela-
tionship to the thelons
captain

  the chiefs been
wondering when you
would appear tor-
rence he said with an
attempt at lightness
go on up he has
news for you

  i hope its bad
clive replied with an
unaffected chuckle o
pleasure he was thor-
oughly enjoying the
little mystery which
seemed to have every-
body so buffaloed

  ascending the spiral
torrence entered the
airy coolness of the
control room it was
a place of perfect or-
der and yet of bewildering complexity its white walls
tinted softly by the green rays of an illuminator set in the
ceiling were lined with levers and gauges and television
panels that gave views of surrounding space in all direc-
tions a few glass globes glowed eerily among spidery
mazes of metal cables

  when clive made his quiet entrance the tiny martian

john michel raymond gallun

  who furnished the plot who wrote the story

 today the university student does not feel his
 education complete unless he travels to other
 lands and observes peoples cities and customs
 different from our own why not then when in-
 terplanetary travel has become a reality the in-
 terstellar tourist cruise young men fresh from
 schools will taste of the vastness of space and the
 far reaches of the suns domains

  but these youngsters must not expect such
cruises to all be picnics no matter how well ex-
plored the suns planets there will always be
mysterious beings mysterious forces and strange
events to add the flavor of danger to such inter-
stellar tours

   on the surface of sun-baked mercury the near-
 est and the most eccentric child of the sun this
 story is laid it is prophetic for its vision of what
 the tourist of the future might expect

captains back was toward him

  apparently unnoticed clive watched pakoh on the
earthmans face there was a strangely mixed expression
part sly amusement part puzzlement part awe iakoh
was barely four feet tall the breech clout of fine-spun
metal cloth which he wore left most of his gnarled and
dried physique revealed

  to look at him as he worked over his mechanisms
darting from this instrument to that turning dials and
adjusting levers with quick efficiency made one think of
things-of the shuttle of a busy loom of waterless deserts
beneath a hot though shrunken sun of something ancient
unknowable and all-wise-like the sphinx

  pakoh was closc to three hundred earth years old which
is middle age by martian standards the skin of his
thin limbs and expanded torso was brown and wrinkled
and was scarred by acid burns of an accident which had
happened years ago he seemed like a battered and
hideous antique doll or like a bit of dried and crumpled
leather such as one might find in the dusty corner of a
tomb

 i orrexce reflected that there were things about
pakoh and all his kind that were perhaps too sim-
ple to understand that silly little round cap he was
wearing for instance it covered barely a square inch of
his bald pate and certainly served no sensible purpose
yet pakoh would sooner go among bloodthirsty savages
unarmed than be without that diminutive and thorough-
ly impractical piece of headgear

  without turning to look yet evidently well aware of
the identity of the person who had entered his sanctuary
pakoh spoke his words were english and his voice was
high piping and sibilant you have finished your lit-
tle nap clive torrence he asked i would have sent
for you only you sleep so sound so like a baby so lurrane
a caressing exotic trill to the martian word that i have
not the heart to wake you

  amused as he always was at his small friends quaint
speech torrence laughed lightly you neednt have
been so considerate of me gnome he told him there
was  disrespect in the nickname by which he commonly
addressed pakoh but whats it all about anyway
drayden said that you had learned something new if
so out with it

  pakoh remained silent for a moment while he made
some final adjustments of the controlling machinery the
ship lurched seemed to change its course slightly and
the sound of the rockets coming distantly from the rear
rose and fell then it settled down to an even hypnotic
purr there was a slight pressure of acceleration a red
signal light glowed on a control panel and pakoh moved
a switch satisfied he turned to the earthman

  pakohs pinched and wizened face was is ridiculously
serious as that of a small monkey queer lights are
seen on dark side of mercury he said they flicker
go out burn again the tliclon is nearest to mercury
and i am ordered by radio to investigate so we go
arrive in six hours you would see lights

  without waiting for an answer the martian strode to a
television panel which was connected by a cable to the
receptive eye or retina of a telescope that was situated
in a glass-roofed chamber far overhead the telescope
could be moved on its mountings and focussed by re-
mote control from the brain center of the craft pakoh
turned dials questingly and after a few seconds a thin
yellow crescent emerged from the blurred glow that had
clouded the view panel by the simple pressing of a
small switch the martian set in operation the apparatus
which radioed the pictures out into space so that they

could be picked up at all points within the orbit of jup-
iter

  the two watched the darkened portion of mercury for
a considerable time before they detected anything unusu-
al then suddenly midway between the limbs of the
crescent a tiny point of white light appeared very slow-
ly it grew seemed to spurt and plume upward for per-
haps fifteen minutes it continued to expand then grad-
ually the light dimmed became a cloudy red and faded
out entirely

  torrence and the martian exchanged puzzled glances
what can it be gnome the former asked volcanic
action of some kind his voice was hushed and husky
with suppressed excitement

  no replied the martian mercury is nearly dead
world internal fires turned cold ages ago

  then a space ship is wrecked there clive cried eag-
erly its crew is trying to signal for help they are
burning their rocket fuel

  the diminutive captain shook his round head not
possible spectrum analysis does not bear out shows
presence of vaporized iron and helium gas not carbon
hydrogen and oxygen as in rocket fuels

  then what explanation is there

  a slow elfin smile crossed pakohs wrinkled brown face
the gods the imps the payanti of space are at work
there maybe he lisped cryptically short time ago
round thing come-maybe that is one of them

  rot the earthman spat

  clive torrence had a wholesome respect for pakohs
scientific knowledge which was certainly infinitely greater
than his own yet apparently there were odd superstitious
quirks in the tiny mans unfathomable mind- apparent-
ly here is a very necessary adverb for it was hard to
tell whether any martian and especially pakoh really
thought or lielieved a thing or merely pretended to be-
lieve it

  quite absently pakoh had taken from a pouch at his
waist a simple toy which he always carried it consisted
of a small flattened spool made of a very heavy metal
about the spindle of the spool was wrapped several yards
of fine flexible wire one end of which was firmly fixed to
the spindle in appearance and function the device was
similar to the jo-jo toys with which earth children of
the first half of the twentieth century had played

  following habit and scarcely aware that he did it for
his mind was focussed on the problem of the lights on
mercury pakoh grasped the free end of the wire at-
tached to his toy and with a careless but precise jerk of
his wrist sent the heavy spool spinning out to one side
like a darting serpents tongue it flashed to the end of its
tether and by ils rapid rotation rewound the wire and
leaped back to his hand only to be hurled out again in
another direction

pakoh was prompted to play with his toy at such
moments of his life which were comparable with
those of a pondering business man or official of earth
when he drums absently on his desk with his fingers
the little martians skill with the jo-jo was as superb as
it was apparently pointless

  clive torrence scarcely noticed his friends eccentric
way of registering puzzlement and deep thought now
so used was he to it however in the past he had often
wondered about the toy had pakoh permitted it he
would have liked to examine closely the heavy spool on
which strange characters were engraved around the
edges were sharp grooved spikes vhich suggested that it
had a purpose more sinister than that of a mere play-
thing
the menace from mercury



  nothing to do but wait and sec pakoh said after a
long pause i have ordered men to keep a close look-
out for round things we will watch mercury mean-
while you will have some games of held with me

  the earthman nodded grinning tolerantly pakoh
touched a lever and in response a small table folded out
of an unencumbered portion of the wall from a closet
the maritan produced two stools a square board the
upper surface of which was painted with various colored
and various shaped trapezoids and a box full of queer
irregularly formed pieces of bone and polished hard-
wood

  three hours passed during which the incongruous pair
played five games of the involved and tedious held of
old mars quite naturally torrence lost them all his
skill was decidedly inferior but that was not the only
reason

  his eyes kept roving lo the television view panel where
the sword of yellow light that was mercury constantly
increased in size within the hollow of the crescent those
unknown and unexplainable blots of fire waxed and
waned

  clive was conscious of a peculiar creepy chilly feeling
along his spine it wasnt fear and in a way it was pleas-
ant but clive had his misgivings those lights-what did
they mean the adventure into which chance had
thrown him was takinghold at last personally he want-
ed to see it through but how about the passengers

  he broke in on a complicated train of thought which
presently would produce a move that would win another
game of theld for pakoh listen to me gnome he
said earnestly do you think we have a right to take this
ship toward mercury with all those young people on
board for all we know there might be-well something
really dangerous ahead of us

  pakoh looked up and then chuckled shortly offi-
cials of earth government order me and i must obey
he piped besides what is there to fear the thelon
is very fast and we are armed-heavy calibre ray gun
forward and aft to protect against such men and such
things as are not good the children they love our lit-
tle experience

  i suppose youre right torrence said staring at the
theld pieces inwardly he told himself that the present
situation might develop dangers with which great speed
and powerful armament could not cope

  it is time to give view screen and controls all our at-
tention pakoh stated while he fumbled to put the theld
paraphernalia away first we will have cheka bring
us food

  and so the thelon hurtled on toward its goal grad-
ually the sun fiery white among the stars like a gigantic
electric arc and ringed by the feathery frost-work of its
corona grew in size its radiations became more and
more intense

  with the same half eager half fearful expectancy which
had characterized them before the passengers watched
the void and on distant worlds other eyes were staring
at the view plates of radio-vision sets that picked up and
assembled etheric impulses which were coming from the
thelon news of the mysterious lights and the alien
sphere had traveled quickly many space ships were
moving sunward

  from the decks of the thelon mercury was now visible
as a large crescent which was growing rapidly

  another half-hour slipped by the liner was cruising
barely five miles above a lightless landscape-that
hemisphere of the innermost of the suns children that i
forever hidden from the sun the ships rocket streams
had died down to a mere wispy purple glow all her il-

luminators with the exception of those that were abso-
lutely needed had been extinguished cautiously and
almost as inconspicuously as a ghost of darkness the
thelon edged forward

  ahead a white glow presently appeared over the ser-
rated horizon it brightened as the vessel advanced and
a broad crater-like valley came into view there was
activity here and light myriad specks of white flame
shone up against the rough volcanic ground

chapter ii

trapped by their own creation

 i orrence was speaking into a telephone we arc
reasonably safe from detection here benz he was
saying keep planetary stations informed of the pro-
gress of things report important messages and develop-
ments here to the control room  k

  quickly he made a new connection on the switchboard
and spoke again stand by your ray guns ready for ac-
tion but do not make any unnecessary moves

  slamming down the instrument he turned to the panel
on which was visible the shifting picture of the flame-lit
valley pakoh was at his side again he was toying ab-
sently with that jo-jo of his torrence manipulated a
dial and the details of the weird scene were enlarged
seemed to hurtle toward them it was as though they were
standing at the very brink of the valley

  the thing which first claimed their attention was a
gigantic cone of glossy black which reared fully half
a mile above the floor of the crater-like depression inky
highlights were reflected from its smooth sides near its
base then for a considerable distance upward its strange
form was only dimly outlined in the darkness from its
truncated summit which evidently had a large chimney-
like opening a faint cloud of emberous red vapor poured
around the base of the cone and a little distance from it
perhaps a score of large spheres were dimly visible they
iooked like some kind of space vehicles

  about these strange shapes moved leisurely-machine
shapes-fantastic shapes they differed from one another
considerably yet all had spidery many-jointed limbs and
each carried at some point on its anatomy a round globe
that gave a soft silvery radiance

  were these really sentient mechanisms with minds and
wills of their own or were they merely intricate tools
by which some unknown intelligence perhaps hidden in
the globular space cars accomplished their desires there
was no way of telling

  imps gods payanu of space pakoh twittered softly
have i not said it his eyes were almost lambent with
the excitement of discovery

  but where did they come from torrence demanded
except for a few human explorers nothing that lives or
moves has been on mercury for ages certainly

  where both easy and hard to guess pakoh told
him the void is wide and deep-so deep that you could
take a rod n million a billion a trillion light years long
and thrust it wherever you please still you would not
touch bottom from anywhere in all infinity they may
have come who knows

  and their motives clive persisted

  pakoh shrugged his slight shoulders to explore to
study to conquer cannot tell maybe anything

  as they continued to watch something shadowy moved
up the side of the great cone arriving at the truncated
summit where the luminous pall of vapor hung it be-
came clearly visible-a sort of elevator dump car loaded
with loose sand automatically and with great care as


wonder stories quarterly

hough the process were very dangerous il emptied its
contents into the opening which led down into the fiery
vitals of the cone then it retreated down its steep track

  immediately the cone went into action the tenuous
flame at its top plumed upward and brightened becom-
ing white-hot gradually it extended itself farther and
farther toward the starlit sky it was literally a colossal
jet of incandescent gas that made outlandish black shad-
ows dance over the torn and desolate landscape

  however pakoh and torrence knew that there was
little danger that it would reveal the presence of the
thelon to the automatons which worked in the valley
when one is close to an intense light everything about
appears abnormally dark

  here is the explanation of the lights we saw from
space clive torrence rasped hoarsely the cone looks
like a form of furnace but how about the fire the air
here isnt dense enough to support active combustion and
besides its mostly carbon dioxide

  maybe it is not fire as we know it said pakoh may-
be it is radioactive fire-atomic energy

  perhaps if torrence had been of a more scientific mind
or of a more timorous nature he would have wondered
what would happen if the fire escaped from the guard-
ing walls of the furnace and was free to spread in the
dust and rocks of mercurys surface

  the flame from the colossal retort had reached its max-
imum the dazzling glare illuminated something which
previously had been lost in the gloom at the other side
of the valley

  look cried pakoh

  he was pointing to a stupendous column of black cry-
stal hat reared far higher even than the immense furnace
it rested on a vast circular base that appeared to be made
of the same black shiny substance from which the cone
had been constructed around the circumference of this
base were arranged a number of cylinders made of a green
mineral they pointed up toward the summit of the col-
umn

  automatons had been working on the gargantuan
machine but now evidently having finished building it
and setting it in order they were makng a hasty retreat
from its vicinity they acted like men who have set the
time fuse in a heavy charge of explosive

  somethings going to happen torrence breathed yet
he and his companion were too fascinated to think of
danger

 i heir expectations were correct a wispy purple
luminescence enveloped the green rods about the
crystal column for several seconds it brightened slow-
ly then with a sudden rush intense purple rays shot from
the rods and impinged upon the column changing it to a
cylinder of dazzling scintillating opalescence the rays
rebounded from the column and slanted up radially in all
directions toward the heavens they formed a vast can-
opy of thin lavender fire that enveloped the whole sky
even to the farthest horizon-and beyond

  the display was like the aurora borealis of earth yet
infinitely more glorious and majestic-more expressive of
cold calm unguessablc power what weird demonstration
of scientific black magic was this

  clive torrence knew that his cheeks had paled awe
was one of the causes but there was another ilis body
was chilly and he had an intuitive feeling of tension it
was as though he had been locked in an airtight room
from which the oxygen would presently be exhausted

  even the hardened though not unkind soul of the old

pakoh was moved tela wrrrp he lisped in his native
martian

  on the wall a loud speaker blared radio room benz
speaking the voice said all communication with the
outer universe has been snapped

  its time to get out of here gnome torrence rasped

  pakoh was already leaping toward the controls the
rocket motors came to life and the great liner nosed up-
ward toward the canopy of luminescence that streamed
from the crystal pillar in the valley and dimmed the
stars it looked as tenuous and informidable as a will o
the wisp and yet-

  torrence acting for pakoh was busily answering phone
calls from all parts of the vessel

  with rocket nozzles flaming the thelon climbed rapid-
ly her momentum was already enormous the veil of
lavender light which was perhaps fifteen miles above
ground shot nearer and nearer yet certainly it could of-
fer no resistance to the hurtling tons of the space ship

  and then the jolt came it was not a sharp jolt such
as striking a solid object might produce rather it was a
long swaying elastic jolt as though the thelon had ram-
med a vast net of live rubber pakoh and torrence were
thrown violently off their feet terrified screams and
the crash of furniture being overturned came from the
rooms below

  the prow of the craft dug deep into the flame-veil but
did not penetrate it when the proper point of tension
had been reached the thelon was hurled downward
against the pressure of her rocket streams like a stone dis-
charged from a monster slingshot

  a force shield pakoh gasped as he picked himself
up it is designed maybe to keep eavesdroppers away
and by accident we are caught in it but we try again

  he guided the thelon close to the ground in order to
get a running start then for the second time they shot
toward the glowing mantel of energy which in some way
must have modified the character of the ether making
it almost like a solid substance they struck the force
shield even harder than before but the result was ident-
ical

  when the equilibrium of the ship had been reestablished
after the crash excited words came over the telephone
speaker chadburn in the rear observation room the
creatures in the valley below have had an accident look
into a view plate i think we ourselves are in great
danger

  the plate showed the deep depression in the planets
surface where the camp of the unknown visitants had
been but the scene was radically changed in aspect some-
how the radioactive fire which had been imprisoned in the
great conical retort had broken loose and was spreading
rapidly eating at the sand and rocks of mercury the
entire door of the valley was already a seething blazing
holocaust of disintegrating lava the atomic energy of
which was being released billowing clouds of incan-
descent gas poured skyward

  in the midst of it all apparently inviolate and still
functioning perfectly was the mechanism that produced
the force shield its great round base made like the
furnace nf a substance obviously immune to the action
of the ire floated  the molten rock a number of the
spheres of the visitants were trying to reach the giant
machine but always the terrific heat repelled them

  the voice of chadburn continued to come from the
speaker describing the accident when we were going
up for the second time i kept looking back at the valley
watching those robots the duni car with a load of
dirt was climbing the cone when it reached the top and
the menace from mercury



began to empty itself a cable or something must have
parted because the car load and all fell into the mouth
of the furnace it wasnt much more than two seconds
later that the cone evidently having taken the charge too
suddenly blew up scattering that white-hot stuff it con-
tained far and wide then hell broke loose
you understand what developments mean clive tor-
rence iakoli questioned quietly his calm was as
complete as if he were merely discussing some move in
a game of theld

clive was still looking into a where the holocaust
of atomic disintegration was climbing the steep walls
of the valley edging toward the open plains spreading
advancing it moved slowly yet with ever increasing
momentum the billowing streams of superheated vapor
lashed up more and more fiercely

  it appears as though old mercury is doomed to die a
violent death torrence stated in answer

  maybe also us said pakoh with an impish grin
we are trapped between force shield and fire fire will
grow meanwhile we cannot escape soon ship itself will
start to burn

  but surely the shield does not cover and surround
the entire planet torrence cried we can go to the
edge of the shield and guide the ship out from under it
maybe it does not cover entire planet pakoh shot
back maybe instead we are under a vast dome of en-
ergy that covers only local area but i think there is no
opening in it if there were radio messages from outside
would reach us they do not reach us

   then thats that torrence said in a softer tone how-
ever there is still hope the machine that produces the
shield can be expected to break down sometime under the
action of the fire meanwhile we might try to put it out
of commission with the ray guns also we can make other
attempts to drive the ship through the shield we may
find a weak spot

  your first plan of using the ray guns we will try
said pakoh  have thought of it too but it is a very
big job he was stepping to a phone to communicate
with the gunners

  good torrence said meanwhile i think we may ex-
pect trouble from the passengers as your self-appointed
chief aide ill undertake the job of keeping them quiet
im going below now to talk to them personally if you
need me page me over the speakers shall i send some-
one up to assist you here

  pakoh shook his head he hated assistants-all but
torrence now he sat before his bewildering control
panel guiding the thelon back toward the flaming valley
into a phone he hissed sharp commands

  descending to the promenade deck torrence encoun-
tered a crowd of young passengers they seemed little
changed since the time several hours ago when he had
last seen them the series of strange events had had its
effects upon them of course they were very quiet now
and the faces of many were pale as death yet there was
no hysteria no violent demonstrations of blind animal
terror there was iron in the makeup of these youths
of earth

  clive sauntered causually into their midst eyes turned
in his direction someone recognized him and shouted
out mr torrence through rumor the name had be-
come associated with that of the tliclons martian captain
and in a moment clive was the center of attention he
smiled back at their questioning troubled faces while he
was thinking out a way to address them subterfuge he
decided was out of place

  you have of course been wondering what is the mean-

ing of the weird events which have taken place in the last
few hours he said at length and i will tell you the
thelon was ordered to investigate flashes of light which
were visible on this planet arriving here we found in
the valley the strange race of beings and their machines
our ship was trapped by the force shield which you can
see overhead then a peculiar kind of radioactive fire was
accidentally started in the valley

  it would be useless to deny that we arc all in great
danger and it may be our fate to die before this ad-
venture is over however the crew and the captain are
doing everything in their power to avert disaster and
they ask only that you continue to cooperate with them
fully to keep order

  now wc are going to make an attempt to smash the
machine that maintains the force shield which is keeping
us imprisoned if the ray guns can accomplish this
and there is a chance maybe a slight one we will be free
lets go over to the windows where we can watch

  in a body those who had not already taken up position
along the observation bays obeyed his suggestion

  at some little distance from where torrence stood be-
side a window a thin-faced boy who could not have been
over seventeen hid his face with his hands and began to
sob and to mutter incoherent blasphemies another
youth grasped him by the shoulder and shook him vio-
lently shut up eddie he spat someone making an
attempt at lightness began to chant a humorous song that
was quickly quelled

  the thelon racing along at as great a speed as she
dared was almost over the valley of the visitants now
or rather where the valley had been in its place was a
lake shimmering dazzling boiling lava fully six times
the area of the now vanished valley great plumes and
fountains of fire lashed at the retreating disintegrating
shores and out of the flames and rosy murk towered
the opalescent pillar of crystal it floated securely on its
great circular base and to all appearances was still un-
harmed

  a number of the spherical space cars of the visitants
were swirling about over it now and then one of them
would make a frantic useless attempt to reach the base
of the huge machine but always the heat and the intense
radioactive radiations made it retreat falteringly

  what are those globes trying to do mr torrence
a curly-headed lad who stood beside clive asked

torrence sacrifice

r  he thelon had nosed steeply down and was diving
toward the crystalline giant that stood as a symbol
of fate for five hundred humans and the occupants of
perhaps a score of strange alien spheres hands gripped
stanchions fiercely-a natural reaction to the free-falling
feeling produced by the rapid loss of altitude a rosy
murk poured over the huge hull of the liner veiling the
dazzling inferno for an instant

  down down the ship was now on a level with the
pinnacle of the opal-wrapped pillar of crystal the
thelon itself was colossal yet when compared to this
mighty creation of the unknown visitants it was like a
needle beside a tall wax candle

soundlessly the liners two ray guns one at the bow and

one at the stern went into action their faint yellowish
beams stabbed through the whirling eddying vapor and
impinged on the glowing pillar from which the force
shield fanned upward and outward would there be any
effect none was noticeable only a few substances
known to man could continue to exist when exposed to
those disintegrating rays but the material from which
the pillar was made was not among them the pillar was
necessarily built to stand up under beams of energy far
more powerful than anything known on the planets of
the solar system

  but torrence was still hopeful not because it was sen-
sible but because he had to be if they could get close
enough to that lake of fire they might be able to disinte-
grate the round black base of the machine one of his
hands was clamped like a vise on the railing at the bot-
tom of the window the other was thrown up to shield
his eyes from the awful glare a fleeting vision of what
the thclons interior might be like in a few hours crossed
his mind and it made him want to shriek like a madman
yet controlling himself he remained outwardly calm

  torrence was conscipus of a pricking-electrical sensa-
tion over his body the radiations from the radioactive
disintegration were penetrating the thick walls of the ship
in a short time those radiations would like the rays given
off by radium produce unhealable sores or death some-
thing would have to be done about them soon

  two minutes told the truth about their chances of de-
stroying the machine that maintained the force shield
for that length of time the thelon spiralled about the pil-
lar at five hundred feet-the lowest altitude that she dared
fly to keep out of reach of the flames her disintegrator
beams were constantly focussed on the base of the crystal
tower-without result

  the spherical vessels of the visitants paid no attention
to the liner instead they concentrated on their own efforts
to put the machine out of action constantly they tried
to approach a hemispherical structure that stood on the
base of the pillar here doubtless were located the
switches which sent power to the huge mechanism but
they too were unsuccessful one of them plunged into the
boiling lake bobbed like a cork on its surfacc for an in-
stant and vanished in a spurt of flame

  the thelon was climbing toward the stars that peeped
fcalmly through the force shield

  wc have failed havent we said the boy at tor-
rences side

  this time clive replied and added reassuringly but
we arent licked yet we might be able to puncture the
shield or something unexpected might turn up

  the youth nodded slowly and a hard knowing smile
that one would have thought totally out of place with him
came to his lips i understand perfectly mr torrence
he said

   

  clive was back in the control room with pakoh we
had better order everybody into space armor he advised
it may help to protect them from the radioactive radia-
tions which are certainly entering the ship

  and so the maddening terror-filled hours dragged by
minute by minute the atomic lire increased in intensity
spreading ever spreading mountains and the walls of
world-old craters that for endless eons had been dead and
lifeless and cold almost to the point of absolute zero top-
pled before its slow but mighty advance melting dis-
solving disintegrating the gical dumc of the forcc
shield which covered a circular area on the surface of
mercury fully five hundred miles in diameter was grad-
ually being filled with superheated helium vapor the tem-

perature of which steadily rose creat geysers of lava
spouted from the molten sea

  like some jungle beast newly caged the thelon her
long flanks already glowing red-hot rushed about her pri-
son furiously attacking the tenuous seemingly fragile veil
of light that held her in but her efforts to escape were
vain she was not alone in her attempts to win freedom
the spherical space cars of the visitants were fighting the
shield too and with no better success

teyond the shield fifteen or twenty space ships had
 gathered to offer assistance but apparently no assis-
tance was possible there was nothing to do but wait
and watch for the end several times disintegrator beams
were brought into play against the veil of force but with-
out results

  the news of the trapped liner had spread quickly
throughout the solar system and the peoples of all the
inhabited planets watched anxiously for the outcome

  within the thelona hull the diminutive shrivelled pakoh
still ruled his mechanisms with an iron hand his mar-
tian stoicism was as yet unruffled he performed the neces-
sary act with quick though unhurried efficiency-answer-
ing excited telephone calls from all parts of the ship giv-
ing orders tending the controls and checking instruments
that showed unnatural figures the temperature of the
air in the vessel was rising even though the heat absorp-
tion apparatus was doing full duty the question now was
when-at what instant-within the next minute or the next
hour the atomic fire would take hold of the thelon or
would the crystalline machine that produced the imprison-
ing shield break down in time as yet there was no hint
of this hoped for event

  the tension was dreadful il was almost inevitable that
soon worn and frayed human nerves would snap

  with pakoh worked torrence outwardly he was calm
but he was less stoical less fatalistic than the little mar-
tian both were like everyone else on the thelon clad
in space suits and they spoke with one another by means
of radios with which their oxygen helmets were equipped

  torrence made many visits to th parts of the vessel
which were frequented by the passengers he went among
them trying desperately to keep up their morale but with
the cards stacked against him il was a losing fight they
were game those students of earth yet human nature has
its limitations

  first of all a young fanatic stabbed himself lo death
in full view of his fellows not more than ten minutes
later an officer was attacked and killed by a raving wild-
eyed group of youngsters who declared they would destroy
the ship before they would suffer the tension any longer
a member of the crew went raving mad and leaped from
an air-lock and so force with the shadow of death at
the point of a ray gun back of it had to be used to main-
tain order and even that was of questionable effectiveness

  a wave of horror came suddenly over torrence and
it brought with it fierce but impotent determination im-
potent time would tell

  the thelon was now hanging motionless at the edge
of the force shield

  panting and perspiring clive hurried up to the control
room when he entered pakoh was seated before his
instrument panel and was leisurely and absently toying
with his jo-jo he glanced at torrence saw that the
earthmans fists were clenched and noted that he was
breathing hard

  better not to become excited now clive torrence

the forcc shield did not effect radio communlcilion here nt all
though it was absolutely impenetrable to messages coming
from outer space
the menace from mercury



lie remarked better to rest soon it is over outer
shell of ship is now only lifleen degrees from point of
fusion temperature still mounting let us have a last
game of theld a drink of i oka and some of your excellent
cigarettes then we will be ready for peace

   but pakohs icy self-possession grated on clives jangled
nerve and he no longer tried to control himself to hell
with your eternal theld you siniikiii imp he bluitcd
somethings got to be done about those kids and im
going to do it remember that hemispherical structure
at the base of the force pillar the visitants were trying
to reach it the power switches must be located there
im going to get into the auxiliary boat and ram that
hemisphere

a sudden surprised look came into pakohs shrivelled
face which was visible through the glazed front of his
helmet clive torrence he piped that is a plan
but we must draw lots for the honor of carrying out
lottery the devil-its my idea

  torrence was leaping across the room to the door which
gave access to the interior of the auxiliary flier but pakoh
clutched his arm you must he said

  the earthman glanced down at him there was a steely
glint in the martians big eyes alright gnome clive
replied weve got to hurry though

  pakoh took a martian coin from a small drawer art-
fully concealed in the wall and handed it to clive i
will have heads  he told him

  torrence shook the coin between his palm and slapped
it down on the back of his gauntlcted hand heads came
up

  i am lucky pakoh grinned

  no youre not clive shot back at him its still my
job  just gave in to your request for a lottery because
if fortune favored me there wouldnt be any more argu-
ments now ill have to face the arguments anyway
youre needed on ihe ship

tte was lifting up on the heavy bar that latched the
--door which opened into the auxiliary space boat
and then the little martian leaped upon him tried to
tear his hands away from the heavy bar pakohs fea-
tures worked and grimaced with furious anger you
are a cheat clive torrence he screeched a cheat
torrence saw that force applied as gently as possible
was the only argument that the gnome would accept
and to apply it gently was not an easy thing to do
pakoh was small but he was put together like a bobcat-
mostly steel wire-and now he was acting like a bobcat-
clawing kicking in wild frenzy you must not go
clive torrence i have won it is my right to go
you are young i am old my life is lived

   after a brief though furious scuffle torrence succeeded
in locking one arm firmly about the shoulders of the tiny
martian so that he could do nothing but squirm inef-
fectually with his free hand clive unlatched the door
opened it and stepped through giving pakoh a lusty shove
back into the control room as he slammed the metal panel
a brief laugh of triumph broke from his lips

  torrence was in a narrow closet at the other side of
which was another air-tight door that led directly into the
hull of the auxiliary flier this small vessel was firmly
clamped by magnetism into a groove in the side of its
mother ship

   in a moment clive stood before the controls of the space
boat he cut the switches that fed current to the mag-
netic anchors and allowed the little craft to slip free and
go diving down toward the indescribable inferno below-
no not below alone for it was all about now great
clouds of vapor their centers yellow-white with heat their

edges rose fringed with torn streamers swirled and bil-
lowed everywhere the glare shields were in placc on the

observation windows and yet clives eyes ached and

burned he clamped a piece of dark flexible glass over
the glazed front of his oxygen helmet and the pain was
somewhat relieved

  huge scintillating chunks and globes of lava hurled
forcibly from the tumultuous blazing sea shot lar up
through the murk and burst with glorious showers of
sparks like the hares of signal rockets there was danger
in those hying lumps of disintegrating material if one
struck the space boat and the chance was by no means
small it would quickly terminate this bold adventure

  the rockets of the craft had come to life now and it
was climbing zigzagging dodging toward the sky through
a thin spot in the rosy wispy murk and through the frosty
pallor of the force shield clive could now and then see a
star or even several stars gleaming coldly peacefully
venus came into view a great glorious speck of cool
white light and close beyond it the smaller and less bril-
liant fleck of green-earth-clives home he surveyed
it without emotion scarcely noticed it at all for his mind
was on other things

  his hard jaw was clamped solid fiercely he threw the
control stick far over to one side making his craft slip
down for several hundred feet to avoid a swarm of drip-
ping sparks that had originated from an exploding lump
of lava had those sparks touched the hull of the cralt
it too would doubtless burst into atomic flames

  could he win his way to the machine through this hell
would he succeed in ramming the hemispherical structure
at its base where the switches and controls were doubtless
located if he did ram it would his act have the desired
effect-destroy the force shield and granting that all
this happened as he hoped it would would it be in time
to save the five hundred souls aboard the thelon from a
fiery death

  briefly clive wondered about these things then he put
them forcibly from his mind he had made his plans
the only coursc to follow was to carry them out as quickly
and efficiently as he could speed and coolness were the
things that counted now

   the crystal column was not difficult to find even though
it had most certainly shifted its position considerably on
the surface of the flaming sea it was only necessary to
approach the great funnel-like formation of silvery light
that hung down through the mists and smoke from the
under surface of the force shield it resembled an im-
mense stationary tornado of shimmering energy at its
bottom would be the machine of the visitants

   with rockets roaring full on the little craft its hull
glowing red in the awful heat approached its goal mount-
ing higher and higher attaining a point of vantage from
which to strike it was like the winged steed of some
fallen angel who riding through the flame-blasted air of
hades seeks to redeem his fall by some act of heroism

  but clive torrence did not look upon himself as a hero
he was sacrificing nothing he had merely decided be-
tween two alternatives to wait supinely for death or to
try in his dying to aid his fellow passengers aboard the
tltelon and he had chosen the course of action

he had guided his ship to a point almost over the crys-
tal column now there it was floating on its fire-
lashed base with the opalescent streams of energy leap-
ing from it feeding the force shield occasionally sin-
uous veils of luminescent vapor would pour from it hiding
it momentarily from view

  torrence had reached the greatest altitude that he


wonder stories quarterly

could attain-fifteen miles close overhead was the force
shield the craft hung motionless

  clives eyes took in the scene below-the vast ocean of
fire extending now from horizon to horizon-the chaotic
waves of liquid lava that ruffled its surface-the spouting
plumes of metallic vapor for the first time torrence was
conscious of the awful majesty of the sight an unac-
countable feeling of peace came over him

  down there beside the towering crystal was his target
the circular structure where the switches were supposed to
be housed it was really a fairly large building but from
the great height it looked as small as a dime torrence
knew however that it would be comparatively easy to hit
maybe his hands would be lifeless and shrivelled by the
radioactive radiations before the crash came but by then
he would have the flier perfectly aimed and the controls
locked  

  no time to lose he glanced at the meters on the con-
trol board-everything ok he breathed deeply once
and then eased the control stick forward one hand was
pressing the throttle the space boat started down on its
long dive the free-fall feeling in exaggerated form
again but clive was used to it it was funny he reflected
that only forty-eight hours before he had been just a care-
free jackass on a vacation and now he was going to die
oh well cat drink and be merry he hoped his fade-
out would do somebody some good however his for-
mer desperation was gone

   like all space vehicles the little craft had a telescope
sighting apparatus set along her tapered nose this was
very valuable in directing her course when dying out in
the void tentatively preparing for the moment when it
would be time to use the instrument clive peered into the
cyepiece the flier was picking up speed at an enormous
rate shooting straight at the bubbling seething holocaust

   clive could not see the darting fleck of flame that fol-
lowed close behind the billowing streams of his own rocket
motors nor could he see the tiny flattened vehicle from
which the flame originated crouching low on the upper
surface of the miniature craft was a small human figure
in space armor and the velocity of the tiny vehicle was
just a shade greater than that of torrences flier

  clive torrence clive torrence the name given
in piping familiar tones came through the earphone in
the earthmans oxygen helmet

  pakoh clive started in surprise but the little mar-
tian expecting that he would do this and realizing that
it might have disastrous consequences was prepared

  steady aim carefully he piped do not talk

i tell you what to do i am here to left of you in two-
man scout boat-just maybe twenty feet distant from
door-nearest i can come now keep all attention on con-
trols and sights until i speak again

  there was a long pause the larger space boat tore on
ever faster and faster making the tortured gases of mer-
curys newly created atmosphere screech and whine like a
tortured devil the altitude was cut down to nine miles
now only a few seconds more torrence was peering
into the eyepiece centering the cross hairs on the circular
structure he had planned to ram his muscles were taut
his nerves tense but steady he moved the control stick
an infinitesimal bit to the right there it looked like a
perfect aim but he couldnt be sure yet for the target was
still too distant

  you have sights lined up on hemispherical building
pakoh asked

  right

  cood then lock controls release main latch on
door leaving only little latch which can be unfastened
quickly

   wonderingly yet realizing the necessity for instant obe-
dience torrence fulfilled his small friends orders it
took three lusty jerks on a heavy bar to undo the metal
clamps that held the thick airtight door in place its
done gnome torrence yelled

  pakohs voice calm and twittering came again re-
turn to controls make adjustments if needed then lock
them and push the throttle to the last notch open door
of flier and catch what  throw to you then swing out
into space

  back at the cyepiece agonizing moments of suspense
a hairs breadth adjustment which only a hand as steady
and cool as a rock could make the ocean of fire scarcely
three miles below then a leap to the door of the flier
an instant of fumbling with the small latch

  the portal flew open and a tornado of fiery wind blew
into the ship the speed of which was rapidly approaching
that of a bullet dazzled by the awful glare torrence
standing on the threshold was still able tosee pakoh who
lay on his stomach  the deck of his tiny scout boat

  catch the martian called one of his arms was
dangling over the side of the craft his wrist jerked
once and something that spun and reeled out a thin wire
behind it shot toward torrence he caught the heavy
spool of the jo-jo in his insulated space gloves

  jump and torrcnce jumped into two miles of fire-
fillcd void with hell at the bottom-trusting himself to a
thin though tough strand of flexible wire

dlit this phase of the game was not nearly as dangerous
as one might expect the fact that they were losing
altitude so much faster than the weak gravity of mercury
could pull them rendered torrences body weightless rela-
tive to the objects in his immediate vicinity tugging
lightly  the wire pakoh drew torrence to safety on the
deck of the scout boat safety it was questionable at
best held rigidly to its course by its locked controls and
with throttle wide open the deserted flier raced on ahead
toward its goal

  could they check the scout boats headlong descent be-
fore the sea of incandescence swallowed them up the
forward braking-rockets were flaming-cutting down the
awful speed but it was a gamble the occan of lava
and the crystal pillar seemed literally to hurtle toward
them

  only a mile and a half of altitude was left now pakoh
was trying to make the scout boat loop around-to bring
it into a climb but its momentum was still too enor-
mous with its flat bottom toward the ground it con-
tinued to mush down through the flaming atmosphere

  a cloud of swirling fiery gas enveloped the tiny flier
obscuring the vision of the two men who clung madly to
the hand-grips  her deck the outer shells of their
space armor were red-hot but the numerous vacuum spaces
and the layers of insulating material between the silvered
external plating and their skins kept most of the terrific
heat away from their bodies still they were sweating
furiously

  why wasnt the boat and its passengers attacked by the
atomic fire torrence had guessed tile truth hours ago
in order for the process oj radioactive disintegration to be
initiated in a substance actual contact between that sub-
stance and some already infected liquid or solid material
was nvccssury gases  matter how high their tempera-
ture could not start the atomic fire lurk favored pakoh
and torrence for no sparks or droplets of fiery rain
touched them they could feel the tingling electric thrill
of the radioactive radiations ev-n through their heavy ar-
mor

  the nose of the scout boat came gradually up pointed
the menace from mercury



toward the sky its stern rocket nozzles belching their
lavender streams halted its fall and then slowly the long
fearful ascent began akoh had lo give all his attention
to the controls

  torrence looked back eagerly searching for the larger
craft which he had deserted there il was almost at its
goal and traveling at titanic velocity its long lavender
rocket blasts were almost lost in the glare of the inferno

  the crash came it was unimpressive in that seething
spitting chaos of mercurys destruction nor was its effect
immediate for the space of several heartbeats nothing
happened then the rays of energy coming from the crys-
tal column dimmed burned brighter dimmed again flick-
ered and went out

  the force shield high overhead warped and bellied un-
der the pressure of the expanding gases beneath it then
like a sheet of cloth hoisted into the air by a strong wind
it shot upward crumpled together its feathery frosty
wisps faded and dissolved into nothing

  clive torrence clung for dear life lo the slanting blast-
swept deck his eyes burned in his glistening sweat-
streaked face as they mounted upward in their wild dodg-
ing flight through the blazing spark-laden atmosphere
his lips curled back from his teeth weve won gnome
he shrieked to pakoh up ahead won

  not yet quite clive torrence the martian said softly
into his transmitter last set-up is still to be played
we must save our own necks-gel to the thelon is the
thelon still in existence we do not know i left her in
the care of drayden

  they had reached the clear cold freedom of space no
need to look back at the devils kingdom fifty miles be-
neath them they gazed about two space ships were
in sight cruising leisurely searchingly in wide circles
one was a small heavily-armed police craft the oilier was
a gigantic liner of the void her name plates had been
burned away and her hull still glowed with a dull baneful
luminescence it was the thelon alright battered and
singed but still in working order

  pakoh threw a small grenade that burst into a flare of
red light ten minutes iatcr they climbed through an air-
lock of the liner  

  it was some hours afterward that several men were
gathered in the luxurious officers lounge of the thelon
a broad observation bay over which the glare shields were
drawn looked out over the tapered and finned stern of
the vessel through the darkened glass the huge sun was
visible and close beside it a small fleck of light that
glowed with almost equal intensity it was mercury
doubtless doomed to burn until all her substances had
changed to pure energy

  far to the rear were six spherical black dots moving
off  a course which was perhaps forty-five degrees to
the right of the thelons

  clive torrence was pointing at them there they
go-the last of the visitants no doubt theyve seen
plenty of the solar system and the mess they got them-
selves into here he said

  benz the tall light-haired man who held the position
of chief radio operator spoke ive had enough of the
mess loo and im glad weve been ordered back to the
earth docks for a checkover and repairs well probably
all get a chance to take a good rest

  rest drayden questioned scornfully im afraid
well have to go to the polar regions or better yet to the
moon if we really want any if we venture around in
civilized places our rest will consist mostly of speeches
and short hours in bed

  and pretty ladies pakoh put in impishly showing a
genuine understanding of earthly humor

  draydens just trying to imagine that hes modest
somebody chuckled well he can start practicing that
real soon because i think the passengers are planning to
pull something

  what shall you do with your vacation clive tor-
rence pakoh asked

  torrence shrugged and grinned follow the line of
least resistance if you agree to do the same gnome he
replied his face sobered for a moment then brightened
again after that he continued back to the mines on
neptunes satellite the thing i hated worst about that
place was the low temperature but i guess ill be able to
stand it now lord in the last couple of days ive
soaked up enough heat to last me for the rest of my life

 whose virile exciting style cannot help but
 win your interest

   mr martin believes in mincing no words in at-
 tempting to show how much the inhabitants of
 one world may vary from those of another jupi-
 ter the mysterious may be the source of life and
 if so that life will probably be governed by the
 conditions of the planet even as we are creatures
 of our earth environment

   picture then the great massive jupiter with its
 gravitational force more than twice that of the
 earths its terrific speed of rotation the mighty
 storms that must sweep its surface then try to
 conceive the inhabitants of such a world and
 if you go further and try to imagine the conflict
 of such mighty men with those of our little green
 earth you have the basis for this unusual story

struction we come not kill    unless it must be but
we are ready all wc sec all we know against us your
greatest weapons are useless as against the gods you wor-
ship    our great fleets of atmospheric ships wing to
your glorious planet    take care they not opposed
it is said

  abruptly the keen piping voice hushed from the
radio the dancers were shrinking away as from the men-
acing fangs of a roaring dragon color had drained from
their faces rouge stood out hideously on palid cheeks
of the women-and several men some clawed hold of
others some groveled on the waxed floor

  snap out of it lance nordens voice strained but
steady seemed to crash on the tense silence dont
start crying before youre hurt get hold of yourselves-
men

  oh my god wailed the big blonde girl with the blue
dress sliding from thick shoulders was that a bird
are we going to be all killed by birds

  im guessing its a man the young engineer stated
quietly if that voice came from the moon its two hun-
dred thousand miles away any voice would sound thin
and eerie at a distance like that come come folks get
hold of yourselves

  i can hear water sloshing a woman moaned and
look at the moon it looks like a devil

  men and women began surging toward windows and
doorways lance nordcn crossed the room with quick
strides looked out and up the air seemed alive with
droning planes and the moonlight appeared unnaturally
awesomely bright a damp wind poured through the
moaning trees like a gusty torrent

  youre right nordcn well face it like men the
speaker a firm-mouthed man with graying hair lit a cig-
arette with steady hand come on gladys were going
home he tucked the white arm of a wide-eyed wo-
man within his own stepped outside

  do you think those fiends will try to drown us mr

norden

  lance norden turned slowly a girl of regal height
faced him a girl with vividly red lips and cool unafraid
eyes of midnight black she was magnificently formed
with wavy black hair clustering in ringlets about her
lovely face the gauzy evening gown of red silk accen-
tuated the strong lines of her form revealed rather than
hid her deerlike grace and hardened brawn

  i dont think they will venture close enough to flood
us the engineer said quietly it would mean destruc-
tion for them and us unless they entirely control the
pull of gravity anyway it wouldnt gain them any-
thing they dont want to destroy what they hope to
possess

  she nodded her queenly head im lorna lansing im
not afraid her lips quivered slightly but she forced a
gallant smile looks like this old world is in for some
trouble

  lance nordcn nodded looks like it miss lansing
if you have a car handy id suggest a run to the hills
youd be safe from-

  im not a weeping willow she cut in sharply and
glanced disdainfully at a little knot of terrified dancers
huddled in a far corner ill go down fighting-il ive
got to im running down to the city to see whats hap-
pening want to come along

  by jove youre a real girl he cried with frank ad-
miration all right lets go

  come on

  she led the way from the brilliantly-illuminated house
careless of the water-cold touch of the night on bare arms
and shoulders guided to where a long powerful-look-
ing roadster was parked nordcn climbed into the ma-
cliine at the girls nod she fitted a key to the ignition
lock pressed on the starter backed out into the highway
sent the car whizzing over the pavement heading straight
for the roaring metropolis

  automobiles were shooting past them like comets lance
norden marked that the faces of the men and women in
the speeding cars were curiously blanched and drawn a
huge truck thundered past barely missing the light road-
ster only lornas alertness and quick twist of the wheel
averted disaster

  she slowed down the humming car as it struck wet as-
phalt soon they were in a maze of swirling traffic churn-
ing through water inches deep lights danced crazily on
the wavelets tho night was redolent with the salt tang
of the sea

  he sidewalks over which water rippled lightly were
crowded with milling shoving hurrying multitudes
radios blared stridently newsboys screeched shrilly
squadrons of police were battling the terror-ridden crowds
here and there the air was hideous with screams and
yells of the maddened populace

  the girl stopped the car as a red light flashed leaned
out and called to a dancing newsboy the lad splashed
through ankle-deep water handed her a paper received
the coin she handed him with a queer little grin the
green signal flared

  lorna tossed the paper to lance started the car whats
the latest tell me as we go on im heading for my
apartment to get some elothes and things

  tides have quit rising lance read his eyes racing
over the flaring headlines president has called out the
army    governors are calling the national guards   
dr braden glenning the great scientist declares means
for combatting the menace are being developed    says
there is no danger of the moon falling on the earth

says the agcncics responsible for swinging the moon from
its orbit dare not approach the earth sufficiently close to
cause serious floods    president calls on all for calm
declares the danger is more apparent than actual mayor
redmond urges the people of new york to keep to their
homes    looting breaks out in scores of cities   
aside from all that everything is fine lorna smiled
and shrugged her splendid shoulders

   the car glided from a snarl of traffic swung into a
quieter side street water swirled close to the hubs of the
churning wheels sidewalks were choked with pushing
chattering yelling crowds the girl halted the roadster
in front of a brightly-illuminated apartment building peo-
ple swarmed from the broad entrance like ants from a
menaced nest

   back in five minutes lorna smiled for an instant
norden felt her fingers  his arm caught a faint elusive
breath of perfume then she had tossed a gay scarf
around her bare creamy shoulders and was slipping from
the car

   a radio in one of the lofty apartments was screeching
whistling frenziedly lance norden was too far away to
distinguish the piping sounds but he knew by the way the
crowd began scattering that the distant messenger from
space was hurling new threats

   trying to throw the fear of hell into us the young en-
gineer muttered grimly why doesnt somebody shut off
the damned thing

   he picked up the newspaper glanced over it swiftly
his shuttling eyes caught a bold-faced bit of type at the
top of the page

     the moons nearest norma approach to our
   earth is  miles dr morton l griffin of
   hallmore observatory computes its present dis-
   tance at about  miles it has not moved
   nearer in the past two hours volume of the moon
   is only one-fortieth of the earths and the mass
   of the earth is roughly eighty-one times that of
   the moon attraction of gravity on the moon is
   only one-sixth of that on the earth the pull of
   the earth becomes so tremendous as the moon ap-
   proaches our world that     

   lorna was coming out of the apartments carrying a
bag behind her shuffled a palid-faced porter bearing
two suitcases the girl had slipped on a long rose-colored
coat but lance noticed as she stepped into the car that
she still wore her red evening dress he felt a strange
thrill race through him as she brushed against him when
she took the wheel

   any particular place youd like to go before we head
for the hills she asked lightly where you staying
the graystone stanford street

   why thats only about twelve blocks northwest passed
it several times glad to take you there

   but i cant discommodc you like that miss lansing
you must have friends here-

   call me lorna she smiled sounds more pally
im free as the air-my folks are way out in oregon im
in new york studying music-but thats no never mind
by jove youre the kind of a girl ive dreamed about-
lorna he caught her offered hand gave it a quick
squeeze full of grit and fight im lance norden
radio engineer just got back this week from the brazil-
ian diamond fields killing a few days here met tom
halstrom-hes an old pal-yesterday and he invited me
to that dance at the morelands

   she nodded her dark head fine ill run down to
your hotel-then well strike out for those little hills the
people down here call mountains got to fill up the old
gas tank before we go much farther

   she eased in the clutch the car began creeping for-

ward slowly through the sloshing water the girl was
handling the machine with steady skill holding it to the
slimy pavement with apparent ease gradually they
gained higher ground until the water was little more than
a trickle a street-car crowded with pallid-faced pas-
sengers rumbled by automobiles were coming so thick
ly that it was with only the greatest skill that lorna avoid-
ed collisions high overhead sounded the drones of rock-
eting airplanes

  a red light momentarily checked the roadsters swift
flight then the girl was driving down a cross-street at
one side of the thoroughfare three cars were locked in a
tangled mass of wreckage

  lorna stopped the roadster before the imposing entrance
of a hotel lance sprang from the car pushed his way
through the surging crowds was back in a few minutes
with a suitcase again the roadster was slipping through
a maze of traffic

chapter ii

at close quarters

 i he girl turned into one of the highways radiating awaj
from the mighty city like spokes from a wheels hub
followed a long line of speeding cars the roar of th
metropolis gradually receded like the wave of a giant sea
lights of speeding cars stabbed the gloom of open spaces
flitted and danced like monstrous fireflies

  it was nearing sunrise when the girl brought the car to s
stop shut off the motor the great golden moon was dip
ping behind a forest-crested ridge stars were fading from
the gray heavens a cold wind whipped the nearer trees
and underbrush over the gray ribbon of a highway far
below hundreds of cars were crawling

  this is as good a place as any for a camp lorna
said and opened the door

  lance followed her as she stepped to the rough ground
looked down from the top of a wooded hill into a little
valley dotted with dim outlines of farm buildings even
as he looked something floated down from the gray sky
like a monstrous bat something that settled down grace-
fully to earth something huge and silent and menacing

  it was instantly veiled by the darkness clinging to the
ground a smothered terrified cry jerked lance around
several people stood by the side of apurring limousine
their eyes glued to the spot where the batlike thing had
settled down it was from one of the fur-swathed women
that had come the strangled cry of terror

  one of the men whirled around plunged into the car
the others followed like sheep charged by a snarling
wolf the limousine jerked around raced back toward
the distant city

  theyve come lornas musical voice quavered slight-
ly her slim fingers were biting into lance nordens
muscular arm in the dim light of the new dawn her face
seemed pinched and oddly white

  ixioks like it lorna his arm went around her sup-
ple waist steadied her his own pulses were pounding
wildly with a tense excitement he vainly strove to master

  gradually the sky grew lighter pink streamers com-
menced glowing along the eastern horizon wisps of rosy
clouds heralded the coming of the sun the wind was
growing stronger keener the shadowy thing down in
the little valley began gathering shape

  wed better park the car behind those rocks lance
said his voice sounded harsh and strained they can
see it from down there we dont know what they are
or what theyll do

the girl nodded climbed into the machine five min-

utes and they were peering down warily from a brush-
screened rock-shouldcr slowly the shadows shrouding
the valleys floor began lifting and the watchers stared
down on something that looked not unlike a gigantic
cigar made of metal something long and narrow with
pointed ends that glistened dully in the growing light of
the dawning

  not a flicker of motion came from the fearsome object
not the faintest whisper of sound it might have been a
coffin of a strange dead

  the faint humming of planes snapped eyes of the
watchers skyward three ships of the air flashing like
silver birds in the first beams of the new sun raced out
over the valley began circling lower and lower and
from the silent tiling on the grass stabbed out jets of
blinding light livid lightning

  a scream tore from loruas white throat as a plane
reeled crazily burst into a red whirlpool of flame an-
other was plunging earthward like a flaming torch the
third zoomed like a soaring hawk dipped glided spiraled
in a desperate race for life flickering lightning followed
as surely as hounds close on the doomed rabbit a blind-
ing flare the planeslid sideways in a swirl of fire

  lorna huddled in the thick brush long shudders rack-
ing her body her lips were a bloodless line in her
blanched face and she was veiling her eyes with quivering
hands

  steady girl steady lance whispered and slipped an
arm around her heaving shoulders dont move those
devils are stirring

  lightly as a floating feather without hum of motor or
running movement the fearsome cigar-like thing was ris-
ing from its grassy bed straight up like a soaring bird
from one end of the glistening shell lightning flashed an
automobile speeding along the gray ribbon of a highway
hurtled off the grade as though struck by an invisible ham-
mer spurted fire and smoke

  the slimy devils lance muttered hoarsely killing
for the mere lust of it the dirty fiends

  the hellish glistening craft half-circled lazily over the
little valley floated like a sluggish buzzard toward the
rise from which lance and lorna watched with wide
eyes settled down a few hundred yards away as a bird
settles on its nest

  then-strange awesome forms were coming out of the
shimmering thing blocky figures seemingly made of yel-
low metal so wide and thick were they that they seemed
little taller than dwarfs but some towered head and
shoulders above the rest and the tall ones were smooth
of skin with copper-colored hair streaming down their
massive backs the shorter creatures were hairy as apes

  the mighty creatures faced the rising sun dropped to
knees and stretched arms high above their shaggy heads
from their throats burst a wild barbaric chant such a
chant as the saber-toothed tiger and hairy mammoth might
imve known when primitive man howled adoration to the
glowing warming life-giving sun-the only god he knew

and the golden faces turned to the sunrise wore ex-
pressions of unbridled ferocity a savagery that
showed even through the matted hair almost covering the
visages of the shorter creatures yet they were plainly
close to humankind

  look look lance lorna whispered fiercely those
big creatures theyre-females

  lance nodded as he eyed the worshipping creatures
from behind a leafy screen already he nad guessed the
truth the huge invaders wore only metallic-looking
skirts from waist to knees and the women were plainly
stronger larger and fiercer than the men

  the wild chant abruptly ceased for a long moment
the worshippers knelt with heads bowed low then they
were rolling in the lush grass clothing part of the ridge
rolling like frolicking animals burying faces in the thick
verdure with wild animal cries a woman tore a mighty
rock from its ancient rest held it high above her cop-
pery head hurled it far down the gentle slope screeched
like a maniac as she watched the boulder bound down the
slant like a gigantic football

  lance the girl caught wildly at his arm we cant
face such beasts and live our greatest athletes would
be helpless as children in a grasp of those devils

  hush dear if they find us here were lost we
cant face their weapons-not yet but well find some
way of beating them every scientist and inventor in
the world must be working right now on something to beat
them

  the creatures were bounding around like great apes
now and then one paused in the wild dance to hug a
tree or roll in the thick grass their golden bodies and
coppery hair glistened in the morning sun with a metallic
sheen muscles stood out on the mighty arms shoulders
and backs like knotted cables

  a shadow flitted across the sunlight instinctively the
man and girl glanced up another of the hellish airships
was floating down through the bright air in the strong
sunlight it glittered like burnished aluminum dipped and
wheeled noiselessly like a monstrous bat pursuing prey
wild howls burst from the watching creatures on the
ridge and they waved thick arms frantically

  like an answer a battery of artillery raced to the crest
of the opposite ridge khakiclad forms were leaping
from racketing trucks springing to the gleaming guns

  forked lightning lashed out from the noiseless thing in
the air jetted from the glistening shell on the ridge
flames played and darted over and around the guns and
i he forms in khaki long ripping splintering crashes
the thunderous roar of detonating powder smoke riven
by lightning flashes mushroomed from the ridge

  slowly the thick cloud of smoke and dust was brushed
away by the strong wind and where had been trucks
and guns and fighting men was only a heap of twisted
metal wild triumphant howls burst from the thick-
bodied creatures on the ridge

  lorna sank down despairingly in the thick brush hard
dry sobs shaking her splendid form cold beads of sweat
trickled down lance nordens face terror gripped his
stout heart with icy talons

  oh god oh god oh god iorna panted lance
weve got to get   get out of here

  dont even breathe louder than you must girl he
answered in a hoarse whisper weve got to hide here
like rabbits until they leave thank god weve got the
car well hidden

  the second airship floated down beside the one nesting
on the ridge for several minutes the newcomers talked
with the others then the first glistening shell soared into
the blue heavens almost instantly it was a mere speck
in he sunlit sky traveling at incredible speed

  gone to get a fresh load of the hellions lance mused
bitterly they must be dropping all over the country
just like they are here killing with those hellish things
destroying like fiends and we cant do a thing to stop
them

  he bowed head in hands tried to rally his scattered
thoughts he was like one gripped by a hideous night-
mare beside him he could feel the girl quivering like a
bird gripped by a merciless cat he had a revolver in
his suitcase but what could such a puny weapon avail
against the weapons those devils carried
the jovian horde	

  the clashing of rocks drew his eyes back to the metal-
like creatures several of the short thick-bodied males
were building something that resembled a crude altar
others were leaping down the slope toward the green val-
ley here and there stalked a female plainly issuing
orders to the toiling men as one of the women came
nearer lance could plainly see that her massive arms
were utterly covered with greenish ornaments which
sparkled and flashed in the strong sunlight

  chains of the same strange material encircled her mighty
neck decorated her column-like legs in her girdle she
wore a long tapering tube-like thing that gleamed like a
polished knife as lance watched her with fascinated
eyes the woman dropped a hand to the gleaming tube
whipped it out

  lance squirmed slightly around to follow her gaze
down in the little valley a cow was pushing into the open
from a little thicket a yellow blaze spat from the taper-
ing tube in the womans hand lashing through the sun-
light like a brilliant streak of gold the distant cow
dropped in its tracks as though felled by an invisible
axe deep-chested roars burst from the squat figures
plunging down the ridges slope

four blocky men raced toward the slain animal cover-
ing the ground in great running leaps stooped hoisted
the carcass atop mighty shoulders lumbered up the slant
a few minutes and the savory odor of roasting beef drift-
ed from behind a rocky point

  if i could only get hold of one of those hellish tubes
lance murmured as the girl moved closer they think
theyve got us all running like rabbits thats a chance
for us if i could only surprise one of those women-

  somethings watching from that airship lorna
warned you saw what happened when    when those
soldiers    we thought theyd all come out and
then that terrible lightning flashed out

  lance nodded soberly they look like brutes lorna
like horrible metal brutes but theyve got brains did
you notice that womans high forehead and they arc
masters of natural laws that we hardly comprehend ill
wait till night comes maybe-

  listen

  it came faintly at first-a deep resonance from behind
them warily they squirmed around in the concealing
brush to stare down on the gently rolling terrain stead-
ily the booming sound deepened gradually translated it-
self into deep voices sounding like a paean of barbaric tri-
umph

  an answering chant came from the blocky forms near
the glistening airship then lance and lorna glimpsed
golden figures striding up the long slope toward the
ridges wooded crest scores of them and behind the
thick-bodicd metal-like forms came a little band of
faltering stumbling women and men beside and behind
them stalked more of the fearsome space creatures in
the garish sunlight the stripped bodies of the earth people
seemed oddly white and pitifully frail against the massive
forms surrounding them

  their hands were bound behind their backs lengths of
tough vines linked them together a thin girl swayed
weakly almost stumbled to her knees a yellow arm went
up brought a long switch down across the girls pale
shoulders the girl screamed wildly staggered on

  like one gripped by a hideous charm lorna lansing
and lance norden watched that dreadful procession move
to the top of the ridge watched it jerk to a halt before the
crude altar the invaders had erected from the knot of
waiting figures stalked a huge form

  for a long moment she appraised the shrinking captives

with coldly calculating eyes the glittering green bands
circling her golden arm seemingly radiated sparks as she
pointed out her choice two females stepped forth
clutched a man in their mighty grasp he was powerfully
built according to earth standards with arching chest
and bulging shoulders but his struggles were as a childs
as he was dragged to the horrible altar

  lorna turned her eyes away held hands over her ears
lance wrenched his gaze away from that hideous scene
with a conscious effort he burned with a mad urge to
rush to the aid of the captives to kill all the fiends he
could with his revolver before he was himself struck
down but he knew his best efforts against the terrible
lightning-tubes carried by those grisly females would
be as the battle of a feather against a cyclone

  hoarse chanting was beating on the air like the ham-
mering of a battering surf it drowned out the gasping
screams of the victim maddened by its very monotony
for an age it seemed to endure then silence was brood-
ing over the countryside from somewhere in the brush
a bird began twittering softly and then there was a
long quivering scream

  lance are they killing them all the girl gasped

  he raised his head cautiously peered through the in-
terlaced branches of a clump of wild rosebushes the
crcatures had moved away from the altar were pulling
the prisoners close to the glistening airship a golden
woman gripped an earthman by a shoulder jerked him
away from the other captives bore him to the ground
pressed something against the white flesh instantly came
a hoarse roaring bellow of agony

  another of the females was turning a pale body under
her own golden bulk a womans wild scream rang out

  are they killing them lorna repeated

  lance laughed a low bitter laugh no theyre not
killing them lorna looks like the devils are branding
them must be they arc making slaves of them

  the girl raised her dark head looked through the thick
branches although she still wore her heavy coat she
was shivering shrieks were coming now in one long
ripple of hideous sound from the captives as they were
seized and branded here and there a huge golden form
dragged away a writhing slave one extended a long
golden arm pointed out the shadowy outlines of a distant
town several of the blocky creatures began to lumber
down the long slant of the ridge

  goin for more slaves lance surmised bitterly
looks like the ladies havent enough to go around
theyre sure a nice sweet lot of yellow hellions

chapter iii
capture

t orna turned her head regarded him with steady eyes

  lance what are we going to do we cant stay
here we havent any water and well perish of cold
and we darent start the car

  he clasped her hand with steady fingers lorna what
weve been watching must be going on all over the world
but there must be some way of beating those yellow devils
theyre coming fast but were still millions against their
hundreds

  but were as helpless as rabbits against those terrible
weapons

  he nodded soberly weve got to get hold of one of
those hellish things lorna got to have our scientists
analyze em and find some means of guarding against em
those fiends think were paralyzed by terror they look
on us just as we look on animals they dont even dream


wonder stories quarterly

any earth dweller would try anything   im going to
try for one of those lightning-tubes

  but lance how-

  going lo try and surprise one of those females they
havent the least idea were here or wed have been  

  yes i know she said steadily as lance paused im
going with you    lance

  bui he shook his head no dear ive got just the
gossamer thread of a chance one can slide through that
brush without making much noise ive been in the jun-
gles five years dear theres the one chance in a million
that i may be able to knock over one of those brutes and
get her lightning-tube if im lucky well therell be a
few less of that brood he finished grimly

  but let me slip along behind you lance she pleaded
i-i-dont want you to leave me i cant stand staying
here-alone

  yes you can dear ive got to go dearest while
theres a ghost of a chance before more come

  she lifted her face to him her lips quivering her dusky
eyes shining like stars he caught her to him kissed her
fiercely then pushed her arms gently from around his
neck slipped away with the silence of a stalking wolf

  he reached the hidden automobile secured a heavy
wrench called guardedly to lorna that he had left a
revolver for her he knew he must strike silently against
the grisly creatures one shot would spell disaster-not
only for him but also for the girl he loved and perhaps
countless multitudes

  like a shadow he slipped through the thick brush mov-
ing from boulder to boulder with the silence of some
creature of the wild as he neared the hellish criatures
he flattened against the ground paused to listen with strain-
ing ears he could hear the deep hum of hoarse voices
warily he raised up behind a wind-shaken bush studied
his surroundings with quick darting glances

  some fifty yards away a little group of the creatures
were feeding kneeling white slaves served their mighty
mistresses but the shaggy males sat by themselves the
huge golden women were eating and drinking from ves-
sels of glistening greenish metal finally one of the
huge females stood up stretched lazily sent her slave
reeling backward with a savage slap stalked toward a
belt of high waving grass

  lance norden breathed deeply tightened his grip on
the heavy wrench followed like a shadow his pulse was
pounding wildly but he felt strangely calm

  lance began circling a ragged shoulder of gleaming rock
inch by inch he crept through a tangle of thin brush
where the bushes grew close to the tall grass lance peered
out cautiously the great woman was stretched out in the
grass basking in the blazing sunlight like some strange
golden animal

  lance slipped across a narrow path cutting through the
brush inched through a clump of scatlered rocks he
had to come up on the terrible creature from the rear he
was stalking the most terrible animal earthman had ever
marked for prey he must stun this creature with the
first blow or be blasted lo atoms by the terrible lighlning-
tube the female carried in her girdle

  he whirled like a cat as a iwig snapped behind him
whirled to face a huge man carrying a shorl savagely
knobbed club of shimmering metal the creature was a
good six feel tall bill so thick and wide as to seem almost
a dwarf he was clad in but a breech-clout and thick
coppery hair malted his huge frame his head was round
and incredible shaggy with the small green eyes blazing
with the lust of murder

  with a snarling growl he hurled himself upon the start-
led lance whirling up his terrible club lance flung him-

self sideways as ihe creature charged felt the knobbed
club whiz past his head savagely the earlhman lashed
out with his heavy wrench the creature growled hoarse-
ly as the weapon thudded against his shoulder leaped
away swung the club viciously

  again lance slipped away from the ferocious charge
and his wrench crashed full on the huge shaggy head
went ihrough thin bone and flesh as ihough it had struck
an eggshell went down and down the huge yellowish
form crumpled down like a tree blasted by lightning

  and as the creature thrashed about  the ground lance
cried out with the agony of invisible fire wrapping him
from head to foot he was flung to earth by a paralyzing
shock his senses were reeling crazily with the blinding
torture of the scorching waves racing through him it
was as though he was being bathed in liquid flame

tte sensed he was writhing on the ground like an im-
- paled nake that moans of frantic pain bubbled
on his pale lips fiery mists whirled around him dragged
him down to a blazing hell    then the blistering tor-
ment gradually ceased something was prodding his
quivering body prodding insistently brutally something
incredibly hard and sharp

   lance rolled up pain-filmed eyes stared up dazedly into
a cruel golden face orbs of glowing green bored into
him dimly he realized it was the fearsome woman he
had been stalking-the creature he had hoped to surprise
and strike down she was gouging his side with a metal-
shod foot

  lance winced away instantly the creature tilted the
tapering cylinder in her hand and lance felt as though
a thousand hornets were stinging him he flung himself
sideways shrieked with the thrilling pain of it the
creature stepped back motioned him to stand up

  feeling miserably weak and helpless lance obeyed
that imperious gesture the woman towered head and
shoulders above the earlhmans own six feet but her
huge bulk gave her a queer blocky appearance she
moved slightly and her ropelike muscles crawled and
bulged under the golden skin her skirt seemingly woven
of bronze fibre only accentuated the mighty lines of her
form

  pointed glistening teeth showed under a lifted lip as
she appraised ihe earlhman with eyes as cold and merci-
less as a jungle beasts and lance knew he was in the
power of a soulless thing knowing  law but its own sav-
age instincts blind animal fear gripped lance nor-
den and shook him

  the watching creature laughed loudly gloatingly the
horrible snarling of tigress clawing its victim in a
blur of speed she thrust the lightning-like lube into her
girdle flicked out a mighty hand thick warm moist
fingers closed around lances mouth and nostrils dug
into flesh jerked him closer

  her other hand darled to the mans buttoned coat
wrenched clothing from him with a single savage tug
baring him to the waist she dropped the tatlered gar-
ments raised her hand slapped him full in the face it
was like the cuff of a bear il sent him reeling shook
him to his toes another stinging smack

  savage rage flooded lance norden as the thick fin-
gers striped his face wilh red welts driving out the fear
as a mighty wind shreds away smothering fog if he
could only get his hands on that hellish cylinder in the
creatures girdle

  if he could only blast her and all the fiends like her
to the four winds of the world crush her hateful head
as he had crushed the eggshell skull of the hairy man-
the jovian horde	

brute if only he could get that gleaming deadly mock-
ing lightning-tube

  her moist oddly warm hand clamped down on his naked
shoulder like a vise she jerked him close to her great
breast holding him powerless with a mighty arm slapped
him full in the mouth chuckled wolfishly as blood bead-
ed on his crushed lips struck again mouthed taunts in
some strange gurgling rasping tongue

  wildly lance struggled to break free from the terrible
embrace and as he squirmed the creatures face con-
vulsed with fury she whirled him off his feet lung
him headlong then he was facing the rocky ground
with her mighty bulk pinning him down it was as
though tons of lead were crushing him into the earth

  searing heat neared his shoulder lance squirmed
frenziedly bellowed hoarsely as glowing metal bit in-
to his crawling flesh desperately he struggled to writhe
out from under that fiendish weight his breath was
coming in great laboring gasps cold sweat of agony
bathed him he could feel his eyes starting from his
head with the blinding pain feel his hair bristle

  the scorching point of the branding-iron was moving
slowly over the back of his shoulder the world whirled
around him in a black fog shot through with red flashes
of hideous pain it seemed to the tortured man that his
whole body was about to burst into flames

  then it came to him that the searing metal no longer
gnawed into him that the crushing weight pinning him
to earth had lifted but his branded shoulder was a
blazing hell of agony he opened his eyes as he was
rolled roughly over on his back

  coppery hair coarse and harsh as the hair of a horse
brushed his face and chest eyes green and merciless as
a cats glared down on him the womans thin lips rolled
away from pointed teeth in the terrible ecstasy of cruelty
he winced as her hard hands stung his naked sides with
vicious slaps

  and it came to lance norden that although this hellish
creature had marked him with the sign of slavery he was
not to live she meant to kill him slowly lingeringly-
because he had slain her shaggy man he could read it
in her cold eyes she wasnt a woman just a ghoul made
in the semblance of a woman

  and again wild rage gripped him his burning eyes
shifted covertly to the tapering lightning-tube in the crea-
tures metal girdle beside it was the pointed branding-
iron and a thick-bladcd knife with the eyes of the en-
gineer he noted the slight projection on the coil handle
he was to die on a bed of hideous torture the thought
hammered on his brain like a mallet

  and millions like him would become cringing slaves of
hellish creaturcs like the green-eyed brute playing with
him as a cat toys with a mouse lorna would be caught
and stripped and branded he writhed with the horror
of it

   as she grasped him again lances fingers closed on tho
handle of the tapering cylinder began inching it from the
creatures girdle

  fighting down the pain wrapping him like a garment
spurred by desperation lance whipped the lightning-tube
from tho metal girdle jabbed the end against the creatures
side pressed the little projecting knob as far as it would
slide

  instantly came a crackling burst of livid flame a
stunning shock

pazedly lance realized he was on the ground quiv-
ering jerkily as though he had received a severe elec-
tric shock for a desperate moment he thought he had
failed that the woman had outwitted him at the last

minute was twisting him with new torture then he saw
he still gripped the lightning-tube

  there was a strange pungent sickening odor lance
twisted around jerked back with a strong shudder where
the creature had squatted was but scattered heaps of
smoking flesh and bone the annihilating lightning-blast
from the tube had literally blown the creature to frag-
ments

  lance norden bounded to his feet any moment more
of the devilish creatures might appear but a high shoul-
der of rock and thick bushes concealed this sheltered dale
from any eyes peering down from the ridge he darted
into a clump of prickly bushes his branded shoulder
burned and throbbed savagely but he was conscious only
of a savage urge to destroy every hellion infesting the shud-
dering earth

  halfway up the slant of the ridge he paused blind
wild rage calmed to more deadly cold fury he had to
think of lorna and the other countless earth people he
had the gossamer filament of a chance now lo surprise
the fiends and capture their space ship with that craft
in their possession the scientists of earth would be en-
abled to know the mighty forces the creatures had mas-
tered

  lance began stealing toward the ridges crest like a
shadow already he could hear the hoarse rasping voices
of the invaders harsh animal-like laughter the shrill
piercing scream of an earth woman rang high in the cool
air lance started as though he had been spurred again
the woman screamed

  gliding from the shelter of a rounded boulder to a
low screen of thin bushes lance rose to his knees parted
the interlaced branches with infinite caution peered
through he saw naked limbs thrashing about on the
brushy sward saw fiendish creatures regarding the
scene with torture-pleased faces

  a slim girl flung her nude body sideways screamed
shrilly as one of the blocky females flicked her with a
ray from her lightning-cylinder another of tho loath-
some creatures leveled her tube the girl shrieked leaped
to her feet as though spurred

  the watchers rocked with hoarse merriment against
a rock cowered a dozen of the pale-bodied terrorized
slaves a man roared with agony as a ray flicked him
bounded and writhed as more of the tubs stung him
drove him close to the screaming girl

  the slimy devils lance gritted the damned
fiends

  and leveling the lightning-tube he had captured he
pressed the knob on the coil handle the creature spur-
ring the girl with the torturing ray dropped like a
lightning-riven pine lance shifted the golden ray an-
other of the hellish things was blasted to fragments
three more were blotted out before the others realized
what was happening

  with a yell lance sprang to his feet charged the crea-
tures two more dropped in smoking heaps a female
whipped her tube from metal girdle as she bounded side-
ways like a gigantic ape but she was annihilated as
she leaped by the vengeful earthman

  lance was racing for the glistening space ship howl-
ing and screeching like fiends the creatures were plung-
ing against each other fighting wildly to gain the shelter
of the silvery craft even in that wild moment lance
noted that the lightning bolts were not harming the glis-
tening ship but were glancing from its silvery side as
light reflects from polished metal

  a nude slave screamed horribly and went down in a
smoking mass as lightning forked out from a tube gripped
by a creature lance shifted crumpled the screeching

killer with a quick tilt of his weapon a groan tore from
his tight throat as a huge form reached the space ship
he was too late

  the creature leaped for an opening in the silvery shell
flung out great arms and crashed down as a revolver
roared a shaggy male pitched sideways with spat of
flame from a clump of brush again the revolver barked
spitefully

  lance gained the opening of the ship with a flying
leap whirled in time to drop a howling creature and
slammed the silvery door shut his darting eyes focussed
on a long tapering gunlike tube jusl above it was a
small window lance darted to the lube peered through
the blue-tinted crystal clear substance composing the
window

  his hand found the knob on the handle of the tube
shoved it instantly a sheet of lightning flared from the
side of the ship the burst of radiance caught a group
of the leaping creatures blasting them to smoking frag-
ment brush and trees in the path of the lightning burst
into flames a huge boulder was dissolving

  the earlhinans hand released the bomb which snapped
back to the head of th tube he saw one of the shaggy
men stoop and snatch up a tube one of the females had
dropped either his dull brain had ceased to function
or the creature cherished savage hatred for the females
of its own kind for it raised the tube and thumbed
on its full power

  three of the remaining females withered under that
vengeful blast of destruction another sprang wildly as
he golden ray seared her shoulder then she too was
blasted lo atoms and at the same instant ihe shaggy man
was struck down by a blast of forked flame the crea-
ture destroying him whirled like a cornered panther point-
ed her death-tube at a cowering slave

  she was loo far to one side to be reached by a lightning
boh from the ship with a yell of fury lance nordert
wrenched open the door sprang out the creature mur-
dering the shrieking white slaves spun around warned by
sheer instinct the ray from her tube caught one of the
shaggy males he dropped then the fierce woman liter-
ally melted as she was struck by the full force of lances
weapon

  some sixth sense buzzed a warning in the earthmans
brain he flung himself sidewise in the quick duck and
roll of a dodging leopard felt blisteriog heat sweep past
him the female who had been wounded by the myster-
ious revolver bullet was on her knees leveling the tube
at him with shaking hands

chapter iv
flight

feeling as a man feels when he stamps life from a rat-
tlesnake lance tilted his lightning-tube the veno-
mous woman withered away in the flame of death two
blocky forms were plunging wildly for the cover of a
clump of rocks lance burned them down with savage
flicks of his terrible tube the sight of the smoking re-
mains of the murdered slaves had driven the last spark of
mercy from his heart

  lance lance its all over lance

  the musical voice came from a clump of brush lance
norden checked his hunt for more of the fiendish creatures
shook his head like a man trying to clear his brain of a
maddening mist he was sure he knew that voice

  lorna where are you

she came out from behind a brushtopped rock one
firm hand gripped a revolver her gauzy evening dress

of red silk hung around her in tatters and her black hair
cascaded down her bare shoulders in splendid turmoil
her dusky eyes were filmed with horror but there was no
hint of fear in her lovely face

  quick inside the ship lance cried those devils
cant harm us there quick before more come

  he watched the girl flit into the silvery craft with the
lithe grace of a deer called to the remaining captives
to come to the refuge they came creeping out from be-
hind rocks and through bushes like creatures rode by a
hideous nightmare horror sat in their wild eyes and
they moved like people stunned by a calamity they hard-
ly comprehended they scurried into the space ship like
scared rabbits as lance urged them to hurry four
women and two men

  hurriedly lance began gathering up the scattered light-
ning-tubes on the ground the earth people would have
desperate need for the weapons in their war with the in-
vaders lorna darted out from the silvery shell stopped
and picked up a couple of the hellish things

  weve got enough dear lance warned we cant
take any more chances look out that you dont touch
those knobs lorna hurry

  weve got to get some things in the car lance she
reminded theres some food there-and clothes were
both nearly naked boy and those poor creatures   

  ill drive the car over here he answered hurriedly
just carry those tubes inside dearest keep the door
shut if any of those devils show just give em a blast
from one of those long tubes in the ship just push the
knob and hold it

  she nodded darted inside the silvery cigar-shaped shell
with a lightning-tube in his hand lance raced over to the
hidden automobile climbed in pressed the starter three
minutes and he was handing suitcases and packages to
lorna through the narrow doorway of the space ship

  well just have to kiss the car goodbye lorna he
grinned as he stepped into the silvery craft and closed the
metal door

  were just trading it for this marvelous ship she an-
swered with a brave little smile picking up a suitcase she
carried it over to where the four woman huddled together
like stunned sheep

  lance norden strode over to the pointed head of the
ship began examining the mysterious power-plant with
the trained eyes of the engineer huge coils of green-
ish metal almost filled the extreme end of the cigar-like
shell with rubbery material separating them from coil
to coil vivid blue light streamed in pulsing waves with
a soft hissing and swishing

  from the heart of the nest of coils radiated in a small
arc a series of long black tubes connecting with a small
compact boxlike machine lance glanced from the coils
and tubes to a long lever fronting a wide seat then up to a
long slab mounted above the hissing coils

  the slab was apparently composed of a peculiar sub-
stance resembling asbestos and was set with several switch-
es control-bultons and two dials the engineers trained
mind was working swiftly logically coolly as he studied
the purpose of each section of the mysterious power-
plant

  that boxlike apparatus must contain the propelling
mechanism lance mused the electric power is gen-
erated by those coils one of those switches controls
the means of heating the ship the others must release
oxygen and control the lightning system this lever
seems to control those coils

  cingorly hi band went to a black switch pulled it

down a notch the electric-blue waves instantly became
one wide sheet of dazzling radiance between the green
the jovian horde



coils and the box-like machine hummed dully as though
a million bees buzzed within lance shut off the myster-
ious power experimented warily with switches and but-
tons sighed with satisfaction as a switch released a hiss-
ing jet of life-sustaining oxygen

  can you run it lance

tltf turned to smile into the eager face of lorna lans-
- ing im going lo try lorna ive played arouud
with planes and done some other things in a misspent
career this ship is a wonder girl beats anything our
earth people ever turned out and im sure going to
try to run it got to

  oh lance they branded you her wide eyes
focussed on his pain-tacked shoulder boy what hap-
pened

  he shrugged lightly one of those creatures treated
me a bit rough before i got her lightning-tube he
caught both her hands in his lorna if you hadnt
risked everything and shot down that creature as she
reached this ship wed have been stamped out you are
sure one game girl

  i had to do something she answered i couldnt
wait any longer and when i saw you slipping through
the brush i thought i might be able to do something
those fiends were so busy    torturing that poor girl   
i thought i had a chance i told you last night i wasnt
a weeping willow she added softly

  were going to win out lorna he exclaimed a bit
wildly we cant fail now they cant reach us inside
this shell with their tubes-

  im going to lix those wounds lance she announced
firmly

  she flitted over to an opened suitcase was back in a
moment with disinfectants and strips of cloth she coated
the branded shoulder with cooling powder cleansed and
bound up the lacerated wound in his chest helped him
to get into a shirt

  he caught her hands to his lips then dropped into the
seat in front of the coils and the strange pulsing blue
waves of vivid light reached up to the switchboard and
drew the black lever down a notch came instantly the
dazzlingly blue glory between the green coils and the low
hum of the driving mechanism gently lance pulled on
the long lever in front of the pilots seat

  the ship barely quivered but through the window above
the switchboard lance could see the terrain moving beneath
the ship he drew the lever a bit closer and the craft
nosed over a clump of trees with the silence and effort-
less ease of an eagle experimentally he pushed the lever
back to neutral the ship hung motionless in the bright
air like a resting bird

  oh lance lorna cried with delight you can handle
it

  kind of looks that way lorna he grinned

  but where can you go again her face was grave
with dread those terrible things must be everywhere
lance

  he nodded soberly ive got to reach some of our
scientists once they can analyze those lightning-tubes and
the metal forming this ship well be able to fight those
devils with their own fire ive got a friend at elmira-
dr barlow sterns hes one of our greatest scientists

  youre going to try and reach him

  its our best chance its more likely that other scien-
tists will be consulting him than that he has left his lab-
oratory

  pulling back the lever a trifle he sent the ship climb-
ing upward until the arrowy pointer on one of the dials
had crept through the thirty-second of a strangely

marked arc leveled the craft out and swung her around
until she headed northwest

  he looked down from a side-window the earth
looked like a green blur he guessed he must be a good
mile above the ground gently he nosed the ship down
until earthly things became a trifle distinct he knew
the strange space craft was shooting along at ripping
speed

  lance reached for the black switch pushed it up gently
until the blue light streaming from the coils glowed less
vividly he glanced up at the steady-eyed girl that
slows us down id give a lot for a control board i could
read im just guessing at altitude and speed

  were passing over a small town lorna informed
peering down from one of the small windows looks like
that road over there is literally covered with abandoned
cars at least they dont seem to be moving were still
pretty high

  lance nodded soberly people must be pretty badly
frightened most likely theyve taken to the hills and
bush trying to reach places they think the devils wont
find

  he eased the ship down until the objects below them
became sharply distinct in the distance a train was
speeding toward rolling hills here and there on the gray
ribbon of highway an automobile raced at top speed by
the way he passed all moving objects lance knew the
space ship still rocketed through the atmosphere like a
comet he cut down the electric-blue energy flashing from
the green coils until the steady stream of radiance dimmed
plainly

  he circled to scan the heavens with danger-sharpened
eyes he knew he faced not only the menace of an at-
tack from venturesome flyers of earth but the possibility
that the bestial invaders were already seeking him the
fearsome invaders were certain to have means of com-
munication between their space ships

  were nearing a good-sized town lorna warned i
can see buildings and high chimneys theres a river-

  its elmira lance interrupted swiftly the rivers
the chemung i see a landmark  know im going to
try and come down in that open field over to the right
close to that clump of trees cant chance a landing field
those people down there think this ship is loaded down
with brutes-and im not sure this shell would stand up
under machine-gun bullets

  look lance the girl cried theres hundreds of
automobiles speeding away from the city the highways
are choked with them and people are running

  sure radios have been broadcasting warnings ahead
of us

t te slipped the ship down shut off the power easily
j-  guided the great craft to a wide strip of level ground
the ship settled down on the grassy sward like a great
bird crept a few feet under the screen of high trees

  darting over to his open suitcase lance found a note-
book and fountain pen and quickly wrote and signed a
message clanccd over to one of the men he had taken
into the ship the man was now dressed in one of lance
nordens suits but lie still looked pale and badly fright-
ened he looked up with a violent start as lance called
to him

  listen the engineer said crisply i want you to
take this message to dr barlow sterns get that ask
any one you see to take you to his laboratory everybody
knows him theres a dozen abandoned cars over on
that street hurry

  the man hesitated passed a shaking hand over his pal-
lid face he was a big heavily built individual with a

pronounced paunch and seemed on the point of bursting
through his tight clothes he somehow conveyed the im-
pression of smug prosperity

  i-i-cant he stammered hoarsely my god man
im sick i darent go out-my god man they branded
me

  one of those hellions tortured me branded me
lance grated we havent got time to think of our-
selves brace up man get hold of yourself im ask-
ing you to do this because i darent leave this ship

  ill go lance it was lornas voice cool and
steady

  something like shame crept into the eyes of the big
man as the girl spoke his glance shuttled to the strain-
ed faces of the little knot of terrorized women huddled a
few feet away back to lance and the steady-eyed lorna
his big shoulders straightened

  ill go he throated huskily youre right old
man this is no time for a man to think of himself

  he took the message from lance lumbered from the
ship as lorna opened the metal door ran awkwardly
toward a big car parked at the end of the nearest street
the watching lancc saw a man run out into the sunshine
as the messenger neared the parked automobile for a
moment the two talked excilcdly then the stranger sprang
into the machine closely followed by the other the car
roared away in a cloud of dust

  that man knows where dr sterns lives lorna cried
in relief

  lance smiled gently he must lorna girl weve
still got a fighting chance folks he turned to the four
women and lone man in the ship maybe youd better
join that crowd gathering over there youll be more
safe with them than here this isnt going to be the
safest place in the world when those devils come after
us

  they regarded him with dull hopeless fear-ridden
eyes finally a woman stirred walked out into the sun-
shine as though she bore the burden of the world on her
bowed shoulders the others followed like frightened
sheep from the staring crowd choking the street came
cries of encouragement and sympathy several rushed
over to aid the staggering refugees

  the eyes of lancc and lorna lansing met in a long
questioning look and the airl shook her dark head

  im not going lance she whispered

  he caught her hands brushed them with his lips i
knew you wouldnt lorna thank god that america
still breeds such women as you well beat those slimy
devils yet

  you think theyll discover that weve captured this
ship she asked after a brief silence

  i think we should expect it he answered slowly
theres a radio transmitting and receiving set near those
coils lorna at least it looks like one if they spot this
ship and we dont answer their signals theyll know
what happened were dealing with brutes possessing the
brains of superior beings

  minutes ticked away pushing milling humanity be-
gan thronging close to the silvery ship moved by the
mainspring of overmastering curiosity lance noted that
the face of most of the men and women were drawn with
anxiety and dread and that their eyes constantly turned
to the sky and he was keenly aware of the fact that not
a single plane cruised the blue heavens

  plainly terror hung over the world like a pall a sigh
of relief escaped the engineers lips as the growing crowd
parted to allow two automobiles to speed through one
was a police car with a scrcaching siren the machines
jerked to a stop a few yards from the space ship

  from the police car leaped three men the foremost

was tall and lean with a remarkably keen face and deep-
set grey eyes the others had the faces of thinkers and
the stooped shoulders of the student the tall grey-eyed
man broke into a run as he came close his keen eyes
were fairly sparkling with eagerness

  come right in dr sterns lance grinned from the
doorway of the space ship theres lots of things in
here thats too deep for me

  the famous scientist shook lances hand warmly glad
to see you my boy you captured this marvelous con-
trivance you and this young lady my stars

  the three scientists followed lance into the ship eyes
wide with interest little whistles and exclamations of
delight broke from their lips as they studied the blue rad-
iance flowing from the green coils and the mysterious ap-
paratus below the switchboard

  dr sterns straightened his long form after a quick
scrutiny of the ship gentlemen this is no place to con-
duct our researches we may be attacked any moment
you all know what the invaders are threatening what
they have done we must take this marvelous contrivance
to my underground laboratory in the adirondacks gen-
tlemen the fate of the world perhaps rests on our
shoulders

  are the brutes raiding the cities lance asked swift-
ly-

  a thick-bodied man whose bright eyes were masked
by thick glasses nodded his head they have rocked
new york chicago washington and other cities with
their lightning bolts debris chokes the streets the loss
of life must be appalling

  this is no time for talk cried a scientist sharply i
am of the opinion of dr sterns we must escape with
this ship to the adirondacks-immediately

  careful with those tubes lance warned sharply as
the thick-bodied man picked up one of the lightning-
cylinders that knob releases those lightning bolls
the other nodded laid the weapon down softly two
thoughtful men came into the ship both carried suit-
cases it came to lance that the grips contained science
apparatus the five scientists were talking excitedly as
they appraised the ship

  wc are of the opinion mr norden that we should
leave at once for dr sterns mountain laboratory stat-
ed a gray-haired man we dare not linger in this ex-
posed area the young lady-

  goes with us lance cut in positively but for miss
lansings courage we wouldnt have this ship now

  i am sure gentlemen we shall be more than delighted
to have the company of miss lansing smiled dr sterns
was not the great herschel assisted mightily by a de-
voted sister miss lansing we already owe you a debt
we can never repay

  the girl flushed rosily lance slipped into the pilots
seat switched on the mysterious power shifted the con-
trol lever the hum of the strange power mechanism
deepened to a steady drone and the space ship left the
ground like a soaring hawk the five scientists pressed
close to watch the blue hissing radiance flowing from
the coils of shimmering green

chapter v

shadows of doom

hills and trees seemed leaping away from the great
ship and the river was soon but a thread of silver
lance zoomed the craft until an indicator on the dial
crept through several markings then leveled off and
rocketed for the bluish outline of distant mountains the
the jovian horde



ship was sweeping along with the effortless ease of a
giant condor a sudden exclamation by one of the scien-
tists jerked the narrowed eyes of lance norden to a side
window

  miles off a silvery shape flashed through the western
heavens like a racing comet another of the hellish ships
and from covering clouds darted a swarm of planes
lightning flared out from the space ship smoke of
bursting shells filmed the bright sky as the planes opened
fire

  forked sheets of bluish fire were ripping the atmosphere
around the darting circling rocketing planes two
plunged down in flames like blazing torches another
reeled and slipped like a bird with a shattered wing
plumes of white smoke flowered out below and behind
the space ship

  those flyers have lured that ship over a nest of anti-
aircraft guns dr stems cried thrillingly brave lads
dying gloriously that others may live    and forget
two more planes were dropping in swirling flames
white puffs of bursting shells showed above and below
the rocketing space ship a ripping sheet of lightning
flared earthward from the silvery craft came a wide
swirl of yellowish fire and billows of gray smoke

  the devils have annihilated those gunners groaned
a scientist

  but they got the hellions lancc yelled look
look theyre crashing theyre hit

  the great ship was drifting down spinning and rolling
on the wings of the strong wind now and then forked
lightning stabbed out viciously as a plane ventured nearer
the doomed craft the ship was going down slowly soft-
ly like a huge parachute

  those wretches must have some mastery over the law
of gravity dr stems muttered they should be hurt-
ling down in flames they are settling to earth as softly
as a leaf but they can be crushed by our weapons they
are not invulnerable

  three planes circled and hovered over the falling ship
spraying it witli smoking lead one was caught by a sud-
den stab of the deadly lightning lurched crazily dropped
in flames fire and smoke mushroomed from the ground
as the space ship settled gently down the strange craft
buckled in the center seemed to fold up on itself

  that bomb smashed them exulted one of the staring
scientists brave boys those creatures are not invinci-
ble it will cost us dear but if we can keep on destroying
their ships-

  those planes are after us lance cut in sharply
those flyers think were enemies  he pulled the control
lever sent the ship racing through the thin air

  no danger from that quarter dr sterns stated quiet-
ly were traveling so fast that those planes seem to be
standing still wc must be making at least two miles to
their one for the time we are more endangered by
friends than enemies

  another fleet of planes coming from behind those
hills lorna informed quietly

  were above their ceiling lance answered or i
dont know a thing about flying we must be flying high-
er than any plane of earth has ever flown and making
a good six hundred miles an hour look at that cloud
bank were a good mile above it

  the other looked down below them spread a gray
fleecy mantle of mist blotting out the earth the pur-
suing planes had vanished overhead stretched a sky of
flawless sapphire for a long moment lance studied the
heavens with narrowed eyes then gradually eased the
ship down unitl he could make out the dim outlines of
bluish mountains slackened the roaring speed

  watch for trouble-everybody he directed crisply
well be wanting to come down pretty soon and we
dont want to be rubbed out by our friends

  that radio has warned that any resistance means an-
nihilation a scientist observed dryly and many nf
our so-called leaders are urging that no resistance be of-
fered thousands of our people are surrendering to the
invading horde to save their lives

  but it means slavery lorna exclaimed horrible
hideous cringing slavery

  the scientist shrugged man has endured the most
inhuman tyranny to preserve his life miss lansing hu-
man nature has not perceptibly changed sinced the days
of the scientists

  we are almost there my boy dr sterns informed
as he peered through the window in the front of the ship
its to the left of that rounded hill with the thick cover-
age of pines

  lance nodded swung the sliip around in a narrow cir-
cle scouted the sky and earth with sharp darting glances
below and ahead stretched wild mountain country gashed
by gulches and thinly carpeted by trees and underbrush
here and there water flashed and sparkled no sign of
lurking planes or hidden guns

  mountains seemed racing toward the great ship as
lance drove her straight for the rounded hill he slack-
ened speed carefully eased the ship down warily he
sighed relief as the giant space cruiser drifted smoothly
down to earth like a gigantic leaf guided it through a
wide gulch and into a haven darkly shaded by overhang-
ing crags and spreading oaks

  bravo applauded dr sterns there isnt one
chance in a thousand of the invaders finding us here it
cant be seen from the sky professor mcpherson turn-
ing to a stockily-built ruddy-faced companion if youll
just set up your wireless outfit and establish communica-
tions with the war department it will protect us from
any attack by our own forces

the thickset scientist nodded and proceeded to take a
wireless set from a suitcase a few moments and he
was sending out a message to washington lance and
lorna followed dr stems into a large laboratory hol-
lowed out in the rocky hillside the place was lined with
retorts electric furnaces carboys of chemicals strange
machines and shelves laden witn instruments of glass and
metal

  i established this laboratory here three years ago the
great scientist explained i come here frequently when
i desire to be free to carry on some important work i
am hopeful i am very hopeful that we will be able to
analyze the peculiar metal of which the ship is built
and those terrible tubes oncc we understand the forces
arrayed against us solution of the problem becomes a
fairly simple matter

  it seems to me doctor that if we could determine the
nature of the metal covering the ship it would be easy
to protect ourselves from those lightning-tubes lance
observed

  yes or by experimenting with the ray itself we may
be able to develop other means of defense those gentle-
men you have met are all pre-eminent in their own spe-
cial spheres of science and this laboratory is splendidly
equipped you may have observed that professor mc-
pherson is using wireless telegraphy the president has
banned the use of the ordinary radio broadcaster as an
act of national defense we know that the invaders
scientists can hear and comprehend the spoken word we
are hopeful they are not cognizant of our silent wire-
less


wonder stories quarterly

  those brutes arc still using the radio to threaten our
people lance asked

  dr sterns nodded gravely they have ordered us to
immediately destroy all our air bases forts scientific
laboratories and all other potential means of offense or
defense their ships have already searched out and anni-
hilated many of our largest airports arsenals and insti-
tutions of science

  are the tides still rising doctor lorna asked

  not beyond the point recorded last night miss lans-
ing i am of the opinion that they dare not venture their
world too close lo earth they have undoubtedly dis-
covered some means of partly mastering the special type
of magnetism wc call gravity but-

  he broke olf as three scientists came into the labor-
atory they carried several lightning-tubes two long
shield-shaped slabs of silvery metal and some odd-look-
ing instruments

  we purpose to first attempt an analysis of this pecu-
liar metal and these ray projectors explained one of the
scientists a lean tall man with greying hair doctor
keppler and i have already demonstrated to our own
satisfaction that the shields and the sheathing of the space
ship are of like composition at least insofar as being
totally impervious lo attacks of the ray his deep voice
held a note of quiet triumph

  splendid professor allandyne splendid applauded
dr sterns the laboratory is at your disposal gentle-
men and while you are conducting your researches
gentlemen professor mcpherson and myself will endeavor
to learn something of the strange power emanating from
those green coils

  this laboratory must be guarded doctor lance nor-
den reminded as the scientists began busying themselves
with test-tubes and burners and the ship we dont
want to be surprised by those hellions

  the great scientist nodded his fine head right my
boy we shall rely on miss lansing and your good self
norden for guard duty i assume the war department
will rush guards here i shall ask that they be equipped
with rubber gas-guns ordinary weapons are a hazard
rather than a protection-with those ray-projectors

  he was bustling around the laboratory as he talked
picking out apparatus for his examination of the strange
power-plant in the ship pungent acrid fumes began
filling the place as the other scientists bent over their
experiments

  well have to watch out for some venturesome souls
of our own people lance warned lorna as they left
the laboratory and scouted sky and terrain with danger-
sharpened eyes this is a lonely spot but some eyes
may have seen us come down here

  well get a lightning-tube apiece lorna exclaimed
theres several in the ship we can watch the ship and
laboratory from that heap of rocks over there lance
she pointed out a clump of boulders behind and above
die laboratory we can watch everything from there
without being seen by anyone well have to have our
coats itll be cold there

  hurrying into the ship they armed themselves with the
fearsome lighlning-tubes secured coats from their suit-
cases professor mcpherson still bent over his wireless
set so absorbed in his task that he hardly noted their
presence

  those scienitsts certainly need guards lance smiled
as he followed the girl outside once they settle down

lo	their work they havent ears nor eyes for anything
else

  it all seems like a horrible dream lorna murmured
it just seems that it cant he true the earth invaded

by beasts from space why lance it seems impossible
yes i know it does lorna girl but weve had posi-
tive proof that its terribly hideously real

  she shivered yet it seems that it jusl cant be true

  hey reached the rocky shelter sat down on flat rocks
shaded by overhanging willows scoutcd ihe sap-
phire sky and wild sweep of hills and broken country
with danger-sharpened eyes but peace seemed brooding
over the countryside not a sound came to the strained
ears of the watchers but the soft rush of water from
somewhere below them the twittering of birds in the
brush the keening of the cold wind

  slowly the hours crept away the sun gradually
shifted toward ihe western hills and long shadows began
marching across hillsides and rolling country suddenly
lorna gave a lillle cry pointed with trembling finger

  like an arrowy messenger of menaca a silvery shape
was flashing earthward from the blue heavens

  oh lance theyve found us the girl panted eyes
wide with dread theyre coming down-

  steady girl he caught her hand in firm fingers
squeezed it assuringly they cant see us nor the ship
they arent likely lo chance a landing in this rough
country    see theyre nosing down behind those
hills terrain must be fairly level over there look at
her fluttering down just like a failing leaf

  but thats only a mile or so away lance weve got
to warn dr sterns and the others

  wait till theyre down lorna those brutes have the
eyes of cats-maybe they can see for miles thats what
they are lorna cats cats made to the semblance of
human beings hellish things with ihe eyes and instincts
and cold cruelty of cats and the brains of super-beings
theyre down lance

  ill warn them lorna girl be right back we darent
leave the place unguarded for a moment

  he slipped through the low brush extending from the
rocks to the space ship studied the surroundings with in-
finite caution for long moments then slipped into the
silvery air cruiser dr sterns and professor mcpherson
were busy with a strange piece of apparatus that seemed
to be made largely of tubes disks and liny colored lights
apparently they were testing the compact humming box-
like machine which seemed to get its power from the green
coils

  the scientists jerked around as lance called softly
listened quietly as he told tersely of the coming of the
ship it would seem we are not menaced yet my boy
commented dr sterns thoughtfully it is unlikely that
they know of our presence here

  they are arriving in ever-increasing numbers sir
added the thick-bodied professor mcpherson they are
apparently centering their attack on our own country
this is probably explained by our vast extent of area
great stretches of level terrain and equable climate it
would seem sir that the appearance of this new space
ship is merely coincidental to the general invasion and
not necessarily immediately menacing to us

  we have established communication with the war
department norden dr sterns informed washington
is rushing guards here equipped with gas masks gas guns
and poison gas our own air bases have been warned
against a possible attack by our own aviators on us if
they move against us we will all lake refuge in this
ship

  lance nodded all right dm-tnr thpres	fnod

in this suitcase in case youre hungry he was taking
out a bottle of milk and a packet of sandwiches from one
of lornas grips as he spoke
the jovian horde



  you and miss lansing will find a well-stocked and
equipped kitchen off the laboratory dr sterns answer-
ed over his shoulder as he turned back to his work

  despite the anxiety gnawing at his vitals lance grin-
ned those men of the learned world hardly gave food
a thuught when absorbed in their pursuit of knowledge

   he found lorna still watching the distant line of hills
with thr intensity of a hunting hawk her face was pale
the deep shadows under her eyes violet with weariness
but she welcomed him with a brave little smile

  there isnt a sign of them-not yet she murmured
but ive got the feeling that eyes terrible eyes are
watching and peering and searching for us

  well they cant sneak upon us without our knowing
all about it he comforted with an assurance he was far
from feeling the war department is sending soldiers
ith gas weapons to guard us and we wont be attacked
by any of our own planes ive brought some of the
food you had in your suitcase dr sterns says theres
plenty more in a room off the laboratory

  the frugal meal was quickly eaten slowly the after-
noon dragged but it brought neither sight nor sound
of the brutes the red sun gradually inched behind the
western hills and in the east the full moon began push-
ing a golden edge above a forested ridge twilight claim-
ed the world faded imperceptibly into the sable realm of
night stars came out and the moon began its march
across the sky and to the weary watchers the shining
satellite seemed like a malignant demon searching for
them

  isnt it about time for those guards to come lance
the girl murmured after a long silence

t should think so lorna girl i suppose they are
-a- working toward us through the brush to avoid any
possibility of being seen by those devils anyway we
cant stay here much longer i know you must be cold
and hungry-

  he broke off with a smothered exclamation a dull
glare was thrusting back the darkness beyond the dis-
tant hills rapidly it widened and a sudden shift of the
wind brought to his straining ears the faint din of savage
yells

  its a fire lance lorna cried and caught his arm
with tense fingers and those howls lance those
fiends are burning some town

  must be lorna the devils we may as well go
down to the ship we cant stay here-look theres
another of those hellish ships and not showing even
the flicker of a light they must be able to see in the
dark

  the shadowy shape was drifting down like a wraith
like a great bird of the night it seemed to skim along
a dark height and swoop swiftly on its frantic prey one
moment it flashed menacingly in the bright moonlight
then was gone like a sigh of the dead

  come on dear lance whispered and slipped an
arm around the girls quivering shoulders weve got
to get out of here

   they slipped through the shadows to the ship flitted in-
side the space cruiser was dimly illuminated with the
bluish radiance flowing from the green coils and the
five scientists were grouped close to the gently humming
power-plant dr sterns turned his head as he heard
lance and lorna enter the ship

  my stars he exclaimed id forgotten all about you
people weve made some marvelous discoveries as-
tounding discoveries much is still a sealed book to us
but the knowledge of earth will be immeasurably enrich-
ed-

  if you live to tell it doctor lance cut in bluntly
another of those hellish ships just passed over us and
the fiends are burning a town beyond those southern
hills

  our new knowledge already bears fruit sir inform-
ed the portly professor mcpherson with stately dignity
these gentlemen indicating the three silent scientists
with a bow have analyzed the composition sheathing this
ship the formula has been wirelessed throughout the
world sir thousands of industrial plants are even now
producing this peculiar composition we shall protect
our airplanes and guns and automobiles with it sir it
absolutely neutralizes effects of those blasting rays sir

  oh professor thats wonderful lorna cried

  dr sterns beamed upon her also we have fathomed
something of the mighty forces mastered by the invaders
scientists miss lansing and now we have discovered
that they came from jupiter the difference in gravity is
what gives them so much power on earth it appears
that the power operating this marvelous space ship is de-
rived through gradual disintegration of atoms by means
of a cosmic ray the ray which is either generated
or captured from interstellar space by yonder apparatus
contains the mighty electrical energy of fully seven hun-
dred million volts they are using our moon as their
base

  lance flashed a quick glance to lorna and moved to
one of the series of narrow windows set into the side of
the ship his narrowed eyes studied starry heavens and
shadowed terrain with quick darting glances the red
glare of the flaming town lit up the sky luridly flung
weird shapes over hills and open country

  we have also determined that the law of gravity has
been neutralized by the marvelous science of the jovians
the deep voice of the portly professor mcpherson as
you know gentlemen the core of our earth is surmised
to be a ball of nickel-iron roughly four thousand miles
in diameter it is thought that tbis core is covered by
largely metallic iron of a thickness of about eight hundred
miles in turn surrounded by a mass of iron magnesium
and silicon having an approximate diameter of a thousand
miles

  that is generally understood professor one of the
other scientists nodded

  we also know that the earth gives off powerful rays
ten to fifty times the wavelength of the deep red ray
continued mcpherson sonorously these rays are in-
visible to us but they cool off the earth and prevents the
sun from establishing a boiling temperature on our sur-
face magnetic rays doctor sterns and i have deter-
mined that this ship is able to defy the law of the special
magnetism we call gravity because it is provided with a
generator of positive electrical force

  and ship and earth repel each other as the north
poles of two magnets repel a scientist commented

  exactly dr keppler the simple opposition of two
positive bodies the power generated by the apparatus in
this ship is a positive electromagnetic force and instead
of being attracted by the earth it is repelled by the earth
the positive magnetism flowing from the depths of the
earth meeting the positive magnetism flowing from this
ship overcomes the pull of gravity gentlemen

  then the drag of gravity is resisted by this positive
magnetic force to such an extent that this ship can be
made a lightcr-than-air cruiser of the heavens lance
queried

  is made lighter than the atmosphere sir professor
mcpherson corrected and driven through the air at in-
credible speed by the power released through gradual dis-
integration of atoms by a cosmic ray the same force


wonder stories quarterly

appears to be used in generation of this mighty low of
positive electromagnetism this shell is so splendidly
constructed that it is insulated against the absolute zero
of space our conclusions gentlemen are of course sub-
ject lo future corrections we have not had the time nor
opportunity-

  theres another jovian ship coming lorna cried
thrillingly floating right over ihese hills look look
theyre spraying the rock and trees with that terrible
lightning look

  the startled scientists darted to the nearer windows
trees and brush were bursting into lames lightning
darted over crags and hillsides like leaping twisting rivu-
lets of lurid fire the oaks spreading above the refuge
were blazing fiercely a few feet away a mass of rock
and earth crashed down from a crag with a force that
shook iho ground

  il would seem as though they may have picked up our
wireless messages professor mcpherson observed dr
sterns quietly or it may be they seek to destroy the
laboratory  they appear to be coming down gen-
tlemen

  they are nosing dovyn cried lance norden see   
they know were here theyre coming out of the ship

chapter vi

the green death

from the space ship glinting greyly through the shad-
ed moonlight huge jovians were pouring each
blocky figure carried a shield of shimmering metal and
a ray-projector and their eyes were phosphorescent as
a wolfs in the dusk

  lance lung himself to the pilots seat in front of the
green coils of the ship pulled down the power lever in-
stantly the blue electric waves pulsing from coil to coil
fanned out into a dazzling flare of glorious radiance a
deep hum came from the driving mechanism

  lance reached for the long starting-lever paused with a
little cry of wonder as he glanced sideways through a nar-
row window the fearsome jovians were dropping in
their tracks like ripe corn mowed down by an invisible
reaper dropping with hardly a convulsive shudder and
around them and their glinting ship wag spreading a thin
greenish mist which twisted and swirled weirdly in the
silvery moonshine

  poison gas cried dr sterns our army strikes the
invaders gentlemen strikes with weapons deadly as their
own see hero come our own gallant lads

  out of the gloom cast by crags thick bush and bunched
trees and into the moonlight moved many figures hideous
gas masks covered their heads and faces and each man
bore a fearsome weapon they approached the ship from
which the little group of earth people watched and their
leader beckoned for the sky cruiser to take to the air
lance moved an answering hand motioned for the sol-
diers to stand back

  dont touch a window or door dr sterns warned
sharply the outside air is death that greenish mist
is probably composed largely of hydrocyanic gas

  were taking off doctor lance called and pulled
on the long starting lever

  if he hadnt been watching the bristling side of a rug-
ged hill he might have thought the ship still hugged the
earth there was hardly a suggestion of the blinding
speed as the ship zoomed above the hill and raced toward
the star-studded zenith earth rushed away and the
lever had been moved barely an inch

lance sliuved il forward checked the flashing speed

turned the ship in a wide circle and began easing her
down until he could make out the shadowy forms of the
staring soldiers guided the great cruiser forward warily
and circled till he caught the cautious signaling of a flash-
light from a rocketing automobile then brought the
ship to earth with the lightness of a falling leaf

  the car had already slid to a halt three uniformed
men sprang from the machine and raced over to the ship
two others followed more slowly lancc left his seat
and joined the scientists as they opened a door and step-
ped out into the night he noted that the faces of the
officers were drawn and grim and that several soldiers
armed with gas guns were in the car

  dr sterns i believe clipped the foremost officer a
stout grey-haired man with keen eyes i am major ran-
dall sir  or the-

  glad youre here major dr sterns cut in with a
smile i have been expecting you we received the
wireless from albany some iwo hours ago it would
seem major that you and your men arrived here when
you were most needed

  wc have been holding the hills and brush around your
camp for an hour or more doctor the stocky built
officer explained crisply i knew we could not reach
those devils with gas as long as they held their ships
we had to wait for them to come out at that i have
never seen creatures die so fast

  they require more oxygen than the people of our
planet stated the great scientist dryly that is evi-
denced by their enormous chest development breathing
in more of the gas than would one of us in the same per-
iod of time they would naturally feel its fatal effects
more swiftly i had that fact before me when i asked
that gas be used against the invaders

  it is being used against the enemy at every opportun-
ity the officer nodded we are of course handicap-
ped by the fact that we must wait for them to come out of
their ships

  the composition used by the jovian scientists to foil
the ray has been analyzed by dr keppler and profes-
sors allandyne and grove major we are already pro-
ducing this peculiar metal and sheathing our guns and
planes with it thus protected from the ray we can at-
tack them with explosive gas shells we are going to de-
stroy the enemy major with their own devices and tho
products of our own science

  i hope youre right doctor exclaimed a tall man
in the uniform of a captain of artillery my god this
is terrible the devils are hunting down our people like
a terrier hunts rats killing and burning and enslaving
offering human sacrifices its doubly-distilled hell
he removed his cap brushed back the damp hair from his
forehead

  theres thousands of them muttered another officer
and every hour brings fresh hordes doctor weve got
to exterminate the vermin or well all be hiding in the
brush like scared rabbits

  well exterminate them captain-and drive their
satellite back to its normal orbit tliat ship over there
major weve got to convert it to our own use were go-
ing to equip those marvelous ships with our protected
guns and shells gentlemen and sweep tho foe from the
sky and earth

  i have ordered the ship taken to where it will be
cleared of gas by this wind major randall clipped

t ance turned and peered through the shifting moon-
light made out blurred outlines of automobiles
dragging a glinting shape over the ground and dim
shapes of soldiers the greenish gas still twisted and
the jovian horde	

spiraled over the spot where lie jovian brutes had died

  lance glanced up at the sky the ruddy glare shed
by the flaming town was fast widening and through the
distant bilious of smoke long flanges of fire jumped and
flickered like darting snakes from a world of flame a
shift of the howling wind brought a burst of fiendish
veiling by the exulting horde

  cod help those poor souls muttered an officer
  hellions are worse than the apaches ever dream-

ej of l-oing

  oh lance cant we do something lorna pleaded

     rant stay here and-and-

  c me on lance gritted and turned to the space
well swoop down on em an give em some of
rir own medicine they dont know weve captured this
ifcjp theyll think were a bunch of their-

  but they must know something sir exclaimed the
iutious professor mcpherson sharply why otherwise
  uld they have attempted to attack us they must have
known we possessed this ship it is not likely that they
located only the laboratory

  the more reason then why we should clean them
out before they come after us lance answered coolly
we can take a couple of gas guns aboard and clean
those beasts out before they realize whats happening
remember gentlemen were dealing with fiends not hu-
mans as we know humans

  you have that other ship now dr sterns lorna
added

  hastily the scientists and officers consulted together
then major randall turned to the expectant lance with
a ghost of a grim smile

  mr norden my orders are explicit i am detailed
here to guard this ship and these gentlemen but my
orders say nothing of this other ship captain riordan will
take your place as pilot of this craft i would recom-
mend sir that you provide yourself with a gas mask
you will find one in that car

  thanks major lance grinned and started for the
automobile one of the officers the tall artillery cap-
tain trotted by his side they reached the car and the
officer gave a few terse orders a grinning soldier stoop-
ed down came up with a couple of gas masks a white
rounded arm reached past lance slim fingers closed on
one of the grotesque head-pieces lance glanced side-
ways started as lorna lansing smiled into his eyes

  for the love of pete girl the engineer cried sharply
this isnt any place for you those brutes may be wait-
ing for us for all wc know lorna we cant have a
girl-

  just try and stop me she interrupted shortly and
proceeded to veil her loveliness with the hideous gas
mask

  a chuckling soldier helped her adjust the device prop-
erly the captain of artillery shrugged as lance contin-
ued to protest better save your breath norden tie
advised tersely time youre married as long as ive
been youll know its no use to argue with a woman when
shes determined to do something

  outside the ship lance stopped for a last word of in-
struction to the others ill ease the ship close to a
bunch of those brutes he explained and thatll give you
boys the chance to cut loose with your gas guns stand
right inside the doors two or three of you if they start
to use their iightning-tubes just sit tight were ruined
if they can get at us with those rays

  remember theres at least two of those ships down
there lorna added maybe more

  quickly the ship was inspected doors and windows
were closed and fastened the dozen soldiers movfid

quietly to their posts five minutes and the great sky
cruiser was slipping through the moonlit heavens like a
hunting owl ahead and below stretched the blazing
town almost veiled by wind-tossed clouds of swirling
smoke

  lance eased the ship lower until he could see the white
glare of arc lights in the streets shadowed from the leap-
ing flames by trees and buildings here and there red
and green signal lights flashed at intersections near the
far end of the doomed town resting on a small meadow
and apparently deserted three jovian ships glinted greyly
through the shifting firelight

  lance nosed the ship nearer the billowing smoke cir-
cled the town slowly many of the streets were choked
with twisted wreckage of automobiles and trucks blasted
to tangled debris by the lightning-tubes of the jovians
and here and there were shattered heaps of what had been
homes and buildings and tiny huddled shapes scattered
over the broken pavement men and women and children
struck down as they fled from the merciless invaders

  in a broad square brightly illuminated by a row of
blazing structures at the far end scores of the jovians
pranced and gamboled like grotesque blocky apes brand-
ished golden arms above shaggy mops of copper-colored
hair dozens of the huge brutes lined one side of the
square and tossed to each other shrieking writhing earth
men and women

  and as each white body hurtled through the air it was
the target for long knives flung by the savage jovians the
front of a building crashed into the square with a wide
burst of fire and rain of sparks and cinders a jovian
howled fiendishly raised a white form high above its head
and flung it into the blazing debris frenzied yells burst
from the grisly throng

  creeping judas gasped a staring soldier

  theres a group of prisoners under those trees nor-
den captain ferris grated weve got to save them

  lance glanced through the narrow window at his left
beneath a row of leafless trees in a short street leading
from the square were ranged scores of men and women
their hands were tied together and trussed up above
their heads to the overhanging limbs and scattered over
the firelit pavement were stark forms of adults and the
pitiful little bodies of slaughtered children

a burst of wild yelling jerked the eyes of lance and
his companions back to the square some of the
coppcr-haircd creatures had sighted the ship they flung
yellowish arms high bounded around like hellish apes
beckoned the watchers to come down and join them

  lance nordens mouth set grimly and into his grey
eyes crept cold lights of killing rage those devils think
were their kind his steady voice had a curiously soft
deadly ring we cant save the poor souls theyre play-
ing with but we can send those devils to hell all set
everybody im going down

  the ship drifted down like a shadow down until the
tense watchers could see the phosphorescent eyes of the
golden brutes captain ferris barked an order three
soldiers shot open the nearer doors of the ship the men
with the gas guns rippled into deadly action too late
the watching jovians saw and understood

  for as they clutched frenziedly at the death tubes in
their girdles the greenish gas gripped them like rot-
ten fruit plucked by the blasts of october they dropped
where they stood some just beyond the first gush of the
greenish death flicked at their tubes but lance tilted the
ship in time to escape the blasting rays

  and the gas wrapped them in folds of death hovered
over them like a pall spewed from hells mocking depths


wonder stories quarterly

  from the darkling depths of the distant valley lurid
lightning flashed and flickered intermittently through the
gray dawn it stabbed the cloud-hung heavens lashed out
across the dim terrain flung back the crowding shadows

  lance norden glanced from the awesome spectacle to
the group of silent men in the space ship theyre
down there thousands of them waiting for the sun and
guarding their camp with those hellish rays

  dr sterns lowered his powerful binoculars nodded
gravely they have seized those limestone quarries
burrowed into the earth like rodents mindful of their
own nights of terrible cold they have not yet become ac-
customed to our own mild temperatures the wide area
covered by those electric rays gentlemen would indicate
the jovians hold that valley with a strong force

  three days had passed since lance norden and his
companions had destroyed the jovians with poison gas
in the flaming town three days of dread and lightning-
barbed death for the reeling earth while the fiends raged
like exulting devils spewed from hells foulest abyss
days of horror and torture and slaughter with the stricken
earth people feverishlyt preparing for the last stand
against the invaders

   lance picked up his field glasses looked long and stead-
ily at the lightning-guarded valley he saw blurred shapes
many shimmering space ships a few hundred yards from
the camp lay the tangled wreckage of a locomotive and
long train of steel passenger cars and in the far distance
a reddish glow told of another city blasted by the blocky
devils

  lance laid down the glasses peered through the nar-
row windows of the ship in the cold light of the gray
dawn he could sec space cruisers which had been cap-
tured from the invaders and a swarm of glinting air-
planes all were sheathed with the mysterious metal the
jovians had brought to earth-the strange substance which
defied the ray projectors guns and shells were coated
with the composition and the aviators wore garments
fashioned from the metal each man had a gas mask

  the next few hours will tell whether the earth people
are to hold their birthright or are destined to become
cringing slaves of those creatures dr sterns said softly
we have done all man can do if they can destroy this
metal gentlemen tapping the ships silvery wall with
long sensitive fingers we are lost but  am hopeful-

i	am very hopeful-our science will prevail

  this glass doctor an officer indicated one of the
narrow windows of the space ship

  that substance is not glass captain lester but a
practically unbreakable crystal it is totally impervious
to the ray

  the tides were higher last night doctor another of-
ficer muttered even if we can wipe out those devils
down there how are we going to drive the moon back
the moon was at perigee last night the great scientist
explained it is unlikely it will be forced closer from
its normal orbit their scientists dare not venture it too
close you heard their threats last night gentlemen their
warnings that further resistance by us would mean annihil-
ation their threat to hunt down and slay by lingering
torture all earth creatures failing to voluntarily surrender
they know wc have killed many of their kind and destroy-
ed some of their ships there is a flaw in their armor gen-
tlemen they are not invincible

  there is movement down in that hel -hole cried
lance peering through his glasses theyre coming out
of their burrows hordes of them

  we must attack before they scatter barked a tall
grey-haired man with the silver eagles of a colonel on

his uniform signal the charge captain lester   
all right lieutenant

t ieutenant lance norden turned to the controls
-j started the great ship smiled a bit grimly as lorna
pushed into the seat beside his the girl had insisted on
remaining with the ship to the last lance thrilled with
the pressure of her shoulder against his

  then they were racing through the cloud-hung heavens
straight for the gray valley and the jovian horde they
rocketed through the flickering lightning lance glanced
at the newly-installed tachometer they were shooting
through the air at a speed of four hundred miles an hour

  livid lightning was sheeting the crystal windows of the
space ship darting and twisting over and around the veri-
table cloud of accompanying cruisers and planes and
answering bursts of yellowish flame were lashing out from
the ships and planes manned by the earthmcn the guns
protected by the strange silvery metal were pumping gas
shells into the ships and camp of the jovians

  lance dived his ship as a cruiser hurtled toward him
he could see shells plowing through the silvery hull of
the enemy as the men manning the guns a few feet from
him went into action the jovian ship fluttered down
clouds of the greenish poison gas pouring from its shat-
tered sides another cruiser rocketed upward from the
ground struck and crumpled a plane before it began to
drift downward far below him lance could see blocky
golden shapes sinking down as the deadly gas clutched
and throttled them

  theyre trying to ram us dr sterns cried thats
how they light smash in the side of a ship with those
heavy prows and burn everything to a crisp with those
rays there goes another plane theyre too fast for
our planes gentlemen

  captain lester signal our planes to scatter out and
keep away from those damned ships colonel tracy
rasped theyre smaller and can turn faster tell em
to keep away and use their guns

  the signal was flashed another plane went down with
a flare of flame jovian ships were fluttering down like
horrible birds from a hideous world with clouds of the
greenish gas enveloping them

  lance avoided a rocketing ship by a steep bank saw
its shimmering side literally split open as shells ripped
into it he joined in the yell of triumph from the gun-
ners as they watched the strange craft flutter down and
past them

  it works gentlemen the metal works dr sterns cried
thrillingly those devils cant destroy it with those
rays see theyre losing heart theyre trying to get
away

  lance glanced through the front window two of the
huge jovian ships were rocketing through the clouds one
was cimght by a burst of shellfire from a plane hiding
above a cloud it pitched sharply began floating ground-
ward the other was already a shimmering speck in the
glowing radiance of the rising sun

  lance nosed lower to the wide-flung camp of the in-
vaders caught a group of the running brutes with a
burst of forked lightning as he discharged one of the elec-
tric tubes in the ship then the camp was blotted out by
the swirling pall of greenish death

  from the corner of an eye lanee glimpsed two enemy
ships hurtling down like comets he zoomed into the sky
grinned wolfishly as he saw one of the attacking cruisers
crumple under the rain of shells poured into it by his gun-
ners the ulhei came so close that for a moment a craoh
seemed certain then lance felt the slithering shape rub
past he pulled his ship around in a steep bank drove his
the jovian horde



erow into the others shredding side blasted the frenzied
rates inside with a quick play of the great lightning-
tube

  lance chortled savage glee as the blocky green-eyed
coppery-haired creatures sagged down like grotesque
imiees toppled by a mighty wind he felt as a man feels
when he stamps loathsome vermin into the gray dust
but lorna veiled her eyes with shaking hands and long
ibuddrrs rocked her body wild yells of delight broke
fron ihe watching soldiers as the jovian ship lurched
quo-rlv and slid sideways

  another of the lightning-spitting shapes swept past to
be caught and blasted to shreds by vengeful shellfire an-
ether ship floated slowly earthward with the greenish
fumes of death swirling around it

  lance pulled the space ship around in a wide circle
loomed above the sun-tipped clouds scouted the blue
heavens with dangcr-keened eyes three planes swooped
c a a jovian cruiser as it shot through a cloud-bank poured
i shells into its shredding hull

  an earth-manned ship was blasting two fleeing jovians
to bit with merciless gunfire and here and there silvery
-hapes were rocketing toward the azure zenith fleeing from
earth like weird birds chased by hellish hunters one

	is caught by a stream of shells from a pursuing ship
i rolled and pitched drunkeuly in the roaring wind flut-
tered down in a greenish gas mist

  we win gentlemen we win dr sterns exulted
and slapped his thigh resoundingly they are racing
for their lairs with the fear of death riding them

  but theyll be back with fresh hordes an officer
groaned if only we could have exterminated them

  come back cried dr sterns with the dread of
death gnawing their vitals never captain not unless
they discover what were using against them and can foil
it for all their strange power they are abysmally primi-
tive savages who have stumbled upon some of natures
mighty secrets when those who escape tell their fellows
of the terrible mist loosed against them-the green mist
of death-

  oh doctor lorna exclaimed impulsively you say
they have their base on the moon if we only could send
that dreadful gas to the moon in one of their own ships

  eh my stars the great scientist was regarding
the girls flushed face as though she was the daughter of
another world send the gas to the brutes why of
course we can fill one of their ships with gas bombs
and shells timed to explode when a door or window is
opened place a robot at the controls and send it to
the satellite his deep-set gray eyes glowed with tri-
umph

  bui will that drive the moon back to its normal orbit
doctor lance queried if those devils can keep on
dragging the ocean over our coasts-

  if it doesnt my boy well find other means dr
sterns assured the jovian scientists are using some
electromagnetic force to attract the satellite to the earth
with what we have already learned of their control of
magnetism coupled with the immensely greater density
size and magnetic power of our planet i have no doubt
but what we shall find means of forcing the moon back
to its proper orbit

  lance nodded cased the ship down through the scud-
ding clouds dense clouds of the greenish gas wrapped
ihe camp of the jovians in ihe silent mantle of death
now and then the strong wind whirled aside the horrible
fog for a brief instant disclosing myriads of shimmering
space ships on the valley floor

  we must strike at the oilier camps of those fiends be-
fore they learn of what has happened here and escape
colonel tracy clipped they are doubtless up to their
devils work elsewhere

  signals flashed from the ship the swarm of space ships
and planes leveled off raced for the spreading glare of a
burning city lance gave a sudden exclamation pointed
far away silvery shapes were flashing through the sunlit
heavens speeding from the earth as though chased by a
pestilence

  dr sterns watched the rocketing ships for a long mo-
ment they have been warned gentlemen probably
by radio from the ships escaping our attack it will not be
long now gentlemen before our planet will lie delivered
of those brutes and they will never return

  too bad we couldnt have wiped them all out lance
grumbled

  we can still strike them cricd the scientist well
send them a dozen of their own ships laden with the death
gas its bound lo kill some of ihem it is very prob-
able the scientists will lose no time in removing their base
from such a dangerous neighbor as the earth but we
must send the dread of hideous death to them we owe
them that much gentlemen for all the death and de-
struction they brought to us

   

  the sunsets glory laved the majestic adirondacks in
crimson and gold in dr sterns underground labora-
tory a group of grave-faced scientists and military men
clustered near the radio lance norden caught one of
lornas soft hands in his drew her closer

  good news it boomed out triumphantly from the

  the oppressed and the oppressors
editor wonder stories quarterly

  i would like to comment upon the ex-
cellent winter  quarterly

  mr pratts onslaught from rigel
is a wonderful yarn worthy of praise
it shows cleverly how those astound-
ing ingenious creatures from outer
space who were able to make use of the
winged creatures and to outwit the
schemes of their opponents were at last
defeated by the earthmen had the
men from rigel been able to gain the
safety of space without such tremen-
dous losses they would undoubtedly
have contrived devices so as to render
the artificial lightning of the earthmen
useless

  but if the yellow beam in the las-
san headquarters was so accurate while
sherman was prisoner why was it not
so at the time of the rescue of marta
lama

  next the moon destroyers was
it not quite unsafe to let boulders from
the moon drift about loosely in space

  the revolt of the star men was
a story of the first class raymond
gallun is a fact author

  now the metal moon brings out
wonderfully the clash between the op-
pressed and the oppressors an idea
worthy of the manner in which it was
written excellent spacewreckcd on
venus in the mighty dramatic style
of jones smacks of law and order and
was magically fascinating

  and the martian this is a story
well felt by most readers it is origin-
al plain and mighty compliments to
messrs glasser and hilliard

  this being the first time i have ever
written mr editor i do not know
whether to restrain my hand in giving
out praise but i can quite truthfully
say that though the previous issues
of wonder stories quarterly were
wonderful the winter  was super-
wonderful

            virgil c a parnoff
            stratford conn

  mr parnoff had better write us
again and ease out curiosity as to the
meaning of some of his terms tell us
what does a fact author mean and
what is super-wonderful

  as wc understood it in the moon
destroyers there would have been no
boulders floating about in space they
would have been all dissolved into cos-
mic dust to fill the great vacuum of
space-editor

between worlds

by garret smith

 rarely does an interplanetary story
 cover such a wide field of romance
 mystery and thrilling adventures as
  found in this masterpiece of sci-
 ence fiction starting on mysterious
 venus shut away from the world by
 its layers of clouds we find a tre-
 mendous drama of exploration of
 unknown lands great conflicts of
 alien raccs social revolutions and
 finally a breath-taking trip to the
 earth where our venusians take

 art in the making of earth history
 his story is as different from the
 average science fiction yarn as
 science fiction is different from a
 cowboy story it is written so that
 the interest never lags for a mo-
 ment and the reader is carried on
 wave after wave of excitement from
 the beginning to the end

  interested that i like all of the authors
  efforts

    i enjoyed the onslaught from rijj-
 e immensely but i want to ask about
 one thing i do not understand just
 what change took place as a result of
 the action of the comet it seems to me
 that if a body were to undergo a great
 change the result would bo different
 in the illustration on pape  paul
 has the earth beings pictured very
 closely but their muscles seem to be
 circular instead of the long fibers which
 run from the elbow to the shoulder

   the shoulder and back muscles also
 seem more like long plates and the
 knee and ankle joints seem very me-
 chanical they seem more like robots
 than mechanized humans

    but nevertheless i enjoyed the story
 immensely lets have more from the
 pen of fletcher pratt

   the moon destroyers by ruch was
 also a good yarn but i cannot figure
 out how if the san francisco was de-
 stroyed there were three ships left to
 destroy the moon unless the silver
 death was used and as i understood
 the story supplies were transferred to
 the remaining ships ganymede and
 los angeles

    the revolt of the star men by gal-
 lun was new and original in its scope
 but what i cannot understand is how
 the space men would have such enor-
 mously developed muscles if they wore
 not developed on some planet with an
 enormous gravitational force

   smith and starzl surely possess
 imagination plus to conceive of an arti-
 ficial satellite containing a pleasure
 city team these two again in the fu-
 ture

             f m king

             shenandoah iowa

   we cannot resist giving mr king
 the thrill of seeing his letter in print
 his appeal was too eloquent in the
 onslaught from rigel paul was try-
 ing to picture the earthlings as
 mechanized men yet to show in some
 way how they could walk about and
 function his task was a difficult one
 and it is natural that there should have
 been some questioning as to the details

 editor wonder stories quarterly
 the winter  quarterly really is
 an all interplanetary issue-and  like
 it the onslaught from rigel and
 the martian were the least like inter-
 planetary tales but strangely i liked
 them the most

   if all the  feature yarns in the
 quarterly are going to be like mr
 pratts well    the only thing i
 couldnt understand in it was how the
 comet-or whatever did it- devised
 nuts screws bolts and other things
 for the men it changed into mechanical
 creatures why should it do anything
 but make the bodies just as they were
 into metal comets cant think not
 being a crank this mistake didnt spoil
 the story for me at all but i just
 mentioned it to see if the author had
 any explanation

   raymond gallun seems stuck on the
 idea of creatures being able to live
 without oxygen  and in a vacuum  
 and in zero temperatures well dont
 think im finding fault i like such
 stories of his his latest wasnt quite
 as good as the space dwellers but
 still

 cellent art decorations

 it is sometimes hard to explain the
 vagaries of comets and what they will
 do to us poor human beings mr pratt
 has taken refuge in paris from the
 numerous inquiries concerning his
 story and we believe he will not re-
 turn until its over over there how-
 ever he is using his time to good ad-
 vantage for us by translating from
 the french the marvelous novel the
 death of iron this will be publish-
 ed in forthcoming issues of wonder
 stories-editor

they would have thumbs
editor wonder stories quarterly

   the last time i wrote to you was in
 the summer  edition again you
 receive a letter from me concerning the
 vandals of the void couldnt we
 have a sequel

   it seems in tho summer  issue
 you went in for trick endings this
 was shown by the man from mars
 the great invasion was a laugh an-
 other trick ending

   ask mr c a smith if we couldnt
 have further adventures of the alcy-
 one

   in the fall  issue i disliked the
 cosmic cloud i couldnt even get in-
 to it the asteroid of death was
 immense i mean grand

   i would like to mention several of my
 bright ideas concerning the manbcast
 of toree couldnt ralph t jones
 give a sort of sequel to that by applying
 the mendelian law mr jones went to
 unnecessary pains to tell that tomman
 impregnated many females in his trav-
 els on that planet tomman also es-
 caped probably impregnating several
 females during his freedom mr jones
 also stated that the reason man did not
 become tho dominant animal on that
 planet was because of the lack of
 thumbs well tommans descendents

 at least one of every four would have
 thumbs sawe i dont necessarily
 want man to wipe out the imbos but
 couldnt they possibly set up a civiliza-
 tion beside that of the imbos ask
 mr jones to write a sequel will you 

   in the struggle for pallas the
 sequel to vandals of the void how
 did these cohorts of the damned
 manage to reproduce so fast it says
 a half-dozen eggs were found less
 than a year later there are god knows
 how many rather irregular wasnt
 it

   outside of the cosmic cloud i
 thought the rest of the issue swell

   i hadnt seen any stories by fletcher
 pratt for a long time  certainly was
 glad to sec the onslaught from rigel
 in spite of his using the old theme of
 earths invasion by another and greater
 system planet or what have you and of
 terras gallant fight to repel them i
 liked the story because it contained a
 great many new ideas such as man be-
 ing changed to metal by some unknown
 process

   the revolt of the starmen a new
 idea entirely at least to me i have
 read several things about life existing
 in space but this is the first time i
 have read a story of which this was the
 theme

   the martian was swell i cer-
 tainly would have liked to seen the
 little feller get back to mars safely
 hilliard wrote such an excellent story
 with the idea furnished by glasser that
 my heart was wrung dry of sympathy
 i liked the majority of the plot contest
 stories but the winter issue has been
 the best for almost a year now since
 the winter 

   why do you a note of complaint go
 in for interplanetary stories entirely
 i would like to see other stories in here

 sional traveling and interplanetary

 arise on toree wc shall transmit this
 to mr jones we believe that the gen-
 eration that will arise as the result of
 our terrestrials visit to toree will
 have not only thumbs but also the
 courage and will of their terrestrial
 forbear that should certainly pro-
 vide some interesting complications-

 several years ago at that time
 the stories were pretty soundly scien-

 writers part was quickly and intelli-
 gently criticized in your columns
 being an engineer i admired the tech-
 nical correctness of most of your stuff
 especially stories dealing with pioneer
 ventures into space you spoke the
 language of reality then

  the cigar with the
  forbidden taste

 the late vice-president marshall was right i
 what this country needs is a good nickel cigar
 and if you once smoke our vinos mkscado you
 will never srnoke an other cigar not only the
 best of leaf tobacco is used in the making of our
 vinos but they are dipped in sweet wine-which
 imparts to them a subtle and quite distinct taste
 and flavor no-you wont get intoxicated smok-
 ing our vinos but they will make you feel good
 wc guarantee that and
 thats not all vinos are
 twisted giving the cigar
 a quaint elegant look
 vinos are manufactured
 in one shape only-
 inches twisted wine dip-
 ped and cellophane wrap-

wonder stories quarterly

the reader speaks

continued from page 

strosities most of them have far ex-
ceeded the bounds of scientific explana-
tion and some have exceeded the bounds
of reason i cite the onslaught from
rigel in which living humans evolve
into jointed metal machines requiring

oil	and an electric charge to run but
retaining their own mentality

  the most abused instrument in the
realm of science fiction is the ray
the introduction of these all-powerful
rays into a stop kills the interest im-
mediately for it excludes the possibil-
ity of any really interesting situations
whether it be the sleep producing
ray the terrible disintegrating ray
the magnetic ray tho paralyzing
ray these purely imaginary forces pre-
sent easy solutions to any and every
problem and the resulting galaxy of
monstrous events would put to shame a
madmans dream

  i notice that few technical points are
discussed any more in the readers col-
umn it is very uninteresting to read
some laymans list of stories he liked
or did not like please mr editor give
us something to stand on there is a
fine but definite line beyond which
science fiction cannot go without becom-
ing fairy tales this rapid evolution
of soundly based science stories into
weird confused extravagant night-
mares makes me feel as though i were
losing a friend

  the martian by glasser and hilli-
ard is one of the finest and most clever-
ly presented short stories i have ever
read

          george w race
albany new york
we confess that we have been carry-
ing on a campaign against these very
things that mr race so soundly com-
plains of the difficulty has been that
a new element entered the field of sci-
ence fiction magazines of wild west
fiction in which science was of little or
no consequence this threw many good
writers olt their balance and destroyed
in some their ability to create a good
story without the use of rays and rays
and rays

  we still hope to convince authors that
the use of a ray does not take the
place of a scientific idea and while
this work is being carried on we ask
mr race to be patient science fiction
is going through a state of evolution
we know it will emerge strengthened
